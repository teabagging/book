Little does Rick know that his quest for the young southern belle would involve much more peril than he would ever, in his wildest dreams, have bargained for. The woman s father is convinced that serious trouble has befallen his daughter. At first Rick isn t so sure that is actually the case, but when she is found murdered in New Orleans, his skepticism vanishes as quickly as his assignment changes from finding her to finding her killer. During his search for the person responsible, Rick uncovers a unique heroin running operation that uses commercial shrimp trawlers to move the contraband along the intercoastal waterway, from Pont Rouge, across southeast Louisiana, to the north short of Lake Pontchartrain for distribution. Rick s investigative legwork takes him through the darker sides of the Crescent City and into the French Quarter nightlife, and there is no shortage of steamy sexual situations, and intense physical encounters accompanied by murder and mayhem. After some unexpected twists, the case comes to a fiery conclusion in a blazing conflagration on the banks of the Mississippi River.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ioDwSVO9c-QC&dq=No+One+Left+To+Burn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"X-Men: Legionquest (X-Men: The Age of Apocalypse Gold Deluxe Edition) (Prelude)","description":"With more than 30,000 updated prices and over 650 photos and illustrations, \\"Comics Values Annual\\" provides an indispensable reference for dealers and collectors of all types of comics.

The Japanese word yokai generally refers to a range of supernatural beings such as ghosts, demons, monsters, shapeshifters, tricksters, and other strange kinds of creatures. While their status is commonly described as supernatural, they exist or appear in the natural, human world. Today, yokai are wildly popular in Japan. They are prevalent across contemporary entertainment genres such as manga (\\"comics\\") and anime (\\"animation\\") series, horror movies, and video games, and they also manifest as the subject of related material culture objects like game cards, character t-shirts, cuddly plushies, and collectable gashapon capsule toys. This diverse array of yokai imagery and materiality is deeply rooted in the past. Yokai images and their stories are enduring, and there is no question that what we see in hot commodities today is closely aligned with traditional Japanese folklore. Yokai: Ghosts & Demons of Japan explores yokai and their popularity in Japan through multiple perspectives of yokai: what they are, their associated tales, how people engaged with or interpreted yokai in different contexts, and why they remain so popular in Japan. The contributors to this book are among eminent scholars, creators, and promoters of various aspects of yokai culture. The interdisciplinary nature of this book's presentation vibrantly illustrates yokai from different angles, allowing for a broad view of their cultural scope in Japan. In addition, the contributors delve into popular culture themes, connecting traditional folklore, folk art, and imagery to trends in Japan as well as in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=e9c6xwEACAAJ&dq=Japanese+Ghosts+and+Demons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diamond Sutra: Transforming the Way We Perceive the World","description":"In this brilliant new translation and commentary on The Diamond Sutra--one of the sublime wisdom teachings of Mahayana Buddhism--Mu Soeng integrates this ancient wisdom teaching with current scientific and psychological thought.

With great perception, the Chronicler shows how the records of Israel reveal the pattern of God's hand in the events of his nation's history and how, within that pattern, the Lord's constant mercy, love and faithfulness shine through. In this readable and thoughtful commentary, Michael Wilcock explores how once that purpose is grasped, the message of 1 & 2 Chronicles comes alive. The Chronicler's sermon is a final and momentous look back over the entire Old Testament, and the countless persons named are part of one people of the living God. With perceptive insight, Wilcock guides us through the two halves of the Chronicles, paralleling them the vibrancy, contrast and drama of the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, and showing how the Chronicles make vivid to us the truths by which the Lord's people in every generation are to live. Part of the loved and trusted The Bible Speaks Today series of commentaries, The Message of 1 & 2 Chronicles offers an accessible and thorough exposition of the Biblical text as well as pastoral exploration of the lessons it can teach Christians today.

What caused this change? Modern Political Science--the first authoritative history of Anglophone political science--argues that the field's transformation shouldn't be mistaken for a case of simple progress and increasing scientific precision. On the contrary, the book shows that political science is deeply historically contingent, driven both by its own inherited ideas and by the wider history in which it has developed. Focusing on the United States and the United Kingdom, and the exchanges between them, Modern Political Science contains contributions from leading political scientists, political theorists, and intellectual historians from both sides of the Atlantic. Together they provide a compelling account of the development of political science, its relation to other disciplines, the problems it currently faces, and possible solutions to these problems. Building on a growing interest in the history of political science, Modern Political Science is necessary reading for anyone who wants to understand how political science got to be what it is today--or what it might look like tomorrow.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=isrSK0TBdvEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Everything French Verb Book: A Handy Reference For Mastering Verb Conjugation (Everything (Language & Writing))","description":"Verb recognition and conjugation is one of the most difficult aspects of learning any language - especially French.

Some Greek historians: Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle; and modern writers: William Stace, Alfred Benn, James Breasted, etc. testify to Greeks' studentship in Egypt. Citing Egyptian texts, the author reveals that the doctrines of Greek philosophers have their prototypes in earlier Egyptian philosophy. However, in their determination to maintain racial and intellectual superiority over Africans, Western historians, since the 18th century, subverted history by attributing the origin of philosophy to the Greeks.

This book contains What You Need to Know About: The Making of the Movie--at first, it sounded like it might just be a quirky art film; a film about Jesus' passion using only the dead languages of Aramaic and Latin without subtitles. But what started out as news of the weird has turned into a powerful and popular film that has already become a major milestone in cinematic history. The Message of the Movie--although liberals have lambasted The Passion and allege that its screening will result in anti-Jewish sentiment, a surprisingly wide assortment of pastors and priests have cheered it.

The Meaning of the Movie--many have hailed it as \\"the greatest evangelistic tool in 2000 years.\\" They predict that it will revolutionize religious life in America and impact greatly on many other parts of the world.

This book is not a genealogical record, although genealogy is included. The opening chapter portrays the illustrious life of the enigmatic patriarch, George Burdine Nalley. An active minister in the Wesleyan church for eleven years, he fell from grace because of his involvement with another woman, and he had the audacity to bring the other woman to live in the house with his wife, Emma Burns, and their children. The next twelve chapters depict the lives of the twelve children nine boys and three girls. Since all of them are deceased, their stories were written by their children as they remember their parents and their own childhoods. These stories give a picture of life in a less sophisticated time in the rural south when people lived off the land and had none of the modern conveniences that we enjoy today. Nalley, A Southern Family Story chronicles 170 years in the life of a family. In one chapter, the dates of births, marriages and deaths of this line of the family are interwoven into national and world events. Another chapter gives statistical information on the numerous family members, including a chronological list of the births, marriages and deaths of the twelve children and ninety-four grandchildren. Newspaper clippings are included of the obituaries of the twelve children and their spouses as well as accounts of the tragic deaths which have occurred. Information on places and events pertinent to the family is recorded. The family reunion which began the year after George Burdine s untimely death in 1914 and continues to this day. Camp meeting, where families lived for two weeks under conditions even more primitive than at home, while they worshipped their God, got caught up on family news, and renewed acquaintance with old friends. Fairview Methodist Church where many baptisms, weddings and funerals of the Nalley clan took place and where many of them are buried. Central Wesleyan College, which the Rev. G. B. Nalley was instrumental in founding. This is a book that you can sit down and read, but it is more than that. It is a reference book that you can refer to over and over again when you are discussing family, trying to remember who was older, who married first, when someone died, and the endless number of other facts and fallacies that we Nalleys talk and argue about when we get together. In addition, this book is a social history of the way life was lived  in those days  as Daddy used to say. When I think of how much change has occurred in the last one hundred years, I am grateful that we have this written record of how our forefathers and foremothers actually lived. Here it is, as complete as I can make it the history of the George Burdine and Emma Burns Nalley family. I hope you enjoy reading it and referring to it as much as I have enjoyed putting it together. If you have a drop of Nalley blood flowing through your veins, you will want to own a copy of this book for your library.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xNhLPbQw688C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wrestling with Grace: A Spirituality for the Rough Edges of Daily Life","description":"Persuades readers to follow their immediate reactive emotions of anger, frustration, and sadness with a \\"second breath\\" prayer, teaching how to overcome such obstacles as anger directed toward others by loving enemies, forgiving others, acting with justice, and embracing peace.

In this much-needed wake-up call to corporate America, Rayman shows why companies must go beyond the bottom line to survive and thrive. Drawing on her experience as a leading advocate for a more responsive workplace, she demonstrates how companies can organize for profit, productivity, and the desire of workers for a more rewarding quality of life. In a win-win agenda for changing outmoded organizations, she demonstrates convincingly that all successful transformations create workplaces that respect the need for dignity: security, self-respect, and the time and freedom to care for family and community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SWMYDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living & Praying in Jesus' Name","description":"Log Home Living is the oldest, largest and most widely distributed and read publication reaching log home enthusiasts.

Robert Altman served a long apprenticeship in movie-making before his great breakthrough, the Korean War comedy M*A*S*H (1969). It became a huge hit and won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, but also established Altman's inimitable use of sound and image, and his gift for handling a repertory company of actors. The 1970s then became Altman's decade, with a string of masterpieces: McCabe and Mrs Miller, The Long Goodbye,Thieves Like Us, Nashville . . . In the 1980s Altman struggled to fund his work, but he was restored to prominence in 1992 with The Player, an acerbic take on Hollywood. Short Cuts, an inspired adaptation of Raymond Carver, and the Oscar-winning Gosford Park, underscored his comeback. Now he recalls the highs and lows of his career trajectory to David Thompson in this definitive interview book, part of Faber's widely acclaimed Directors on Directors series. 'Hearing in his own words in Altman on Altman just how much of his films occur spontaneously, as a result of last-minute decisions on set, is fascinating . . . For film lovers, this is just about indispensable.'

At three in the morning the police were called, but they just said that boys were running away from the best of homes nowadays and that they'd list David as a runaway. No, there would be no official search for the youngster. Aghast, the Hilligiests, in the months that followed, hired their own detective, put up posters, even sought the aid of clairvoyants. But David never did come home again because, along with at least twenty-six other Houston boys, he had been murdered and buried by the homosexual owner of a candy factory, the mass murderer of the century, Dean Corll, according to his two teenage confessed accomplices, Elmer Wayne Henley, Jr., and David Brooks. Many of the young boys had not even been reported as missing, and the fact that they were dead would probably never have come to light had not one of the murderers confessed. For in Houston, where in a typical year the total number of murders is twice that of London despite the fact that London is six times as large and far more densely populated, missing persons and violence are likely to be considered commonplace. In the months before the trial of Henley and Brooks, Jack Olsen interviewed and probed for answers about the criminals, the victims and the city itself, which remained for the most part silent, angry and defensive. The result is a classic of true crime reportage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MUnFzqeHd_0C&dq=The+Candy+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Thirty years in hell\\"; or, \\"From darkness to light","description":"\\"\\"Thirty Years In Hell\\" Or, \\"From Darkness to Light\\"\\" by Bernard Fresenborg.

Some see CCM performers as ministers or musical missionaries, while others define them as entertainers or artists. This popular musical movement clearly evokes a variety of responses concerning the relationship between Christ and culture. The resulting tensions have splintered the genre and given rise to misunderstanding, conflict, and an obsessive focus on self-examination. As Christian stars Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, DC Talk, and Sixpence None the Richer climb the mainstream charts, Jay Howard and John Streck talk about CCM as an important movement and show how this musical genre relates to a larger popular culture. They map the world of CCM by bringing together the perspectives of the people who perform, study, market, and listen to this music. By examining CCM lyrics, interviews, performances, web sites, and chat rooms, Howard and Streck uncover the religious and aesthetic tensions within the CCM community. Ultimately, the conflict centered around Christian music reflects the modern religious community's understanding of evangelicalism and the community's complex relationship with American popular culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pkooEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turning Yourself Around: Self-Help Strategies for Troubled Teens","description":"Drawing on real-life examples of three teenagers in recovery, this book presents a program designed to accompany a Twelve-Step program, with self quizzes and hands-on exercises.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=EZuaAAAACAAJ&dq=Turning+Yourself+Around:+Self-Help+Strategies+for+Troubled+Teens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NIV Compact Thinline Bible (New International Version)","description":"The NIV Thinline Bible, Compact captures the depth and beauty of the Bible, in a take-anywhere size.

He has come to Livorno to sing on the summer stage with Ada Giachetti, a famous and beautiful soprano. Ada's mother offers him a spare room, and before Ada herself has a chance to meet the unknown tenor, her younger sister, Rina, arrives home from the market and falls fatefully in love. With the help of singing lessons from Ada, Caruso wins the leading role in Puccini's new opera La Boh me. Although Caruso loves Rina, it is Ada he adores, and they soon become lovers. Heartbroken, Rina becomes an opera singer too, hoping to take her sister's place. For decades, the two sisters are locked in a struggle to be the star on Caruso's stage and in his bed, while Caruso's voice grows more and more unimaginably beautiful. But as his relations with the two sisters break down in scandal and tragedy, the now world-famous Caruso builds a new life for himself as the star of the Metropolitan Opera in New York. There, far from the drama and passion of Caruso's Tuscan life, a shy young American woman will win his heart and, taking the greatest leap of faith of all, supplant Ada and Rina as his one true love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=csL78WNZbA0C&dq=Tenor+of+Love:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Praying for Those We Love as They Serve Our Country","description":"A collection of prayers, devotions, and Biblical passages for friends and family of those serving in the United States military.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=q8gdF0ml4IoC&dq=Praying+for+Those+We+Love+as+They+Serve+Our+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The positive principle today : how to renew and sustain the power of positive thinking","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OXBeuAAACAAJ&dq=The+positive+principle+today+:+how+to+renew+and+sustain+the+power+of+positive+thinking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jews of Lithuania: A History of a Remarkable Community 1316-1945","description":"The history of Lithuanian Jewry was accompanied throughout by manifestations of antisemitism.

Where would America be without George Washington, or Daniel Boone, or Sojourner Truth, or Babe Ruth? Where would we be without so many characters who are less well remembered today? Historians and biographers regularly come across stories of little-known or forgotten heroes, and this book provides a chance to rescue some of the best of them. In Forgotten Heroes, thirty-five of the country's leading historians recount their favorite stories of underappreciated Americans. From Stephen Jay Gould on deaf baseball player Dummy Hoy; to William Leuchtenburg on the truth behind the legendary Johnny Appleseed; to Christine Stansell on Margaret Anderson, who published James Joyce's Ulysses; these portraits can be read equally for delight, instruction, and inspiration Taken together, however, the whole is much more than the sum of its parts. Every culture needs heroes who lead by example and uplift us all in the process. Too often lately, historians have been more intent on picking apart the reputations of previously revered Americans. At times it has seemed as if the academy were on the attack against much of its own culture, denying its past greatness while making heroes only of its dissidents and doubters. Yet as this collection vividly demonstrates, heroes come in many shapes and sizes, and we all gain when we remember and celebrate them. Forgotten Heroes includes nearly as many women as men, and nearly as many people from before 1900 as after. It expands the traditional definition of hero to encompass not only military figures and politicians who took risks for great causes, but also educators, religious leaders, reformers, labor leaders, publishers, athletes, and even a man who started a record company. Many of them were heroes of conscience -- men and women who insisted on doing the right thing, no matter how unpopular or risky, commanding respect even from those who disagreed. Some were famous in their day and have since been forgotten, or remembered only in caricature.

Haar droom komt uit, maar is het misschien te mooi om waar te zijn? Ellen is vanaf haar vijfde een weeskind en wordt onder hoede genomen door haar oom en tante. Zij laten haar keer op keer weten dat wat ze ook in haar leven zal bereiken, aan hun hartelijk te danken is. Wanneer de verloving met haar nieuwe vlam zich nadert, pleegt hij plotseling zelfmoord. Wat heeft haar neef Jago hiermee te maken? En welke mysterieuze familiegeheimen liggen er verborgen in haar erfenis, het eiland met het familiekasteel voor de kust van Cornwall?

In 1995, when Von Trier and three comrades issued a 10-point 'Vow of Chastity' for the making of simpler, more truthful movies, cynics in the film business refused to take it seriously. Five years on, the international success of the raw, uncompromising 'Dogme95' films - Festen, The Idiots, Mifune, The King is Alive - has fired a volley of shots across the bows of a staid and bloated industry. Richard Kelly's investigation of the Dogme95 movement is a piece of 'gonzo journalism' in which Kelly sallies forth in search of the Dogme brothers and their accomplices, seeking to hammer out the truth from the lies in this austere and anarchic piece of cinematic mischief.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mxaxr-XlnMwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fabulous Hell: A Novel","description":"When death proves as elusive as a meaningful life, when HIV is no longer a license to party into the final sunrise, when reality finally jars the nameless protagonist fully awake, the rootless, wayfaring opportunist of Curtis's debut novel turns on the demons at his heels and bites back.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VINaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fabulous+Hell:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Gran Granero Rojo","description":"Hab a caballos, ovejas, cabras, gansos, y un viejo espantap jaros recostado en su azad n.

Against this backdrop, Andrew Way Leong examines the emergence of generational terms that have long been used to organize Japanese American narratives: issei (first generation), nisei (second generation), and sansei (third generation). In the process, he suggests these widely-used generational concepts are in fact a recent construct. Leong's illuminating research is made possible by the Hoji Shinbun Digital Collection, the world's largest open-access, full-image, and searchable online digital collection of Japanese American newspapers. With this technology, Leong is able to analyze materials that until recently were regarded as beyond computer-aided analysis, due to difficulties presented by the complexity of Japanese language. With access to these primary sources, Leong is able to upend several scholarly assumptions and beliefs and present a never-before-seen picture of Japanese American struggles both with an adversarial host country and among themselves backed by the authority of primary sources.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NB9pDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vilhelm Hammershi, 1864-1916: Danish painter of solitude and light","description":"Danish painter Vilhelm Hammershoi (1864-1916), whose work is frequently compared to Vermeer's, has been overlooked for nearly a century. The catalogue for an exhibition that received wide acclaim at the Musee d'Orsay, Paris, and that opens at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in June 1998, this handsome book presents 80 of Hammershoi's distinctive and intimate portraits, landscapes, and interiors.Hammershoi exhibited extensively throughout Europe and was recognized by his peers as the premier Danish painter; critics often included him among the French Impressionists. His reputation diminished after his death, however, and he remained relatively unknown until his recent rediscovery.Today's art lovers will immediately respond to Hammershoi's extraordinary use of line, light, and shadow, and to his interiors and landscapes punctuated with a mood of concentrated absence. His portraits, too, are compelling psychological studies, often reflecting the isolation of the long Scandinavian winter.

This interdisciplinary selection, which is organized by theme and genre, demonstrates Wollstonecraft's importance in contemporary social, political and sexual theory and in Romantic studies. The book examines the reception of Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman but it also deals with the full range of her work from travel writing, education, religion and conduct literature to her novels, letters and literary reviews. As well as reproducing the most important modern Wollstonecraft scholarship the collection tracks the development of the author's reputation from the nineteenth century. The essays reprinted here (from early appreciations by George Eliot, Emma Goldman and Virginia Woolf to the work of twenty-first century scholars) include many of the most influential accounts of Wollstonecraft's remarkable contribution to the development of modern political and social thought.

The narrative provides a candid, unflinching portrayal of one of Russia's major revolutionary voices living among the impoverished and downtrodden of society. Throughout the narrative we follow Gorky as he takes on job after job and learns various life lessons that form the nucleus of his \\"university\\" education. The meticulous description of at first seemingly insignificant details reveal Gorky s fine-tuned literary eye. A beautiful and realistic struggle of a man who hoped to tear down class barrier, and a call for compassion, this classic is a must-read. Maxim Gorky (1868-1936) forged his reputation among the most talented and original Russian modern writers. His position in Russian literature is indisputable, as demonstrated by his five Nobel Prize nominations. A dissenter and a Bolshevik associate, he led a turbulent life of exile, which marked his literary endeavours. A strong supporter of Russia s political, social, and cultural transformation, Gorky s name still echoes in the annals of history.

At the edges of the world stand walls of ice which push slowly forward to reclaim the land for the night. And at the world's center, in the Holy Land where two great religions were born, are the Wells of Ihrain, the source of the greatest magics. Over the last century the Patriarchs of the West have demanded crusades to claim the Wells from the Pramans, the followers of the Written. Now an uneasy truce extends between the Pramans and the West, waiting for a spark to start the conflict anew. Then, on a mission in the Holy Land, the young Praman warrior Else is attacked by a creature of the Dark-in effect, a minor god. Too ignorant to know that he can never prevail over such a thing, he fights it and wins, and in so doing, sets the terrors of the night against him. As a reward for his success, Else is sent as a spy to the heart of the Patriarchy to direct their attention away from further ventures into the Holy Lands. Dogged by hidden enemies and faithless allies, Else witnesses senseless butchery and surprising acts of faith as he penetrates to the very heart of the Patriarchy and rides alongside their armies in a new crusade against his own people. But the Night rides with him, too, sending two of its once-human agents from the far north to assassinate him. Submerged in his role, he begins to doubt his faith, his country, even his family. As his mission careens out of control, he faces unanswerable questions about his future. It is said that God will know his own, but can one who has slain gods ever know forgiveness?

The authors carefully lead the reader trough the maze of terminology, explaining the major problems phenomenology has treated and showing how these are a consistent extension of the traditional concerns of philosophy. In concise, uncluttered, and straightforward terms, the history, development, and contemporary status of phenomenology is explained with a copiously annotated bibliography following each chapter.

When considered as aesthetic objects, how do scientific instruments or technological innovations reflect and embody culturally grounded assessments about appearance, feel, and use? And when these objects become museum artifacts, what aesthetic factors affect their exhibition? Contributors found answers in the material objects themselves. This volume reconsiders how science, technology, art, and aesthetics impact one another.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-a5qBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Training Juan Domingo: Mexico and Me","description":"Deceptively fresh and innocent, this book is really a hair-raising and rowdy venture from start to finish, by a woman who turns the commonplace into pure magic. And the not so commonplace: a drug bust, the Kennedy assassination, a climb to the crater of Paricutin volcano, Acapulco in the 50s. This is a younger Mexico, trying to find its way. It is also an indictment of cruelty and indifference, a book about dogs, children, love of nature.

Then, in the summer of 1995, the Clinton administration suddenly shifted course, deciding to assert the leadership that would prove necessary to end the war in Bosnia. This book based on numerous interviews with key participants in the decisionmaking process and written by a former National Security Council aide examines how the policy to end the war took shape. Getting to Dayton is a powerful case study of how determined individuals can exploit their positions to change U.S. government policy on crucial issues. In so doing, Daalder not only explains how Washington launched the diplomacy that culminated at Dayton, but also why the subsequent peace proved to be difficult to establish. Ivo H. Daalder is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. From 1995 to 1996 he served on the National Security Council staff as Director for European Affairs, where he was responsible for coordinating U.S. policy for Bosnia. His most recent publications include The United States and Europe in the Global Arena (1998) and Bosnia After SFOR: Options for Continued U.S. Engagement (1997). He is co-author of Winning Ugly: NATO's War to Save Kosovo, which will be published in 2000.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wTUDsYFO92wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trysting Moon (Harper Monogram)","description":"Rescued from the dreadful fire that left her blind, Irish patriot Lark Ballinter finds herself falling, against her will, for this Catholic enemy to her cause.

Traditional scholarship maintains that Islam developed in opposition to the idolatrous and polytheistic religion of the Arabs of Mecca and the surrounding regions. In this study of pre-Islamic Arabian religion, G. R. Hawting adopts a comparative religious perspective to suggest an alternative view. By examining the various bodies of evidence which survive from this period, the Koran and the vast resources of the Islamic tradition, the author argues that in fact Islam arose out of conflict with other monotheists whose beliefs and practices were judged to fall short of true monotheism and were, in consequence, attacked polemically as idolatry. The author is adept at unravelling the complexities of the source material, and students and scholars will find his argument both engaging and persuasive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mh134wJLwkIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Game of Inches: The Stories Behind the Innovations That Shaped Baseball: The Game on the Field (Volume 1)","description":"Ben-Zion Gold's memoir brings to life the world of a million Jews in pre-World War II Poland who were later destroyed by the Nazis.

Scott Davis first sketches the fundamentals of as Aristotelian approach to the ethics of war, arguing that the virtue is a craft, of itself fragile, that must be sustained by a community that makes the highest demands upon itself. Introduced as a criterion for evaluating alliances and international relations, the concept of moral community is also of the highest significance for interpreting those ruptures within the community, including resistance and rebellion, that arise concomitantly with the prospect and onset of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CkX7DwAAQBAJ&dq=Warcraft+and+the+Fragility+of+Virtue:+An+Essay+in+Aristotelian+Ethics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the Techniques of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu","description":"This comprehensive guide to  the gentle art  by one of its foremost practitioners and teachers helps readers master the fundamentals on which a confident self-defense or professional competition career are based.

Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire prankster, is rich enough to do whatever he likes. And what he likes is to carefully execute projects where he can cauterize by ridicule what the rest of the world ignores: complacency, greed, corruption, and idiocy. Determined to  make it hot for people,  Grand spends his billions staging a series of hilarious, sometimes bewildering stunts, lampooning along the way the American holy cows of money, status, power, beauty, media, and stardom. Concocting deliciously perverse mayhem, he throws a million one-hundred-dollar bills into an enormous vat of steaming offal, proving just what people will do for money, and he promotes a new silky shampoo that turns hair to wire and a deodorant that becomes a time-released stench-bomb. He inserts subliminally suggestive and perverse images into well-loved classic films, takes a howitzer on safari, and brings a panther to a kennel club dog show. His most elaborate adventure is an ultra-exclusive cruise aboard the S.S. Magic Christian, where elite passengers are treated to a series of madcap indignities. The Magic Christian is a hilarious and savagely satiric view of American commercialism, rich in Southern s deft handling of detail, dialogue, and delightful deviancy.

'We need the tonic of wildness,' Thoreau wrote in Walden, and by turning his back on town amenities to build a house on Walden Pond in 1845, he helped shape our notions of the individual, subsistence, and a moral relation to nature. Raising white beans and potatoes that he sold to his Concord neighbors, he stayed for two years; his book records both the philosophy he developed while living alone and the facts of his everyday life. Included here with the complete text of Walden are selections from Thoreau's first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers; 'A Plea for Captain John Brown,' his eloquent defense of the American abolitionist's rebellion at Harper's Ferry, and such masterpieces as his famous essay 'Civil Disobedience,' in which he describes a night spent in prison for refusing to pay a poll tax to a government that condoned slavery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0LSN_CALkbMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Create Your Indoor Fountain: Expressions of the Self","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UD9OMwEACAAJ&dq=Create+Your+Indoor+Fountain:+Expressions+of+the+Self&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Audel Complete Building Construction (Audel Technical Trades Series)","description":"You can build on this foundation Whether construction is your livelihood or you're just planning ahome addition, you need to know the latest about materials,methods, and more.

Wind tunnels could not provide the necessary data so pilots had to risk their safety in experimental aircraft which, for their time, achieved phenomenal performance. Both series of D-558 were well-designed, strong and efficient aircraft which enabled test pilots to tackle the unknown in comparative safety. Though delayed by their innovative but troublesome power-plants, and limited by the cost of their air-launched sorties, they went well beyond their original Mach 1 speed objective and continued to generate information that provided design solutions for a whole generation of supersonic combat aircraft. Although the final stage of the D-55 programme, the USN's 'militarized' D-558-3, never happened, the Navy was able to apply the lessons of the programme to its much more practical combat types such as the F8U Crusader and F3H Demon. Supported by full-colour artwork including three-view plates of the two D-558 models and a technical view of the D-2 cockpit, this authoritative text offers a comprehensive guide to the record-breaking Navy research craft.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x2qdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesse Bear's Tra-La Tub","description":"Rhymed text and illustrations describe Jesse Bear's activities for preschoolers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3jIEAAAACAAJ&dq=Jesse+Bear%27s+Tra-La+Tub&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ILLUSTRATED LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD: A TRILOGY.","description":"Autobiographical accounts of country life in late nineteenth-century England, chronicle the disappearing traditions and values of hamlet, village, and small market towns","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IaInAQAAMAAJ&dq=THE+ILLUSTRATED+LARK+RISE+TO+CANDLEFORD:+A+TRILOGY.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Titanium and Titanium Alloys","description":"Given their growing importance in the aerospace, automotive, sports and medical sectors, modelling the microstructure and properties of titanium and its alloys is a vital part of research into the development of new applications.

The first, The Invisible Spirit: A Life of Post-War Scotland 194575, was met with immediate acclaim. Ian Hamilton declared it  The most remarkable book on Scotland I have ever read . This new volume brings the story much closer to the present day and traces in vivid and enthralling detail the social and political threads which lead directly to the Scotland of the twenty-first century. There are wonderful highs and devastating lows. Along the way the author describes the oil boom in Shetland, gives a hilarious account of Scotland s doomed campaign at the World Cup in Argentina and tells the astonishing story of the cloning of Dolly the sheep. In dark contrast he also provides a searing analysis of such tragedies as the Orkney child sex abuse scandal, the Lockerbie bombing and the massacre of schoolchildren and a teacher at Dunblane. This is not conventional history as a bland recital of facts: in a sparkling and caustic critique, Kenneth Roy anatomizes an often dysfunctional Scotland which is still recognisable today. But as the book closes, hope is just round the corner  or is it? The Broken Journey culminates in a referendum and the inauguration of the new Scottish parliament. The stage is set for the future we now live in . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8589DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That Sweet Enemy: The French and the British From the Sun King to the Present","description":"From Blenheim and Waterloo to 'Up Yours, Delors' and 'Hop Off You Frogs', the cross-Channel relationship has been one of rivalry, misapprehension and suspicion. But it has also been a relationship of envy, admiration and affection. In the nearly two centuries since the final defeat of Napoleon, France and Britain have spent much of that time as allies - an alliance that has been almost as uneasy, as competitive and as ambivalent as the generations of warfare. Their rivalry both on peace and war, for good and ill, has shaped the modern world, from North America to India in the eighteenth century, in Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it is still shaping Europe today. This magisterial book, by turns provocative and delightful, always fascinating, tells the rich and complex story of the relationship over three centuries, from the beginning of the great struggle for mastery during the reign of Louis XIV to the second Iraq War and the latest enlargement of the EU. It tells of wars and battles, ententes and alliances, but also of food, fashion, sport, literature, sex and music. Its cast ranges from William and Mary to Tony Blair, from Voltaire to Eric Cantona; its sources from ambassadorial dispatches to police reports, from works of philosophy to tabloid newspapers, from guidebooks to cartoons and films. It's a book which brings both British humour and Gallic panache to the story of these two countries, in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer, in victory and in defeat, in dominance and in decline.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_t7y4LaBTbUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gulf War: A Bibliography","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eJ0mkpl7m0AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Luigi Carnacina's great Italian cooking: La grande cucina internazionale","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9is-AQAAIAAJ&dq=Luigi+Carnacina%27s+great+Italian+cooking:+La+grande+cucina+internazionale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brother of Jesus: James the Just and His Mission","description":"James the Just was, in the time between Jesus' resurrection and James's death, the most prominent and widely respected leader in Christendom.

Wilson's legendary career. Sparking vigorous debate in the sciences, The Social Conquest of Earth upends  the famous theory that evolution naturally encourages creatures to put family first  (Discover). Refashioning the story of human evolution, Wilson draws on his remarkable knowledge of biology and social behavior to demonstrate that group selection, not kin selection, is the premier driving force of human evolution. In a work that James D. Watson calls  a monumental exploration of the biological origins of the human condition,  Wilson explains how our innate drive to belong to a group is both a  great blessing and a terrible curse  (Smithsonian). Demonstrating that the sources of morality, religion, and the creative arts are fundamentally biological in nature, the renowned Harvard University biologist presents us with the clearest explanation ever produced as to the origin of the human condition and why it resulted in our domination of the Earth s biosphere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sr44okuve8MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasury of American Antiques: Pictorial Survey of Popular Folk Arts and Crafts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8WxgxwEACAAJ&dq=Treasury+of+American+Antiques:+Pictorial+Survey+of+Popular+Folk+Arts+and+Crafts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Soberman!","description":"In The Adventures of Soberman!, the author recognizes the value of humor in recovery from alcoholism.

The more than 30,000 islands dotted throughout the basin provide some of the best ways to enjoy the Great Lakes. While the vast majority of these islands can only be reached by private boat or plane, a surprising number of islands each with its own character and often harboring more than a bit of intrigue in its history can be reached by merely taking a ferry ride, or crossing a bridge, offering everyone the chance to experience a variety of island adventures.

The extraordinary Cajun and Creole cooking of South Louisiana has roots going back over two hundred years, and today it is the one really vital, growing regional cuisine in America. No one is more responsible than Paul Prudhomme for preserving and expanding the Louisiana tradition, which he inherited from his own Cajun background. Chef Prudhomme's incredibly good food has brought people from all over America and the world to his restaurant, K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen, in New Orleans. To set down his recipes for home cooks, however, he did not work in the restaurant. In a small test kitchen, equipped with a home-size stove and utensils normal for a home kitchen, he retested every recipe two and three times to get exactly the results he wanted. Logical though this is, it was an unprecedented way for a chef to write a cookbook. But Paul Prudhomme started cooking in his mother's kitchen when he was a youngster. To him, the difference between home and restaurant procedures is obvious and had to be taken into account. So here, in explicit detail, are recipes for the great traditional dishes--gumbos and jambalayas, Shrimp Creole, Turtle Soup, Cajun \\"Popcorn,\\" Crawfish Etouffee, Pecan Pie, and dozens more--each refined by the skill and genius of Chef Prudhomme so that they are at once authentic and modern in their methods. Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen is also full of surprises, for he is unique in the way he has enlarged the repertoire of Cajun and Creole food, creating new dishes and variations within the old traditions. Seafood Stuffed Zucchini with Seafood Cream Sauce, Panted Chicken and Fettucini, Veal and Oyster Crepes, Artichoke Prudhomme--these and many others are newly conceived recipes, but they could have been created only by a Louisiana cook. The most famous of Paul Prudhomme's original recipes is Blackened Redfish, a daringly simple dish of fiery Cajun flavor that is often singled out by food writers as an example of the best of new American regional cooking. For Louisianians and for cooks everywhere in the country, this is the most exciting cookbook to be published in many years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ij3QAMTGX90C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Parents Disagree and What You Can Do About It","description":"How to stop arguing and present a united front.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fkyc8zj0nCgC&dq=When+Parents+Disagree+and+What+You+Can+Do+About+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Highland Champion","description":" With her latest Scottish medieval romance . . .

In Mr. Arquilla's view, Reagan during his presidency articulated important new concepts that fundamentally reshaped American foreign policy. He saw the effort simply to contain Soviet expansion as too defensive in nature, so he replaced it with a doctrine designed to help others free themselves from totalitarian rule. He objected to the notion of mutual nuclear deterrence on practical and ethical grounds, a stand that led him to negotiate arms reductions as well as explore the possibility of missile defense. On these issues, as Mr. Arquilla shows, Reagan overturned a long-standing consensus of public and expert opinion, helping achieve a favorable end to the cold war and the arms race that came with it. Yet there were also areas in which Reagan s policies played out less successfullyhis inattention to the consequences of nuclear proliferation by smaller powers like Pakistan; his indecision in launching a preventive war against terrorism in the mid-1980swith consequences that continue to haunt us today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xo14AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Reagan+Imprint:+Ideas+in+American+Foreign+Policy+from+the+Collapse+of+Communism+to+the+War+on+Terror&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There Is A Tide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Xjl9MwEACAAJ&dq=There+Is+A+Tide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Marsh, pioneer; the life story of a trail-blazer on six frontiers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9Xc2ABdRx5YC&dq=John+Marsh,+pioneer%3B+the+life+story+of+a+trail-blazer+on+six+frontiers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frogs and Toads and Tadpoles, Too (Rookie Read-About Science)","description":"Explains basic likenesses and differences between frogs and toads.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fQ5LVeqgRzMC&dq=Frogs+and+Toads+and+Tadpoles,+Too+(Rookie+Read-About+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rough and ready, or, Life among the New York newsboys (Ragged Dick series)","description":"Rufus, also known as Rough and Ready, is a newsboy who must protect his sister, Rose, from an alcoholic stepfather, James Martin.

Formatted as a dictionary, or gazetteer, and organized by state, it includes all known tribal groupings within the state and the many villages where they were located. Using the year 1650 to determine the general location of most of the tribes, Swanton has drawn four over-sized fold-out maps, each depicting a different quadrant of North America and the location of the various tribes therein, including not only the tribes of the United States, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and Central America, but the Caribbean islands as well. According to the author, the gazetteer and the maps are \\"intended to inform the general reader what Indian tribes occupied the territory of his State and to add enough data to indicate the place they occupied among the tribal groups of the continent and the part they played in the early period of our history. . . .\\" Accordingly, the bulk of the text includes such facts as the origin of the tribal name and a brief list of the more important synonyms; the linguistic connections of the tribe; its location; a brief sketch of its history; its population at different periods; and the extent to which its name has been perpetuated geographically.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Xpx6WoPz7xIC&dq=The+Indian+tribes+of+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bananas: From Manolo to Margie","description":"Follows the journey of a banana from Honduras where it is grown to North America where it is eventually consumed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=379xGwAACAAJ&dq=Bananas:+From+Manolo+to+Margie&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mel Bay Easy Banjo Solos","description":"This book presents a selection of original 5-string banjo tunes that can be played by the beginning student familiar with basic chords in G tuning. the author introduces a variety of styles and banjo techniques including hammer-ons, pull-offs, string bending and slides - all in standard notation and banjo tab.

Jane Stern was a walking encyclopedia of panic attacks, depression, and hypochondria. Her marriage of more than thirty years was suffering, and she was virtually immobilized by fear and anxiety. As the daughter of parents who both died before she was thirty, Stern was terrified of illness and death, and despite the fact that her acclaimed career as a food and travel writer required her to spend a great deal of time on airplanes, she suffered from a persistent fear of flying and severe claustrophobia. Yet, this fifty-two-year-old writer decided to become an emergency medical technician. Stern tells her story with great humor and poignancy, creating a wonderful portrait of a middle-aged, Woody Allenish woman who was  deeply and neurotically terrified of sick and dead people,  but who went out into the world to save other people s lives as a way of saving her own. Her story begins with the boot camp of EMT training: 140 hours at the hands of a dour ex-marine who took delight in presenting a veritable parade of amputations, hideous deformities, and gross disasters. Jane overweight and badly out of shape had to surmount physical challenges like carrying a 250-pound man seated in a chair down a dark flight of stairs. After class she did rounds in the emergency room of a local hospital. Each call Stern describes is a vignette of human nature, often with a life in the balance. From an AIDS hospice to town drunks, yuppie wife beaters to psychopaths, Jane comes to see the true nature and underlying mysteries of a town she had called home for twenty years. Throughout the book we follow her as she gets her sea legs, bonds with the firefighters who become her colleagues, and eventually, comes to be known as Ambulance Girl.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FVAzYpomUFIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Algorithms and data structures in F and Fortran","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BDEcNAAACAAJ&dq=Algorithms+and+data+structures+in+F+and+Fortran&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Poems of Heinrich Heine: A Modern English Version","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nGcDzgEACAAJ&dq=Complete+Poems+of+Heinrich+Heine:+A+Modern+English+Version&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Once upon a Crime","description":"Once upon a time, the Grimms  fairy tales taught lessons.

Steven Roger Fischer offers the first English-language history of Easter Island in Island at the End of the World, a fascinating chronicle of adversity, triumph, and the enduring monumentality of the island's stone guards. A small canoe with Polynesians brought the first humans to Easter Island in 700 CE, and when boat travel in the South Pacific drastically decreased around 1500, the Easter Islanders were forced to adapt in order to survive their isolation. Adaptation, Fischer asserts, was a continuous thread in the life of Easter Island: the first European visitors, who viewed the awe-inspiring monolithic busts in 1722, set off hundreds of years of violent warfare, trade, and disease from the smallpox, wars, and Great Death that decimated the island to the late nineteenth-century Catholic missionaries who tried to \\"save\\" it to a despotic Frenchman who declared sole claim of the island and was soon killed by the remaining 111 islanders. The rituals, leaders, and religions of the Easter Islanders evolved with all of these events, and Fischer is just as attentive to the island's cultural developments as he is to its foreign invasions. Bringing his history into the modern era, Fischer examines the colonization and annexation of Easter Island by Chile, including the Rapanui people's push for civil rights in 1964 and 1965, by which they gained full citizenship and freedom of movement on the island. As travel to and interest in the island rapidly expand, Island at the End of the World is an essential history of this mysterious site.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vXjxAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ernie Harwell: My 60 Years in Baseball (Honoring a Detroit Legend)","description":"As the voice of the Detroit Tigers for over 30 years, Ernie Harwell was a much beloved figure and a Hall of Fame broadcaster.

However, to obtain and maintain supreme cardiovascular fitness and a rock-hard body, I must continually use the training regimen I learned as a member of the Navy SEALs.\\" -- from The Navy SEAL Workout As the world's most elite combat unit, the Navy SEALs have long been known for their tremendous physical fitness and mental stamina. Their training program has also carried somewhat of a mystique, as so few people actually enter and stay in the program. Now Navy SEAL Mark De Lisle reveals the no-frills workout that has conditioned some of the best bodies around. From stretching through cooldown, including a variety of running and swimming workouts as well as tips on top-notch nutrition, The Navy SEAL Workout can improve any committed participant's cardiovascular fitness and overall shape and tone. \\"After 27 years as a Navy SEAL, I feel The Navy SEAL Workout program is the best one on the market, encompassing the physical training regimen required of a Naval Special Warfare Warrior. The levels of intensity, from beginner to advanced, are so well laid out that both the biggest 'couch potato' and professional athelete can see improvement after a short period of time.\\" -- Allan Starr, Command Masterchief, Naval Special Warfare Command Group One \\"In The Navy SEAL Workout, Mark De Lisle has developed a program soundly based in a state-of-the-art knowledge of exercise physiology and principles. This book would be a valuable addition to the library of anyone who is interested in peak performance.\\" -- W.K. Prusaczyk, PhD, Exercise Physiologist, Navy Health and Research Center \\"It has been interesting to note the numerous SEAL-related materials that have come out in recent years.

Excerpt: Pennsylvania Station-commonly known as Penn Station-is the major intercity train station and a major commuter rail hub in New York City. It is one of the busiest rail stations in the world, and a hub for inbound and outbound railroad traffic in New York City. The New York City Subway system also has multiple lines that connect to the station. The station is in the underground levels of Pennsylvania Plaza, an urban complex between Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue and between 31st Street and 33rd Street in Midtown Manhattan, and is owned by Amtrak. Serving 300,000 passengers a day (compared to 140,000 across town at Grand Central Terminal) at a rate of up to a thousand every 90 seconds, it is the busiest passenger transportation facility in the United States and by far the busiest train station in North America. Penn Station is at the center of the Northeast Corridor, an electrified passenger rail line extending south to Washington, D.C., and north to Boston. Intercity trains are operated by Amtrak, while commuter rail services are operated by the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit. The station is also served by six New York City Subway routes. Penn Station saw 8.4 million Amtrak passenger arrivals and departures in 2010, about double the traffic at the next busiest station, Union Station in Washington, D.C.

The book uncovers the conspiracy roots of government involvement in science-fiction/horror movies, from pulp-fiction and Lost World romances to films dealing with flying saucers, the planet Mars, mind control, abductions, transdimensional journeys, and extraterrestrials. Written in a mock-serious tone reminiscent of Rod Sterling's Twilight Zone TV Series, and illustrated with old movie stills and posters, Hollywood Vs. the Aliens is a fascinating, fun read, yet delivers some startling findings. Rux reviews the facts known about UFOs and ancient technologies, and how they came to be discovered. Then he investigates the period between the 1930s and 1950s, focusing on CIA Robertson Panel's recomendation that Hollywood be used as a deflectionary tool against popular interest in UFOs. Government involvement in Orson Welles' 1938 War of the Worlds broadcast is discussed, as are the Disney and United Artists studios' early connections to patriotic propaganda. Early '50s movies like The Thing from Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still show UFOlogical facts that only government sources could have known at the time. From there the book goes on to discuss recent releases and the ongoing depictions of aliens and UFOs, right up to Independence Day, Men in Black, and Mars Attacks!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zWAEHQAACAAJ&dq=Hollywood+vs.+The+Aliens:+The+Motion+Picture+Industry%27s+Participation+in+UFO+Disinformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sayings of Sri Ramakrishna,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Tv7KAAAACAAJ&dq=The+sayings+of+Sri+Ramakrishna,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chow Venice: Savoring the Food and Wine of La Serenissima","description":"The city of Venice is one of the most beautiful in the world, but a visit is too often marred by meals at bad restaurants with high prices, unscrupulous waiters, and tasteless food.

Shawn Johnson was the lead pastor of a thriving, fast-growing church. He was supposed to have it all together. But he was also struggling in silence with anxiety and depression, suffering from debilitating panic attacks that told him the lie that this would never end, that he'd spend the rest of his life in excruciating pain. Until one day he ended up sobbing and screaming on the side of the road. He had to be brought home by his wife and two friends, who removed any potential weapons from his house while he sat with his head in his hands, begging God for a miracle. In Attacking Anxiety, Shawn vulnerably shares about this dark time and offers those familiar with that same struggle everything he's learned in his battles with anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. As readers join Shawn on this journey, he will expose the lies that lead toward isolation and replace them with the truths that are essential to survival; reveal the things that most people don't realize are adding more anxiety and depression to their lives and replace them with the wisdom and support that lead to true freedom; explain what to do when you, or someone you love, is in the middle of a panic attack, and guide you through what you need to know, what you need to start doing, what you need to stop doing, and what you need to remember in order to start attacking anxiety and depression. This is not a one-and-done process that will completely free you from all brokenness, but it will help you recognize that, even in the middle of so much brokenness and overwhelming pain, God has a plan and a purpose for your life, and he is ready to heal you in ways you never thought possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5jo1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Burning All Illusions: A Guide to Personal and Political Freedom","description":"This is a book about freedom.

Too often, there aren t adequate systems in place to aid those affected in processing what has happened. This study uniquely combines practical theology, pastoral insight and scientific data to demonstrate how Christian congregations can be helped to be resilient in the face of sudden devastating events. Beginning by identifying the characteristics of trauma in individuals and communities, this collection of essays from practitioners and academics locates sudden trauma-inducing tragedies as a problem in practical theology. A range of biblical and theological responses are presented, but contemporary scientific understanding is also included in order to challenge and stretch some of these traditional theological resources. The pastoral section of the book examines the ethics of response to tragedy, locating the role of the minister in relation to other helping agencies and exploring the all-too-topical issue of ministerial abuse. Developing a nuanced rationale for good practical, pastoral, liturgical and theological responses to major traumas, this book will be of significant value to scholars of practical theology as well as practitioners counselling in and around church congregations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HSCyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Madcap Miss","description":"At 22 Grace Farnsworth had lost her job as a governess, and had to assume a childish disguise to have enough money for a coach seat.

They tell of a great secret finally revealed, of a surprising answer to the most profound questions, of a hidden mystery that satisfies our deepest longings. Writers, poets, artists, composers, and filmmakers have pursued the Grail for 1,700 years. The great quest drives the legends of King Arthur, propels Indiana Jones's greatest adventure, and keeps many people turning the pages of \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" These tales of quests and miracles and of honor and betrayal have capti-vated humankind for so long, say the authors of \\"The Grail Code,\\" because the stories really do touch the deepest parts of our hearts.

Drawing on a broad range of sources, including the archives of the Dalmatian communes under Venetian rule and military frontier records, Bracewell provides the first comprehensive analysis of the uskoks as a social phenomenon, examining their origins, their military and social organization, their plunder economy, their mental world, and their relations with other groups in this borderland between three empires. The uskoks lived on the Christian-Muslim frontier, and they invoked Europe s struggle against Islam to justify their often bloody deeds. As Bracewell demonstrates, however, their actions were also shaped by the maze of local political and economic rivalries, social conflicts, and confessional antagonisms. In a book that tests the concept of the social bandit, the author analyzes the motives that guided the uskoks and distinguishes these from the factors that impelled various elements of the local population to support them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ht_-CgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Uskoks+of+Senj:+Piracy,+Banditry,+and+Holy+War+in+the+Sixteenth-Century+Adriatic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cambridge Klett Concise Polish-English Dictionary (English and Polish Edition)","description":"A fully-bilingual Polish-English dictionary, especially designed for Polish learners of English.

Its dual purpose is to promote understanding of complex historical processes leading to globalization and generate interest in transnational and global comparative research on railways. In four volumes, organized by historical geography, this scholarly collection gathers rare out-of-print published and unpublished materials from archival and digital repositories throughout the world. It adopts a capsule approach that focuses on short selections of significant primary source content instead of redundant and irrelevant materials found in online data collections. The current collection draws attention to railway cultures through railroad reports, parliamentary papers, government documents, police reports, public health records, engineering reports, technical papers, medical surveys, memoirs, diaries, travel narratives, ethnographies, newspaper articles, editorials, pamphlets, broadsides, paintings, cartoons, engravings, photographs, art, ephemera, and passages from novels and poetry collections that shed light on the cultural history of railways. The editor s original essays and headnotes on the cultural politics of railways introduce over 200 carefully selected primary sources.

The Nobel Prize winning writer s masterwork is the engrossing story of a Muslim family in Cairo during Britain s occupation of Egypt in the early decades of the twentieth century. The novels of The Cairo Trilogy trace three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence. Palace Walk introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sonsthe tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad s rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in Palace of Desire, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. Sugar Street brings Mahfouz s vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician. Throughout the trilogy, the family s trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries. Filled with compelling drama, earthy humor, and remarkable insight, The Cairo Trilogy is the achievement of a master storyteller.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SKBBDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bloodsword Saga: The Trilogy","description":"Mark Bowman's 1950s childhood in segregated Texas is found in 'Last Dance of 'Jim Crow'.

The fall phenomenon, occurring when North American horned and antlered animals are at their physical prime, features dramatic and dangerous fights, chasing, scent marking, and rubbing. It is the time of year when the thrilling whistle of a bull elk sweeps across the canyon; when lovesick bull moose curiously court dairy cows, and bighorn rams collide with one another with the combined force of 2400 foot-pounds. A hundred exciting color photographs vividly illustrate this spectacular fall ritual and author Ron Spomer's descriptive text explains the origins and reasons for this fascinating, seemingly bizarre behavior. For example, why do whitetail bucks tryst with one doe at a time while elk bulls wear themselves thin servicing a harem? Why, after the rut, do mule deer bucks cast their antlers and assume the identity of does? The Rut investigates and answers these questions and more about these compelling animal rituals, including rutting tactics as well as describing how terrain, habitat, climate and other factors combine to shape each species' specific strategy for perpetuating itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d9FFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Rut:+Spectacular+Fall+Ritual+of+North+American+Horned+and+Antlered+Animals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Middle of the Night (Acting edition)","description":"Shakespeare's actors did not receive a copy of the entire script but instead worked from \\"cue-scripts\\" or \\"part scripts\\" which contained only the lines and cues for a single character.

It has served to challenge authority, defend privilege, advance causes, and throttle hopes. In the first anthology of its kind to appear in over thirty years, Documenting American Violence brings together excerpts from a wide range of sources about incidents of violence in the United States. Each document is set into context, allowing readers to see the event through the viewpoint of contemporary participants and witnesses and to understand how these deeds have been excused, condemned, or vilified by society. Organized topically, this volume looks at such diverse topics as famous crimes, vigilantism, industrial violence, domestic abuse, and state-sanctioned violence. Among the events these primary sources describe are: --Benjamin Franklin's account of the Conestoga massacre, when an entire village of American Indians was killed by the Paxton Boys, a group of frontier settlers --militant abolitionist John Brown's attack on Harper's Ferry --Ida B. Wells' condemnation of lynchings in the South --the massacre of General Custer's 7th Cavalry at Little Bighorn, as witnessed by Cheyenne war chief Two Moon --Nat Turner's confession about the slave revolt he led in Southampton County, Virginia --Oliver Wendell Holmes' diaries and letters as a young infantry officer in the Civil War --a police officer's account of the Haymarket Trials --Harry Thaw's murder of the Gilded Age's most prominent architect, Stanford White, through his own published version of the events --the post-trial, public confessions of Ray Bryant and J.W.

A Logical Journey is a continuation of Wang's Reflections on G?del and also elaborates on discussions contained in From Mathematics to Philosophy. A decade in preparation, it contains important and unfamiliar insights into G?del's views on a wide range of issues, from Platonism and the nature of logic, to minds and machines, the existence of God, and positivism and phenomenology. The impact of G?del's theorem on twentieth-century thought is on par with that of Einstein's theory of relativity, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, or Keynesian economics. These previously unpublished intimate and informal conversations, however, bring to light and amplify G?del's other major contributions to logic and philosophy. They reveal that there is much more in G?del's philosophy of mathematics than is commonly believed, and more in his philosophy than his philosophy of mathematics. Wang writes that \\"it is even possible that his quite informal and loosely structured conversations with me, which I am freely using in this book, will turn out to be the fullest existing expression of the diverse components of his inadequately articulated general philosophy.\\" The first two chapters are devoted to G?del's life and mental development. In the chapters that follow, Wang illustrates the quest for overarching solutions and grand unifications of knowledge and action in G?del's written speculations on God and an afterlife. He gives the background and a chronological summary of the conversations, considers G?del's comments on philosophies and philosophers (his support of Husserl's phenomenology and his digressions on Kant and Wittgenstein), and his attempt to demonstrate the superiority of the mind's power over brains and machines. Three chapters are tied together by what Wang perceives to be G?del's governing ideal of philosophy: an exact theory in which mathematics and Newtonian physics serve as a model for philosophy or metaphysics. Finally, in an epilog Wang sketches his own approach to philosophy in contrast to his interpretation of G?del's outlook.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ArpNEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Logical+Journey:+From+Gdel+to+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rube: The River Man","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SKgVPQAACAAJ&dq=Rube:+The+River+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Audel Plumbers Pocket Manual (Audel Technical Trades Series)","description":"Here's the real plumber's friend This fully revised guide gives you plumbing essentials, illustrations, tips, shortcuts - the lowdown on brazing, soldering, pipe fittings, commercial water coolers, automatic bathroom systems, and more.

Her sons had graduated from college; she had been divorced for a long time; she was a successful journalist. While there was nothing really wrong with her life, she felt restless. Could she live independently of her family, her friends, her career? Steinbach searches for the answer to this provocative question firstly in Paris, where she finds a soul mate in a Japanese man; in Milan, where she befriends a young woman about to marry, and in the evocative cities of Oxford and Venice. Her trip is peppered with accounts of the exotic strangers she meets, her reflections on life and the observational postcards she wrote to herself during her year away.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_VwBV3npPDYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE VOYAGERS.","description":"Many ex-coalminers will find in this novel a powerful reminder of their own life  down the pit  as it skilfully recreates a typical day in the life of Luke, a British coalface worker in the 1970 s.

At an early age he went to sea as a cabin boy, becoming a captain in his own right at the age of twenty-one in the British merchant service. He ended up in Philadelphia and offered his services to the infant American navy, becoming its ablest and most dashing commander, raising \\"Old Glory\\" for the first time ever to the jackstaff of the USS Alfred, then attacking British ports in the US war of independence. His hour of glory was on the USS Bon Homme Richard when he engaged the Royal Navy off Flamborough Head.

This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

Despite such triumphs, he shocked the culinary world by taking his own life in February 2003. TheGaultMillau guidebook had recently dropped its ratings of Loiseau s restaurant, and rumors swirled that he was on the verge of losing a Michelin star (a prediction that proved to be inaccurate). Journalist Rudolph Chelminski, who befriended Loiseau three decades ago and followed his rise to the pinnacle of French restaurateurs, now gives us a rare tour of this hallowed culinary realm. The Perfectionist is the story of a daydreaming teenager who worked his way up from complete obscurity to owning three famous restaurants in Paris and rebuilding La C?te d Or, transforming a century-old inn and restaurant that had lost all of its Michelin stars into a luxurious destination restaurant and hotel. He started a line of culinary products with his name on them, appeared regularly on television and in the press, and had a beautiful, intelligent wife and three young children he adored Bernard Loiseau seemed to have it all. An unvarnished glimpse inside an echelon filled with competition, culture wars, and impossibly high standards, The Perfectionist vividly depicts a man whose energy and enthusiasm won the hearts of staff and clientele, while self-doubt and cut-throat critics took their toll.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z5pL0GvBn1kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photosynthesis","description":"Explains this fundamental process clearly and concisely for the undergraduate biology student.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6F7yuf1Sj30C&dq=Photosynthesis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies in Luke-Acts;: Essays presented in honor of Paul Schubert,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nNHGtAEACAAJ&dq=Studies+in+Luke-Acts%3B:+Essays+presented+in+honor+of+Paul+Schubert,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Years Before the Mast and Twenty-four Years After (Harvard Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TPc8twEACAAJ&dq=Two+Years+Before+the+Mast+and+Twenty-four+Years+After+(Harvard+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Source Records Of The Great War","description":"This is a new release of the original 1923 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6nwlnwEACAAJ&dq=Source+Records+Of+The+Great+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Exist, I Need, I'm Entitled","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ncfSwAEACAAJ&dq=I+Exist,+I+Need,+I%27m+Entitled&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Insider's Guide to Sake","description":"This introductory handbook to sake presents over 100 brands for all tastes and budgets, tips for beginners and connoisseurs, and an explanation of the brew-master's skills.

New York Newsday From bestselling author Connie Bruck, The Predators  Ball dramatically captures American business history in the making, uncovering the philosophy of greed that dominated Wall Street in the 1980s. During the 1980s, Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert was the Billionaire Junk Bond King. He invented such things as  the highly confident letter  ( I m highly confident that I can raise the money you need to buy company X ) and the  blind pool  ( Here s a billion dollars: let us help you buy a company ), and he financed the biggest corporate raiders men like Carl Icahn and Ronald Perelman. And then, on September 7, 1988, things changed... The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert with insider trading and stock fraud.

As more and more women enter the workplace, it would seem reasonable for society to make mothering a simpler and more efficient task. Instead, Sharon Hays points out in this original and provocative book, an ideology of \\"intensive mothering\\" has developed that only exacerbates the tensions working mothers face. Drawing on ideas about mothering since the Middle Ages, on contemporary childrearing manuals, and on in-depth interviews with mothers from a range of social classes, Hays traces the evolution of the ideology of intensive mothering--an ideology that holds the individual mother primarily responsible for child rearing and dictates that the process is to be child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor-intensive, and financially expensive. Hays argues that these ideas about appropriate mothering stem from a fundamental ambivalence about a system based solely on the competitive pursuit of individual interests. In attempting to deal with our deep uneasiness about self-interest, we have imposed unrealistic and unremunerated obligations and commitments on mothering, making it into an opposing force, a primary field on which this cultural ambivalence is played out.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5r5obtRneqoC&dq=The+Cultural+Contradictions+of+Motherhood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valve Amplifiers (2nd Ed.)","description":"Building Valve Amplifiers is a unique hands-on guide for anyone working with tube audio equipment--as an electronics hobbyist, audiophile or audio engineer.

That question--and the mysteries of the archipelago's vast contradictions--haunt Theodore Friend's remarkable work, a narrative of Indonesia during the last half century, from the postwar revolution against Dutch imperialism to the unrest of today. Part history, part meditation on a place and a past observed firsthand, Indonesian Destinies penetrates events that gave birth to the world's fourth largest nation and assesses the continuing dangers that threaten to tear it apart. Friend reveals Sukarno's character through wartime collaboration with Japan, and Suharto's through the mass murder of communists that brought him to power for thirty-two years. He guides our understanding of the tolerant forms of Islam prevailing among the largest Muslim population in the world, and shows growing tensions generated by international terrorism. Drawing on a deep knowledge of the country's cultures, its leaders, and its ordinary people, Friend gives a human face and a sense of immediacy to the self-inflicted failures and immeasurable tragedies that cast a shadow over Indonesia's past and future. A clear and compelling passion shines through this richly illustrated work. Rarely have narrative history and personal historical witness been so seamlessly joined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_w6Mn4xRLt8C&dq=Indonesian+Destinies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sylvia Factor","description":"As a Merchant Marine in World War II, Lee McEwen saw it all.

Cooperstown, New York, in 1979 (the year Willie Mays was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame), is a close-knit community where gossip is sovereign and baseball is the great American religion. Seen through the eyes of Dr. Kerwin Chylak, a psychiatrist who has recently moved to town with his family, the citizens of Cooperstown are a wildly eclectic team of players that includes an alcohol-befuddled mayor determined to be more than a footnote to history; the town busybody who pitches missiles of miscommunication; a disillusioned ex-ball player turned warrior; and a sports writer who detests baseball. Little do these ordinary people know that they are about to be thrust into an extraordinary situation as the construction of a baseball theme park threatens their quaint way of life. Teetering on the cusp of a decade in which commercialism could swallow them whole, they are spurred to action -- with unexpected, poignant, often hilarious results. Full of baseball legend and lore and featuring an unforgettable cast of unconventional characters, Cooperstown probes the hearts and minds of small-town America. It is a celebration of life in all its struggles, sorrows, and sudden slides into victory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OC_BtWiE_LcC&dq=Cooperstown:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horse: The Complete Guide (Complete Animal Guides)","description":"Whatever page you turn to, this huge, wonderfully illustrated reference will teach you something new and exciting about the majestic horse.

Kate Stone was twenty when the war began, living with her widowed mother, five brothers, and younger sister at Brokenburn, their plantation home in northeastern Louisiana. When Grant moved against Vicksburg, the family fled before the invading armies, eventually found refuge in Texas, and finally returned to a devastated home. Kate began her journal in May, 1861, and made regular entries up to November, 1865. She included briefer sketches in 1867 and 1868. In chronicling her everyday activities, Kate reveals much about a way of life that is no more: books read, plantation management and crops, maintaining slaves in the antebellum period, the attitude and conduct of slaves during the war, the fate of refugees, and civilian morale. Without pretense and with almost photographic clarity, she portrays the South during its darkest hours.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kfiCyYcF0HoC&dq=Brokenburn%3B:+The+journal+of+Kate+Stone,+1861-1868+(Library+of+Southern+civilization)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Albanian-English Dictionary","description":"The largest and most comprehensive bilingual dictionary of Albanian, The Albanian-English Dictionary is an essential reference for all those concerned with modern Albanian, whether students, scholars, translators, or in professional contexts.

Uit de as van het Keizerrijk is een nieuwe dreiging verrezen die de vrijheid van het hele sterrenstelsel bedreigt: de meedogenloze Eerste Orde.

Their fame was worldwide, with writers and artists such as David Bowie and Gabriel Garc a M rquez citing them as key influences. In Georges Brassens and Jacques Brel, Chris Tinker sheds new light on the pair and their work by moving beyond the biographical and linguistic approaches that tend to dominate the study of French song. Instead, Tinker focuses on the social and cultural impact of the music and public personas of Brassens and Brel. He explores the fascinating mix of the personal and the general in their lyrics and the way those often opposing impulses played out in their songs and through their careers. Tinker also is careful to give the musical aspects of the songs their proper attention, considering the ways in which they alternately support or undermine the personas developed in the singers' lyrics. Georges Brassens and Jacques Brel will be the definitive look at the work and the world of the two greatest figures of chanson fran?ais.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z3j8ESLPQBAC&dq=Georges+Brassens+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michael Crichton: Two Complete Novels","description":"A collection of two of the best-selling author's works: \\"Disclosure,\\" and \\"Rising Sun\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F2rfKNqXesYC&dq=Michael+Crichton:+Two+Complete+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kamandi Archives, Volume 1 (DC Archive Editions)","description":"Featuring full-color images from the best moments in graphic novel history, this comprehensive reference explores everything from dragons, cow races, and monstrous rats to insider secrets from Casanova himself.

We long for what we don't have. We doubt we will ever get it. We despair when we've lost it. In all cases, we lose sight of the simple truth that all we really have is right now. This moment alone is where we live and where we act. Great wisdom traditions throughout history have recognized this. Life is never static. It is always in flux. A dynamic, cyclical interplay between all things. Push and pull. Yin and yang. Light and the shadow. Joy and suffering. Birth and death. All of it coming together, right here, right now. We cannot run from it, no matter how much we might want to. We are always in this moment. Even choosing to do nothing is a choice that shapes our now. The only real choice is to lean in. To say yes to life in every moment, whatever it offers. To join in the unending dance of the seasons, all life migrating through it. It is from that place that you can act from your deepest truth. This journal was written to help you do just that. There are 108 questions and idea to meditate on, spread out over six seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Hurricane Season, Winter, and back around to Spring again. Jacqui has devoted much of her life to studying the Yoga Sutras, and the prompts are numbered in the same chapter-and-verse fashion (1.1, 1.2, 1.3... etc). There is plenty of space to write your thoughts and insights along the way, and we invite you to move at your own pace, approaching each passage as a seasonal companion that you can visit and revisit as you need to. You can take the journey in the order we've offered, moving through the seasons from spring and back around again. Or you can start where you need to start.

Further he indicates that the book has created its own supporters and detractors and has also been at the core of intense debates about the de-colonizing of the African mind, the dismantling of America, and the destabilizing of the Eurocentric hegemony. This book is not meant to be unread, un-remarked upon, or unheard. Afrocentrists have multiplied in the theaters, universities, unions, political organizations, schools, and corporations.

North American folk music achieved a high level of popular acceptance in the late 1950s. When it was replaced by various forms of rock music, it became a more specialized musical niche, fragmenting into a proliferation of musical styles. In the pop-folk revival of the 1960s, artists were celebrated or rejected for popularizing the music to a mass audience. In particular the music seemed to embrace a quest for authenticity, which has led to endless explorations of what is or is not faithful to the original concept of traditional music. This book examines the history of folk music into the 21st century and how it evolved from an agrarian style as it became increasingly urbanized. Scholar-performer Dick Weissman, himself a veteran of the popularization wars, is uniquely qualified to examine the many controversies and musical evolutions of the music, including a detailed discussion of the quest for authenticity, and how various musicians, critics, and fans have defined that pursuit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ts2rDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Textiles and clothing,: By Kate Heintz Watson (The Library of home economics [10])","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZrFpYJCTwgoC&dq=Textiles+and+clothing,:+By+Kate+Heintz+Watson+(The+Library+of+home+economics+%5B10%5D)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anonymous Was a Woman: A Celebration in Words and Images of Traditional American Art and the Women Who Made It","description":"Juxtaposes color reproductions of samplers, quilts, and needle-pictures with excerpts from the diaries and journals of eighteenth and nineteenth-century women","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3G51oplVK3gC&dq=Anonymous+Was+a+Woman:+A+Celebration+in+Words+and+Images+of+Traditional+American+Art+and+the+Women+Who+Made+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel according to St. John, 11-21 and the First Epistle of John (Calvin's commentaries)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=APsjnQEACAAJ&dq=The+Gospel+according+to+St.+John,+11-21+and+the+First+Epistle+of+John+(Calvin%27s+commentaries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cleaving of Christendom, 1517-1661: A History of Christendom (vol. 4)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Afternoon of the Gosling","description":"Pretty little Cerise Thayer was a minister's daughter who enjoyed doing \\"good\\".

Using his unique perspective on the Left and the Right, Jim examines the perceptions of liberals and conservatives on the prevailing issues of the day, comparing these perceptions with the real-life experiences of a cross section of Americans. Read about the passionate debate between a Republican father and his liberal daughter on the Iraq War, then find out what the soldiers who actually fought have to say, or compare the discussion that a conservative talk show host and his liberal guest have on health care with the reality of a cancer patient who lost his insurance coverage. Starting with the conventional, like friends and family members who are loathe to talk politics, and ending with the often heart-wrenching stories of those who have suffered the consequences of today's political disconnect, Jim analyzes the ever-expanding gap between the rhetoric of politicians and the experiences of the people they're supposed to represent.

Directors can use this unique guidebook for new play development from the beginning to the end of the process. Kahn and Breed explore ways of choosing new projects, talk about where to find new scripts, and explore the legal aspects of script development. They present a detailed system for theatrical analysis of the new script and show how to continue exploration and development of the script within the laboratory of the theater. Most importantly, they delineate the parameters of the relationship between the director and the playwright, offering proven methods to help the playwright and help facilitate the healthy development of the script. Breed and Kahn offer suggestions on casting, incorporating rewrites, and script handling plus how and when to use audience response and how to decide what step to take next. They also include extended interviews with developmental directors, dramaturgs, and playwrights, who give credence to the new script development process. In short, Kahn and Breed demystify a common, though often convoluted, theater process, providing a unique codification of ways to work on new plays.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9fhB8hCoSc4C&dq=Scriptwork:+A+Director%27s+Approach+to+New+Play+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Sky : The Art of Computer Animation","description":"The Academy Award-winning animation studio, responsible for the computer-generated effects in such movies as Alien Resurrection and Joe's Apartment, presents a frame-by-frame tour through the 3-D animation process, providing a behind-the-scenes look at their first full-length film, Ice Age, featuring the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ofdfQgAACAAJ&dq=Blue+Sky+:+The+Art+of+Computer+Animation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Some Like It Hotter","description":"She takes hers tall, dark and extra hot!

But they ve noticed you. They notice everything. That s their job. Sitting quietly in a nondescript car outside a bank making note of the tellers  work habits, the positions of the security guards. Lagging a few car lengths behind the Brinks truck on its daily rounds. Surreptitiously jiggling the handle of an unmarked service door at the racetrack. They re thieves. Heisters, to be precise. They re pros, and Parker is far and away the best of them. If you re planning a job, you want him in. Tough, smart, hardworking, and relentlessly focused on his trade, he is the heister s heister, the robber s robber, the heavy s heavy. You don t want to cross him, and you don t want to get in his way, because he ll stop at nothing to get what he s after. Parker, the ruthless antihero of Richard Stark s eponymous mystery novels, is one of the most unforgettable characters in hardboiled noir. Lauded by critics for his taut realism, unapologetic amorality, and razor-sharp prose-style and adored by fans who turn each intoxicating page with increasing urgency Stark is a master of crime writing, his books as influential as any in the genre. The University of Chicago Press has embarked on a project to return the early volumes of this series to print for a new generation of readers to discover and become addicted to. In The Outfit, Parker goes toe-to-toe with the mob hitting them with heist after heist after heist and the entire underworld learns an unforgettable lesson: whatever Parker does, he does deadly.  Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.  Washington Post Book World  Elmore Leonard wouldn t write what he does if Stark hadn t been there before. And Quentin Tarantino wouldn t write what he does without Leonard. . . . Old master that he is, Stark does all of them one better.  Los Angeles Times  Donald Westlake s Parker novels are among the small number of books I read over and over. Forget all that crap you ve been telling yourself about War and Peace and Proust these are the books you ll want on that desert island.

His influence has only increased since his death. A powerful catalyst and innovator, Rockwell broadened his constituency beyond the core Radical Right by articulating White Power politics in terms that were subsequently appropriated by the one-time klansman David Duke. He played a major role in developing Holocaust revisionism, now an orthodoxy of the Far Right. He also helped politicize Christian Identity, America's most influential right-wing religious movement, and welded together an international organization of neo-Nazis. All of these extremist movements continue to thrive today. Frederick Simonelli's biography of this powerful and enigmatic figure draws on primary sources of extraordinary depth, including declassified FBI files and manuscripts and other materials held by Rockwell's family and associates. The first objective assessment of the American Nazi party and an authoritative study of the roots of neo-nazism, neo-fascism, and White Power extremism in postwar America, American Fuehrer is shocking and absorbing reading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KAU2E4fFC10C&dq=American+Fuehrer:+George+Lincoln+Rockwell+and+the+American+Nazi+Party&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mark: Traditions in Conflict","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-M7YAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mark:+Traditions+in+Conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hirohito, Emperor of Japan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NQxxAAAAMAAJ&dq=Hirohito,+Emperor+of+Japan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Folk Psalms of Faith","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8soXMctUH_IC&dq=Folk+Psalms+of+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breeding lettuce for resistance to tomato spotted wilt virus in Hawaii (Research extension series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Alj5ygAACAAJ&dq=Breeding+lettuce+for+resistance+to+tomato+spotted+wilt+virus+in+Hawaii+(Research+extension+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Administering SAP R/3: HR - Human Resources Module","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8GhiPgAACAAJ&dq=Administering+SAP+R/3:+HR+-+Human+Resources+Module&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romanian Patericon: Saints of the Romanian Orthodox Church","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BogBAAAACAAJ&dq=Romanian+Patericon:+Saints+of+the+Romanian+Orthodox+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If You Take a Mouse to School","description":"Mouse goes to school in this picture book in the beloved #1 New York Times bestselling If You Give... series!

Chicago Tribune NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY USA TODAY AND CHICAGO TRIBUNE ? WINNER OF THE JAMES FENIMORE COOPER PRIZE FOR HISTORICAL FICTION Deep in the mist-shrouded forests of the Pacific Northwest is a small mill town called Commonwealth, conceived as a haven for workers weary of exploitation. For Philip Worthy, the adopted son of the town s founder, it is a haven in another sense as the first place in his life he s had a loving family to call his own. And yet, the ideals that define this outpost are being threatened from all sides. A world war is raging, and with the fear of spies rampant, the loyalty of all Americans is coming under scrutiny. Meanwhile, another shadow has fallen across the region in the form of a deadly virus striking down vast swaths of surrounding communities. When Commonwealth votes to quarantine itself against contagion, guards are posted at the single road leading in and out of town, and Philip Worthy is among them. He will be unlucky enough to be on duty when a cold, hungry, tired and apparently ill soldier presents himself at the town s doorstep begging for sanctuary. The encounter that ensues, and the shots that are fired, will have deafening reverberations throughout Commonwealth, escalating until every human value love, patriotism, community, family, friendship not to mention the town s very survival, is imperiled. Inspired by a little-known historical footnote regarding towns that quarantined themselves during the 1918 epidemic, The Last Town on Earth is a remarkably moving and accomplished debut.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6tBDi2tx3W8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PowerPointAdvanced Presentation Techniques","description":"* The first and only book to focus exclusively on advanced PowerPoint techniques, this latest addition to our successful Power Pack series shows veteran users how to harness sophisticated program features-and take their presentations to the next level * Techniques covered include putting together design templates and color schemes, working with master layouts, importing and manipulating digital photos and video clips, creating sophisticated animation and transition effects, and building interactive Web-based presentations * The CD-ROM offers add-ins, utilities, background images, presentation templates, sound effects, animated image clips, third party software toolboxes, presentation libraries, sound effects, and much more","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dmnGQgAACAAJ&dq=PowerPointAdvanced+Presentation+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learning Stories: Constructing Learner Identities in Early Education","description":"This text shows how learning stories can help create learner identities and affect education, pedagogy and learning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GFeSusK9m_cC&dq=Learning+Stories:+Constructing+Learner+Identities+in+Early+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What to Do When You Don't Know What to Say to Your Own Family","description":"This unique approach to family relationships is a toolbox of easy-to-read, practical ideas that can be quickly adapted for use in any family circle as a means of encouraging other family members.

What ideas dominate the key textbooks on the subject and what is presented as 'truth'? This book answers these critical questions. It is widely known that Western support of Israel played a vital role in the realization of Zionist objectives in Palestine. But academic support of Israel in the West has been a neglected issue, with Western academic knowledge being regarded as impartial and objective. This book reveals that this understanding of Western academic knowledge is wrong when it comes to the Israel/Palestine question. Rather, knowledge has been biased, misleading, and dogmatic and Western college students are subscribing to 'factual histories' based on theories at best, if not fiction. The book is the first empirical investigation able to document this partial reporting of history. Seyed Hadi Borhani examines the most popular college-level textbooks used to teach the history of the Israel/Palestine in Western universities, combining 'textbook analysis' (to determine how the dominant academic texts report the question) and a 'context analysis' (to identify who 'manufactures' the dominant knowledge). The book provides a historical map of how the Israel-Palestine conflict is understood in the West. The book can be used as a critique for students and professors to use alongside textbooks and is a vital and much-needed intervention into the state of affairs in Western academia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sPlXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvelous Country","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VrK9zQEACAAJ&dq=Marvelous+Country&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jackie Under My Skin: Interpreting an Icon","description":"Jackie Under My Skin is a nuanced description of how Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis transformed our definitions of personal identity and style.

Through the eyes of Elizabeth Thompson, the circuit rider's wife and narrator, Harris offers a witty but caring assessment of the sometimes fine differences between spiritual and merely religious folks, town and country society, backsliders and straight-and-narrow plodders, Methodists and Baptists, and heaven and hell.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mkndtMBtfRwC&dq=A+Circuit+Rider%27s+Wife+(Brown+Thrasher+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robin Archives, Volume 1 (DC Archive Editions)","description":"Collects past editions of the continuing adventures of Batman, and his sidekick, Robin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=loZRPgAACAAJ&dq=Robin+Archives,+Volume+1+(DC+Archive+Editions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Virginians at home: Family life in the eighteenth century","description":"Family life in the eighteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=X3ULAQAAIAAJ&dq=Virginians+at+home:+Family+life+in+the+eighteenth+century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shock Lines","description":"Gina, a seductive teenaged girl, lures her thirty-two-year-old high-school teacher, Phil, into a nightmare, and soon a series of atrocities begin to unfold in her sleepy, California desert town.

One reason for this is the general silence in most modern ethical theory about the place of emotions in the moral life. In this study of the possibility of emotional/moral transformation through religious belief and practice, Paul Lauritzen breaks this silence and attempts to explain both why emotions have been ignored and why they must be reclaimed.\\" \\"Drawing on work in philosophical psychology, cultural anthropology, and religious studies, Lauritzen develops an account of emotions and of the self that allows us to see how a system of religious belief and practice may dramatically transform the emotional life of the believer. He argues that emotions are not biologically basic experiences, invariant from culture to culture, but rather are culturally mediated artifacts that are inescapably tied to communities of belief and practice that sustain particular understandings of the self and its world.\\" \\"To this end, Lauritzen sketches a \\"social-constructivist\\" account of human emotions and analyzes the emotion of anger in detail. By comparing anger as it is found in our culture with accounts of \\"anger\\" in certain non-Western societies, the author demonstrates that emotions are crucially shaped in communities of belief and practice and are thus open to transformation with a change in belief and practice.\\" \\"This possibility is explored at length by examining the way in which a framework of retributive justice structures the experience of anger in our culture. According to Lauritzen, this framework presupposes that the human condition is characterized by limited resources, on the one hand, and by limited generosity, on the other. Against this background, anger will appear to be a natural retributive response to violations of individuals' rights.\\" \\"The author concludes the study by showing how, given particular religious views about human life and history, the framework of retributive justice may be transformed or transcended in ways that dramatically affect the emotional life of the believer.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Examples of use are in roaming between overlapping wireless systems, e.g., IP over DVB, WLAN, WiMAX and BWA. Mobile IP is not required within cellular systems such as 3G, to provide transparency when Internet users migrate between cellular towers, since these systems provide their own data link layer handover and roaming mechanisms. However, it is often used in 3G systems to allow seamless IP mobility between different packet data serving node (PDSN) domains. Mobile IP is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard communications protocol that is designed to allow mobile device users to move from one network to another while maintaining their permanent IP address. Defined in Request for Comments (RFC) 2002, Mobile IP is an enhancement of the Internet Protocol (IP) that adds mechanisms for forwarding Internet traffic to mobile devices (known as mobile nodes) when they are connecting through other than their home network. Mobile IP communication protocol refers to the forwarding of Internet traffic with a fixed IP address even outside the home network. It allows users having wireless or mobile devices to use the Internet remotely. Mobile IP is mostly used in WAN networks, where users need to carry their mobile devices across different LANs with different IP addresses. Mobile IP is not a wireless protocol. However, it could be employed for the IP infrastructure of cellular networks. The principle objective of this book are to provide an introduction to basic concepts and methodologies for mobile communication and to develop a foundation, that can be used the basis for further study and research in the field of communication engineering.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2-LEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Change Is Gonna Come","description":"A Change is Gonna Come chronicles more than forty years of black music: from the hopeful, angry refrains of the Freedom movement to the slick pop of Motown; from Woodstock and the 'Summer of Love' to Vietnam and the race riots; from disco inferno to the Million Man March.

Chekhov assigned a personal way of speaking to each character, divorcing consequence from action, cause from effect. Despite the controversy generated by its paradoxical nature, however, The Cherry Orchard has become a milestone in twentieth-century drama. In this astute analysis of Chekhov's last play, Donald Rayfield argues that The Cherry Orchard can be best understood when read as a culmination of the dramatist's major plays, particularly The Seagull (1896) and Three Sisters (1901). Stressing that Chekhov the playwright is inseparable from Chekhov the story writer, Rayfield points up instances in which the author \\"reuses\\" material from such classic stories as \\"A Visit to Friends\\", \\"Panpipes\\", \\"The Black Monk\\", and \\"The Bride\\". An engaging history of the how the play came to be - complete with citations from Chekhov's notebooks to show the parallels between his life and the lives of his characters - amplifies Rayfield's dissemination of the dramatist's themes and stylistics technique. Rayfield further uses Chekhov's letters to and from those involved in the initial production - the Moscow Arts Theater director Konstantin Stanislavsky; Chekhov's wife, the actress Olga Knipper; and various of Chekhov's contemporaries in the theater - to chronicle the play'sevolution. The apparent contradiction of a play that is simultaneously comic and tragic is, Rayfield concludes, a fact of the modernist drama of Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, and Antonin Artaud. Rayfield's concise analysis is an essential companion to any reading of The Cherry Orchard, as it delineates the play's seminal role in the evolution of twentieth-century theater and its crucial position in Russian cultural history as both the culmination of all realist nineteenth-century fiction and the first masterpiece of a new, arguably symbolist or absurdist, literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gJ-vQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Cherry+Orchard+Catastrophe+and+Comedy+(Twayne%27s+Masterwork+Studies+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Riches of Oseola McCarty","description":"A brief biography of Oseola McCarty, a hard-working washer woman who, without a formal education herself, donated a portion of her life savings to the University of Southern Mississippi to endow a scholarship fund for needy students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=poIIAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Riches+of+Oseola+McCarty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flea market handbook","description":"In this indispensable guide, Geraldine James, home buying manager for Selfridges department store, shares the insider knowledge she has gleaned from spending every available weekend at flea markets.

Pile has opened up a productive theoretical and empirical space for further study and exploration' - RGS-IBG Urban Geography Research Group What is real about city life? Real Cities shows why it is necessary to take seriously the more imaginary, fantastic and emotional aspects of city life. Drawing inspiration from the work of Walter Benjamin, Sigmund Freud and Georg Simmel, Pile explores the dream-like and ghost-like experiences of the city. Such experiences are, he argues, best described as phantasmagorias. The phantasmagorias of city life, though commonplace, are far from self-evident and little understood. This book is a path-breaking exploration of urban phantasmagorias, grounded empirically in a series of unusual and exciting case studies. In this study, four substantial phantasmagorias are identified: dreams, magic, vampires and ghosts. The investigation of each phantasmagoria is developed using a wide variety of clear examples. Thus, voodoo in New York and New Orleans shows how ideas about magic are forged within cities. Meanwhile vampires reveal how specific fears about sex and death are expressed within, and circulate between, cities such as London and Singapore. Taken together, such examples build a unique picture of the diverse roles of the imaginary, fantastic and the emotional in modern city life. What is \\"real\\" about the city has radical consequences for how we think about improving city life, for all too often these are over-looked in utopian schemes for the city. Real Cities forcefully argues that an appreciation of urban phantasmagorias must be central to what is considered real about city life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b5L7AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perfect Day","description":"Perfect day is misschien het beste te omschrijven als een literaire variant van een Greatest Hits- of Best Of-album, inclusief een verrassende bonustrack!

When we think of the radical changes that transformed America during the twentieth century, our minds most often snap to the fifties and sixties: the Civil Rights Movement, changing gender roles, and new economic opportunities all point to a decisive turning point. But these were not the only changes that shaped our world, and in Living on the Edge, we learn that rapid social change and uncertainty also defined the lives of Americans born at the turn of the twentieth century. The changes they cultivated and witnessed affect our world as we understand it today. Drawing from the iconic longitudinal Berkeley Guidance Study, Living on the Edge reveals the hopes, struggles, and daily lives of the 1900 generation. Most surprising is how relevant and relatable the lives and experiences of this generation are today, despite the gap of a century. From the reorganization of marriage and family roles and relationships to strategies for adapting to a dramatically changing economy, the challenges faced by this earlier generation echo our own time. Living on the Edge offers an intimate glimpse into not just the history of our country, but the feelings, dreams, and fears of a generation remarkably kindred to the present day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9W8NEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Which ad pulled best?","description":"This tenth edition of Which Ad Pulled Best? is a brief workbook that serves as a supplement for the marketing and advertising courses.

An empassioned defence of Sebond's fifteenth-century treatise on natural theology, it was inspired by the deep crisis of personal melancholy that followed the death of Montaigne's own father in 1568, and explores contemporary Christianity in prose that is witty and frequently damning. As he searches for the true meaning of faith, Montaigne is heavily critical of the arrogant tendency of mankind to create God in its own image, and offers his personal reflections on the true role of man, the need to eschew personal arrogance, and the vital importance of faith if we are to understand our place in the universe.

Smith's bold new critical study, have instead reenacted the Tower of Babel myth, producing a constitutional discourse marked by rampant confusion, elaborate sophistry, and thinly veiled authoritarian bullying. How is it that the pursuit of such lofty aims by yesterday's framers and today's scholars has left us mired in a constitutional morass? This timely book ponders that question with the intellectual vigor it deserves. Observing that standard accounts of constitutional law--both the \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" varieties--have lost their power to illuminate, The Constitution and the Pride of Reason explores how constitutional law hangs together (and how it falls apart) by investigating the perennial claim that the Constitution and its interpretation somehow embody a commitment to governance by \\"reason.\\" What does this claim mean, and is it valid? In confronting these queries, Smith offers revealing and iconoclastic assessments of constitutionalists ranging from Madison and Jefferson to Dworkin and Bork. Also detailed in these pages is a provocative overview of the whole constitutional project, from its noble aspirations to its tragic failures. A truly visionary work that investigates the scholarship, the design, and the history of the quintessential American legal document, this volume also sensibly reflects on the meaning and possibility of the ethical commitment to the \\"life of reason.\\" It will appeal not only to students of constitutional law but also to those interested in political science, philosophy, and American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wAc9lBqbH6sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Covert War","description":"This powerful study makes a compelling case about the key U.S. role in state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War. Long hidden from public view, Operation Condor was a military network created in the 1970s to eliminate political opponents of Latin American regimes. Its key members were the anticommunist dictatorships of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil, later joined by Peru and Ecuador, with covert support from the U.S. government. Drawing on a wealth of testimonies, declassified files, and Latin American primary sources, J. Patrice McSherry examines Operation Condor from numerous vantage points: its secret structures, intelligence networks, covert operations against dissidents, political assassinations worldwide, commanders and operatives, links to the Pentagon and the CIA, and extension to Central America in the 1980s. The author convincingly shows how, using extralegal and terrorist methods, Operation Condor hunted down, seized, and executed political opponents across borders. McSherry argues that Condor functioned within, or parallel to, the structures of the larger inter-American military system led by the United States, and that declassified U.S. documents make clear that U.S. security officers saw Condor as a legitimate and useful 'counterterror' organization. Revealing new details of Condor operations and fresh evidence of links to the U.S. security establishment, this controversial work offers an original analysis of the use of secret, parallel armies in Western counterinsurgency strategies. It will be a clarion call to all readers to consider the long-term consequences of clandestine operations in the name of 'democracy.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tSDg6xa4z2YC&dq=Covert+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Butterfly Kisses (Little Golden Book)","description":"Based on the chart-topping song by the same name, Butterfly Kisses is for every dad who knows the joy of raising a daughter, and for every little girl who has experienced the comfort of a father's unconditional love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=z-1ANhkpDxAC&dq=Butterfly+Kisses+(Little+Golden+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fruit of Stone","description":"Mark Spragg's first novel is the story of the lifelong friendship between two Wyoming ranchers, McEban and Bennett, and their love for the same woman--Gretchen Simpson.

Serbian troops were forced to withdraw, enabling an international military and political presence to take charge in the region. But was this war inevitable or was it the product of failed western diplomacy prior to the conflict? And once it became necessary to use force, did NATO adopt a sound strategy to achieve its aims of stabilizing Kosovo? In this first in-depth study of the Kosovo crisis, Ivo Daalder and Michael O'Hanlon answer these and other questions about the causes, conduct, and consequences of the war. Based on interviews with many of the key participants, they conclude that notwithstanding important diplomatic mistakes before the conflict, it would have been difficult to avoid the Kosovo war. That being the case, U.S. and NATO conduct of the war left much to be desired. For more than four weeks, the Serbs succeeded where NATO failed, forcefully changing Kosovo's ethnic balance by forcing 1.5 million Albanians from their home and more than 800,000 from the country. Had they chosen to massacre more of their victims, NATO would have been powerless to stop them. In the end, NATO won the war by increasing the scope and intensity of bombing, making serious plans for a ground invasion, and moving diplomacy into full gear in order to convince Belgrade that this was a war Serbia would never win. The Kosovo crisis is a cautionary tale for those who believe force can be used easily and in limited increments to stop genocide, mass killing, and the forceful expulsion of entire populations. Daalder and O'Hanlon conclude that the crisis holds important diplomatic and military lessons that must be learned so that others in the future might avoid the mistakes that were made in this case.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aeQLUvtZnMcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Wiccan Bardo: Initiation and Self-Transformation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Tq1TAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Wiccan+Bardo:+Initiation+and+Self-Transformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Failure of a mission;: Berlin 1937-1939,","description":"Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

They spread to the northern and southern Mediterranean shores, making significant contributions to Western civilization. But today they are almost completely unknown. Except for scholars, they are mostly ignored today because the rival Greek and Roman cultures that eventually spread to the West attempted to erase any trace of the Phoenicians. History has no mercy on the vanquished and is written by the winners. While scholars are aware of the Phoenician contributions to civilization, most people know nothing about them. This book is an attempt to bring this topic back to the attention of modern readers. The author hopes that a broad audience of readers will be interested in the knowledge that was brought to us by the contributions of the Phoenicians. The intended audience of this book includes students of history, mythology or religion, writers and scholars from other disciplines, linguistic experts and anyone with an interest in enhancing their knowledge about forgotten civilizations. There are over three million people of Phoenician descent in the United States and twice as many in the remainder of the Americas, to whom this book would also be of interest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4-G3wAEACAAJ&dq=Surviving+Panic+Disorder:+What+You+Need+to+Know&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Concerning the Jews","description":"Some months ago I published a magazine article descriptive of a remarkable scene in the Imperial Parliament in Vienna.

Yet the physical and institutional differences between tangible assets and knowledge assets remain poorly understood. In the case of knowledge, the ownership and control of assets are becoming ever more separate, a phenomenon that is actually exacerbated by the phenomenon of learning. If we are to meet the challenges of the information economy, then we need a new approach to property rights based on a deeper theoretical understanding of knowledge assets. Max Boisot writes clearly and in accessible language providing some of the key building blocks which are needed for a theory of knowledge assets. He develops a powerful conceptual framework, the Information-Space or I-Space, for exploring the way knowledge flows within and between organizations. This framework will enable managers and students to explore and understand how knowledge and information assets differ from physical assets, and how to deal with them at a strategic level within their organizations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6-BOHeSqkk0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reasonable Doubts: The O.J.

The mind is an indivisible part of a human being. However, to describe the mind I divided it artificially into various components, as I do not know any better way to make the subject of the mind clear.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7MWRBQAAQBAJ&dq=El+Aleph+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powers and Prospects: Reflections on human nature and the social order","description":"The renowned linguist and political activist offers penetrating reflections on language, human nature, and foreign policy in this essay collection. From linguistics to the Middle East; foreign affairs to the role of the media; and intellectual responsibility to the situation in East Timor, Noam Chomsky offers a wide-ranging exploration of the issues and ideas that have concerned him most deeply throughout his distinguished career. These essays are drawn from a series of lectures Chomsky gave in Australia in 1995, under the auspices of the East Timor Relief Association. Examining the interplay between language, human nature and foreign policy, Powers and Prospects provides a scathing critique of government policy orthodoxy. Moving beyond criticism of the status quo, Chomsky then outlines other paths that can lead to better understanding and more constructive action.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9rGQCgAAQBAJ&dq=Powers+and+Prospects:+Reflections+on+human+nature+and+the+social+order&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The President and Mrs. Reagan: An American Love Story","description":"A photojournalist presents photographs of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, from the gubernatorial campaign in 1966 through 1998, and recounts his experiences while taking the pictures and his observations of their relationship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hQNyAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+President+and+Mrs.+Reagan:+An+American+Love+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dialogues with Zuni Potters","description":"The Zuni Indians of western New Mexico have been making beautiful pottery for over a century. In this intimate and personal book fourteen contemporary Zuni potters tell us in their own words about the traditions and techniques of their craft--how they collect and handle clay, how they fire and decorate pots, and how they learn, develop, teach, and adapt their art. Some of these potters have learned in the traditional way from their mothers, but many have also taken advantage of modern mobility and education to learn at school and by visiting museum collections of pueblo pottery. Their work and their lives combine tradition and innovation. Pottery is a traditional female art among the pueblos, but five of the potters included in this book are men. One potter uses an electric kiln at home but travels to workshops in the midwest with sheep manure so that she can demonstrate traditional firing techniques. All of them are as generous in sharing their stories in this book as they are in working cooperatively to develop their craft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=f7N1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Dialogues+with+Zuni+Potters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of James","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fFgrngEACAAJ&dq=The+Story+of+James&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Painter 7 Wow!

It provides new insights into the emerging phenomenon of how social media tools are harnessed to promote faith and beliefs systems, specifically looking at the Malay view of apostasy from Islam. Employing sociocultural theory and theoretical concepts to analyse the discursive behaviour of a Malaysian apostate on a social networking site, the study unpacks how digital storytelling and rhetorical strategies can influence readers, culturally and socially, and contribute to identity construction in relation to politicised viewpoints. The analysis of the discourse surrounding apostasy in Malaysia enables parallels to be drawn to such discourses in other parts of the world, raising discussions on the connections between inflammatory online rhetoric and social problems, such as recruitment to terrorism, involvement in gangs or the use of addictive substances. This book is of particular interest to scholars and students considering the intersection of critical discourse analysis and religious studies. It is of interest to sociolinguists and psychologists interested in online media.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=586kDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo the Venetian","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AzqgqnIgpGEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Bit of Soul Food (World Snacks)","description":"Easy-to-read rhyming text introduces a variety of \\"soul food\\" dishes, including grits, fried chicken, collard greens, yams, and sweet tea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G20s3FZgT2UC&dq=A+Little+Bit+of+Soul+Food+(World+Snacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slick","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mf8NAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beans and Rice: Growing Up Cuban","description":"The author has taken a semi-humorous look at a tragic chapter in history: She survived the Cuban Revolution, leaving her country, and being raised in a different country but she's still not sure of what she is ","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Alhxxr1T9bsC&dq=Beans+and+Rice:+Growing+Up+Cuban&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cast up by the sea (Fireside Henty series)","description":"Ned, who was shipwrecked as an infant, grows up to embark on a life at sea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6_BSswEACAAJ&dq=Cast+up+by+the+sea+(Fireside+Henty+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Together in Rhythm: A Facilitator's Guide to Drum Circle Music (Book & DVD)","description":"Create compelling rhythm-based events for groups of all kinds!

A chilly east wind was blowing. The trees of the vast forests were all in leaf but the ash trees, and they were unfolding their buds. And along a bridle-path a few miles southwest of York a lad of fourteen was riding, while behind him followed a handsome deerhound. A boy of fourteen, at that age of the world, was an older and more important personage than he is to-day. If he were well-born he had, generally, by this time, served his time as a page and was become an esquire in the train of some noble lord. That this lad had not done so was because his uncle, a prior in whose charge he had been reared since the early death of his parents, had designed him for a priest. Priest, however, he had declined to be, and his uncle had now permitted him to go forth unattended to attach himself as page to some lord, if he could.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tD9rAqctzZwC&dq=A+boy%27s+ride&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cowboy from the Wild Horse Desert: A Story of the King Ranch","description":"Life in 1912 on the biggest Ranch in the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CpanGAAACAAJ&dq=The+Cowboy+from+the+Wild+Horse+Desert:+A+Story+of+the+King+Ranch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living In The Shade of Islam","description":"The \\"How to Live as a Muslim\\" series is an essential guide for anyone who seeks to acquire an accurate knowledge of Islam, as it elucidates all the facets of Islam with precise brevity in three volumes: An Introduction to Islamic Faith and Thought, Living in the Shade of Islam, and Living the Ethics and Morality of Islam, respectively.

But the expedition went horribly wrong: Delayed by a hurricane, knocked off course by a colossal error of navigation, and ultimately doomed by a disastrous decision to separate the men from their ships, the mission quickly became a desperate journey of survival. Of the three hundred men who had embarked on the journey, only four survived three Spaniards and an African slave. This tiny band endured a horrific march through Florida, a harrowing raft passage across the Louisiana coast, and years of enslavement in the American Southwest. They journeyed for almost ten years in search of the Pacific Ocean that would guide them home, and they were forever changed by their experience. The men lived with a variety of nomadic Indians and learned several indigenous languages. They saw lands, peoples, plants, and animals that no outsider had ever seen before. In this enthralling tale of four castaways wandering in an unknown land, Andr s Res ndez brings to life the vast, dynamic world of North America just a few years before European settlers would transform it forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ePh0swEACAAJ&dq=Black+Conquistador:+The+Narvaez+Expedition+in+Florida+(Historic+Adventure+Series,+No.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bread and wine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=voTyAAAAMAAJ&dq=Bread+and+wine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More tales by Polish authors;","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Or do they contain their own critical components, albeit in altered form? Oe and Beyond surveys the accomplishments of Oe and other writers of the postwar generation while looking further to examine the literary parameters of the \\"Post-Oe\\" generation. Despite the unprecedented availability today of the work of many of these writers in excellent English translations, some twenty years have passed since a collection of critical essays has appeared to guide the interested reader through the fascinating world of contemporary Japanese fiction. Oe and Beyond is a sampling of the best research and thinking on the current generation of Japanese writers being done in English. The essays in this volume explore such subjects as the continuing resonances of the atomic bombings; the notion of \\"transnational subjects\\"; the question of the \\"de-canonization\\" (as well as the \\"re-canonization\\") of writers; the construction (and deconstruction) of gender models; the quest for spirituality amid contemporary Japanese consumer affluence; post-modernity and Japanese \\"infantilism\\"; the intertwining connections between history, myth-making, and discrimination; and apocalyptic visions of fin de siecle Japan. Contributors pursue various methodological and theoretical approaches to reveal the breadth of scholarship on modern Japanese literature. The essays reflect some of the latest thinking, both Western and Japanese, on such topics as subjectivity, gender, history, modernity, and the postmodern. Oe and Beyond includes essays on Endo Shusaku, Hayashi Kyoko, Kanai Mieko, Kurahashi Yumiko, Murakami Haruki, Murakami Ryu, Nakagami Kenji, Oe Kenzaburo, Ohba Minako, Shimada Masahiko, Takahashi Takako, and Yoshimoto Banana.

In the United States, particularly in the high-immigration cities, most immigrant-origin groups have significantly lower earnings than do their counterparts in Canadian or Australian cities. Immigration policy is not a factor, however; in fact U.S. immigrants?in particular origin groups?are not less skilled. American institutions, including education, labor market structures, and social welfare, all reflect greater individualism and all contribute to the potential for inequality. Resulting higher poverty rates for America's immigrants explains their more extensive use of its weaker welfare system. Jeffrey Reitz's social institutional approach projects the impact of institutional restructuring?past and future?on the economic performance of immigrants in these countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kmEPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Al Illich's how to pick winners","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AD_HAAAACAAJ&dq=Al+Illich%27s+how+to+pick+winners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way I See It: An Autobiography","description":"The daughter of Ronald and Nancy Reagan offers an inside view of growing up in the Reagan family, describing her father's emotional abandonment of her and the family's bitter rivalries","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2eEeAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Way+I+See+It:+An+Autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Trophy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LkqeoBlAVpUC&dq=The+Last+Trophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Volume 17","description":"The graphic novel is a vital and emerging genre, and this is the only book that focuses on its relation to Jewish culture, literature, and history.

Newton: The Radical Theorist","description":"Huey P. Newton's powerful legacy to the Black Panther movement and the civil rights struggle has long been obscured. Conservatives harp on Newton's drug use and on the circumstances of his death in a crack-related shooting. Liberals romanticize his black revolutionary rhetoric and idealize his message. In Huey P. Newton: The Radical Theorist, Judson L. Jeffries considers the entire arc of Newton's political role and influence on civil rights history and African American thought. Jeffries argues that, contrary to popular belief, Newton was one of the most important political thinkers in the struggle for civil rights. Huey P. Newton's political career spanned two decades. Like many freedom fighters, he was a complex figure. His international reputation was forged as much from his passionate defense of black liberation as from his highly publicized confrontations with police. His courage to address police brutality won him admirers in ghettos, on college campuses, and in select Hollywood circles. Newton gave Black Power a compelling urgency and played a pivotal role in the politics of black America during the 1960s and 1970s. Few would deny that Newton's life (1942-1989) was strewn with incidences of violence and that his police record was long. But Newton's struggles with police took place in a rich and troubled context that included urban unrest, police brutality, government repression, and an intense debate over civil rights tactics. Stripped of history and interpretation, the violence of Newton's life brought emphatic indictments of him. Newton's death attracted widespread media attention. However, pundits offered little on Newton as freedom fighter or as theoretician and activist. Huey P. Newton: The Radical Theorist dispels myths about Newton's life, but the book is primarily an in-depth examination of Newton's ideas. By exploring this charismatic leader, Jeffries's book makes a valuable contribution to the scant literature on Newton, while also exposing the core tenets and evolving philosophies of the Black Panther Party. Judson L. Jeffries is an assistant professor of political science at Purdue University. He is the author of Virginia's Native Son: The Election and Administration of Governor L. Douglas Wilder (2000), and his work has been published in such periodicals as Western Journal of Black Studies, Journal of Political Science, and Ethnic and Racial Studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VnP7qL3ROBMC&dq=Huey+P.+Newton:+The+Radical+Theorist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brief Coaching for Lasting Solutions","description":"Like so many helping professionals today, coaches are discovering that the most effective treatment plan is not always the one that takes the most time.

Furthermore, the answers are sometimes abbreviated and not played out to the final conclusion. The reader is advised to play out these sequences to the end and attempt to 'refute' the correct answer until he knows beyond doubt that the correct answer works. In problems where there are numerous stone captures, the reader should play out the moves on a board.

Horrell presents a study of Pauline ethics, examining how Paul's moral discourse envisages and constructs communities in which there is a strong sense of solidarity but also legitimate difference in various aspects of ethical practice. Horrell reads New Testament texts with an explicit awareness of contemporary ethical theory, and assesses Paul's contribution as a moral thinker in the context of modern debate. Using a framework indebted to the social sciences, as well as to contemporary ethical theory, Horrell examines the construction of community in Paul's letters, the notions of purity, boundaries and identity, Paul's attempts to deal with diversity in his churches, the role of imitating Christ in Paul's ethics, and the ethic Paul develops for interaction with 'outsiders'. Finally, the pattern of Paul's moral thinking is considered in relation to the liberal-communitarian debate, with explicit consideration given to the central moral norms of Pauline thought, and the prospects for, and problems with, appropriating these in the contemporary world.

The British were involved at key points in the initial stages of modernization. Their hold upon the import-export economy tended to slow down industrialization, and there were other areas in which their presence acted as a brake upon Brazilian modernization. But the British also fostered change. British railways provided primary stimulus to the growth of coffee exports, and since the British did not monopolize coffee production, a large proportion of the profits remained in Brazilian hands for other uses. Furthermore, the burgeoning coffee economy shattered traditional economic, social and political relationships, opening up the way for other areas of growth. The British role was not confined to economic development. They also contributed to the growth of 'a modern world-view'.

He was the father of modern polar exploration, the last act of territorial discovery before the leap into space began. Nansen was a prime illustration of Carlyle's dictum that 'the history of the world is but the biography of great men'. He was not merely a pioneer in the wildly diverse fields of oceanography and skiing, but one of the founders of neurology. A restless, unquiet Faustian spirit, Nansen was a Renaissance Man born out of his time into the new Norway of Ibsen and Grieg. He was an artist and historian, a diplomat who had dealings with Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin, and played a part in the Versailles Peace Conference, where he helped the Americans in their efforts to contain the Bolsheviks. He also undertook famine relief in Russia. Finally, working for the League of Nations as both High Commissioner for Refugees and High Commissioner for the Repatriation of Prisoners of War, he became the first of the modern media-conscious international civil servants.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uOvKCQInwUQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Missions of the Civil War","description":"Civil War historian and celebrated author Philip Van Doren Stern presents an underground history woven from first hand accounts of Civil War spies, scouts, detectives and double agents.

Instead of accepting salvation, it is better to deserve it. Instead of buying, begging, or stealing, a cure, it is better to stop building disease. Disease is of man's own building, and one worse thing than the stupidity of buying a cure is to remain so ignorant as to believe in cures. The false theories of salvation and cures have built man into a mental mendicant, when he should be the arbiter of his own salvation, and certainly his own doctor, instead of being a slave to a profession that has neither worked out its own salvation from disease nor discovered a single cure in all the age-long period of man's existence on earth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KCwGtAEACAAJ&dq=Toxemia+explained&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Conifer Manual : Volume 1 (Forestry Sciences)","description":"The research that has culminated in the pUblication being introduced . worldwide) save by one or two of this Manual was in the first place undertaken private conifer enthusiasts.

Geert Hofstede regards them as a crucial aspect causing considerable problems. On the front page of his website he claims that \\"culture is more often a source of conflict than of synergy. Cultural differences are a nuisance at best and often a disaster\\". Corresponding to this viewpoint, a lot of literature is dedicated to the awareness of culture in business. Most of these works refer to models of national culture, which are used as a basis for discussion in this essay as well. As the emphasis should lay on the way in which cultural differences in non-verbal communication might influence business interactions, the knowledge about these concepts is presumed and therefore the individual dimensions are not explained in detail. For the two neighbouring countries, France and Germany, which are used to elucidate the topics, one might expect a more or less common way of communicating and doing business. Yet there are some hidden but rather important cultural differences, mostly rooted in underlying concepts, which shall be taken under the umbrella term of non-verbal communication as well.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LgNEV2LULd0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hayes Over New Zealand","description":"This is a special upgraded edition of the portrait of New Zealand, first published in 1981.

It was a sequel to a similar sym posium entitled: The Present Status of the Quantum Theory of Light held at the same venue in August 1995. These symposia came about as a result of discussions between Professor Stanley Jeffers and colleagues on the International Organizing Committee. Professor Jeffers was the executive local organizer of the symposia. The 1997 symposium attracted over 120 participants representing 26 different countries and academic institutions. The broad theme of both symposia was the enigma of modern physics: the non-local, and possibly superluminal interactions implied by quantum mechanics, the structure of fundamental particles including the photon, the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity, and the nature of gravity and inertia. Jean-Pierre Vigier was the guest of honour at both symposia. He was a lively contributor to the discussions of the presentations. The presentations were made as 30-minute lectures, or during an evening poster session. Some participants did not submit a written account of their presentation at the symposium, and not all of the articles submitted for the Proceedings could be included because of the publisher's page limit.

He spent the last 7 years studying these claims to determine if any could be valid and if so then to determine the source of the anomalous energy and the electrogravity effects.According to classical electrodynamics, all electrically charged particles, like quarks and electrons, should radiate away energy from gyroscopic precessional motions and orbital motions. Bugh has come to the conclusion that they really do. However, all particles are also absorbing just as much energy from all other radiating particles.The continuously absorbed energy equals the radiated energy and applies forces that move similar type particles into harmonious precesssional motions with each other. This results in a sea of electromagnetic standing waves among all matter in the universe.It is this sea of standing waves rather than quantum probability waves that best account for the wave like nature of matter. Particles move to quantized states because of electromagnetic forces that keep particle motions synchronized with this sea of standing waves.This is an interaction among all matter that Ernst Mach alluded to as necessary to cause matter's characteristic of inertia. Einstein called this Mach's Principle. Einstein studied Mach's ideas while developing his theory of General Relativity.Using common sense and classical electrodynamics, Bugh explains how these particle spin interactions are possible even among compensating spins. Technology advancements are possible based on these particle spin interactions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Tj_Lm9qWckwC&dq=Spin+Wave+Technology:+Initial+Release&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings.(Book Review): An article from: Reviewer's Bookwatch","description":"Een fascinerend verhaal vol wijze levenslessen en een genot om te lezen.

C. Wright Mills examines and critiques the organization of power in the United States, calling attention to three firmly interlocked prongs of power: the military, corporate, and political elite. The Power Elite can be read as a good account of what was taking place in America at the time it was written, but its underlying question of whether America is as democratic in practice as it is in theory continues to matter very much today. What The Power Elite informed readers of in 1956 was how much the organization of power in America had changed during their lifetimes, and Alan Wolfe's astute afterword to this new edition brings us up to date, illustrating how much more has changed since then. Wolfe sorts out what is helpful in Mills' book and which of his predictions have not come to bear, laying out the radical changes in American capitalism, from intense global competition and the collapse of communism to rapid technological transformations and ever changing consumer tastes. The Power Elite has stimulated generations of readers to think about the kind of society they have and the kind of society they might want, and deserves to be read by every new generation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kn_OAuktbq4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When The Lamp Flickers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PV_8nQEACAAJ&dq=When+The+Lamp+Flickers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Joseph Cornell","description":"Describes the artistic career and major works of Joseph Cornell.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8rH-AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Essential+Joseph+Cornell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When God Was A Woman","description":"Here, archaeologically documented, is the story of the religion of the Goddess.

In recent years government regulators, hoping to remedy economic crisis by diverting capital from hidden channels back into taxable view, have undertaken sustained and serious efforts to force tax havens into compliance. In Tax Havens, Ronen Palan, Richard Murphy, and Christian Chavagneux provide an up-to-date evaluation of the role and function of tax havens in the global financial system-their history, inner workings, impact, extent, and enforcement. They make clear that while, individually, tax havens may appear insignificant, together they have a major impact on the global economy. Holding up to $13 trillion of personal wealth the equivalent of the annual U.S. Gross National Product and serving as the legal home of two million corporate entities and half of all international lending banks, tax havens also skew the distribution of globalization's costs and benefits to the detriment of developing economies. The first comprehensive account of these entities, this book challenges much of the conventional wisdom about tax havens. The authors reveal that, rather than operating at the margins of the world economy, tax havens are integral to it. More than simple conduits for tax avoidance and evasion, tax havens actually belong to the broad world of finance, to the business of managing the monetary resources of individuals, organizations, and countries. They have become among the most powerful instruments of globalization, one of the principal causes of global financial instability, and one of the large political issues of our times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2KZQabqIOkoC&dq=Tax+Havens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Truth About Alaska, the Golden Land of the Midnight Sun(The Land of Gold)","description":"An Alaskan Gold Mine: The Story of No. 9 Above is a notable and tragic story of the discovery of Alaska gold in 1898.

As a loyal subject to King George, Cresswell found himself often unhappy in America, detailing the turmoil and abuses often suffered by Loyalists in the colonies. Confining his travel mainly to the mid-Atlantic region, Cresswell not only had occasion to attend a slave gathering and observe what went on there, but also traded amongst many of the native tribes, including the Lenape, Tuscarora, Ottawa and Shawnee. Despite his ambivalence about returning to England, (toward the end of the book he moans, \\"\\"I wish to be at home and yet dread the thought of returning to my native Country a Beggar \\"\\" (P. 251)), life in the colonies becomes too much for this loyal subject and Cresswell's journal ends in 1777 with his return to England.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rRf_Ts98xFwC&dq=Journal+of+Nicholas+Cresswell,+1774-1777&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An outline of theosophy,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3uxdswEACAAJ&dq=An+outline+of+theosophy,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to prevent psychic blackmail;: The philosophy of psychoselfism: sensible selfishness versus senseless self-sacrifice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uUpYAAAAMAAJ&dq=How+to+prevent+psychic+blackmail%3B:+The+philosophy+of+psychoselfism:+sensible+selfishness+versus+senseless+self-sacrifice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early writings of Herbert W.

How has the Internet, a medium that thrives on control, been accepted as a medium of freedom? Why is freedom increasingly indistinguishable from paranoid control? In Control and Freedom, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun explores the current political and technological coupling of freedom with control by tracing the emergence of the Internet as a mass medium. The parallel (and paranoid) myths of the Internet as total freedom/total control, she says, stem from our reduction of political problems into technological ones. Drawing on the theories of Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault and analyzing such phenomena as Webcams and face-recognition technology, Chun argues that the relationship between control and freedom in networked contact is experienced and negotiated through sexuality and race. She traces the desire for cyberspace to cyberpunk fiction and maps the transformation of public/private into open/closed. Analyzing \\"pornocracy,\\" she contends that it was through cyberporn and the government's attempts to regulate it that the Internet became a marketplace of ideas and commodities. Chun describes the way Internet promoters conflated technological empowerment with racial empowerment and, through close examinations of William Gibson's Neuromancer and Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell, she analyzes the management of interactivity in narratives of cyberspace. The Internet's potential for democracy stems not from illusory promises of individual empowerment, Chun argues, but rather from the ways in which it exposes us to others (and to other machines) in ways we cannot control. Using fiber optic networks light coursing through glass tubes as metaphor and reality, Control and Freedom engages the rich philosophical tradition of light as a figure for knowledge, clarification, surveillance, and discipline, in order to argue that fiber-optic networks physically instantiate, and thus shatter, enlightenment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yOaNXCxt1vgC&dq=Control+and+Freedom:+Power+and+Paranoia+in+the+Age+of+Fiber+Optics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Math Presents More Geometry: Learning Geometry is Easy!

Central to that stance is naturalism--that is, they treat a philosophical theory of language as an empirical theory like any other and see people as nothing but complex parts of the physical world.

The promulgation of new government regulations places new and more stringent restrictions on the materials that may be used in energetic mixtures. These regulations now mandate numerous training programs, and initiate other actions, such as OSHA s Process Safety Management standard, intended to eliminate accidents and incidents. Unfortunately, the US lacks an organized, broad-range academic program to cover the science and use of energetic materials and educate the next generation of pyrotechnicians. Designed as a bridge to allow a smooth and confident transition for personnel coming from a chemistry background into the practical world of explosives, Chemistry of Pyrotechnics: Basic Principles and Theory, Second Edition emphasizes basic chemical principles alongside practical, hands-on knowledge in the preparation of energetic mixtures. It examines the interactions between and adaptations of pyrotechnics to changing technology in areas such as obscuration science and low-signature flame emission. Much more than a simple how-to guide, the book discusses chemical and pyrotechnic principles, components of high-energy mixtures, and elements of ignition, propagation, and sensitivity. It offers heat compositions, including ignition mixes, delays, thermites, and propellants and investigates the production of smoke and sound as well as light and color. Promoting the growth and expansion of pyrotechnics as a science, Chemistry of Pyrotechnics: Basic Principles and Theory, Second Edition provides practitioners with the ability to apply chemical principles and logic to energetic materials and thereby make the field as productive, useful, and safe as possible.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pxScgdDCQVUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'm Coming to Get You (Pied Piper)","description":"After eating all the planets in outer space, a horrible monster gets a big surprise when it comes to Earth and tries to capture a little boy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mHAbAQAAMAAJ&dq=I%27m+Coming+to+Get+You+(Pied+Piper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Have a Glass: A Modern Guide to Wine","description":"Halfaglass, aka James Nevison and Kenji Hodgson, was formed in response to the realization that no one was \\"talking wine\\" to twenty-somethings in a way that seemed relevant to their lifestyles.

Just as positive psychology focuses on exploring optimal individual psychological states rather than pathological ones, Positive Organizational Scholarship focuses attention on optimal organizational states --- the dynamics in organizations that lead to the development of human strength, foster resiliency in employees, make healing, restoration, and reconciliation possible, and cultivate extraordinary individual and organizational performance. While the concept of positive organizational scholarship encompasses the examination of typical and even dysfunctional patterns of behavior, it emphasizes positive deviance from expected patterns. Positive Organizational Scholarship examines the enablers, motivations, and effects associated with remarkably positive phenomena --- how they are facilitated, why they work, how they can be identified, and how researchers and managers can capitalize on them. The contributors do not adopt one particular theory or framework but draw from the full spectrum of organizational theories to understand, explain, and predict the occurrence, causes, and consequences of positivity. Positive Organizational Scholarship rigorously seeks to understand what represents the best of the human condition based on scholarly research and theory. This book invites organizational scholars to build upon and extend the positive organizational phenomena being examined. It provides the definitional, theoretical, and empirical foundations for what will become a cumulative body of enduring work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cumQYLiKCCcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyday Grace - Having Hope, Finding Forgiveness, And Making Miracles","description":"In this comforting,inspirational companion to the No.1 New York Times bestseller, A Return to Love, Marianne Williamson returns to her spiritual roots, writing on the art of nurturing a thriving soul in a harsh world.

Today this fierce battle remains high in our collective memories, not only for its terrors but for its indelible image of triumph: the raising of the flag on Mt. Suribachi. Much information exists about the Battle for Iwo Jima, but it is scattered and can be difficult to track down. This book draws the information together in two ways. It offers bibliographic listings to lead researchers to useful sources, and provides actual texts of documents related to the battle and its aftermath. Part One, \\"The Bibliography,\\" offers information on more than 800 books, magazines, official documents, audio-visual materials and online resources about the Battle of Iwo Jima. Each listing is annotated to assist researchers, historians, veterans and others seeking information. Part Two, \\"The Anthology,\\" offers the texts of hard-to-locate documents; a series of maps showing the day-by-day progression of the battle; and a selection of poetry inspired by the battle. Appendices provide details of the American chain of command and both the American and the Japanese orders of battle; describe some lingering mysteries about the Battle of Iwo Jima; and list Iwo Jima memorial sites around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZVKDBAAAQBAJ&dq=Return+to+Iwo+Jima+++50&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"EMERALD STORM","description":"In the fifth installment of master storyteller William Dietrich s bestselling adventure series, the swashbuckling, battle-scarred hero Ethan Gage must race from the slopes of the Alps to the sultry tropics of the Caribbean to pursue a mysterious Spanish treasure as the fate of England and of the world s first successful slave revolt hang desperately in the balance.

Habermas focuses on the liberal notion of the bourgeois public sphere as it emerged in Europe in the early modern period. He examines both the writings of political theorists, including Marx, Mill and de Tocqueville, and the specific institutions and social forms in which the public sphere was realized.

The great granite quarries of the North East are silent now, as are virtually all of the 100 granite yards that existed in Aberdeen around the year 1900.

In the heyday of the mid-nineteenth century, the granite men of the North East hewed this material from the bowels of the earth and used it to fashion the iconic structures that defined the age. It paved the streets and embankments of London. It was used to build bridges over the Thames. It was carved into monuments for kings and commoners not only in Britain but all over the world. None of it possible without the men that toiled in those quarries and yards.

Alan Wallace reasserts the power of shamatha and vipashyana, traditional Buddhist meditations, to clarify the mind's role in the natural world. Raising profound questions about human nature, free will, and experience versus dogma, Wallace challenges the claim that consciousness is nothing more than an emergent property of the brain with little relation to universal events. Rather, he maintains that the observer is essential to measuring quantum systems and that mental phenomena (however conceived) influence brain function and behavior. Wallace embarks on a two-part mission: to restore human nature and to transcend it. He begins by explaining the value of skepticism in Buddhism and science and the difficulty of merging their experiential methods of inquiry. Yet Wallace also proves that Buddhist views on human nature and the possibility of free will liberate us from the metaphysical constraints of scientific materialism. He then explores the radical empiricism inspired by William James and applies it to Indian Buddhist philosophy s four schools and the Great Perfection school of Tibetan Buddhism. Since Buddhism begins with the assertion that ignorance lies at the root of all suffering and that the path to freedom is reached through knowledge, Buddhist practice can be viewed as a progression from agnosticism (not knowing) to gnosticism (knowing), acquired through the maintenance of exceptional mental health, mindfulness, and introspection. Wallace discusses these topics in detail, identifying similarities and differences between scientific and Buddhist understanding, and he concludes with an explanation of shamatha and vipashyana and their potential for realizing the full nature, origins, and potential of consciousness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wMmrAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Connected+Discourses+of+the+Buddha:+A+New+Translation+of+the+Samyutta+Nikaya,+2+Vols.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Happiness, or The Teachings of Epicurus","description":"The brilliant writings of a highly influential Greek philosopher, with a foreword by Daniel Klein, author of Travels with Epicurus The teachings of Epicurus about life and death, religion and science, physical sensation, happiness, morality, and friendship attracted legions of adherents throughout the ancient Mediterranean world and deeply influenced later European thought.

Although philology departments are steadily disappearing from contemporary educational establishments, in this book Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht demonstrates that the problems, standards, and methods of philology remain as vital as ever. For two and a half millennia philologists have viewed themselves as the modest heirs and curators of their textual past's most glorious periods, collecting and editing text fragments, historicizing them and adding commentary, and ultimately teaching them to contemporary readers. Gumbrecht argues for a return to this tradition as an alternative to an often free-floating textual interpretation and to the more recent redefinition of literary studies as \\"cultural studies,\\" which risks a loss of intellectual focus. Such a return to philological core exercises, however, can become more than yet another movement of academic nostalgia only if it takes into account the hidden desire that has inspired philology since its Hellenistic beginnings: the desire to make the past present again by embodying it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Z2rdiQKU1ZYC&dq=The+Powers+of+Philology:+DYNAMICS+OF+TEXTUAL+SCHOLARSHIP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Junior Handling: The Complete Guide on How to Show Your Dog","description":"Stand! is the must-have guide to dog showing in the UK, for beginners and seasoned exhibitors alike.

To do it four times is incredible. To do it four times in five years and always on a Friday the 13th is the stuff of legend. Welcome to the world of Steven Russell. Con artist. Thief. Swindler. Embezzler. Hopeless romantic. A husband and father, Russell was a church organist, prosperous businessman, and onetime Boca Raton cop before turning to his life of crime. Arrested for a string of felonies, with a specialty in fraud, his real expertise turned out to be his uncanny ability to escape from jail. Between 1993 and 1998, he orchestrated a string of prison breaks that were as audacious as they were ingenious. Using whatever unlikely materials were at handa Magic Marker, a pay phone, a walkie-talkie, a pair of stolen bright red women's stretch pantsalong with an innate talent for analytical thinking and boundless quantities of sheer nerve, Russell again and again arranged his own \\"early releases\\" from jail. Unfortunately, for Russell, staying out of jail is another matter entirely. Over the years, it became increasingly clear that Russell's talent for escape is matched only by his knack for getting arrested. One thing always seems to trump Steven Russell's careful planning, cool head, and instinct for self-preservationlove. Russell cannot resist the urge to try and spring the great love of his lifea fellow inmate named Phillip Morris. In I Love You Phillip Morris, journalist Steve McVicker goes right to the heart of this improbable-but-true story of crime, punishment, and passion. Thanks to unprecedented and exclusive access to Russell, his family, and his friends, he retraces Russell's journey from small-town businessman to flamboyant white-collar criminal and jailhouse Houdini. It's the darkly comic tale of a man with a spectacular ability to manipulate almost everyone he meets, yet who is himself helpless in the face of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lmfSPQAACAAJ&dq=I+Love+You+Phillip+Morris&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a conservative","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nXXZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Confessions+of+a+conservative&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crime of Ruby McCollum","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H4ZQAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Crime+of+Ruby+McCollum&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stopping To Home","description":"In 1806, orphaned eleven-year-old Abigail and her little brother Seth find a home with the young Widow Chase in the seaport of Wiscasset, Maine, and help her discover a way to support them all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sUTMOCiZ-UIC&dq=Stopping+To+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flash MX 2004 ActionScript Bible","description":"Provides in-depth information to the more than one million Flash developers who want to take their animations to the next level using sophisticated interaction and data-driven content Flash ActionScript is an object-oriented scripting language used with Flash that allows the designer to control a movie in non-linear fashion, create sophisticated interactivity, control elements on the stage, collect and track input from the movie viewer, and exchange and manipulate data from external sources The most comprehensive Flash ActionScript guide available, cowritten by Robert Reinhardt, coauthor of Macromedia Flash MX 2004 Bible (0-7645-4303-2) Published to coincide with the release of Flash \\"X,\\" the newest version of this widely used Web development tool","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=IKT6eVeQnNYC&dq=Flash+MX+2004+ActionScript+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Outdoor Projects","description":"Techniques and materials, directions and advice for home outdoor projects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZHoIAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Book+of+Outdoor+Projects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE INVENTION OF THE WORLD","description":"The idea of \\"world religions\\" expresses a vague commitment to multiculturalism.

In this ambitious study, Tomoko Masuzawa examines the emergence of \\"world religions\\" in modern European thought. Devoting particular attention to the relation between the comparative study of language and the nascent science of religion, she demonstrates how new classifications of language and race caused Buddhism and Islam to gain special significance, as these religions came to be seen in opposing terms-Aryan on one hand and Semitic on the other. Masuzawa also explores the complex relation of \\"world religions\\" to Protestant theology, from the hierarchical ordering of religions typical of the Christian supremacists of the nineteenth century to the aspirations of early twentieth-century theologian Ernst Troeltsch, who embraced the pluralist logic of \\"world religions\\" and by so doing sought to reclaim the universalist destiny of European modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OMku6YC9VPwC&dq=THE+INVENTION+OF+THE+WORLD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seed Handbook: The Feminine Way to Create Business","description":"Today more than ever women want to start their own businesses but many of them lack the confidence, knowledge and skills to do so.

Fukushima's calligraphy is not merely didactic, a gilded vessel to make Zen doctrines more palatable. They are technically masterful, reflecting Fukushima's training in the calligraphic arts from an early age as well as his apprenticeship with Okada Roshi and his kaisho or \\"block\\" script, and Shibayama Roshi and his exquisite gyosho script. But like the beneficent force of Shibayama's calligraphy, from which he learned much, Fukushima's calligraphy is a quiet storm, a serene volcano, a compassionate and gentle eruption of the vast energy or ki of the Zen mind. The gentle forms of Fukushima's calligraphy are rife with the erupting force of mushin. This book reproduces twenty pieces of Fukushima's calligraphy, as well as a rare piece done by both Shibayama Roshi and Suzuki Sensei. Set against Fukushima's calligraphy, one can see in it all three generations of bridge builders of one of the most important lineages of dharma transmission from Japan to the United States. To complete things is a magnificent portrait of Bodhidharma (Japanese: Daruma), attributed to the incomparable Zen ink painter Sesshu Toyo (1420-1506). This volume also contains essays on Fukushima in particular and Zen calligraphy in general by some of the leading scholars in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GUhIAQAAIAAJ&dq=Zen+No+Sho:+The+Calligraphy+of+Fukushima+Keido+Roshi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating Leaderful Organizations: How to Bring Out Leadership in Everyone","description":"Filled with examples of progressive companies around the world, a guide to bringing out the leader in anyone presents a new model of leadership for today's lean, economical management strategies.

In life and on the screen, these were her public roles. Walker's excellent biography fills the gaps, giving insights into her private life-into what it must have been like to be Vivien Leigh. Walker (author of Garbo: A Portrait, CH, Mar '81; Dietrich, 1984; and Bette Davis: A Celebration, 1986) is a careful researcher who managed to win the confidence of the right people. His interview subjects include Vivien Leigh's only daughter, Suzanne Farrington; her first agent, John Glidden; and her last husband, Jack Merivale. Vivien is personal without being excessively gossipy, and informative without being pedantic. Walker's book should delight film-goers, theater-goers, and readers curious about prominent people. Leigh's achievements were many, but her personality had its darker side; even her 20 years as half of Britain's reigning theatrical couple \`\`the Oliviers'' took its toll on her physical and mental health. Amply supplied with photographs of the actress at all stages of her life, Vivien is an engaging book about an engaging figure. Undergraduates and general readers.- J.L.

Philip Leith meets all these objectives in this volume. The first four chapters provide a valuable introduction to computer concepts and methods of holding information, from the specific point of view of the practising lawyer or student.

The New Yorker In the midst of a long summer on Grayling Island, Maine, twenty-six-year-old Kelly Kelleher longs for something interesting to happen to her something that will make her finally feel some of what she imagines other people must feel when they watch the fireworks explode off the beach. So when Kelly meets The Senator at an exclusive party and he asks her to go back to a hotel room on the main island with him, she says yes. Even though the senator is old enough to be her father, even though he has perhaps been drinking too heavily to get behind the wheel, the danger of saying yes is an inevitable and even exciting part of the adventure Kelly is finally going to have. However, as The Senator s car whips around the island s roads and eventually crashes through a guardrail, it becomes clear to Kelly and the reader that this man embodies a wholly different and more sinister type of danger, one much larger and harder to contain than the horrible events that unfold as Kelly is left in the sinking car. Black Water is a chilling meditation on power, trust, and violation and a timeless classic from one of America s foremost storytellers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jIOCi31CmnkC&dq=Black+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Clue of the Whistling bagpipes: the Dana Girls Mystery Stories #41","description":"Includes Part 1, Number 2: Books and Pamphlets, Including Serials and Contributions to Periodicals July - December)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_x0hAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Catch More Fish Everytime: Your Success Guide to the Great Lakes & the Tributaries","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Qv2xPAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Catch+More+Fish+Everytime:+Your+Success+Guide+to+the+Great+Lakes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mountain Goat","description":"The American mountain goat is one of the most elusive and least familiar species of hoofed mammals in North America. Confined to the remote and rugged mountains of the western United States and Canada, these extraordinary mountaineers are seldom seen or encountered, even by those who patiently study them. Life on the Rocks offers an intimate portrayal of this remarkable animal through the eyes and lens of field biologist and photographer Bruce Smith. Color photographs and accounts of Smith's personal experiences living in Montana's Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area accompany descriptions of the American mountain goat's natural history. Smith explores their treacherous habitat, which spans the perilous cliffs and crags of the Rocky, Cascade, and Coast mountain ranges. The physical and behavioral adaptations of these alpine athletes enable them to survive a host of dangers, including six-month-long winters, scarce food sources, thunderous avalanches, social strife, and predators like wolves, bears, lions, wolverines, and eagles. Smith also details the challenges these animals face as their territory is threatened by expanding motorized access, industrial activities, and a warming climate. Life on the Rocks showcases the elegance and charm of this little-known creature, thriving in some of North America's harshest wilderness. Smith's volume will appeal to wildlife enthusiasts, wildland travelers, and conservationists interested in the future of the American mountain goat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gGHxAwAAQBAJ&dq=Mountain+Goat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life and Death (Elementary Go (Kiseido))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wOwOAAAACAAJ&dq=Life+and+Death+(Elementary+Go+(Kiseido))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organization Development at Work: Conversations on the Values, Applications, and Future of OD","description":"Organization Development at Work a title in The Practicing OD Series is a collection of conversations among leaders, practitioners, and educators in the organization development (OD) field.

The Rifle is an inspirational story and hero s journey of a 28-year-old U.S. Marine, Andrew Biggio, who returned home from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, full of questions about the price of war. He found answers from those who survived the costliest war of all -- WWII veterans. It began when Biggio bought a 1945 M1 Garand Rifle, the most common rifle used in WWII, to honor his great uncle, a U.S. Army soldier who died on the hills of the Italian countryside. When Biggio showed the gun to his neighbor, WWII veteran Corporal Joseph Drago, it unlocked memories Drago had kept unspoken for 50 years. On the spur of the moment, Biggio asked Drago to sign the rifle. Thus began this Marine s mission to find as many WWII veterans as he could, get their signatures on the rifle, and document their stories. For two years, Biggio traveled across the country to interview America s last-living WWII veterans. Each time he put the M1 Garand Rifle in their hands, their eyes lit up with memories triggered by holding the weapon that had been with them every step of the war. With each visit and every story told to Biggio, the veterans signed their names to the rifle. 96 signatures now cover that rifle, each a reminder of the price of war and the courage of our soldiers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0bsyEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+rifle+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All the Laws but One: Civil Liberties in Wartime","description":"In All the Laws but One, William H. Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, provides an insightful and fascinating account of the history of civil liberties during wartime and illuminates the cases where presidents have suspended the law in the name of national security. Abraham Lincoln, champion of freedom and the rights of man, suspended the writ of habeas corpus early in the Civil War--later in the war he also imposed limits upon freedom of speech and the press and demanded that political criminals be tried in military courts. During World War II, the government forced 100,000 U.S. residents of Japanese descent, including many citizens, into detainment camps. Through these and other incidents Chief Justice Rehnquist brilliantly probes the issues at stake in the balance between the national interest and personal freedoms. With All the Laws but One he significantly enlarges our understanding of how the Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution during past periods of national crisis--and draws guidelines for how it should do so in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mAJTrwOH4E8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Noah's Christmas inspiration","description":"Leona Dalrymple (Mrs. C.

It challenges revisionist readings of Jacobinism that dwell on its totalitarian potential or portray it as dangerously utopian. The mainstream Jacobin agenda emphasised 'fair shares' and equal opportunities for all in a private ownership market economy. It sought to achieve social justice without jeopardising human rights and tended thus to complement, rather than undermine, the liberal, individualist programme of the Revolution. The book stresses the relevance of the 'Enlightenment legacy', the close affinity between Girondins and Montagnards, the key role played by many lesser-known figures and the moral ascendancy of Robespierre. It reassesses the basic social and economic issues at stake in the Revolution, which cannot be understood solely in terms of political discourse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9gqLGoAsrxwC&dq=Fair+Shares+for+All:+Jacobin+Egalitarianism+in+Practice+(Past+and+Present+Publications)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Stress: Principles and Strategies for Health and Wellbeing","description":"Managing Stress, Seventh Edition, provides a comprehensive approach to stress management honoring the integration, balance, and harmony of mind, body, spirit, and emotions.

Homeland of the greatest conqueror of all time, Genghis Khan, vast tracts can be discovered on horse or camel, or in the comfort of a four-wheel drive. Written by Mongolian expert, Jane Blunden, this updated guide highlights its culture and customs, including the deel, the colourful national dress, herding rules and customs, Mongolian throat singing and Naadam, the annual celebration of wrestling, archery and horse-riding. For visitors keen to sample the unique pleasures of staying with nomads, she also explains how and where to experience the traditional lifestyle of a Mongolian ger. The guide offers tips on riding and biking tours, winter dog sledding and summer yoga camps and provides in-depth information on national parks and conservation. Wildlife tours and visits based around Buddhist temples are still Mongolia's strengths, along with the age old traditional herding culture and Nomadic lifestyle, to be seen throughout this vast country. This amazing lifestyle of nomads with their flocks of camels, sheep and cashmere goats herded on horseback, from the times of Genghis Khan, is disappearing fast as families become more settled. The capital Ulaanbaatar is undergoing major changes and offers visitors a taste of city life in contrast to the wide open spaces. The guide reviews new hotels and restaurants which are popping up as business is booming. Mongolia provides all the information you'll need to arrange an unforgettable stay with Mongolian nomads, enjoying the centuries-old lifestyle of a traditional ger.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ug9bBAAAQBAJ&dq=Mongolia:+The+Bradt+Travel+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Relativistic Gravitation","description":"This is an introductory textbook on applications of general relativity to astrophysics and cosmology. The aim is to provide graduate students with a toolkit for understanding astronomical phenomena that involve velocities close to that of light or intense gravitational fields. The approach taken is first to give the reader a thorough grounding in special relativity, with space-time the central concept, following which general relativity presents few conceptual difficulties. Examples of relativistic gravitation in action are drawn from the astrophysical domain. The book can be read on two levels: first as an introductory fast-track course, and then as a detailed course reinforced by problems which illuminate technical examples. The book has extensive links to the literature of relativistic astrophysics and cosmology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H9C3ySei6hAC&dq=An+Introduction+to+Relativistic+Gravitation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nicklaus by Design: Golf Course Strategy and Architecture","description":"Nicklaus, the greatest golfer in the history of the game, has been winning kudos for his visually striking layouts and challenging yet playable holes.

Companions know you for who you are, overlooking your flaws while celebrating your strengths. The companions attributes include appreciation, cheerfulness, dialogue, honesty, humility, and loyalty. Guides are catalysts of change. They are the doers and the visionaries who instill entire organizations with a sense of purpose. The guides attributes are courage, determination, experience, justice, knowledge, leadership, and vision. Honored Feathers of Wisdom provides practical leadership lessons from the Native American past.

O. Madden, Jr., began with the birth in 1758 of his great-great-grandmother Sarah Madden. She is one of the two ancestors to whom he dedicates this book. Sarah's mother, Mary Madden, contributed the surname that endured. Mary Madden was an Irishwoman who had probably immigrated as a servant a few years before Sarah's birth. Although the myths of Virginia would make every colonial who was white into an aristocrat, Mary Madden, like most eighteenth-century Virginians, was indigent. But unlike many others, she was free. Of Sarah Madden's father, nothing is known. The legal definition of mixed-race children of blacks and whites had been settled in 1662, when the Virginia legislature enacted laws prohibiting interracial marriages and declaring that children followed the status of their mother. Such legislation made children like Sarah Madden free, but illegitimate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9nqcjV-gSakC&dq=We+Were+Always+Free:+The+Maddens+of+Culpeper+County,+Virginia,+a+200-Year+Family+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Phunny Phonics","description":"\\"... comprehensive teaching guide to help your students learn to blend 3 and 4-letter short vowel words, along with the five other common sounds- ch, sh, ee, oo and _y.\\" This book supports the first set of Funny Photo Phonics books.
