Since Marilyn Monroe died among suspicious circumstances on the night of August 4, 1962, there have been queries and theories, allegations and investigations, but no definitive evidence about precisely what happened and who was involved . . . until now. In The Murder of Marilyn Monroe: Case Closed, renowned MM expert Jay Margolis and New York Times bestselling author Richard Buskin finally lay to rest more than fifty years of wild speculation and misguided assertions by actually naming, for the first time, the screen goddess s killer while utilizing the testimony of eye-witnesses to exactly what took place inside her house on Fifth Helena Drive in Los Angeles  Brentwood neighborhood. Implicating Bobby Kennedy in the commission of Marilyn s murder, this is the first book to name the LAPD officers who accompanied the US Attorney General to her home, provide details about how the Kennedys used bribes to silence one of the ambulance drivers, and specify how the subsequent cover-up was aided by a noted pathologist s outrageous lies. This blockbuster volume blows the lid off the world s most notorious and talked-about celebrity death, and in the process exposes not only the truth about an iconic star s tragic final hours, but also how a legendary American politician used powerful resources to protect what many still perceive as his untarnished reputation. Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

When, in May 1969, the body of David Oluwale was found in the River Aire near Leeds, few questions were asked about the circumstances of his death. Oluwale was homeless and had spent time in a psychiatric hospital, an immigrant from Nigeria who was trapped in a system that had failed him miserably. Eighteen months later a lengthy campaign of harassment by two Leeds policemen was uncovered - Oluwale became national news in Britain, and a symbol for its black community. This extraordinary book draws on original archival material only recently released to revisit one of the most chilling crimes in British history, and at the same time raises questions as relevant today as they were at the end of the sixties.

However, 'development' has always been a contested idea. While often presented as a positive process to improve people's lives, the potential negative dimensions of 'development' on people and environments must also be recognised. Theories and Practices of Development provides a clear and user-friendly introduction to the complex debates around how development has been understood and achieved. The third edition has been fully updated and expanded to reflect global political and economic shifts, as well as new approaches to development. There is a new chapter on politics and development, encompassing debates around development and democracy, civil society organisations, and human rights. Sections on diversity and development have been expanded and the book considers the future of development in the era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The book deals with the evolution of development ideas and policies, focusing on economic, political, social, environmental and spatial dimensions. It highlights how development cannot be considered as a neutral concept, but is entwined with inequalities in power at local, as well as national and global scales. The use of boxed examples, tables and illustrations helps students understand complex theoretical ideas and also demonstrates how development theories are put into practice in the real world. Each chapter ends with a summary section, discussion topics, suggestions for further reading and website resources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XyTJDAEACAAJ&dq=Theories+and+Practices+of+Development+(Routledge+Perspectives+on+Development)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Basic Business Mathematics","description":"Tough Test Questions?

Influenced by the mysterious place gingerbread holds in classic children's stories, beloved novelist Helen Oyeyemi invites readers into a delightful tale of a surprising family legacy, in which the inheritance is a recipe. Perdita Lee may appear to be your average British schoolgirl; Harriet Lee may seem just a working mother trying to penetrate the school social hierarchy; but there are signs that they might not be as normal as they think they are. For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor walk-up apartment with some surprisingly verbal vegetation. And then there's the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it's very popular in Druh strana, the far-away (or, according to many sources, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee's early youth. The world's truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread, however, is Harriet's charismatic childhood friend Gretel Kercheval  a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met. Decades later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother's long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet's story. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value. Endlessly surprising and satisfying, written with Helen Oyeyemi's inimitable style and imagination, it is a true feast for the reader.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DJFgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens,: His tragedy and triumph","description":"A scholarly biography of the author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2p_yAAAAMAAJ&dq=Charles+Dickens,:+His+tragedy+and+triumph&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossing Ocean Parkway","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pearls are a Nuisance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5aPKzgEACAAJ&dq=Pearls+are+a+Nuisance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everything She Thought She Wanted","description":"Elizabeth Buchan s beloved bestsellers, Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman and The Good Wife Strikes Back, have made her an icon of upmarket women s fiction.

He was also--as James Lord persuasively argued in Giacometti: A Biography--a heroic figure whose vocation sustained him through a life of crippling anxiety and erotic guilt. Almost twenty years after it first appeared, Giacometti has attained the status of a classic, one of the most candid and complete biographies of an artist in our time. In Mythic Giacometti, Lord reveals the hidden \\"blueprint\\" of that work: a daringly literal, visionary interpretation of the myth of Oedipus as it affected the conduct and outcome of Giacometti's life. The result is a case study both in the development of an artist and in the writing of biography. Lord concentrates on the private totems of Giacometti's life-family legend, childhood memory, illness and injury, crucial sexual encounters, intimations of mortality-that amounted, in Lord's view, to signs of a tragic destiny directly linked to the central tragedy of Western literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1okbMYwm4lUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Put My Life on Fast-Forward?: How to Slow Down and Start Living Again","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Flower in the Garden: My Cloth Book (My Cloth Books)","description":"Open out the soft pages of this beautiful organic cloth book and meet Bear, Elephant, Toucan, and Lion.

Through the extensive use of pseudocode, the book illustrates the actual implementation of Windows functions, showing in detail what happens when a Windows program executes. The topics include a walk through a typical Windows application, memory management, the creation and destruction of a program, dynamic linking, the Windows-DOS interface, the scheduler, the messaging system, resource management, and GDI basics.

The ancient regime running the parish covertly demands that she prove herself as a leader. However, her blunt manner, honed by years as an army pilot, is meeting with a chilly reception from some members of her congregation and Chief of Police Russ Van Alystyne, in particular, doesn't know what to make of her, or how to address \\"a lady priest\\" for that matter. The last thing she needs is trouble, but that is exactly what she finds. When a newborn baby is abandoned on the church stairs and a young mother is brutally murdered, Clare has to pick her way through the secrets and silence that shadow that town like the ever-present Adirondack mountains. As the days dwindle down and the attraction between the avowed priest and the married police chief grows, Clare will need all her faith, tenacity, and courage to stand fast against a killer's icy heart. In the Bleak Midwinter is one of the most outstanding Malice Domestic winners the contest has seen.

Booklist (starred review) With humor and opinions aplenty, a woman embarks on an unconventional quest to see if she is meant to be a nun. Just as Jane Christmas decides to enter a convent in mid-life to find out whether she is  nun material,  her long-term partner Colin, suddenly springs a marriage proposal on her. Determined not to let her monastic dreams be sidelined, Christmas puts her engagement on hold and embarks on an extraordinary year-long adventure to four convents one in Canada and three in the UK. In these communities of cloistered nuns and monks, she shares and at times chafes and rails against the silent, simple existence she has sought all of her life. Christmas takes this spiritual quest seriously, but her story is full of the candid insights, humorous social faux pas, profane outbursts, and epiphanies that make her books so relatable and popular. And Then There Were Nuns offers a seldom-seen look inside modern cloistered life, and it is sure to ruffle more than a few starched collars among the ecclesiastical set.  A lovely, heartfelt tale. Get thee to a bookstore and buy it.   A. J. Jacobs, New York Times bestselling author of The Year of Living Biblically  In fluid and often playful prose, she introduces women and men (she spent a week at a monastery on the Isle of Wight) who have devoted their lives to prayer, including a skydiving 90-year-old nun.

As a youngster, he proudly helped his family bellwether the Civil War and rebirth of the New South. By the early 1900s, he was a prosperous farmer and landowner. Time passed quickly, and too soon he was an old man. Join Grandpa and feel the biting north wind as he shuffled onto the front porch, cupped his hands around his mouth, and shouted, \\"It's hog-killing day!\\" Watch the bustling families rush toward the big house to slaughter enough hogs to carry them through the winter. Summer finally arrived and brought old-time gospel singing and preaching to their country church on the hill. Mama rose early on Sunday morning and filled her basket with fried chicken, biscuits, baked sweet potatoes, and fried apple pies. After preaching there was going to be another dinner-on-the-ground. Everyone was excited. Without a doubt, those were the good years. But all that changed. Walk down the dismal road with the Burrell family as they helplessly watched the reckless Roaring Twenties and Great Depression bring a flourishing economy and their comfortable lifestyle to a grinding halt. Feel Grandpa's pain and humiliation when the bank called in his Deed-of-Trust, and he was forced to sell his last 640-acre farm and home for a few dollars. Sit for awhile and listen to his grandson, Cecil Allen Burrell, The Man Himself, as his thought-provoking stories detail how they all survived those disastrous years. With their eyes on the future, John Harrison's children and grandchildren navigated their way back into prosperity and eventually reclaimed their part of the American dream & the same dream brought to America by their Great3-Grandfather, Dr. Jean-Baptiste Elzear Burel in 1778.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kpV0QkMHKWUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Divided We Stand: How Al Gore Beat George Bush and Lost the Presidency","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Journal For Healing: Writing Through Pain and Illness.","description":"A journal for people facing life-threatening illnesses is designed to help patients address the range of related emotions and includes sections for recording important moments and guidelines for writing to loved ones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j44tONctQsgC&dq=A+Journal+For+Healing:+Writing+Through+Pain+and+Illness.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SoulShaping","description":"Soulshaping is the inspiring memoir of an archetypal \\"male warrior\\"a trial lawyerwho struggled to find his heart and a more authentic, soulful path.

They may represent current times with some level of reality or shape their settings to suit an agenda. There are audiences for both realism and escapism in the mystery novel. It is interesting, however, to compare the fictional world of the mystery sleuth with the world in which readers live. Of course, mystery readers do not share one simplistic world. They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read. They may choose a book because it has a familiar background or because it takes them to places they long to visit. Readers may be rich or poor; young or old; conservative or liberal. So are the heroines. What incredible choices there are today in mystery series! This three-volume encyclopedia of women characters in the mystery novel is like a gigantic menu. Like a menu, the descriptions of the items that are provided are subjective. Volume 3 of Mystery Women as currently updated adds an additional 42 sleuths to the 500 plus who were covered in the initial Volume 3. These are more recently discovered sleuths who were introduced during the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999. This more than doubles the number of sleuths introduced in the 1980s (298 of whom were covered in Volume 2) and easily exceeded the 347 series (and some outstanding individuals) described in Volume 1, which covered a 130-year period from 1860-1979.

Bush have in common? As Paul Lewis shows in Cracking Up, they are all among the ranks of joke tellers who aim to do much more than simply amuse. Exploring topics that range from the sadistic mockery of Abu Ghraib prison guards to New Age platitudes about the healing power of laughter, from jokes used to ridicule the possibility of global climate change to the heartwarming performances of hospital clowns, Lewis demonstrates that over the past thirty years American humor has become increasingly purposeful and embattled. Navigating this contentious world of controversial, manipulative, and disturbing laughter, Cracking Up argues that the good news about American humor in our time that it is delightful, relaxing, and distracting is also the bad news. In a culture that both enjoys and quarrels about jokes, humor expresses our most nurturing and hurtful impulses, informs and misinforms us, and exposes as well as covers up the shortcomings of our leaders. Wondering what s so funny about a culture determined to laugh at problems it prefers not to face, Lewis reveals connections between such seemingly unrelated jokers as Norman Cousins, Hannibal Lecter, Rush Limbaugh, Garry Trudeau, Jay Leno, Ronald Reagan, Beavis and Butt-Head, and Bill Clinton. The result is a surprising, alarming, and at times hilarious argument that will appeal to anyone interested in the ways humor is changing our cultural and political landscapes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yl8RJAbuc-kC&dq=Cracking+Up:+American+Humor+in+a+Time+of+Conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not a Little Monkey","description":"Five little monkeys sitting in a tree discover, one by one, that it is unwise to tease Mr. Crocodile.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NhCTcCypt9IC&dq=Not+a+Little+Monkey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A home geography of New York city,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ieoYAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BEAR FACTS,#3 SEASO/","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H6QIEBzfTMkC&dq=BEAR+FACTS,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Navajo Sunrise (Harlequin Historical, No. 608)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vaJYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Navajo+Sunrise+(Harlequin+Historical,+No.+608)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's Dust: A Modern Asian Journey","description":"The author relates his impressions of his travels through Burma, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea and Japan","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SaOpQgAACAAJ&dq=God%27s+Dust:+A+Modern+Asian+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Understructure of Writing for Film & Television","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Animals and plants of the Cenozoic era;: Some aspects of the faunal and floral history of the last sixty million years","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B_27ji7m_JgC&dq=Animals+and+plants+of+the+Cenozoic+era%3B:+Some+aspects+of+the+faunal+and+floral+history+of+the+last+sixty+million+years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discourse on method, Optics, Geometry, and Meteorology (The Library of liberal arts)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wz0PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Discourse+on+method,+Optics,+Geometry,+and+Meteorology+(The+Library+of+liberal+arts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amazing Laws of Cosmic Mind Power","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Handbook of Parallel Computing and Statistics (Statistics: A Series of Textbooks and Monographs)","description":"Technological improvements continue to push back the frontier of processor speed in modern computers.

The Wealth of Nations provides the perfect basis for studying the international transmission of economic ideas as it is generally considered to be the foundation of modern political economy, and still continues to be read after more than two centuries. Its appeal crosses national, cultural, and ideological boundaries -- countries investigated here range from China to Sweden -- and its enduring popularity is indicated by its status as the most translated economics book in history. Adam Smith Across Nations includes numerous sections which will of invaluable assistance to any Smith researcher. As well as presenting reviews and analysis from each country from the 18th century to the present day, an appendix lists editions of The Wealth of Nations in 18 languages, enabling the reader to understand the speed and number of translations. Most importantly, an introductory overview synthesises current research on the economic ideological context in the individual countries when The Wealth of Nations was introduced, the motives behind its introduction, its immediate reception, and the nature of the objections to Smith's doctrines. Professor Lai concludes that Smith's impact outside English-speaking country was predominantly limited to the realm of ideas: few of his policy recommendations were put into practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hpoKDOoJ9JIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eat Mangoes Naked: Finding Pleasure Everywhere (and dancing with the Pits)","description":"This book is your traveling pleasure companion.

Why does politics no longer excite many--of not most Americans? Michael McGerr attributes the decline in voting in the American North to the transformation of political style after the Civil War. The Decline of Popular Politics vividly recreates a vanished world of democratic ritual and charts its disappearance in the rapid change of industrial society. A century ago, political campaigns meant torchlight parades, spectacular pageants staged by opposing parties, and crowds of citizens attired in military dress or proudly displaying their crafts at well-attended rallies. The intense partisanship of presidential campaigns and party newspapers made political choice easy for people from all walks of life. In the late 1860s and 1870s, however, the rise of liberalism led to a rejection of partisanship by the press and a move towards \\"educational,\\" rather than spectacular, electioneering. This style then lost out at the turn of the century to the sensational journalism of Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst, and the \\"advertised\\" campaigning of Mark Hanna and other politicians. McGerr shows how these new developments made it increasingly difficult for many Northerners to link their political impulses with political action. By the 1920s, Northern politics resembled our own public life today. A vital democratic culture had yielded to advertised campaigns, an emphasis on personalities rather than issues or partisanship, and low voter turnout.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QcnQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Small Worlds","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8q5cDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Remains of an Altar (SIGNED)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2f2alQEACAAJ&dq=The+Remains+of+an+Altar+(SIGNED)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When adoption fails","description":"A New York Times Notable Book The shocking truth about postwar adoption in America, told through the bittersweet story of one teenager, the son she was forced to relinquish, and their search to find each other. During the Baby Boom in 1960s America, women were encouraged to stay home and raise large families, but sex and childbirth were taboo subjects. Premarital sex was common, but birth control was hard to get and abortion was illegal. In 1961, sixteen-year-old Margaret Erle fell in love and became pregnant. Her enraged family sent her to a maternity home, and after she gave birth, she wasn't even allowed her to hold her own son. Social workers threatened her with jail until she signed away her parental rights. Her son vanished, his whereabouts and new identity known only to an adoption agency that would never share the slightest detail about his fate. Claiming to be acting in the best interests of all, the adoption business was founded on secrecy and lies. American Baby lays out how a lucrative and exploitative industry removed children from their birth mothers and placed them with hopeful families, fabricating stories about infants' origins and destinations, then closing the door firmly between the parties forever. Adoption agencies and other organizations that purported to help pregnant women struck unethical deals with doctors and researchers for pseudoscientific \\"assessments,\\" and shamed millions of women into surrendering their children. Gabrielle Glaser dramatically demonstrates the power of the expectations and institutions that Margaret faced. Margaret went on to marry and raise a large family with David's father, but she never stopped longing for and worrying about her firstborn. She didn't know he spent the first years of his life living just a few blocks away from her; as he grew, he wondered about where he came from and why he was given up. Their tale--one they share with millions of Americans--is one of loss, love, and the search for identity. Adoption's closed records are being legally challenged in states nationwide. Open adoption is the rule today, but the identities of many who were adopted or who surrendered a child in the postwar decades are locked in sealed files. American Baby illuminates a dark time in our history and shows a path to reunion that can help heal the wounds inflicted by years of shame and secrecy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8qhPEAAAQBAJ&dq=When+adoption+fails&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yin Fire","description":"Who You Are at the Most Fundamental Level Being the most important reference point for BaZi analysis, The Day Master represents the true essence of your character and personality traits, and signifies your qualities, quirks, strengths and weaknesses.

This hiatus in his work is often dismissed as a consequence of personal disillusionment, and studies of Swift commonly move from 1714 to 1724 with barely a mention of his activities in that decade. This examination demonstrates a consistency of purpose on Swift's part, and uses his continuous dedication to the preservation and promotion of the privileges of the Church of Ireland to examine that fissure within contemporary Irish society. The unpublished, overlooked, and otherwise neglected writings of Swift, studied in the light of contemporary political and economic events in England and Ireland, reveal a politically astute observer and wise, if wary, commentator on events.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qlpbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Jonathan+Swift+and+the+Church+of+Ireland,+1710-1724&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Islam Debate","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Almost Perfect","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Left Behind Collection I boxed set: Vol. 1-4 (Vols 1-4)","description":"This collection includes four soft cover editions of the bestselling \\"Left Behind\\" series.

Despite the proven efficacy and safety of this standard treatment in psychiatry, its availability is variable. Part of this disparity in access is related to misunderstanding by laypersons regarding the treatment and its potential adverse effects. Adequate education and training of psychiatrists and their support staff are essential to ensuring patients' access to this vital treatment tool. The authors of Clinical Manual of Electroconvulsive Therapy offer this expansive yet reader-friendly volume to help psychiatrists successfully incorporate ECT into their clinical practices. It is also a valuable resource for medical students and psychiatric residents, as well as experienced clinicians and researchers. The book updates the 1985 original and 1998 second edition of Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Programmed Text, and provides readers with a scheduled approach to understanding the fundamental concepts of ECT while offering practical guidance for establishing and maintaining an ECT program. Topics include the history of ECT, indications for use, patient referral and evaluation, the basics of ECT, clinical applications, anesthetics and other medications, seizure monitoring and management, ictal motor and cardiovascular response, adverse effects, and maintenance ECT. Included are detailed descriptions of recent advances including ultra-brief pulse ECT, oxygenation, muscle relaxation, and other modifications that have made this very effective treatment much safer and more acceptable to patients. Currently, it is estimated that more than 100,000 people receive ECT treatments each year in the U.S. Indications for use of ECT are for mood disorders such as major depressive disorder and mania, and thought disorders including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Indications for use in other psychiatric disorders and general medical disorders such as Parkinson's disease, which appears to respond especially well to ECT, are reviewed as well. This highly-readable manual is a must-have for the library of any clinician interested in or currently practicing ECT: Provides background information on the origins of psychiatric treatments preceding ECT, including efforts using hydrotherapy and insulin comas Includes an algorithm for the management of ECT seizure adequacy Discusses contraindications as well as the potential adverse effects of ECT, including cognitive changes and cardiovascular complications Provides specific information about ECT device manufacturers, reprintable patient information sheets, and a written informed consent form This clinical manual comprehensively explores and explains the available knowledge regarding ECT -- based on extensive research over the past 70 years -- in order to help potential ECT clinicians make informed choices about the development and management of their ECT program.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mdZgigRi2OUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nine Dayak nights (A Galaxy book.

The Journal Of Callie Wade invites us into a world long vanished, brought to life once more in the pages of a young pioneer woman's diary. April 12, 1859: \\"What you can't duck, you best welcome.\\" That's what Mama used to always say, anyway....Even though it was in me to fight going West, I couldn't; there's a light in Pa's eyes, a kind of hope that our Rose will find health and I see it in Jack's eyes, too. As wild and reckless as my brother can be, I know he dreams of better. When I look into Quinn's eyes I feel my own dreams, too...and the love. But everything is so unsure on the trail. Sitting here, staring at the scattered campfires of the train, I can almost hear the prayers to make it through another dust-choked mile, over another river, another birth...another death. Maybe Pa is right, maybe we'll all have a new chance at life in the West. But at what price? From bitter hardships to moments of shining joy, from unexpected friendships to Callie's blossoming love for Irishman Quinn McGregor, The Journal Of Callie Wade is a chronicle of courage and faith, an inspiring tale of hope and endurance to treasure for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wguNlYzNPQUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"True Blue","description":"A mysterious high-profile homicide in the nation's capital collides with the dark side of national security in David Baldacci's new, heart-stopping thriller.

O'Brien endures because he was a remarkable writer. Remarkable indeed He had a way of blending of hard fact with almost-fanciful fantasy, juxtaposing technology and mysticism, creating convincing and scientific settings that play against the otherworldly romance. For all the weird fancifulness -- these days O'Brien is read mostly as a successor to Poe -- his work has qualities we now associate with science fiction: O'Brien clearly researched the field of microscopy before he wrote _The Diamond Lens_; it reads in places like hard SF.

Forming a distinct and commercially successful genre that in turn inspired the military and nautical novels that flourished in the 1830s, military memoirs profoundly shaped nineteenth-century British culture's understanding of war as Romantic adventure, establishing images of the nation's middle-class soldier heroes that would be of enduring significance through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As Ramsey shows, the military memoir achieved widespread acclaim and commercial success among the reading public of the late Romantic era. Ramsey assesses their influence in relation to Romantic culture's wider understanding of war writing, autobiography, and authorship and to the shifting relationships between the individual, the soldier, and the nation. The memoirs, Ramsey argues, participated in a sentimental response to the period's wars by transforming earlier, impersonal traditions of military memoirs into stories of the soldier's personal suffering. While the focus on suffering established in part a lasting strand of anti-war writing in memoirs by private soldiers, such stories also helped to foster a sympathetic bond between the soldier and the civilian that played an important role in developing ideas of a national war and functioned as a central component in a national commemoration of war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WJ2oDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"German in 30 Days","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RfY4lQEACAAJ&dq=German+in+30+Days&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 4th King","description":"Once upon a time, three kings came out of a distant land and followed a star to a little-known town across the desert.

Through her children's television show, which reaches millions of people in Latin America and the United States, this blond sex symbol has attained extraordinary cultural authority. Reaching far beyond younger audiences, Xuxa's show informs the culture at large about gender relations, racial democracy, and idealized beauty. Backed by Brazil's TV Globo, the fourth-largest commercial network in the world, Xuxa has built an empire. Amelia Simoson's colorful portrayal is the first book to explore how Xuxa's representation of femininity, her privileging of a white ideal of beauty, and her promotional approach to culture perpetuate inequality on an unprecedented scale. Simpson's thoughtful analysis exposes the complicity of a mass audience eager to celebrate Xuxa's deeply compromised representations of gender, race, and modernity. Xuxa also explores the meaning behind the myth--Xuxa's long-term relationship with Brazil's soccer idol, Pel , and the near-worship of her atypical blond, blue-eyed appearance by Brazil's population. As the author examines Xuxa's suggestive style juxtaposed with juvenile entertainment, and the phenomenon of Xuxa-look-alike teenaged paquitas, she unfold the symbolic territory of blond sex symbols worldwide. \\"Simpson has brought the facts and persona of Xuxa together in this well-documented, well-written analysis of the Brazilian superstar. She touches bases on gender, race, and changing patterns in Brazil. Xuxa is rich with information, laced with insight about the methods, practices and abuses that abound with the marketing of a personality and its products, and the effect of TV on all who watch it, especially the children.\\" --News from Brazil","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=elBzEAAAQBAJ&dq=Xuxa:+The+Mega-Marketing+of+Gender,+Race,+and+Modernity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hold 'em Poker","description":"Texas Hold 'em is not an easy game to play well.

This account of Mead's public life describes his key role in creating water policy and overseeing reclamation projects. His career spanned the history of irrigation from the first corporate ditch enterprises in Colorado in the 1880s through the construction of Hoover Dam a half-century later. In all his endeavors, whether serving as state engineer in Wyoming, investigating irrigation use for the Department of Agriculture, developing model rural communities in Australia and California, of administering the Bureau of Reclamation, Mead always sought to give the benefits of water to small farmers and average citizens.

Drawing on a wide range of sources, most notably oral narratives recorded in the 1930s, this rich account shows that African Americans demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the role clothing played in demarcating age, sex, status, work, recreation, as well as special secular and sacred events. Testimonies offer proof of African Americans' vast technical skills in producing cloth and clothing, which served both as a fundamental reflection of the peoples' Afrocentric craftsmanship and aesthetic sensibilities, and as a reaction to their particular place in American society. Previous work on clothing in this period has tended to focus on white viewpoints, and as a consequence the dress worn by the enslaved has generally been seen as a static standard imposed by white overlords. This excellent study departs from conventional interpretations to show that the clothing of the enslaved changed over time, served multiple functions and represented customs and attitudes which evolved distinctly from within African American communities. In short, it represents a vital contribution to African American studies, as well as to dress and textile history, and cultural and folklore studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Un3BwAEACAAJ&dq=%27New+Raiments+of+Self%27:+African+American+Clothing+in+the+Antebellum+South+(Dress,+Body,+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God of Hellfire","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Textile Structure and Analysis: A Home Study Course in Twelve Lessons (Shuttle Craft Guild Monograph 18)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CCshAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dowsing for Beginners: How to Find Water, Wealth and Lost Objects (For Beginners (Llewellyn's))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A HISTORY OF EUROPE VOL 1 : FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TO 1713.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3wF3OwAACAAJ&dq=A+HISTORY+OF+EUROPE+VOL+1+:+FROM+THE+EARLIEST+TIMES+TO+1713.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern Lives","description":"In this acclaimed book, Torgovnick explores the obsessions, fears, and longings that have produced Western views of the primitive.

The central image of This Living Mirror is Clare of Assisi's journey to God, a journey which begins with her flight from her family home followed by her consecration by St Francis. Clare, says author Sister Frances Teresa, is given to us as a compass, pointing always to God. Clare lays down the guidelines for us so that we, too, can find our way from the known to the unknown, from brokenness to the One, from loneliness to community.An important part of Clare's journey involved the obstacles and difficulties she encountered. Clare experienced the violent hostility of her own family, the acute pain of bereavement when Francis died, continual ill health, and constant pressure from Church authorities to abandon God's call. In all of this, Clare has remained a noble example in how to live in the pain of our human condition, but in peace and even, on a good day, joy.This Living Mirror reflects on Clare's life and her teachings about community, on the early Franciscan dream of a world worshipping God together, and finally on Clare's most important relationships: with Francis, with Christ, and finally with Sister Death. Sister Frances Teresa draws out the inner heart of what Clare has to say to us, writing, \\"Not for nothing did her contemporaries equate her with light itself. We live, at the moment, in quite dark days; may she shine for us, as she shone for them, 'giving a clear light in the house of the Lord.'\\" Sister Frances Teresa Downing, OSC is a member of the Community of Poor Clares at Arundel, and is currently part of a small community on the edge of a Council estate in East Sussex. She is author of the highly acclaimed Living the Incarnation: Praying with Francis and Clare of Assisi.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Xp7MwEACAAJ&dq=This+Living+Mirror:+Reflections+on+Clare+of+Assisi&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The mother church: A history of the building of the original edifice of the First church of Christ, scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8IEUAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Concrete River","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Social Work Graduate School Applicant's Handbook: The Complete Guide To Selecting and Applying to MSW Programs","description":"Written by a former social work admissions director at a top-ranking school of social work, this book helps master of social work (MSW) applicants improve their graduate school applications and decide which school of social work is right for them.

Twenty years after its original publication, and now with a new Foreword by the author, Arrows of Rain remains a vital exploration of the importance of story in opposition to corruption and the steep cost of speaking truth to power.  A story that must be told never forgives silence.  In the country of Madia (based in part on Ndibe s native Nigeria) a young sex worker runs into the sea and drowns. The last man who spoke to her, the  madman  Bukuru, is asked to account for her last moments. When his testimony implicates the Madian armed forces, Bukuru is arrested and charged with her death. At the first day of trial, Bukuru, acting as his own attorney, counters these charges with allegations of his own, speaking not only of government complicity in a series of violent assaults and killings, but telling the court that the president of Madia himself is guilty of rape and murder. The incident is hushed up, and Bukuru is sent back to prison, where he will likely meet his end. But a young journalist manages to visit him, and together they journey through decades of history that illuminate Bukuru s life, and that of the entire nation. A brave and powerful work of fiction, Arrows of Rain continues to resonate as a necessary morality tale and a brilliant dramatization of the complex factors behind the near-collapse of a nation from one of the most exciting novelists writing today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oJh0AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Know And Tell The Gospel: A Down-to-Earth Guide to Sharing Your Faith","description":"Encouragement, biblical teaching and practical information about how to share your faith with others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MStdSQAACAAJ&dq=Know+And+Tell+The+Gospel:+A+Down-to-Earth+Guide+to+Sharing+Your+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lieutenant America and Miss Apple Pie","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Best of Ed Zern","description":"This rich, full treasury of the best writings of America's finest outdoor humorist includes selections from Ed Zern's previous books, many of his memorable Nash automobile ads, and various short gems; such as his delicious review of Lady Chatterley's Lover (found wanting because there is too little practical information on the life of a rural gamekeeper).

If you re single and searching, there s no end to other people s explanations, excuses, and criticism explaining why you haven t found a partner:  You re too picky.

Smart, ambitious women always have a harder time finding mates.   You have low self-esteem. You can t love someone else until you ve learned to love yourself.   You re too needy.

In just eighteen months he sold more than one million pages of classified material to Israel. No other spy in U.S. history has stolen so many secrets, so highly classified, in such a short period of time. Author Ronald Olive was in charge of counterintelligence in the Washington office of the Naval Investigative Service that investigated Pollard and garnered the confession that led to his arrest in 1985 and eventual life sentence. His book reveals details of Pollard's confession, his interaction with the author when suspicion was mounting, and countless other details never before made public. Olive points to mistaken assumptions and leadership failures that allowed Pollard to ransack America's defense intelligence long after he should have been caught.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MDZlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Late Summer Flowers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Help Wanted: Short Stories about Young People Working","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of Schooldays","description":"\`School', wrote Henry Green, \`is no odder than the world outside, only more concentrated.' It is also an experience that everyone has to undergo, and many people have left accounts of their schooldays inspired either by repugnance or regret. The old school, whether you compare it to a Fasciststate (as W.H. Auden famously did), a hothouse, a prison, or a place of lost content, remains with you for the rest of your life. Drawing on fiction, memoirs, autobiography, poetry, and letters Patricia Craig presents an enthralling selection of attitudes to schools and schooling.All manner of institutions are described, from village schools to state comprehensives, charity schools, public schools, private schools and grammar schools, with some (usually) fond reminiscences of primary schools for good measure. But the emphasis is on individual experience - on the playingfield, in the classroom, making friends and enemies, encountering inspiring or eccentric schoolmasters. Pupils and teachers have their say, Miss Jean Brodie alongside Dr Arnold, Winston Churchill rubbing shoulders with Nicholas Nickleby. Through it all run the anarchic exploits of the heroes andheroines of the school story - Billy Bunter and the Greyfriars mob, Stalky and Co., William Brown, Tom Brown, and the creations of T.B. Reed and Angela Brazil.Ranging from the sixteenth century to the present day, and focusing on Great Britain and Northern Ireland, this anthology sheds incidental light on attitudes to children, educational systems, and the divisions of British society. It will strike a chord with every pupil, past or present, inrevealing the glories and defects of British education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1d5ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Oxford+Book+of+Schooldays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frederic Chopin (Lifetimes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rdk8AQAAIAAJ&dq=Frederic+Chopin+(Lifetimes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constructing Questions for Interviews and Questionnaires: Theory and Practice in Social Research","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"City of Blood (Dirty Harry #6)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AebiAAAACAAJ&dq=City+of+Blood+(Dirty+Harry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Brother","description":"The Apache chief, Cochise, and Tom Jeffords, government scout, succeed in achieving peace after the army fails","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZwBDetIsrIC&dq=Blood+Brother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embracing Forgiveness","description":"Embracing Forgiveness is a five-session small group church study for adults and young adults incorporating a Participant Workbook and a DVD.

Based on their experience as professional writers and as teachers in a large, successful screenwriting program at California State University, Northridge, the authors provide a progression of assignments at manageable screenwriting lengths for beginners. They lead students through development of a premise, treatment, stepsheet, and, finally, miniscreenplay essential elements in writing a longer script. A major feature of the text is the use of many example scenes from contemporary and classic American films, such as On the Waterfront, Kramer vs. Kramer, The Godfather, The Graduate, Tootsie, and more. Other scenes are drawn from international films and dramatic literature. The criticism of these scenes invites students to develop their own comparative models, while simultaneously providing exposure to the central analytical terms of good dramatic writing. The authors also place screenwriting within the larger tradition of dramatic writing in order to put the beginning writer in touch with the wealth of art, experience, and practical ideas the drama contains. They provide an up-to-date, practical discussion of marketing and copywriting a screenplay, with addresses of relevant professional societies. Most importantly, they never offer an ill-advised shortcut or restrict students to only one way of thinking about a character, situation, or scene. In The Understructure of Writing for Film & Television, the student's thought and creativity are central.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yP1tBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Over the Hill and Past Our Place","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"First Home: A Decorating Guide and Source Book for the First Time Around","description":"Provides suggestions for simple, inexpensive ways to decorate each room in the house, and discusses color, storage, lighting, and related questions","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WE4LAAAACAAJ&dq=First+Home:+A+Decorating+Guide+and+Source+Book+for+the+First+Time+Around&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"creative childbirth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A New Leaf","description":"A heartwarming novel from America's most popular living artist journeys to the picturesque village of Cape Light on the coast of New England, a hamlet populated by colorful inhabitants who share a strong sense of community and caring for their neighbors.

The natural human tendency to care for fellow humans, to support them with social networks, has proven to be a powerful treatment as well. As a result, the areas of application for social support intervention have expanded dramatically during the past 20 years. As these areas have expanded, so too has the literature on the theory and measurement of social support. Yet, the literature has focussed on very particular areas. Investigators in the social sciences have mainly focused on the protection that social support confers in the context of stressful life events and transitions, whereas studies in the health sciences have concentrated on the effects of social networks and supports on population mortality and morbidity. Although no single theoretical framework has been widely accepted, there is consensus that both the psychological sense of support and actual expressions of support play critical roles in maintaining health and well being. This book is a state-of-the-art resource for the selection and development of strategies for social support assessment and intervention. Designed for use by behavioral and medical scientists conducting studies of physical illness, psychological adjustment, and psychiatric illness in human populations, this volume presents a broad conceptual framework addressing the role of social support in mental and physical health. The book is divided into four sections. The first provides some historical context as well as a conceptual overview of how social support might influence mental and physical health. The second discusses techniques for measuring social networks and support, and the third addresses the design of different types of support interventions. The final section presents some general comments on the volume and its implications for social support research and intervention. This resource is meant to aid researchers in understanding the conceptual criteria on which measurement and intervention decisions should be made when studying the relations between social support and health. Furthermore, the information provided on both measurement and intervention will be valuable to practitioners interested in designing and evaluating prevention and treatment initiatives.

Life s losses were sharp and deeply-felt, but the hope carried by the beings that survived sets the stage for the world as we know it now. Picture yourself in the Cretaceous period. It s a sunny afternoon in the Hell Creek of ancient Montana 66 million years ago. A Triceratops horridus ambles along the edge of the forest. In a matter of hours, everything here will be wiped away. Lush verdure will be replaced with fire. Tyrannosaurus rex will be toppled from their throne, along with every other species of non-avian dinosaur no matter their size, diet, or disposition. They just don t know it yet. The cause of this disaster was identified decades ago. An asteroid some seven miles across slammed into the Earth, leaving a geologic wound over 50 miles in diameter. In the terrible mass extinction that followed, more than half of known species vanished seemingly overnight. But this worst single day in the history of life on Earth was as critical for us as it was for the dinosaurs, as it allowed for evolutionary opportunities that were closed for the previous 100 million years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6CtBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Letter to Santa Claus","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Detectives on Everest: The 2001 Mallory & Irvine Research Expedition","description":"Discusses new discoveries and artifacts found on the Mallory & Irvine Research Expedition's 2001 follow-up journey to Everest in search of new information on the fate of Andrew Irvine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=84fmwAEACAAJ&dq=Detectives+on+Everest:+The+2001+Mallory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe","description":"A gripping preview of humanity's future in the Universe, drawing on current scientific knowledge, historical accounts and classic science fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uh1zYJkmMfwC&dq=Our+Cosmic+Future:+Humanity%27s+Fate+in+the+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A tree grows in Brooklyn: A novel (Armed Services edition)","description":"Chronicles the joint effort of the U.S. government, the publishing industry and the nation's librarians to boost troop morale during World War II by shipping 120 million books to the front lines for soldiers to read during what little downtime they had. 35,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKZUBQAAQBAJ&dq=A+tree+grows+in+Brooklyn:+A+novel+(Armed+Services+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Graph Theory with Applications","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shadows on the Grass","description":"Isak Dinesen takes up the absorbing story of her life in Kenya begun in the unforgettable Out of Africa, which she published under the name of Karen Blixen.

Education presents itself as a distinctly improving, enabling practice. Even its most radical critics assume that education is, at core, an incontestable social good.

In challenging all that is well-intentioned in education, it reveals how our educational commitments are always underwritten by violence. Our highest ideals have the lowest origins. Seeking to unsettle a settled conscience, Benign Violence: Education in and beyond the Age of Reason is designed to disturb the reader. Education constitutes us as subjects; we owe our existence to its violent inscriptions.

Vivid...impressive....Splendidly informative.  The New York Times  Succeeds spectacularly.  Science  A tour de force.  Salon Already internationally acclaimed for his elegant, lucid writing on the most challenging notions in modern physics, Sean Carroll is emerging as one of the greatest humanist thinkers of his generation as he brings his extraordinary intellect to bear not only on Higgs bosons and extra dimensions but now also on our deepest personal questions: Where are we? Who are we? Are our emotions, our beliefs, and our hopes and dreams ultimately meaningless out there in the void? Do human purpose and meaning fit into a scientific worldview? In short chapters filled with intriguing historical anecdotes, personal asides, and rigorous exposition, readers learn the difference between how the world works at the quantum level, the cosmic level, and the human level and then how each connects to the other. Carroll's presentation of the principles that have guided the scientific revolution from Darwin and Einstein to the origins of life, consciousness, and the universe is dazzlingly unique. Carroll shows how an avalanche of discoveries in the past few hundred years has changed our world and what really matters to us. Our lives are dwarfed like never before by the immensity of space and time, but they are redeemed by our capacity to comprehend it and give it meaning. The Big Picture is an unprecedented scientific worldview, a tour de force that will sit on shelves alongside the works of Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Daniel Dennett, and E. O. Wilson for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x21qCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stand Tall: Learning to Really Love Yourself (Tough Issues for Teens, Book One-Self Esteem)","description":"Guidance with a Christian emphasis for teens who need help with their self-esteem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h_LcH4NinRQC&dq=Stand+Tall:+Learning+to+Really+Love+Yourself+(Tough+Issues+for+Teens,+Book+One-Self+Esteem)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bodies and Souls","description":"Isabel Vincent s groundbreaking exploration brings to light a dark chapter in our recent history: the white slave trade and the international Jewish mobsters behind it. From the end of the 1860s until the beginning of the Second World War, thousands of young, impoverished Jewish women, most of them from the hard-scrabble shtetls of Eastern Europe, were sold into slavery by a notorious gang of mobsters called the Zwi Migdal. While the enterprise controlled brothels in various locales, its main centres of operation were Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and, to a lesser extent, New York City. To recruit vulnerable country girls, pimps would target villages of desperate poverty, where they posed as respectable suitors of considerable means who had made their money abroad. They would arrange sham marriages to their victims and promise them an easy life in the New World. But once they d crossed the ocean, these Jewish women found themselves caught up in the white slave trade. Under frequently brutal conditions, the young women had to service the needs of a booming population of immigrant men. An added hardship to endure was being vehemently shunned by the  respectable  Jewish community. Banned from synagogue and reviled by their neighbors, the women were forbidden from partaking in the sacred Jewish burial ritual. So prostitutes banded together to form the Society of Truth, with the promise to do all could they could to help each other be buried in dignity. Through the society the women observed religious life together, setting up private synagogues and kosher kitchens. Cast aside by their community, they created their own: a society of love, honour to God and faith in each other. With the determination and skill of her training as an investigative journalist, Isabel Vincent tells an unforgettable and gripping tale of a shameful chapter in recent history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ew0yYFORsLgC&dq=Bodies+and+Souls&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Basic Spanish","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Atlanta (Campaigns of the Civil War)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Arabic (Egyptian), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Egyptian Arabic with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7dMSAQAAMAAJ&dq=Arabic+(Egyptian),+Conversational:+Learn+to+Speak+and+Understand+Egyptian+Arabic+with+Pimsleur+Language+Programs+(Pimsleur+Instant+Conversation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frontiers and Wars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r0F9zgEACAAJ&dq=Frontiers+and+Wars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's Only Rock 'N' Roll: My On-The-Road Adventures With the Rolling Stones","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Day Of Their Return, The","description":"Aeneas is the powder keg of the universe, a frontier planet where rebellion is a way of life--and death.

Here is the work of Jack London, Rudyard Kipling, Stephen Crane, C.S. Forester, Ernest Hemingway, and of course Conrad. Along with the essential stories come unexpected gems by writers not known for their seafaring bent such as William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, E.M. Forster, and Edgar Allan Poe. Some of the finest writers in the English language have been drawn to the subject of life at sea, with its dangers, loneliness, and triumphs.

African American Studies. Women's Studies. Native American Studies. In ROOTWORK, Veronica Golos' third book of poetry, the author continues her restless exploration into American history this time into the daily lives of anti-slavery abolitionists John Brown and Mary Day Brown. Combining sweeping scholarly research with epic re-imagining, ROOTWORK uses epistolary poems as a gateway into character, motivation, passion, and love. Golos digs deep into the Browns, and she sets up an undercurrent as well, using the voices of runaways and ghosts. In a book of great imagination and courage she completely inhabits the lesser-known Mary Brown Golos shows how poetry can seep beneath the skin with language both restrained and transcendent. \\"Veronica Golos is a poet who has a deep passion for justice and truth- telling. ROOTWORK continues her exploration of language that brings us good and bad news of American history and culture. With her imagined lost writings of Mary Ann Day Brown and John Brown as the root of this important new volume, Golos asks of us to consider the emotional weight, spiritual depth, and intellectual heft of those connected with revolutionaries, rebels, the opponents of the social order. Brown's hanging is often seen as the moment when abolitionists could truly say they would sacrifice themselves to end slavery, given that the plantation South had already decided they would do everything to keep the profitable industry going. While she digs deeper and deeper into the lives of those who made American history John Brown, Sojourner Truth, Frances Harper, et al, it is Mary, the second wife and the mother of many children, whose interrogation of her own soul that Golos examines with language as spare as a Kansas landscape or as soaring as a sermon. With this collection, Golos reclaims an unheard voice among the many powerful voices for freedom.\\" Patricia Spears Jones","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KfvxrQEACAAJ&dq=Veronica%27s+Book+(Poetry)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fog Magic","description":"A child of Nova Scotia who loves the fog is transported by it to a secret world of her own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AbVgvcbwfgMC&dq=Fog+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Appleby at Allington","description":"Sir John Appleby dines one evening at Allington Park, the Georgian home of his acquaintance Owain Allington.

Witch. Crazy. Schizo. Ember Brycin has been called them all. She's always known she's different. No one has ever called her normal, even under the best circumstances. Bizarre and inexplicable things continually happen to her, and having two different colored eyes, strange hair, and an unusual tattoo only contributes to the gossip about her. When the latest school explosion lands her in a facility for trouble teens, she meets Eli Dragen, who's hot as hell and darkly mysterious. Their connection is full of passion, danger, and secrets. Secrets that will not only change her life, but what and who she is--leading her down a path she never imagined possible. Between Light and Dark, Ember finds a world where truth and knowledge are power and no one can be trusted. But her survival depends on finding out the truth about herself.

Although a relatively new subject, this field of research has already received great interest from both academia and industry because the principles and theory behind biochemical evolution have enormous potential in the creation and development of new biologically active compounds, drugs, and treatments for disease. However, almost every book that discusses evolution has ignored the role that biochemical evolution plays, and so in his new book, Athel Cornish-Bowden attempts to fill the knowledge gap for students, professional scientists and all interested individuals. In The Pursuit of Perfection the author explains how the biochemical processes that occur in living cells, long thought to be evidence of intelligent design rather than evolution, can now be understood as the result of natural selection. For example, the initial impression that metabolic pathways consist of an almost haphazard collection of reactions that happen to do the job turns out to be quite false. When detailed studies are made to see how the actual organization of a process compares with other ways of achieving the same result, the one found in living organisms is found to be the best possible, or at least very close to it. The style, content and organisation of the book are intended to make the book accessible, interesting, and fun to read for both scientists, students, and scientifically-minded individuals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hWrwAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Pursuit+of+Perfection:+Aspects+of+Biochemical+Evolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Backboard Fever (Chip Hilton Sports Stories, 10)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"SEASONS OF STRENGTH: New Visions of Adult Christian Maturing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Sound of Chariots","description":"A young girl growing up in Scotland after World War I tries to come to terms with her grief over her father's death and her increasing sense of the passage of time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P1n1EgDwtEcC&dq=A+Sound+of+Chariots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Namanga","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When You Reach September: An Editor's West Florida Essays And Other Episodic Echoes, With Four More Fictional Stories: Ruby's Cafe, Six Bushels of Corn, Atchafalaya and the Worm Grunters","description":"Ring Jaw -- sleepy Chipola River country town -- flashes back woods-toughened West Florida characters and their violent lives of the 1930s and 1940s.

Instead of leading to this promised land it has brought us to the brink of environmental and cultural disaster. Why has there been this gap between modernity's aspirations and its achievements? Development Betrayed offers a powerful answer to this question. Development with its unshakeable commitment to the idea of progress, is rooted in modernism and has been betrayed by each of its major tenets. Attempts to control nature have led to the brink of environmental catastrophe. Western technologies have proved inappropriate for the needs of the South, and governments are unable to respond effectively to the crises that have resulted. Offering a thorough and lively critiques of the ideas behind development, Richard Norgaard also offers an alternative co-evolutionary paradigm, in which development is portrayed as a co-evolution between cultural and ecological systems. Rather than a future with all peoples merging to one best way of knowing and doing things, he envisions a future of a patchwork quilt of cultures with real possibilities for harmony.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i9yKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voices in the Garden","description":"The lives of an aged respected historian, his wife, and a young, magnetic drifter are disrupted by the vicious, powerful director Grotterosso, who is filming the life of Napoleon's son l'Aiglon","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-9CoAAAAIAAJ&dq=Voices+in+the+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Secrets of the New Age: Satan's Plan for a One World Religion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Computer Telephony Encyclopedia","description":"If you want to grasp the full length and breadth of the rapidly developing computer telephony field, this book is the place to start.

His discussions of conversion, repentance, mysticism and saintliness, and his observations on actual, personal religious experiences - all support this thesis. In his introduction, Martin E. Marty discusses how James's pluralistic view of religion led to his remarkable tolerance of extreme forms of religious behaviour, his challenging, highly original theories, and his welcome lack of pretension in all of his observations on the individual and the divine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PbQd6uLg5VQC&dq=The+depth+of+God+(Religious+experience+series+%3B+v.+10)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese (Cantonese), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Cantonese Chinese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Los Chistes Favoritos de los Nios 9","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kG0vAAAAYAAJ&dq=Los+Chistes+Favoritos+de+los+Nios+9&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sinatra: The Life","description":"Packed with revelations, this is the first complete account of a career built on raw talent, sheer willpower--and criminal connections.

Children were left orphaned and families were devastated. As many American soldiers were killed by the 1918 flu as were killed in battle during World War I. And no area of the globe was safe. Eskimos living in remote outposts in the frozen tundra were sickened and killed by the flu in such numbers that entire villages were wiped out. Scientists have recently rediscovered shards of the flu virus frozen in Alaska and preserved in scraps of tissue in a government warehouse. Gina Kolata, an acclaimed reporter for The New York Times, unravels the mystery of this lethal virus with the high drama of a great adventure story. Delving into the history of the flu and previous epidemics, detailing the science and the latest understanding of this mortal disease, Kolata addresses the prospects for a great epidemic recurring, and, most important, what can be done to prevent it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jbRGenPelw0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"About Boston;: Sight, sound, flavor & inflection","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Early writings of Ellen G.

The captain of the frigate, Hugh Pigot, was a brutal and sadistic commander who flogged his men mercilessly and drove them beyond the limits of endurance. However, nothing could excuse the slaughter of guilty and innocent officers alike as the mutineers went wild and committed crimes beyond anything Pigot could have dreamt up. Not content with that, they then took the ship into an enemy port and gave her up to the Spanish who, unaware of the true facts for some time, nevertheless greeted them with the contempt they deserved. The Spanish took the ship into their service but due to an amazing episode of red tape and internal wrangling, never actually got the frigate to sea. Meanwhile the Royal Navy relentlessly hunted down the mutineers over the next ten years and of the 33 either caught or who gave themselves up, 24 were either hanged and hung in chains upon gibbets, or transported for life. A number managed to escape justice. The author describes these events which end with the daring re-capture of the HERMIONE under the guns of Spanish forts, with Captain Edward Hamilton leading 100 English sailors in six open boats in one of the most brilliant cutting-out expeditions in naval history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pNGXAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Black+Ship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"YOU COME WHEN I CALL YOU","description":"Who  or what  is Wendy Swan?

Yet for the New Testament writers it was so much more, representing a radical break that forever affected their perception of God and the world. In Fracture Roy Harrisville examines the thought worlds of the New Testament writers, demonstrating how the cross split apart their previously held ideas, causing a profound reorientation centered on the story of the cross. Focusing chronologically on Paul, the Synoptic writers, John and the authors of Hebrews and 1 Peter, Harrisville demonstrates changes in the writers' understanding of sacrifice, law, Hellenism, the apocalyptic, and other areas, changes that created the new values of the radically different Christian community. An insightful work of careful critical scholarship, Fracture opens up new understanding of the Cross's dramatic effect on mental worlds of the New Testament writers, changes that provoked bitter conflict with the neighbors and foes of early Christianity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iNWY04YhiXcC&dq=Fracture:+The+Cross+as+Irreconcilable+in+the+Language+and+Thought+of+the+Biblical+Writers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blank Study Cards (SparkNotes Study Cards)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qpnVnQEACAAJ&dq=Blank+Study+Cards+(SparkNotes+Study+Cards)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horse Stories: Riding with the Wind","description":"An epic, emotional story of two girls and their bond with beloved horses, the action sweeping between Italy during the Second World War and present day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DgJ4BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Military Order of Constantine of Saint George","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tara Road","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Helping Your Child Through Your Divorce","description":"Previously published in 2009 under the title Still a family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xxAGNdNJT5kC&dq=Helping+Your+Child+Through+Your+Divorce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Promised Sunrise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RS0AuAEACAAJ&dq=Promised+Sunrise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TWILIGHT FOR THE GODS","description":"National Bestseller * Named one of Rolling Stone's Best Music Books of 2018 * One of Newsweek's 50 Best Books of 2018 * A Billboard Best of 2018 * A New York Times Book Review \\"New and Noteworthy\\" selection The author of the critically acclaimed Your Favorite Band is Killing Me offers an eye-opening exploration of the state of classic rock, its past and future, the impact it has had, and what its loss would mean to an industry, a culture, and a way of life. Since the late 1960s, a legendary cadre of artists including the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Black Sabbath, and the Who has revolutionized popular culture and the sounds of our lives. While their songs still get airtime and some of these bands continue to tour, its idols are leaving the stage permanently. Can classic rock remain relevant as these legends die off, or will this major musical subculture fade away as many have before, Steven Hyden asks. In this mix of personal memoir, criticism, and journalism, Hyden stands witness as classic rock reaches the precipice. Traveling to the eclectic places where geriatric rockers are still making music, he talks to the artists and fans who have aged with them, explores the ways that classic rock has changed the culture, investigates the rise and fall of classic rock radio, and turns to live bootlegs, tell-all rock biographies, and even the liner notes of rock s greatest masterpieces to tell the story of what this music meant, and how it will be remembered, for fans like himself. Twilight of the Gods is also Hyden s story. Celebrating his love of this incredible music that has taken him from adolescence to fatherhood, he ponders two essential questions: Is it time to give up on his childhood heroes, or can this music teach him about growing old with his hopes and dreams intact? And what can we all learn from rock gods and their music are they ephemeral or eternal?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zJElDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Part of Speech.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Getting It Wrong: How Black Public Intellectuals Are Failing Black America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Coffin Quilt: The Feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Russian Silhouettes","description":"As a respected trainer who became a world-class chess grandmaster after leaving Leningrad and moving to Holland in 1972, Genna Sosonko observes the golden age Soviet chess from a privileged dual perspective.

In the 1960's, Notre Dame's football program was in shambles. Little did anyone know, help was on its way in the form of Ara Parseghian, a controversial choice for head coach the first one outside of the Notre Dame \\"family.\\" It was now his responsibility to rebuild the once-proud program and teach the Fighting Irish how to win again. But it was no small task. The men of Notre Dame football were a bunch of unlikelies and oddballs, but Parseghian transformed them into a team: a senior quarterback who would win the Heisman Trophy; a five-foot-eight walk-on who would make first team All-American; an exceptionally rare black player, who would overcome much more than his quiet demeanor to rise to All-American, All-Pro, Hall of Famer, and to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Parseghian would change everything, from the uniforms and pads to the offensive strategy. It would be a huge gamble against great obstacles. But Ara Parseghian had that look in his eye.... New York Times bestselling author Jim Dent chronicles one of the greatest comeback seasons in the history of college football. Once again confirming his position as one of the top sports writers in the country, Dent brings the legends of Notre Dame football to life in an unforgettable story of second chances, determination, and unwavering spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CWBrYeHyv6EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flying Cavalier (The House of Winslow #23)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLUazQEACAAJ&dq=The+Flying+Cavalier+(The+House+of+Winslow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Labor/Birthing from the Inside Out","description":"\\"Giving birth is the pivotal moment of a woman's life but it is often treated as a medical procedure, and not as a rite of passage. Birthing from Within offers parents engaging and memorable ways for pregnant women, and their partners, to activate personal, social and spiritual resources that will guide them through labour and afterwards. Many birth classes teach from the 'outside', from the perspective of the professional. Yet, knowledge of anatomy and the stages of labour can often seem irrelevant in the intensity of contraction. The pregnant woman needs to know about labour and birth from her own perspective, she needs to be prepared for birthing from within. Pam England offers a method that allows a woman to fully understand her own strengths and resources. The self-discoveries made during pregnancy makes birth life-enhancing and empowers the future of the family. It is a multi-sensory and holistic approach that aims to make parents feel positively informed about what they are about to experience, confident about the birth of their child. Pain is an inevtiable part of childbirth but Birthing from Within provides resources for building pain-coping confidence in parents. It gives detailed instructions on dealing with normal labour pain and when the humane use of drugs may be called for.\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CS8_AQAACAAJ&dq=Labor/Birthing+from+the+Inside+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse and Custer: The Parallel Lives of Two American Warriors","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Singing Songs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Valley Song","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R-QAImdOsqgC&dq=Valley+Song&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sporting Club","description":"Antagonisms emerge when two competitive friends meet at the centennial celebrations of a Michigan hunting and fishing club","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=chLzAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Sporting+Club&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Micromechanics and MEMS: Classic and Seminal Papers to 1990","description":"Micromechanics is a rich, diverse field that draws on many different disciplines and has potential applications in medicine, electronic interfaces to physical phenomena, military, industrial controls, consumer products, airplanes, microsatellites, and much more.

Building authentic and lasting human relations may be the most important calling for leaders in this century. According to management and global leadership specialist Maya Hu-Chan, the concept of  saving face  can help any leader preserve dignity and create more empathetic cross-cultural relationships.  Face  represents one's self-esteem, self-worth, identity, reputation, status, pride, and dignity. Saving face is often understood as saving someone from embarrassment, but it's also about developing an understanding of the background and motivations of others to discover the unique facets we all possess. Without that understanding, we risk causing others to lose face without even knowing it. Hu-Chan explains saving face through anecdotes and practical tools, such as her BUILD leadership model (Benevolence, Understanding, Interacting, Learning, and Delivery). This book illustrates how we can give face to create positive first impressions, avoid causing others to lose face, and, most importantly, build trust and lasting relationships inside and outside the workplace.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_HPDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treat","description":"Who's a good dog?

But the final defeat on the field of battle was far less painful than the personal defeat he encountered upon his return home. Betrayed by his wife and best friend, the only remnant of his marriage and love was a newborn daughter. Despite the difficulties, Tom remained adamant against giving Laura up. He eventually took a job with the Department of Indian Affairs. Over a period of several years, he and his young daughter move all over the Northern Plains, meeting with the leaders of the Indian tribes, then bringing recommendations with his findings. There was no other white man who knew the country or the Indians better than Thomas Winslow. When the opportunity comes to join the Seventh Cavalry under General George Custer, it affords a better home life for Laurie and a highly desired return to a military career for Winslow. But Tom soon discovers that Custer's campaign against the Indians in the Northern Plains is ill-fated and that his old bitter rival, Spencer Grayson, is a superior ranking officer! As they head toward the Little Big Horn and the final confrontation, who will be left standing?

On that first day we sold twenty-four bottles, and now we sell over 2 million a week, so we've grown since then. This book is about the stuff we've learned since selling those first few smoothies. About having ideas and making drinks, about running a business and getting started, about nature and fruit, about company life and working with friends, about the stuff we've got right and the stuff we got wrong, and about squirrels . . . and camping . . . and doing the right thing. We thought we'd write it all down in a book so we don't forget any of it, and to maybe help other people too. We started innocent from scratch, so we've learnt a lot of things by getting stuff wrong. Some other lessons have come from listening carefully to people clever than us. And some stuff we just got lucky on. But all of it, the good the bad and the useful, is in here. Plus, perhaps our mums will finally believe us when we tell them we haven't rung home for a while because we've been a bit busy these past few years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=glvZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PostgreSQL (Linux)","description":"How to configure the PostgreSQL database?

No single sea battle has had more far-reaching consequences than the one fought in Hampton Roads, Virginia, in 1862. The Confederacy, with no fleet of its own, took a radical step to combat the Union blockade, building an iron fort containing ten heavy guns on the hull of a captured Union frigate named the Merrimack. The North got word of the project, and, in panicky desperation, commissioned an eccentric inventor named John Ericsson to build the Monitor, an entirely revolutionary iron warship. Rushed through to completion in just one hundred days, it mounted only two guns, but they were housed in a shot-proof revolving turret. The ship hurried south from Brooklyn, only to arrive to find the Merrimack had already sunk half the Union fleet and would be back to finish the job. When she returned, the Monitor was there. She fought the Merrimack to a standstill, and, many believe, saved the Union cause. As soon as word of the fight spread, Great Britain the foremost sea power of the day ceased work on all wooden ships. A thousand-year-old tradition ended and the naval future opened. Richly illustrated with photos, maps, and engravings, Iron Dawn  renders all previous accounts of the encounter between the Monitor and the Merrimack as obsolete as wooden war ships  (The Dallas Morning News). Richard Snow brings to vivid life the tensions of the time in this  lively tale of science, war, and clashing personalities  (The Wall Street Journal).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eWc6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Iron+Dawn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Dream of Martin Luther King","description":"Now in Dragonfly--from the acclaimed creator of the Caldecott Honor Book Tar Beach comes a personal and captivating portrait of the life of Martin Luther King, Jr.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tYxGa1t2gwMC&dq=My+Dream+of+Martin+Luther+King&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Norton Book of Women's Lives","description":"\\"This remarkable and wide-ranging collection, full of surprises, shouldencourage any woman who is trying to survive in a man's world, andenlighten any man who sincerely wants to understand contemporarywomen.\\" --Alison Lurie","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=itwCHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Norton+Book+of+Women%27s+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irish Rebel: John Devoy and America's Fight for Ireland's Freedom","description":"Described by Padraig Pearse as the  greatest of the Fenians , John Devoy was born before the Famine and lived to see the Irish tricolour flying from Dublin Castle. The descendent of a rebel family, he was an avowed Fenian who went into exile in New York in 1871. Over the next half-century he was the most-prominent leader of the Irish-American nationalist movement. Every Irish leader from Parnell to Pearse sought his counsel. He organised a dramatic rescue of Fenian prisoners from Australia, rallied Irish America behind the Land War, served as a middle man between the Easter rebels and the German government, and helped move Irish-American opinion in favour of the Treaty. When he died in 1928, Devoy was accorded a state funeral and a hero s burial in Ireland. This new revised edition of the acclaimed biography of this overlooked architect of the Irish independence movement is also the story of Ireland, and of Irish-America, from the Famine to Freedom, examining the extraordinary cloak-and-dagger planning of the Easter Rising and the critical role of America in its outcome.  The Devoy story, in Terry Golway s hands, combines wide scholarship and adventure: it reads like a novel. Get a comfortable chair when you read this book: you won t be able to put it down.

Henry Award winner John Biguenet is as notable for the rigor of its intellect as for the sweep of its imagination. Whether recounting the predicament of an atheistic stigmatic in \\"The Vulgar Soul\\" or a medieval torturer who must employ his terrible skills upon his own apprentice in the title tale, these stories decline to settle for ready sentiments or easy assurances. Rather than add to the massive canon of the victimized, for example, \\"My Slave\\" takes the perspective of the victimizer. In \\"The Open Curtain,\\" a man achieves intimacy with his family only when he recognizes -- watching them dine as he sits in his car at the curb -- that he lives in a household of strangers. Menaced by a gang of skinheads in a Jewish cemetery, an American tourist in Germany placates the Neo-Nazis with a formula he continues to repeat even after he is safely back home in \\"I Am Not a Jew.\\" And as for love, it makes demands in such stories as \\"Do Me\\" that shake our very notions of what it means to love. If these stories engage the world in sometimes shocking ways, they are virtuoso engagements, eloquent in their prose, surprising in their plotting, sly in their humor. Biguenet shifts among voices and narrative strategies and imposes neither a single style nor a repeated structure as he depicts the ecological catastrophe of \\"A Plague of Toads,\\" the problem posed by a ghost in the nursery in \\"Fatherhood,\\" and the ghastly discovery a grieving widower defends as \\"another kind of memory\\" in \\"Rose.\\" Such mastery of craft may come as a surprise in a first-time author, but even more impressive is the object of his art. For whether it seeks to prick or to tickle, each story in The Torturer's Apprentice addresses its subject with an authority unusual in contemporary literature as it entices the reader beyond the boundaries of the expected and the accepted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sn5OYvvCw70C&dq=The+Torturer%27s+Apprentice+-+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Of The Beat Generation: The Writers, Artists And Muses At The Heart Of A Revolution","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"La Mort Dans L'Ame","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JaaiswEACAAJ&dq=La+Mort+Dans+L%27Ame&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Autolisp Programmer's Toolbox","description":"AutoLISP, the programming language behind AutoCAD, is for those who want to move from developing simple applications to more complex and powerful applications.

Hudson Jr. covers a wide range of economic and social topics related to the opportunities given to slaves to produce and trade their own food and other goods--contingent on first completing the master's assigned work for the day. In particular, Hudson shows how these opportunities were exploited by the slaves both to increase their control over their family life and to gain status among their fellow slaves. Filled with details of slaves' social values, family formation, work patterns, \\"internal economies,\\" and domestic production, To Have and to Hold is based on a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, emphasizing wherever possible the recollections of former slaves. Although their private world was never immune to intervention from the white world, Hudson demonstrates a relationship between the agricultural productivity of slaves, in family situations that range from simple to complex formations, and the accumulation of personal property and social status within slave communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MTQyhqDrzFIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog","description":"Includes a new section on clicker training.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4VE-8VAyS5AC&dq=Don%27t+Shoot+the+Dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The English Novel: An Introduction","description":"Written by one of the world s leading literary theorists,this book provides a wide-ranging, accessible and humorousintroduction to the English novel from Daniel Defoe to the presentday.

Often the target of ridicule, young Aaron is initially willing to accept the taunts of his peers out of loyalty to his father. But when a a misguided publicity stunt ends in tragedy, Aaron is prematurely thrust into an adolescent sphere of dislocation, insecurity, and rebellion as he struggles to make his way without a father. Intelligent, sensitive, and confused about his identity, Aaron transforms himself into a would-be clown, wearing strange clothing and cracking jokes about himself to hide his uneasiness. From self-mocking buffoon to self-loathing punk rocker, Aaron tries to on mask after mask in an effort to both satisfy his father's legacy and transcend it. An outsider from the start, the hilariously endearing yet overwhelmingly conflicted Aaron shows us what it is like to need attention so desperately that one would sabotoge both family and love to satisfy its call. Ringing with the truth of what it means to have grown up at the end of the twentieth century,Aaron, Approximately marks Zachary Lazar's debut as a refreshing and intelligent new voice in American fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z0oTHAAACAAJ&dq=Aaron,+Approximately&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LA Grande Pointe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MvmdAAAACAAJ&dq=LA+Grande+Pointe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American everyday cookbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qyFBAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+American+everyday+cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wines and spirits (Foods of the world)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oF7EswEACAAJ&dq=Wines+and+spirits+(Foods+of+the+world)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diabetic Eye Disease","description":"Diabetes affects every part of the eye, not just the retina.

The writing may be fine and literary but, from an actor's standpoint, there are other considerations. A great monologue for you is one which showcases you, lends itself best to your interpretation, makes auditors, instructors, and casting directors sit up and say, \\"Wow!\\". More often than not, monologues lifted from plays are, because they're lifted from plays - totally out of contextl They don't make a heck of a lot of sense unless delivered in relation to the total piece. Or unless you devote a great portion of your valuable, allotted time to exposition. A monologue pulled from a play is an abstract thing and usually, therefore, has no point of reference, no point o view, no beginin, middle and end, and is of an unspecified duration. Dramaline monologues, on the other hand, are of ideal durations, embrace contemporary subjects, have definite points of view, are written in today's speech, and have beginnings, middles, and ends. And they're not over-worked war-horses. They are fresh slices of modern life that will focus maximum attention on you. And they are presented in larger, readable type and spacing. They are also printed on non-glare, eye-easy paper. Every consideration has been taken to make Dramaline books easy on the actor, to make them readily usable, effective tools.

If you're like most business leaders, you'd say it's fundamentally about relationships-and you'd be wrong. The best salespeople don't just build relationships with customers. They challenge them. The need to understand what top-performing reps are doing that their average performing colleagues are not drove Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at Corporate Executive Board to investigate the skills, behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes that matter most for high performance. And what they discovered may be the biggest shock to conventional sales wisdom in decades. Based on an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps across multiple industries and geographies, The Challenger Sale argues that classic relationship building is a losing approach, especially when it comes to selling complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions. The authors' study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one-the Challenger- delivers consistently high performance. Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer's specific needs and objectives. Rather than acquiescing to the customer's every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale. The things that make Challengers unique are replicable and teachable to the average sales rep. Once you understand how to identify the Challengers in your organization, you can model their approach and embed it throughout your sales force. The authors explain how almost any average-performing rep, once equipped with the right tools, can successfully reframe customers' expectations and deliver a distinctive purchase experience that drives higher levels of customer loyalty and, ultimately, greater growth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L7qJDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Challengers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pakistan: The Eye of the Storm","description":"This thoroughly revised and updated edition of Bennett Jones  market-leading account of this critical modern state includes fresh material on the Taliban insurgency, the Musharraf years, the return and subsequent assassination of Benazir Bhutto, and the unlikely election as president of Asif Ali Zardari.

Few men can say they have known Africa as Capstick has known it leading safaris through lion country; tracking man-eating leopards along tangled jungle paths; running for cover as fear-maddened elephants stampede in all directions. And of the few who have known this dangerous way of life, fewer still can recount their adventures with the flair of this former professional hunter-turned-writer. Based on Capstick s own experiences and the personal accounts of his colleagues, Death in the Long Grassportrays the great killers of the African bush not only the lion, leopard, and elephant, but the primitive rhino and the crocodile waiting for its unsuspecting prey, the titanic hippo and the Cape buffalo charging like an express train out of control. Capstick was a born raconteur whose colorful descriptions and eye for exciting, authentic detail bring us face to face with some of the most ferocious killers in the world underrated killers like the surprisingly brave and cunning hyena, silent killers such as the lightning-fast black mamba snake, collective killers like the wild dog.

Few have been aware of the number of texts he translated, the importance he attached to this activity, or the extent to which the translated works inform his own stories and poems. Between the age of ten, when he translated Oscar Wilde, and the end of his life, when he prepared a Spanish version of the Prose Edda , Borges transformed the work of Poe, Kafka, Hesse, Kipling, Melville, Gide, Faulkner, Whitman, Woolf, Chesterton, and many others. In a multitude of essays, lectures, and interviews Borges analyzed the versions of others and developed an engaging view about translation. He held that a translation can improve an original, that contradictory renderings of the same work can be equally valid, and that an original can be unfaithful to a translation. Borges's bold habits as translator and his views on translation had a decisive impact on his creative process. Translation is also a recurrent motif in Borges's stories. In \\"The Immortal,\\" for example, a character who has lived for many centuries regains knowledge of poems he had authored, and almost forgotten, by way of modern translations. Many of Borges's fictions include actual or imagined translations, and some of his most important characters are translators. In \\"Pierre Menard, author of the Quixote,\\" Borges's character is a respected Symbolist poet, but also a translator, and the narrator insists that Menard's masterpiece-his \\"invisible work\\"-adds unsuspected layers of meaning to Cervantes's Don Quixote. George Steiner cites this short story as \\"the most acute, most concentrated commentary anyone has offered on the business of translation.\\" In an age where many discussions of translation revolve around the dichotomy faithful/unfaithful, this book will surprise and delight even Borges's closest readers and critics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FHvV5z_5Q4sC&dq=El+Principe+Feliz+/+The+Happy+Prince+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call Me Crazy","description":"It was the perfect plan.I needed a wife--temporarily--in order to inherit the family business.And she needed a favor--the kind that takes nine months to deliver.We had it all worked out, from the no-touching policy on our wedding night (her rule) to the no-falling-in-love decree (mine).

But there is one thing that we could do better. We could pass the ball better than they can now. Man, we used to pass that basketball around like it was a hot potato.\\"--Sam \\"Buck\\" Covington, former member of the Washington Bruins n a nation distinguished by a great black athletic heritage, there is perhaps no sport that has felt the impact of African American culture more than basketball. Most people assume that the rise of black basketball was a fortuitous accident of the inner-city playgrounds. In Hot Potato, Bob Kuska shows that it was in fact a consciously organized movement with very specific goals. When Edwin Henderson introduced the game to Washington, D.C., in 1907, he envisioned basketball not as an end in itself but as a public-health and civil-rights tool. Henderson believed that, by organizing black athletics, including basketball, it would be possible to send more outstanding black student athletes to excel at northern white colleges and debunk negative stereotypes of the race. He reasoned that in sports, unlike politics and business, the black race would get a fair chance to succeed. Henderson chose basketball as his marquee sport, and he soon found that the game was a big hit on Washington's segregated U Street. Almost simultaneously, black basketball was catching on quickly in New York, and the book establishes that these two cities served as the birthplace of the black game. Hot Potato chronicles the many successes and failures of the early years of black amateur basketball. It also recounts the emergence of black college basketball in America, documenting the origins of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association, or CIAA, which would become the Big Ten of black collegiate sports. The book also details for the first time the rise of black professional basketball in America, with a particular emphasis on the New York Renaissance, a team considered by experts to be as important in the development of black basketball as the Harlem Globetrotters. Kuska recounts the Renaissance's first victory over the white world champion Original Celtics in 1925, and he evaluates the significance of this win in advancing equality in American sports. By the late 1920s, the Renaissance became one of the sport's top draws in white and black America alike, setting the stage for the team's undisputed world championship in 1939. As Edwin Henderson had hoped--and as any fan of the modern-day game can tell you--the triumphs certainly did not end there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yjGp_ifcLhsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside the Playboy Mansion: If You Don't Swing, Don't Ring","description":"Examines life inside the Playboy Mansion with observations and anecdotes from friends and celebrities who were guests of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g5WJGQAACAAJ&dq=Inside+the+Playboy+Mansion:+If+You+Don%27t+Swing,+Don%27t+Ring&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matters of Substance","description":"Presented by an editor of the journal Addiction, an analysis of the ways in which drugs are controlled throughout the world evaluates drug use and abuse in a societal context that considers contemporary beliefs about personal freedom, pleasure, and globalization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=179gTHXyw3QC&dq=Matters+of+Substance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Protector of the Small: First Test / Page / Squire / Lady Knight","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Elsevier's Russian-English Dictionary (4 Volume Set)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Minnie and Moo Go to Paris (Minnie and Moo (DK Paperback))","description":"Two cow friends, Minnie and Moo, find a bus and try to drive to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower.

As a teenager he started to explore a set of nettlesome geometrical problems, including Euclid's parallel postulate, and in 1832 he published a brilliant twenty-four-page paper that eventually shook the foundations of the 2000-year-old tradition of Euclidean geometry. Bolyai's 'Appendix' (published as just that - an appendix to a much longer mathematical work by his father) set up a series of mathematical proposals whose implications would blossom into the new field of non-Euclidean geometry, providing essential intellectual background for ideas as varied as the theory of relativity and the work of Marcel Duchamp. In this short book, Jeremy Gray explains Bolyai's ideas and the historical context in which they emerged, were debated, and were eventually recognized as a central achievement in the Western intellectual tradition. Intended for nonspecialists, the book includes facsimiles of Bolyai's original paper and the 1898 English translation by G. B. Halstead, both reproduced from copies in the Burndy Library at MIT.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vKHdnQEACAAJ&dq=Janos+Bolyai,+Non-Euclidean+Geometry,+and+the+Nature+of+Space&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy : April","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Abraham's Four Seeds","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Vampire Hunter D, Vol. 4: Tale of the Dead Town","description":"When a floating city becomes the target of a rash of vampire attacks, only one man can restore the oasis. \\"The City,\\" a tiny metropolis of a few hundred sheltered citizens floating serenely on a seemingly random course a few feet above the ground, has long been thought safe from the predation of marauding monsters.

Dr. Hanna explores the all-important question facing us today: why are Americans paying much more per person for health care than those in other developed nations, but getting much less in terms of quality? Approaching this painful paradox through a clinician's eyes, Dr. Hanna first makes a careful diagnosis and then prescribes an appropriate treatment to heal our ailing system. He shares real-life examples of patients and provides insights into the minds of doctors, including how their decisions influence the costs and outcomes of treatments.

As the first anthropological study of an urban community in Saudi Arabia since that oil boom, Arabian Oasis City is also the first to document those changes. Based on extensive interviews and participant observation with both men and women, the authors record and analyze the transformation that has occurred in this ancient oasis city throughout the twentieth century: the creation of the present Saudi Arabian state and of a new national economy based on the export of oil and the economic boom brought about by the dramatic increases in the price of oil following the October 1973 Arab-Israeli War. In addition, the authors reveal the changes brought about by the fall in the price of oil beginning in 1982 and analyze the problems confronting  Unayzah in its aftermath. By demonstrating that the area was not exclusively dominated by tribalism and Bedouin nomads, this empirical case study destroys stereotypical views about Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it proves the existence prior to the coming of the modern Saudi Arabian state  of surplus agricultural and craft production and the full development of local, regional, and long-distance trade networks. It shows that women, although veiled, played active roles in work outside the household. The social impact of change over the years is, however, profound especially the gradual replacement of the extended family by the nuclear family, changing patterns of husband-wife relationships, the impact of self-earned income on the status of women, and the emergence of a new middle class of employees and entrepreneurs. Because of the high degree of gender segregation in this area of research, Altorki and Cole give us a fortunate collaboration between a Saudi Arabian female scholar and an American male scholar experienced in research in the Middle East.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KyiTLRCzO10C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Law and liberty","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Our Family History & Album: Our Family History/Our Family Album","description":"A beautiful gift and keepsake album to record the genealogy and family history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XYKRDgAAQBAJ&dq=Our+Family+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of Mystery & Imagination (Everyman Paperback Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Guidelines for Developing Instructions","description":"Confusing, inadequate instructions for setting up and using consumer products are not only unhelpful, but potentially dangerous.

Based on the true story of the brutal murder of German tourist, Gisela Pfleger, \\"Culture Shock\\" brings this harrowing story to life in a way that only a true cop-author can tell it. The book captures every riveting detail of this investigation, from the moment the first bullet strikes its unsuspecting victim, through the barrier of the gangs code of silence, to the exhaustive search and arrest of the last remaining suspect. \\"Culture Shock\\" allows you to enter the minds of those unsung heroes known as detectives, who, you will discover, are actually ordinary people doing exceptional and extraordinary work. You are invited to witness first hand and to discover with the detectives how the separate paths of people so different could lead them to collide at a refuge on a mountain, where so many things go wrong in a place so right. What began as just another robbery-murder in our crime plagued society, ends up anything but ordinary. One lost culture in our society, and one culture lost in our society. What happens when the two meet? \\"Culture Shock\\" will leave you searching for answers. This compelling story is about Gisela and Klaus Pfleger of Germany who came to visit their daughter, Birte in Southern California. Birte was preparing to graduate from college and embark on her new career as a teacher. Birte and her parents had much to celebrate. In addition to celebrating Birtes success, Gisela was here to share great news with her daughter. She had been given a new lease on life. After months of treatment, her cancer had finally gone in remission. It was spring in California and unlike the weather back home, it was dry and warm. The fast pace of LA had already taken its toll. Their trip to Universal Studios was exhilarating, yet exhausting. \\"Oh, those gunfights, they are so real! These Americans are so clever,\\" thought the Pflegers. But Klaus and Gisela needed to get away from the assault of LA, if only just for a day. Birte had classes to attend. She pondered skipping to be with her parents but was so close to graduation. Birte recalled a peaceful and tranquil place she had visited-it would be perfect for them. Birte had provided detailed directions so that her parents would not get lost. Though only an hour drive to the east of LA, the tiny spot near Idyllwild seemed like an escape to another world. Her parents would feel much at home in the forest. There they could relax. Klaus and Gisela admired the many plants and flowers in bloom. They had never seen plants like this back in Germany, or in any other place they had traveled for that matter. As they explored the Indian Vista Viewpoint, and soaked in the sights, both Gisela and Klaus were oblivious to the danger closing in on them. They were not from here and had not been schooled in Street Survival 101. Without warning, suddenly everything changed forever. Gisela lay dead in a pool of blood, while Klaus staggered about mortally wounded. He had to get Gisela help. How could they have gotten so lost? So begins the harrowing account of how an unimposing elderly couple from Germany would become the victims of a horrific crime: a crime that with the arrival of the mornings papers, and the evening news would shock a nation and the world. Maneuvering in and out of consciousness, Klaus desperately sought help for his wife...

Written by many of our nation's most insightful observers, the essays provide an objective and penetrating analysis of the most critical challenges facing America as well as innovative solutions to many of them.The State of the Union Address is among the nation's oldest rituals, but one that has deviated from its original purpose: Rather than a candid assessment of the country or a meaningful self-evaluation by the current administration, it has become a political spectacle marked by self-congratulation and spin. The Real State of the Union seeks to turn an empty exercise into a more meaningful national dialogue about the social, political, and economic health of our country. Rejecting the political correctness of both parties, this volume tells the American public what it needs to know about the real problems that plague the country and why the political solutions that are offered too often fail to address the real nature of those problems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oFmgmdiTNSQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Progress and Poverty: An inquiry Into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth: The Remedy","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c-SxAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solar Control and Shading Devices","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kKRfQgAACAAJ&dq=Solar+Control+and+Shading+Devices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theodore Roosevelt: a Biography","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"LINCOLN FINDS A GENERAL : A Military Study of the Civil War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t5P-zAEACAAJ&dq=LINCOLN+FINDS+A+GENERAL+:+A+Military+Study+of+the+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Le Saint Coran","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Philosophical Works Including the Works on Vision (Everyman's Library (Paper))","description":"Written in a highly personal style, Spinoza's \\"Ethics\\" presents to readers anordered vision of the universe as a unified whole--not as a lifeless world ofinnumerable separate entities.

Or they would have named it for you, a permanent mark, just for being here.\\" From a new talent that Annie Proulx has called an \\"important emerging writer\\" comes a surprising and expansive collection of stories, steeped in the lore of the frontier but unmistakably fresh and of our time. When We Were Wolves roams over a West we never knew existed--colonized by rogues and tricksters, Custer impersonators, firefighters with a weakness for arson, and the other rootless folk who come to rest under the vast and forgiving desert sky. Jon Billman writes about accidental lives: people who are trapped in unsuitable marriages, impossible situations, but who handle them with the odd grace of those who are determined to live by their own strange code. He mingles the skewed humor of David Sedaris with the loping, rough-edged appeal of Tom McGuane.

The book sets forth new ways of understanding why the abolition of slavery did not yield equitable fruits of citizenship, not only in Brazil, but throughout the Americas and the Caribbean. Afro-Brazilians in Sao Paulo and Salvador lived out their new freedom in ways that raise issues common to the entire Afro-Atlantic diaspora. In Sao Paulo, they initiated a vocal struggle for inclusion in the creation of the nation's first black civil rights organization and political party, and they appropriated a discriminatory identity that isolated blacks. In contrast, African identity prevaled over black identity in Salvador, where social protest was oriented toward protecting the right of cultural pluralism. Of all the eras and issues studied in Afro-Brazilian history, post-abolition social and political action has been the most neglected. Butler provides many details of this period for the first time in English and supplements published sources with original oral histories, Afro-Brazilian newspapers, and new state archival documents currently being catalogued in Bahia. Freedoms Given, Freedoms Won sets the Afro-Brazilian experience in a national context as well as situating it within the Afro-Atlantic diaspora through a series of explicit parallels, particularly with Cuba and Jamaica.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=60lwRIVraMAC&dq=Freedoms+Given,+Freedoms+Won:+Afro-Brazilians+in+Post-Abolition+Sao+Paolo+and+Salvador&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unicorn U.","description":"Explore touches and flaps on every page in this exciting ABC book.

Tired of urban living, bored of her career, out of love with her long-standing partner, she and her son spied a romantic ruin in Andalusia amid its own olive groves, and made an offer. What happened next - selling her London house, and handing in her notice at the magazine - was going to be straightforward, or so she thought. She had not counted on the sudden emergence of a New Man in her life, the plans of Arsenal football ground to purchase her back garden, a badly slipped disc and the logistics involved in moving a lifetime's possessions. Nor had she realised what a struggle re-building the house, room by room, or planting a garden in the hostile terrain of southern Spain would be. But helped by her new husband, Dan, and an assortment of eccentric locals, not least by the worldly wisdom of Juan the builder, she made it, and over the ensuing four years, the house and pool were built and the garden began to take shape. This is the story of how Miranda got to ma?ana, of her love affair with Spain, and a countryside where 'great jagged peaks range above little fields, white villages tumble like sugar cubes down the sides of hills, and white houses grow room by room in a puzzle of rectangles, topped by corrugated cinnamon-brown terracotta tiles moulded on a man's thigh'. Illustrated throughout with line-drawings by Dan Pearce, Getting to Ma?ana is a book to read and treasure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jUBirgEACAAJ&dq=Getting+to+Manana&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gloria (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Teaching and Learning Chinese as a Foreign Language: A Pedagogical Grammar","description":"This book provides a research-based account of how to teach and learn Chinese as a foreign language.

Throws out behaviorist theories that claim animals have no consciousness. ? Offers a completely new understanding of the role psychedelics play in the development of consciousness in all species. ? Reveals drug use to be a natural instinct. From caffeine-dependent goats to nectar addicted ants, the animal kingdom offers amazing examples of wild animals and insects seeking out and consuming the psychoactive substances in their environments. Author Giorgio Samorini explores this little-known phenomenon and suggests that, far from being confined to humans, the desire to experience altered states of consciousness is a natural drive shared by all living beings and that animals engage in these behaviors deliberately. Rejecting the Western cultural assumption that using drugs is a negative action or the result of an illness, Samorini opens our eyes to the possibility that beings who consume psychedelics--whether humans or animals--contribute to the evolution of their species by creating entirely new patterns of behavior that eventually will be adopted by other members of that species. The author's fascinating accounts of mushroom-loving reindeer, intoxicated birds, and drunken elephants ensure that readers will never view the animal world in quite the same way again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qFsoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales from the night rainbow =: Moolelo o na po makole : the story of a woman, a people, and an island : an oral history of Kailiohe Kameekua of Kamalo, Molokai, 1816-1931","description":"Braided Waters sheds new light on the relationship between environment and society by charting the history of Hawaii s Molokai island over a thousand-year period of repeated settlement. From the arrival of the first Polynesians to contact with eighteenth-century European explorers and traders to our present era, this study shows how the control of resources especially water in a fragile, highly variable environment has had profound effects on the history of Hawaii. Wade Graham examines the ways environmental variation repeatedly shapes human social and economic structures and how, in turn, man-made environmental degradation influences and reshapes societies. A key finding of this study is how deep structures of place interact with distinct cultural patterns across different societies to produce similar social and environmental outcomes, in both the Polynesian and modern eras a case of historical isomorphism with profound implications for global environmental history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HORyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mighty Thor: Loki HC","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Solis","description":"Written by Joseph L. Henderson, one of the first generation of Jungian analysts, and Dyane N. Sherwood, a practising analyst, this book is a striking and unique contribution to the resurgence of interest in alchemy for its way of representing the phenomenology of creative experience. Transformation of the Psyche is organized around 22 illuminated paintings from the early Renaissance alchemical manuscript the Splendor Solis, and is further illustrated by over 50 colour figures. The images of the Splendor Solis are possibly the most beautiful and evocative alchemical paintings to be found anywhere, and they are widely known to students of alchemy. Jung reproduced several Splendor Solis images in his works, yet prior to this book no one has explored the symbolism of the paintings as a series in relation to the process of depth psychological transformation. This book is the first scholarly study of the paintings in their entirety, and of the mythological and historical allusions contained within the images. Transformation of the Psyche does not simply explain or analyze the pictures, but invites the reader to participate in the creative and transforming process evoked by these images. Transformation of the Psyche is a truly unique book that will be of immense value and interest to analysts and psychotherapists, as well as scholars of mediaeval and renaissance intellectual history and students of spiritual disciplines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=__aOAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Gaelic harper's first tunes: A primer for clairseach based on remnants of Gaelic oral tradition including the first tunes taught student harpers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HrbOPAAACAAJ&dq=A+Gaelic+harper%27s+first+tunes:+A+primer+for+clairseach+based+on+remnants+of+Gaelic+oral+tradition+including+the+first+tunes+taught+student+harpers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powder Puff Derby of 1929: The True Story of the First Women's CrossCountry Air Race","description":"\\"Originally published as The Powder Puff Derby of 1929 in 2002 by Sourcebooks, Inc.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FhDwtAEACAAJ&dq=Powder+Puff+Derby+of+1929:+The+True+Story+of+the+First+Women%27s+CrossCountry+Air+Race&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CST - French Sample Test (XAM CST (Paperback))","description":"In a guide attuned to the New York Department of Education standards, readers will find sample test questions covering the CST French test.

In the Tibetan tradition, it is common for a meditation master to offer explanations and interpretations in this way, in order to share his understanding with students and to shed light on centuries-old texts that may be difficult for contemporary practitioners to fully understand. Such a commentary is usually read at the end of a comprehensive course of study and is designed for seasoned students of Tibetan Buddhism. To make the work more accessible to Western Buddhists, the translators have added detailed notes and appendixes. In this case, the well-known original text by Jigme Lingpa (1730-1798) presents in elegant verse the entire Buddhist path according to the Nyingma school. Because it is pithy and concise and makes use of elaborate poetic language, a commentary is indispensable. The root text consists of two main sections devoted, respectively, to the Sutras and the Tantras. The Sutra section, which is the subject of the present volume, covers the ethical, psychological, and philosophical teachings shared by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The essential thrust is toward the Mahayana, but the text also addresses questions associated with the Hinayana perspective, such as the fundamental issues of karma and ethics, the four noble truths, and the twelvefold chain of dependent arising.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h0rYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Treasury+of+Precious+Qualities:+A+Commentary+on+the+Root+Text+of+Jigme+Lingpa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elemental Power: Celtic Faerie Craft & Druidic Magic (Llewellyn's Celtic Wisdom)","description":"Practical Celtic magic in the traditions of the Drulds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EfJ3jMMG3qgC&dq=Elemental+Power:+Celtic+Faerie+Craft&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medicine Woman (Interview with Author)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Passport to a happy marriage","description":"Never See the Bible the Same Way Again The Bible was written thousands of years ago by Eastern people whose worldview had very little, if anything, in common with culture of the West.

With breathtaking command of medieval Muslim sources as well as the vast literature on medieval European and Muslim culture, Carole Hillenbrand has produced a book that shows not only how the Crusades were perceived by the Muslims, but how the Crusades affected the Muslim world - militarily, culturally, and psychologically. As the author demonstrates, that influence continues now, centuries after the events. In The Crusades the reader discovers how the Muslims reacted to the Franks, and how Muslim populations were displaced, the ensuing period of jihad, the careers of Nur al-Din and Saladin, and the interpenetration of Muslim and Christian cultures. Stereotypes of the Franks in Muslim documents offer a fascinating counter to Western views of the infidel of legend. For readers interested in the Middle Ages, military history, the history of religion, and postcolonial studies, The Crusades opens a window onto a conflict we have only viewed from one side.

He is most famous for the hilarious, often bittersweet stories that he published in the 1930s and 1940s in the New Yorker. He was also a brilliant cartoonist whose unique drawings were an eagerly awaited feature in Harold Ross s New Yorker and in Thurber s books. This biography is a book much in the spirit of Thurber himself. Readable, anecdotal, and often delightfully funny, Remember Laughter will be cherished by all fans of Thurber. Yet Neil A. Grauer by no means sentimentalizes Thurber. He addresses serious, and often disturbing, features of Thurber s life while highlighting Thurber s courage, inexhaustible humor, and unique literary and artistic talents. The result is a biography that both celebrates Thurber s genius and shrewdly appraises his qualities as a man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i-371BEsIkIC&dq=Remember+laughter:+A+life+of+James+Thurber&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet China","description":"One of the most requested titles in our critically acclaimed Traveler series, this beautiful guide makes the vast enigma of China accessible to every visitor.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Injuries Trauma and Death Due to Nuclear War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CY7aAQAACAAJ&dq=Injuries+Trauma+and+Death+Due+to+Nuclear+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thin Man (Classic Crime)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zNGHAQAACAAJ&dq=Thin+Man+(Classic+Crime)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Sitter's Guide by Dennis the Menace","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dead Lucky: Lord Lucan: The Final Truth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Willow Hill","description":"Andrew Manson has traveled to Pensacola, Florida, to see his college friend Richard Abbott get married to a local lady, Samantha Grimes.

Because no two children are exactly alike in their development, we have designed the Bank Street Ready-to-Read series in three levels to accommodate the individual stages of reading readiness of children ages four through eight. ? Level 1: Getting Ready To Read  (Pre-K to Grade 1) Books are perfect for reading aloud with children who are getting ready to read or are just beginning to read words or phrases. ? Level 2: Reading Together (Grades 1 to 3) Books are written especially for children who are on their way to reading independently but who may need help. ? Level 3: I Can Read It Myself (Grades 2 to 3) Books are designed for children able to read on their own. They also can be enjoyed as read-alouds.. Our three levels make it easy to select the books most appropriate for a child s development and enable him or her to grow with the series step by step. The Bank Street Ready-to-Read books also overlap and reinforce each other, further encouraging the reading process.

They present a compelling look at one of the most serious issues in today s society: health care in America. How will we provide quality healthcare to older adults who will need it during the next thirty to fifty years? Who will provide this care? How will it be funded? How can we establish systems of care now to be in place as demographic and health-related economic pressures mount? Alongside the sobering reality of the challenges our country faces, there are reasons for optimism. Innovative programs created and maintained by volunteers and religious congregations are emerging as pivotal factors in meeting health care needs.

We lay in bed and just don't \\"feel\\" like doing what they suggest even though we know it will make our life better. That \\"feeling\\" stops us from executing one or more steps they suggest we take to make our lives better. I couldn't overcome that feeling either. Here I was an alcoholic, a sex addict, sugar addict, spending addict, tobacco addict, love addict, I had gone bankrupt, been through two horrific divorces, a child custody battle, I played two professional sports I never wanted to play and I contemplated suicide.

We wonder why, for some people, success seems to come so naturally. Could the secret be how they were parented? This book unveils how parenting helped shape some of the most fascinating people you will ever encounter, by doing things that almost any parent can do. You don't have to be wealthy or influential to ensure your child reaches their greatest potential. What you do need is commitment and the strategies outlined in this book. In The Formula: Unlocking the Secrets to Raising Highly Successful Children, Harvard economist Ronald Ferguson, named in a New York Times profile as the foremost expert on the US educational \\"achievement gap,\\" along with award-winning journalist Tatsha Robertson, reveal an intriguing blueprint for helping children from all types of backgrounds become successful adults. Informed by hundreds of interviews, the book includes never-before-published insights from the \\"How I was Parented Project\\" at Harvard University, which draws on the varying life experiences of 120 Harvard students. Ferguson and Robertson have isolated a pattern with eight roles of the \\"Master Parent\\" that make up the Formula: the Early Learning Partner, the Flight Engineer, the Fixer, the Revealer, the Philosopher, the Model, the Negotiator, and the GPS Navigational Voice. The Formula combines the latest scientific research on child development, learning, and brain growth and illustrates with life stories of extraordinary individuals from the Harvard-educated Ghanian entrepreneur who, as the young child of a rural doctor, was welcomed in his father's secretive late-night political meetings; to the nation's youngest state-wide elected official, whose hardworking father taught him math and science during grueling days on the family farm in Kentucky; to the DREAMer immigration lawyer whose low-wage mother pawned her wedding ring to buy her academically outstanding child a special flute. The Formula reveals strategies on how you regardless of race, class, or background can help your children become the best they can be and shows ways to maximize their chances for happy and purposeful lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fmZRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Think the World of You","description":"We Think the World of You combines acute social realism and dark fantasy, and was described by J.R.

The book sets forth new ways of understanding why the abolition of slavery did not yield equitable fruits of citizenship, not only in Brazil, but throughout the Americas and the Caribbean. Afro-Brazilians in Sao Paulo and Salvador lived out their new freedom in ways that raise issues common to the entire Afro-Atlantic diaspora. In Sao Paulo, they initiated a vocal struggle for inclusion in the creation of the nation's first black civil rights organization and political party, and they appropriated a discriminatory identity that isolated blacks. In contrast, African identity prevaled over black identity in Salvador, where social protest was oriented toward protecting the right of cultural pluralism. Of all the eras and issues studied in Afro-Brazilian history, post-abolition social and political action has been the most neglected. Butler provides many details of this period for the first time in English and supplements published sources with original oral histories, Afro-Brazilian newspapers, and new state archival documents currently being catalogued in Bahia. Freedoms Given, Freedoms Won sets the Afro-Brazilian experience in a national context as well as situating it within the Afro-Atlantic diaspora through a series of explicit parallels, particularly with Cuba and Jamaica.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=60lwRIVraMAC&dq=Freedoms+Given,+Freedoms+Won:+Afro-Brazilians+in+Post-Abolition+So+Paolo+and+Salvador&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Dare (A Liaden Universe Novel)","description":"Val Con yos'Phelium, a rogue DOI agent and heir to the Clan Korval, is forced to come out of hiding when his cousin, a power-hungry and conniving gambler and con artist, becomes the leader of the Clan.

His radically new electronic and instrumental music converted Igor Stravinsky to serialism in the 1950s and has continued to inspire young composers for more than fifty years. Other Planets: The Complete Works of Karlheinz Stockhausen, 19502007 draws on more than fifty years of Maconie s close study of Stockhausen and functions as a catalogue raisonee of Stockhausen s complete output. With plentiful citations from the history of radio, film, and sound recording, as well as from contemporary science and technology, the book is laid out in chronological order and contains ample commentary on the composer s sources of inspiration. Each composition is also fully documented within the text, giving full information of each work s publisher, catalog number, instrumentation, duration, and authorized compact disc. The updated edition extends the range of the volume s contents to include the twenty-five works Stockhausen composed between 2004 and his death in 2007.

The Western Amazon is the state of Amazonas on the border with Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. In this region of the Amazon nearly 98% of the rainforest is unspoiled. It is here where the pristine headwaters of the Amazon - the Rio Negro and the Rio Solimoes - come down from the Andes, far from the modern world. The main port of entry for exploring this region is the jungle metropolis called Manaus. On the eastern side of the Amazon, there are some amazingly beautiful destinations, but there are fewer options as the region has been partially deforested and basic transportation and infrastructure are problematic. The top destination on the eastern side is Par  state, with its rich cultural life, the exotic capital Bel m, nearby Ilha de Maraj , and Santar m, up the Amazon River near the border with Amazonas. The author, a longtime resident of Brazil, is Latin America news director for ICIS, an international news agency. The best hotels for every budget are detailed, from beach resorts to country inns, restaurants, attractions and activities are detailed in the cities, towns and villages.

But as these schismatics organized themselves into the Disciples of Christ, the Reverend Sidney Rigdon aligned himself with the Latter. day Saints, quickly becoming a member of the First Presidency. He served Joseph Smith loyally, even through a spat over Smith's romantic interest in Rigdon's teenage daughter.Next to Smith, Rigdon was the most influential early Mormon. He co-wrote the famous Lectures on Faith, championed communalism, and delivered significant early sermons, including the famous Salt Sermon and the Ohio temple dedicatory address. Following Smith's death, Rigdon led some 500 Latter-day Saints to Pennsylvania, where today his followers still number about 10,000 strong.Rigdon is a biographer's dream, writes Van Wagoner. Intellectually gifted, manic-depressive, an eloquent orator and social innovator but a chronic indigent, Rigdon aspired to altruism but demanded advantage and deference. When he lost prominence, his early attainments were virtually written out of the historical record. Correcting this void, Van Wagoner weaves the psychology of religious incontinence into the larger fabric of social history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M57tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sidney+Rigdon:+A+Portrait+of+Religious+Excess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Memories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Modern Cabinetmaking","description":"Activities are designed to help students review content and develop critical thinking skills.

Since their earliest discovery in 1947, the Scrolls have been the object of fascination and extreme controversy. Challenging traditional dogma, Golb has been the leading proponent of the view that the Scrolls cannot be the work of a small, desert-dwelling fringe sect, as various earlier scholars had claimed, but are in all likelihood the remains of libraries of various Jewish groups, smuggled out of Jerusalem and hidden in desert caves during the Roman siege of 70 A. D. Contributing to the enduring debate sparked by the book's original publication in 1995, this digital edition contains additional material reporting on new developments that have led a series of major Israeli and European archaeologists to support Golb's basic conclusions. In its second half, the book offers a detailed analysis of the workings of the scholarly monopoly that controlled the Scrolls for many years, and discusses Golb's role in the struggle to make the texts available to the public. Pleading for an end to academic politics and a commitment to the search for truth in scrolls scholarship, Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? sets a new standard for studies in intertestamental history \\"This book is 'must reading'....

A growing number of workers will employ CryoEM for structural studies in their own research, and a large proportion of biomedical researchers will have a growing interest in understanding what the capabilities and limits of this approach are.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o5EUmAEACAAJ&dq=Three-Dimensional+Electron+Microscopy+of+Macromolecular+Assemblies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chainsaw's Justice","description":"Allen a??Skipa?

Following in the footsteps of the great French-American tradition of photographers like Cartier-Bresson and Garry Winogrand, Boutos brings to the fore a Carnival which has lost, along with color, its very identity. That his images capture the contemporary reality of this much photographed spectacle without any cliche or shopworn excess is a testament to the photographer, who portrays with deceptive ease the behind-the-scenes rituals of the carnival's baroque proceedings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VaeBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Venice+Carnival+Unmasked&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Phantom Empire: Movies in the Mind of the 20th Century","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lilian Jackson Braun: A Reader's Checklist and Reference Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nWUOAAAACAAJ&dq=Lilian+Jackson+Braun:+A+Reader%27s+Checklist+and+Reference+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feeding the Poor: Assessing Federal Food Aid","description":"In the midst of the welfare reform revolution, Peter H.

H. H.\\" is a poem written over a seventeen year period and completed in 1849. Widely considered as one of the greatest poems of the Victorian era it is a richly lyrical work which meditates on the search for hope in the wake of a great loss. The length of this work and the period of time in which Tennyson took to complete it speaks volumes as to the personal impact of the loss of such a close friend. Central to this work is an examination of death and spirituality as part of the grieving process. Tennyson's psyche can be seen transforming through the course of this work. What begins as a spirit filled with doubt and despair transforms into one of faith and hope by the end of the work. \\"In Memoriam A. H. H.\\" is a powerful examination of death and loss, one in which the author exposes a very personal process of how he dealt with the loss of one of his closest friends.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YYztrQEACAAJ&dq=In+Memoriam.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Izzy's Fire: Finding Humanity In The Holocaust","description":"Edna Ipson, Holocaust survivor, now 93 years old, sees her familys story of struggle and survival recorded and published. Brunswick Publishing has just released Izzys Fire: Finding Humanity in the Holocaust by Nancy Wright Beasley, which focuses mainly on the Ipson familys life in hiding in a Lithuanian farmers potato field.The book depicts how 13 members of five Jewish families survived the Holocaust through their own ingenuity and the generosity of a poor Catholic farm family. All 13 Jews ended up living in a 9x12x4 underground hole as World War II raged around them. Some lived underground for about seven months before being liberated by the Russian Army.Dr. Michael Berenbaum, project director of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (1988-1993) and author of The World Must Know: The History of the Holocaust as Told in the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum, says, Izzys Fire is filled with the passion of one woman determined to do justice to the story of another woman who lived in hiding throughout the war years. The war has soul. One feels the intensity of the struggle to survive. One senses the decency of those who were ready to rescue and the evil that haunted a mother and father and their young child in the dangerous world they lived. Nancy Wright Beasley has told a powerful story with dignified restraint. She has given voice to an underreported side of the Holocaust life in hiding. Adriana Trigiani, author of the best selling Big Stone Gap trilogy, offered early praise for the book. According to Trigiani, Nancy is a passionate, dedicated writer who has written a searing story, sure to capture readers with Izzy's Fire. She proves herself to be a storyteller who uses firsthand accounts and research with equal resolve. Beasley draws from personal interviews, research and numerous memoirs, including extensive memoirs from Israel Izzy Ipson, who helped his family escape from Kovno Ghetto, one of the most notorious killing fields for Jews in Lithuania. The Ipps, as they were known then, relocated to Richmond following their liberation and later changed their name to Ipson. The story has been re-created at the Virginia Holocaust Museum in Richmond, Virginia.Izzys Fire, which encompasses Virginia Standards of Learning at a variety of levels, will be taught as a pilot project in several eighth grade language arts classes in Chesterfield County public schools during the 2004-05 school term.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PSoAXra49S0C&dq=Izzy%27s+Fire:+Finding+Humanity+In+The+Holocaust&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hypnobirthing Bundle for Happy Hypnomoms and Blissful Hypnobabies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Principles and Techniques of Patient Care","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blame Me on History","description":"The coming-of-age of a black intellectual under apartheid.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6CZbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Blame+Me+on+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World Book of Word Power","description":"These volumes have been developed specifically to help you increase your overall ability to use words. \\"Word Power\\", the collection of skills and techniques that enable a person to communicate effectively, is perhaps the most vital area for personal growth that you will ever encounter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IWJMxTctg8EC&dq=The+World+Book+of+Word+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas Aquinas: An Evangelical Appraisal","description":"Norman L. Geisler reintroduces evangelicals to the man they forgot,  clarifying Aquinas' teachings about the nature of God, Scripture, faith, reason, and other key issues of apologetics and ethics. Aquinas, the author argues, is a more articulate defender of the faith than anyone in our midst.  Roman Catholic Aquinas scholar Robert N. Campbell observes that Geisler makes a good case for his message that the writings of Aquinas can be of great value to today's Protestant and Roman Catholic philosophers and theologians.  The book gives an understandable presentation of many of Aquinas' major contributions and shows how they are relevant, at times even crucial, to contemporary discussion,  adds Winfried Corduan of Taylor University. In the process Geisler strikes a credible blow against the current unfounded prejudice toward St. Thomas in evangelical thought.

Lee in Texas","description":"Robert E. Lee In Texas introduces a little known phase of the great General s career his service in Texas during the four turbulent years just preceding the Civil War at Camp Cooper, watching the federal government s  humanizing  experiment with the wild Comanches; at San Antonio, commanding the Department of Texas; and at Fort Mason, headquarters of the Second United States Cavalry. In this account Carl Coke Rister, a leading historian of the West, takes us with Lee to his lonely posts on the border, and we share with him the hazardous and often fruitless chases after renegade Indians and Mexican bandits. We see through the eyes of the  Academy man  the raw life on the frontier and hear from his lips his impressions of the country and people. These were critical years for the nation and for the future military leader of the Confederacy. When Lieutenant Colonel Robert Edward Lee was transferred from the superintendency of West Point to Camp Cooper on an Indian frontier, where isolation, rawness, inconvenience, deprivation, and even death were commonplace, it seemed to him and to some of his friends that his military career was coming to a dead end. Nevertheless, while he was  lost on the frontier,  he gained strength, wisdom, and maturity. He worked with, and for the most part commanded, the famous Second Cavalry, many of the officers of which became either Northern or Southern field commanders in the Civil War. To know these officers, their points of strength and weakness, their whims and caprices, and their likes and dislikes served him well later in military crises. When in 1861 Lee came from the Texas wilderness to report to General Winfield Scott in Washington, he was prepared to assume the role of the South s peerless leader to justify General Scott s Mexican War characterization of him as  America s very best soldier.

Just as Deng Xiaoping's better advertised experiment with market- based reforms has challenged Marxist-Leninist dogma on economic policy, the years since the death of Mao Zedong have seen a profound reexamination of a more basic question: to what extent are the root problems of the system due to Chinese socialism and Marxism generally? Here Yan Sun gathers a remarkable group of primary materials, drawn from an unusual range of sources, to present the most systematic and comprehensive study of post-Mao reappraisal of China's socialist theory and practice. Rejecting an assumption often made in the West, that Chinese socialist thought has little bearing on politics and policymaking, Sun takes the arguments of the post-Mao era seriously on their own terms. She identifies the major factions in the debate, reveals the interplay among official and unofficial forces, and charts the development of the debate from an initially parochial concern with problems raised by Chinese practice to a grand critique of the theory of socialism itself. She concludes with an enlightening comparison of the reassessments undertaken by Deng Xiaoping with those of Gorbachev, linking them to the divergent outcomes of reform and revolution in their respective countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nGPmtO5YA0QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sins of the Mother: An Alison Young Thriller","description":"Psychologist, philanthropist, and family advocate Cheryl Saban, Ph.D., is on a mission!

The procedure is used as a preventive measure against aging and a means by which bodies, particularly women s, can be transformed and  improved  through the appearance of youth. But why is Botox so popular, and why is aging such a terrifying concept? Botox Nation draws from engaging, in-depth interviews with Botox users and providers as well as Dana Berkowitz s own experiences receiving the injections. The interviews reveal the personal motivations for using Botox and help unpack how anti-aging practices are conceived by, and resonate with, everyday people. Berkowitz is particularly interested in how Botox is now being targeted to younger women; since Botox is a procedure that must be continually administered to work, the strategic choice to market to younger women, Berkowitz argues, aims to create lifetime consumers. Berkowitz also analyzes magazine articles, advertisements, and even medical documents to consider how narratives of aging are depicted. She employs a critical feminist lens to consider the construction of feminine bodies and selves, and explores the impact of cosmetic medical interventions aimed at maintaining the desired appearance of youth, the culture of preventative medicine, the application of medical procedures to seemingly healthy bodies, and the growth and technological advancement to the anti-aging industry. The first in-depth social investigation into the development of Botox as a phenomenon, Botox Nation is a captivating and critical story of how norms about bodies, gender, and aging are constructed and reproduced on both cultural and individual levels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fi1uDQAAQBAJ&dq=Botox&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Frog Princess (Tales of the Frog Princess)","description":"Enter E.D.

By an appropriate mathematical generalization of the concept of scalar fermion-numbers (i.e., replace the number f by a 2 by 2 matrix F, where f & F are both square-roots of unity) one arrives at a new organizing principle for fundamental fermions. Using this principle, it is possible to describe individual flavors, flavor doublets & families, of fundamental fermions, in the context of a new internal, non-Euclidean (i.e., \\"Lorentzian\\") 2-space. Certain algebraic & geometric properties of this 2-space automatically explain family replication & the number (three) of families observed in nature. Moreover, with respect to the internal transformation F, the e-type (mu- or tau-type) neutrino is found to have the same topology as a cylinder (Mobius strip). Assuming that a change in topology during neutrino-neutrino transitions is suppressed (e.g., a doughnut cannot be continuously deformed into a sphere), it is easy to calculate a matrix describing long-distance neutrino mixtures (see aps1999feb12_001 at http://publish.aps.org/eprint).

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. The aim of this book is to list every reference to William Blake published between 1757 and 1863 and every criticism and edition of his works from the beginning to the present. Partly because of the deluge of scholarship in the last forty years, it includes perhaps twice as many titles as Sir Geoffrey Keynes's great bibliography of 1921. An introductory essay on the history of Blake scholarship puts the most significant works into perspective, indicates the best work that has been done, and points to some neglected areas. In addition, all the most important references and many of the less significant ones are briefly annotated as to subject and value. Because many of the works are difficult to locate, specimen copies of all works published before 1831 have been traced to specific libraries. Each of Blake's manuscripts is also traced to its present owner. Two areas which have received relatively novel attention are early references to Blake (before 1863) and important sale and exhibition catalogues of his works. In both areas there are significant number of important entries which have not been noticed before by Blake scholars. The section on Blake's engravings for commercial works receives especially detailed treatment.

Bush nor Congress are willing to confront that America s reckless spending, disastrous deficits, and exploding debt are speeding our great nation to financial ruin. Imagine a world in which you lose your job because your company goes under, your retirement money disappears, the value of your home tumbles overnight, your bank stops allowing cash withdrawals, and your ATM card is canceled. The price of groceries has risen so fast that you don t have the money to pay for them at the check-out counter . . . and the country is bankrupt. That is exactly the future that economist Gerald J. Swanson sees America hurtling toward unless we rein in our country s reckless spending. In America the Broke, Swanson, coauthor of the runaway New York Times bestseller Bankruptcy 1995, argues that the United States is on the brink of financial collapse. Thanks to George W. Bush s two tax cuts, the White House and Congress  escalation of domestic spending, two wars, and an economic recession, what was a $200 billion annual surplus three years ago under Bill Clinton has become a river of red ink. The White House s official projected deficit for 2004 is $521 billion the largest deficit in U.S. history. With a national debt spiraling upward of $7.3 trillion, a huge trade deficit, and personal debt at an all-time high, we are standing at the edge of a financial abyss that could undermine the financial security of our families and our children s children.  Deficits don t matter,  claim Vice President Dick Cheney and other members of the Bush Administration. But the facts revealed in America the Broke paint an alarming picture. Next year s projected deficit will exceed the amount all our cities spend on police, fire protection, medical care, and every other civil service in an entire year. It is more than we could save from abolishing Medicare and Medicaid completely. The real deficit the deficit the government doesn t want you to know about including the hidden funds we  borrow  from Social Security is nearly $1 trillion. Rising interest rates alone could trigger staggering payments on our skyrocketing debt, soaking up every dollar the government takes in, leaving America bankrupt. What does this mean for you and me? If the dollar goes into free fall, banks could close, businesses go bankrupt, real estate values crumble, and middle-class families could lose everything they own. But there is hope. We can save ourselves if we demand that our political leaders act now to eliminate the deficit and reduce the debt. In a year of deficit denial, America the Broke is a critical wake-up call regarding our government s reckless deficit spending as well as a blueprint for rescuing our economy and saving our country","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nOscx-RpriEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Ulysses","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Microsoft ASP.NET Fast & Easy Web Development","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Feeding the Poor:Assessing Federal Food Aid","description":"In the midst of the welfare reform revolution, Peter H.

She was born Mary Dunne. A New York actress in a stalled career, she s previously been known as Maria and Martha. Married three times, she s also been called Mrs. Phelan, Mrs. Bell, and currently, Mrs. Terence Lavery wife of the esteemed playwright. No wonder Mary Dunne forgot her name this morning at the hairdresser. She has no idea who she is anymore. Or maybe she s just crazy. She s curious to find out. Over the course of a single day, Mary tries to recall more than her name. But as memories of her past come trickling back infuriating, illuminating, and grievous she realizes there s so much she d prefer to forget. As she tries to escape what she calls  the dooms,  Mary must confront what she s done with her life deliberately, haplessly, or by default. If only she were going crazy; it would be so much easier to explain it all away. Hailed by the Globe and Mail as a  feminist novel written before the wave of feminist novels began,  I Am Mary Dunne is  as complex and satisfying as anything Moore has yet done  (The Observer).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vKdLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials for the Activity Professional in Long Term Care","description":"This textbook outlines key subject matter for activity professionals in the long term care setting, who are in training or are already working in the field.

OBSCURE BOOKS PRESS has now re-published it using the original text. Gypsy Rickwood wrote this book \\"for the English speaking public in the hope that would give good counsel to many, and some amusement to those who regard it simply as a game.\\" His method is a very old one, practiced by wandering tribes of gypsies long before it was ever set down roughly on paper, and the answers to the questions have been slightly modernized by the original translator. One hundred and twenty five pages are divided into the fifty four questions which a fortune teller is most likely to be asked. These are almost always on four main subjects: - Concerning Life. - Concerning Love. - Concerning Chance. - The Last Lap. (Old age and the distant Future.) The gypsy's reply depends upon a turn of the card, with some 3000 answers listed in the book. The author emphasises that the accuracy of the answers depends largely on the sincerity of the questioner. If questions of an unsuitable nature are asked, the answers should be given in the same frivolous vein! This is a most entertaining little book which will prove both a source of amusement to some and thought provoking to others. \\"From the truth to a lie is but a hands-breadth.\\" Romany Proverb.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ALH_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An introduction to mathematics (A Galaxy book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Introduction to mathematical philosophy (A Clarion book)","description":"Work focuses on concepts of number, order, relations, limits and continuity, propositional functions, descriptions and classes, more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YLFFAAAAYAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+mathematical+philosophy+(A+Clarion+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece","description":"Told with consummate skill by the writer of the bestselling, award-winning A Civil Action, The Lost Painting is a remarkable synthesis of history and detective story. An Italian village on a hilltop near the Adriatic coast, a decaying palazzo facing the sea, and in the basement, cobwebbed and dusty, lit by a single bulb, an archive unknown to scholars. Here, a young graduate student from Rome, Francesca Cappelletti, makes a discovery that inspires a search for a work of art of incalculable value, a painting lost for almost two centuries. The artist was Caravaggio, a master of the Italian Baroque. He was a genius, a revolutionary painter, and a man beset by personal demons. Four hundred years ago, he drank and brawled in the taverns and streets of Rome, moving from one rooming house to another, constantly in and out of jail, all the while painting works of transcendent emotional and visual power. He rose from obscurity to fame and wealth, but success didn t alter his violent temperament. His rage finally led him to commit murder, forcing him to flee Rome a hunted man. He died young, alone, and under strange circumstances. Caravaggio scholars estimate that between sixty and eighty of his works are in existence today. Many othersno one knows the precise numberhave been lost to time. Somewhere, surely, a masterpiece lies forgotten in a storeroom, or in a small parish church, or hanging above a fireplace, mistaken for a mere copy. Prizewinning author Jonathan Harr embarks on an spellbinding journey to discover the long-lost painting known as The Taking of Christits mysterious fate and the circumstances of its disappearance have captivated Caravaggio devotees for years. After Francesca Cappelletti stumbles across a clue in that dusty archive, she tracks the painting across a continent and hundreds of years of history. But it is not until she meets Sergio Benedetti, an art restorer working in Ireland, that she finally manages to assemble all the pieces of the puzzle. Praise for The Lost Painting  Jonathan Harr has gone to the trouble of writing what will probably be a bestseller . . . rich and wonderful. . . . In truth, the book reads better than a thriller. . . . If you're a sucker for Rome, and for dusk . . . [you'll] enjoy Harr's more clearly reported details about life in the city.  The New York Times Book Review  Jonathan Harr has taken the story of the lost painting, and woven from it a deeply moving narrative about history, art and taste and about the greed, envy, covetousness and professional jealousy of people who fall prey to obsession. It is as perfect a work of narrative nonfiction as you could ever hope to read.

Its phrases, idioms, and expressions paint a comprehensive picture of the mind-set that enabled the Jews of Europe to survive a millennium of unrelenting persecution: they never stopped kvetching---about God, gentiles, children, food, and everything (and anything) else. They even learned how to smile through their kvetching and express satisfaction in the form of complaint. In Born to Kvetch, Michael Wex looks at the ingredients that went into this buffet of disenchantment and examines how they were mixed together to produce an almost limitless supply of striking idioms and withering curses (which get a chapter all to themselves). Born to Kvetch includes a wealth of material that's never appeared in English before. You'll find information on the Yiddish relationship to food, nature, divinity, and humanity. There's even a chapter about sex. This is no bobe mayse (cock-and-bull story) from a khokhem be-layle (idiot, literally a \\"sage at night\\" when no one's looking), but a serious yet fun and funny look at a language that both shaped and was shaped by those who spoke it. From tukhes to goy, meshugener to kvetch, Yiddish words have permeated and transformed English as well. Through the idioms, phrases, metaphors, and fascinating history of this kvetch-full tongue, Michael Wex gives us a moving and inspiring portrait of a people, and a language, in exile.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d1EnrsjzBMUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christian Mom's Idea Book: Hundreds of Ideas, Tips, and Activities to Help You Be a Great Mom","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Seven Gothic Tales (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Edgar Cayce on Prophecy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery","description":"Describes how the abolitionist used his influence and his weekly newspaper to motivate two generations of activists fighting against slavery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3F_hIAAACAAJ&dq=All+on+Fire:+William+Lloyd+Garrison+and+the+Abolition+of+Slavery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul's Rhetoric in Its Contexts: The Argument of Romans","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sayings of the Buddha: The Dhammapada","description":"Trembling and quivering is the mind, Difficult to guard and hard to restrain. The person of wisdom sets it straight, As a fletcher does an arrow. The Dhammapada introduced the actual utterances of the Buddha nearly twenty-five hundred years ago, when the master teacher emerged from his long silence to illuminate for his followers the substance of humankind s deepest and most abiding concerns. The nature of the self, the value of relationships, the importance of moment-to-moment awareness, the destructiveness of anger, the suffering that attends attachment, the ambiguity of the earth s beauty, the inevitability of aging, the certainty of deaththese dilemmas preoccupy us today as they did centuries ago. No other spiritual texts speak about them more clearly and profoundly than does the Dhammapada. In this elegant new translation, Sanskrit scholar Glenn Wallis has exclusively referred to and quoted from the canonical suttasthe presumed earliest discourses of the Buddhato bring us the heartwood of Buddhism, words as compelling today as when the Buddha first spoke them. On violence: All tremble before violence./ All fear death./ Having done the same yourself,/ you should neither harm nor kill. On ignorance: An uninstructed person/ ages like an ox,/ his bulk increases,/ his insight does not. On skillfulness: A person is not skilled/ just because he talks a lot./ Peaceful, friendly, secure/ that one is called  skilled.  In 423 verses gathered by subject into chapters, the editor offers us a distillation of core Buddhist teachings that constitutes a prescription for enlightened living, even in the twenty-first century. He also includes a brilliantly informative guide to the versesa chapter-by-chapter explication that greatly enhances our understanding of them. The text, at every turn, points to practical applications that lead to freedom from fear and suffering, toward the human state of spiritual virtuosity known as awakening. Glenn Wallis s translation is an inspired successor to earlier versions of the suttas. Even those readers who are well acquainted with the Dhammapada will be enriched by this fresh encounter with a classic text.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oVJX9IB2WKoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art Restoration: The Culture, the Business, the Scandal","description":"The world s art heritage is under attack from the very people charged with its preservation, argues this important book, which has ignited controversy among art historians, curators, and restorers. In the world s museums and in towns and cities throughout Europe, misguided restoration efforts are having irreversible, often tragic effects on masterpieces by Piero della Francesca, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and many other artists. What roles do aesthetic, institutional, and commercial factors play in the decision to restore a work of art? How can we prevent or halt projects in which a work of art is not restored but irreparably damaged? James Beck and Michael Daley explore these questions in the context of restoration projects in Florence, at the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and in museums in France, England, and the United States. They sound an alarm that must be heeded if we are to preserve the world s art for future generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1dCNKgAACAAJ&dq=Art+Restoration:+The+Culture,+the+Business,+the+Scandal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"C Programming (The Peter Norton Programming Series)","description":"Now updated to cover the latest assembler versions, with more code than ever, this bestselling classic is for every programmer who wants to build complete, full-scale assembly language programs.

An alternative view casts Spanish American intellectuals in a far more reactionary role. Here, it is suggested that the elaboration of inert popular stereotypes such as the stoic Indian and the heroic gaucho has resulted in an infinite postponement of authentic cultural identity, and a perpetuation, aided by intellectuals, of a social order in which popular demands were either ignored or repressed. In the context of this debate, this book explores the roles played by intellectuals in the creation of popular national identities in twentieth-century Spanish America, and seeks to identify the factors which lie behind two such contrasting evaluations of their contribution. Ranging across the intellectual centers of Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and Peru, it illustrates vividly the diversity and evolution of intellectual life in the region. Particular attention is paid to the idea of peripheral modernity and its influence on intellectual activity, as well as to the contributions made by intellectuals to the three major strands in debates on popular national identity: bi-culturalism, anti-imperialism and history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JQufpqD7BBUC&dq=In+the+Shadow+of+the+State:+Intellectuals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Morningstar Guide to Mutual Funds: 5-Star Strategies for Success","description":"Praise for Morningstar Guide to Mutual Funds \\"Picking actively managed mutual funds is no mean challenge.

This volume examines metaphors for revolution in the storm, flood, and harvest imagery ubiquitous in Russian literary works. At the same time, it considers the struggle to own the narrative of modernity, including Bolshevik weaponization of language and cultural policy that supported the use of terror and social purging. This uniquely cross-disciplinary study conducts a close reading of texts that use storm, flood, and agricultural metaphors in diverse ways to represent revolution, whether in anticipation and celebration of its ideals or in resistance to the same. A spotlight is given to the lives and works of authors who responded to Soviet authoritarianism by reclaiming the narrative of revolution in the name of personal freedom and restoration of humanist values. Hinging on the clashes of culture wars and class wars and residing at the intersection of ideas at the very core of the fight for modernity, this book provides a critical reading of authoritarian discourse and investigates rare examples of the counter narratives that thrived in spite of their suppression.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xOgJEAAAQBAJ&dq=Russian+Language+Since+the+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Errors in English and Ways to Correct Them (Harpercollins Reference Library)","description":"A pocket handbook to grammar and language provides quick tips for effective communication with up-to-date language rules, simple structural approaches, usage guidelines, common spelling problems, and a reference to proofreader's marks.

Managing Translation Services looks at how to successfully make the change from being a single freelance translator to developing a translation company offering a range of value added services. The book is intended principally for those who presently work as a freelance translator with all the inherent limitations this presents in terms of income and being reliant on the limited range of skills that the individual can offer. While some business skills will have been accumulated by virtue of working in a commercial environment, the transition from being responsible for oneself and taking the bold step of employing additional resources can be quite daunting. However, the opportunities this offers in terms of income and personal satisfaction are considerable. This book considers the initial Ssteps towards business development, exploiting these opportunities and the rewards they can offer. Advice is given on setting up a translation business, organisational development, what a business plan needs to consider for successful growth, how quality management needs to be approached, managing human resources, customer relations and other topics. The book provides a wealth of ready-made examples of quality procedures, forms that support business management and sources of further information. It also considers an exit strategy and related long-term planning when disposing of the business. Managing Translation Services is based on the many years of experience gained by the author working as a staff translator, freelance translator, university lecturer in translation studies, and former head of an award-winning, ISO 9001 accredited company. As a result, it covers a range of management issues relating to providing professional translation services.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9urHczfC3Z0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Further Materials on Lewis Wetzel and the Upper Ohio Frontier: The Historical Narrative of George Edgington, Peter Henry's Account, The Narrative of ...

Thresher: The Story Behind History's Deadliest Submarine Disaster","description":"On the morning of April 10, 1963, the world's most advanced submarine was on a test dive off the New England coast when she sent a message to a support ship a thousand feet above her on the surface: experiencing minor problem . . . have positive angle . . . attempting to blow . . . Then came the sounds of air under pressure and a garbled message: . . . test depth . . . Last came the eerie sounds that experienced navy men knew from World War II: the sounds of a submarine breaking up and compartments collapsing.When she first went to sea in April of 1961, the U.S. nuclear submarine Thresher was the most advanced submarine at sea, built specifically to hunt and kill Soviet submarines. In The Death of the USS Thresher, renowned naval and intelligence consultant Norman Polmar recounts the dramatic circumstances surrounding her implosion, which killed all 129 men on board, in history's first loss of a nuclear submarine. This revised edition of Polmar's 1964 classic is based on interviews with the Thresher's first command officer, other submarine officers, and the designers of the submarine. Polmar provides recently declassified information about the submarine, and relates the loss to subsequent U.S. and Soviet nuclear submarine sinkings, as well as to the escape and rescue systems developed by the Navy in the aftermath of the disaster. The Death of the USS Thresher is a must-read for the legions of fans who enjoyed the late Peter Maas's New York Times best-seller The Terrible Hours.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jFJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Life In Leadership: From D-Day to Ground Zero: An Autobiography","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sunset Cookbook Classics","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Who Does She Think She Is?: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Computing Essentials 2004 Intro w/ PowerWeb & Interactive Companion","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Golden Bowl (volume 23 & 24) (Notable American Authors)","description":"Nearly thirty years in the making, The Library of America's eleven-volume edition of the complete fiction of Henry James now culminates with this authoritative volume collecting his final three finished works. Considered by James to be his most finely constructed novel, The Ambassadors (1903) recounts the attempts of a conscientious American to convince the son of a friend to return home from Paris-and in doing so plays the charm of the Old World against the provincialism of the New. In The Golden Bowl (1904), an American woman marries an Italian prince while her father unknowingly marries the prince's former mistress; James underscores both the fragility and strength of human ties and further develops what he once called the \\"complex fate, being an American.\\" Originally written for the stage but never produced, James reworked The Outcry (1911) into a highly successful comic novel of social manners that also deals with the ethics of art collecting. Included as an appendix is \\"The Married Son,\\" the chapter James contributed to The Whole Family (1908), a multi-author novel conceived by William Dean Howells and portraying a dysfunctional family whose struggles mirror the frustrated collaborative efforts of the book's twelve contributors.

Bunns patronage of Abraham Lincoln establishes an unknown connection between politics and business money in Lincolns career, but represents a moderate, even compassionate, political model that 30 years later during the career of Mark Hanna seemed quaint by comparison. This book offers a new look at the connections between business and political power that, in these troubled days of Enron-like scandals, ought to be widely read, and more widely practiced. Dr. Kurt A. Hohenstein, Esq., Professor, Hampden-Sydney College Andrew T.

In 1915, when Baxter was 33, he was arrested, sent to prison, then shipped under guard to Europe where he was forced to the front line against his will. Punished to the limits of his physical and mental endurance, Baxter was stripped of all dignity, beaten, starved and left for dead by the New Zealand military. In the final attempt to discredit him authorities consigned him to a mental institution, an experience that would haunt him for the rest of his life.

This picturesque lake, shaped like a dragon protecting its territory, has witnessed droughts, tornadoes, fishing tournaments, boat races, and even World War II aircraft crashes. Surrounded by its own unique history, Lake Martin also reflects the dynamic personalities of those who sacrificed childhood homes and family land to bring dreams of a prosperous future to fruition. Before the Tallapoosa River was dammed to feed Lake Martin's waters, it was an ideal environment for the Native Americans who resided on land now submerged. The land's history is rife with discord as British soldiers and Georgia Rangers resisted French spies in the early 1700s and migrant settlers defended their homefront during the Civil War. The Martin Dam became a state landmark by 1927, generating hydroelectric power while memorializing the 31-mile-long lake as the world's largest man-made body of water at the time. It was not long before Lake Martin evolved into a community enjoying unparalleled growth as a vacation site and permanent home for Americans who discovered the satisfaction lakeside living could provide. Lake Martin: Alabama's Crown Jewel chronicles the trials and triumphs of the people who created one of today's leading retirement communities through courageous choices and determination. The story is told through compelling narrative and evocative images, many of which have not been widely published.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ww7jgEACAAJ&dq=Lake+Martin:+Alabama%27s+Crown+Jewel+(AL)+(Making+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Helping Children Cope with the Death of a Parent: A Guide for the First Year (Contemporary Psychology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Landscape Gardening in Japan","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eJNRAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Convenient Arrangement (Romance Ser.)","description":"In the two years since his wife's death, Lord Sedgewick, has not remarried.

Can a cup of coffee reveal the face of God? Can it become the holy grail of modern-day knights errant who brave hardship and peril in a relentless quest for perfection? Can it change the world? These questions are not rhetorical. When highly prized coffee beans sell at auction for $50, $100, or $150 a pound wholesale (and potentially twice that at retail), anything can happen. In God in a Cup, journalist and late-blooming adventurer Michaele Weissman treks into an exotic and paradoxical realm of specialty coffee where the successful traveler must be part passionate coffee connoisseur, part ambitious entrepreneur, part activist, and part Indiana Jones. Her guides on the journey are the nation s most heralded coffee business hotshots: Counter Culture s Peter Giuliano, Intelligentsia s Geoff Watts, and Stumptown s Duane Sorenson. With their obsessive standards and fiercely competitive baristas, these roasters are creating a new culture of coffee connoisseurship in America a culture in which $10 lattes are both a purist s pleasure and a way to improve the lives of third-world farmers. If you love a good cup of coffee or a great adventure story you ll love this unprecedented up-close look at the people and passions behind today s best beans.  Weissman illustrates how the origin, flavor compounds and socioeconomic impact of a cup of coffee are relevant now more than ever. . . . Tagging along behind the main characters in today s specialty coffee scene, [she] travels from the exotic to the expected to artfully deconstruct the connoisseur s cup of coffee.

It has shaped its geography, controlled its economy and moulded its civilisation. The same stretch of water which conveyed Pharaonic battleships, Ptolemaic grain ships, Roman troop-carriers and Victorian steamers today carries modern-day tourists past bankside settlements in which rural life  fishing, farming, flooding  continues much as it has for millennia. At this most critical juncture in the country's history, foremost Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson takes us on a journey up the Nile, north from Lake Victoria, from Cataract to Cataract, past the Aswan Dam, to the delta. The country is a palimpsest, every age has left its trace: as we pass the Nilometer on the island of Elephantine which since the days of the Pharaohs has measured the height of Nile floodwaters to predict the following season's agricultural yield and set the parameters for the entire Egyptian economy, the wonders of Giza which bear the scars of assault by nineteenth-century archaeologists and the modern-day unbridled urban expansion of Cairo  and in Egypt's earliest art (prehistoric images of fish-traps carved into cliffs) and the Arab Spring (fought on the bridges of Cairo)  the Nile is our guide to understanding the past and present of this unique, chaotic, vital, conservative yet rapidly changing land.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q5KbAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Nile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Toasts: Jokes, Stories and Quotations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cM51swEACAAJ&dq=More+Toasts:+Jokes,+Stories+and+Quotations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Dojo: A Guide to the Rituals and Etiquette of the Japanese Martial Arts.","description":"A collection of essays by David Lowry that highlights the history and significance of the rituals, training costumes, objects, and relationships involved in Japanese martial arts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=noiBngEACAAJ&dq=In+the+Dojo:+A+Guide+to+the+Rituals+and+Etiquette+of+the+Japanese+Martial+Arts.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Maxwell Street Blues: A Paul Whelan Mystery (Paul Whelan Mysteries)","description":"In Chicago, PI Paul Whelan is hired by a lawyer to find missing Sam Burwell, last seen operating a booth in Maxwell Street's open-air flea market.

Topics include: The tantric view of human nature and the external world The special role of the guru, or tantric mentor The preliminary practices that prepare the student for full initiation The major dimensions of Vajrayana practice, including visualizations, liturgies, and inner yogas The tradition of the tulku, or incarnate lama The lore surrounding the death of ordinary people and of saints The practice of solitary retreat, the epitome of traditional Tibetan Buddhism Secret of the Vajra World is the companion volume to the author's earlier book, Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism.

Also, with its revealing look at the record business an industry that makes the rest of show business seem positively tame this book is as immediate as a new issue of Rolling Stone, as colorful as a good mystery, and as tart and explosive as a top-ten hit. Told with the gritty, up-close feel of a behind-the-scenes documentary film, this is the story of three young women who wanted to play rock and roll like the boys. It follows their coming together in the underground grunge-rock scene in Minneapolis, their early club days, and their discovery by Warner Bros. Records. It tracks their dramatic breakup (and reconfiguration), goes through the often funny, sometimes inspiring, and always emotional recording sessions for their album Fontanelle, and goes stage-side as they film their all-important video for MTV. Veteran journalist Neal Karlen was given unprecedented access to Warners marketing and strategy meetings, where he observed firsthand the star-making machinery that runs the pop music business. From punk rockers in the mosh pit to rock stars in mansions, Babes in Toyland contains revealing snapshots of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love, Soul Asylum's Dave Pirner, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, and R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, as well as Beavis and Butt-head, today's most powerful rock critics. Center-stage in this story are the members of Babes in Toyland: Kat Bjelland, the punk-rock poetess who'd dreamed of being a star since she was five years old; Lori Barbero, the dreadlocked drummer and band mother who was best friend to everybody in the alternative music scene; and Maureen Herman, the brainy bassist who struggled to fit in with the group.

At its center are two sisters: Yuri, a fashion model sleeping her way into oblivion; and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous Denny s into lives radically alien to her own: those of a jazz trombonist who claims they ve met before; a burly female  love hotel  manager and her maidstaff; and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These  night people  are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that Yuri s slumbermysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crime  will either restore or annihilate her. After Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agency  the interplay between self-expression and understanding, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love. Murakami s trademark humor, psychological insight, and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery.  Eyes mark the shape of the city. Through the eyes of a high-flying night bird, we take in the scene from midair. In our broad sweep, the city looks like a single gigantic creatureor more, like a single collective entity created by many intertwining organisms. Countless arteries stretch to the ends of its elusive body, circulating a continuous supply of fresh blood cells, sending out new data and collecting the old, sending out new consumables and collecting the old, sending out new contradictions and collecting the old. To the rhythm of its pulsing, all parts of the body flicker and flare up and squirm. Midnight is approaching, and while the peak of activity has indeed passed, the basal metabolism that maintains life continues undiminished, producing the basso continuo of the city s moan, a monotonous sound that neither rises nor falls but is pregnant with foreboding.   from After Dark","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T28ABqCQxIUC&dq=And+After+That,+the+Dark&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vanishing Voter: Public Involvement in an Age of Uncertainty","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"America One Step at a Time: A 3,400 Mile Walk in Search of America","description":"As seen on The Fine Living Channel's, Radical Sabbaticle TV program.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The girl's own book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The porch and the middle chamber: The book of the lodge","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RqBXAQAACAAJ&dq=The+porch+and+the+middle+chamber:+The+book+of+the+lodge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Crown of Anavrea","description":"In a time when castles were the strongest...in a place where combat was face to face...Labren was on the run.
