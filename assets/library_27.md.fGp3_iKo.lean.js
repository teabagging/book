Although our baby hasn't come yet I have 4 younger siblings and my mom used the sleep training methods promoted in this book on all of us and they work very well. It's hard to listen to babies cry themselves to sleep but it really is the only way they will learn to get themselves to sleep and the only way you will ever get some sleep. Discipline is just one of those things that you have to do as a parent.

This book was what I missed for a long time. Here is something what I've learned from this paperback:In the early days of automobiles, safety was virtually unheard of. For example, until the late 1940s automobiles used plate glass in the windshield and side glass. Early motor vehicle is little more than a speeding gas can with a sofa mounted on it. These cars used cotton batting, mohair and natural fibers to upholster and insulate the interior. These early vehicles would smolder, ignite and sustain a flame quite well. Much like the upholstered chairs or sofas found in the home, something as simple as an errantly discarded cigarette would ignite the material into a giant blazing inferno.Starting with the history of automotive safety, the book proceeds to contemporary cars, which consist of materials virtually inflammable, unless exposed to any kind of fire accelerant. Almost every substance of earth contains carbon in some form. If subjected to a high enough level of heat, pretty much everything will burn. Items thought to be not flammable such as steel and concrete become flammable if exposed to a 7000F (3500C) fire.Describing fire behavior basics, the books analyzes burning characteristics of exhaust system and underhood flammable liquids like gasoline and diesel fuel, power steering fluid, transmission fluid, hydraulic ride fluid, brake fluid, coolant, engine oil, windshield washing fluid. Ignition capabilities of air filters and fuel injection system is also analyzed. The book conduct an in-depth inquiry of electrical system and fire: battery, alternator, started motor, HVAC, engine ignition coil, electrical switch, solenoids, wiring looms, fuse and relay panel, etc.Targeted to fire investigators, the books describes engineer's principal job to determine if there exists a primary failed part which could have caused an operational mode fire, and to find arson indicators, since deliberate arson is a crime. The most common mistake ca perpetrator makes in deliberate arson is that a copious quantity of flammable liquid is splashed around the interior or the engine compartment and then ignited. The result will be a burn pattern which will be obviously greater than the available fuel load. The book completes with the chapter \\"Engineer in the courtroom\\", which describes proper investigation techniques, scene photography, forensic tools, subrogation issues, arbitration and the superior court action.I don't have a CD-ROM which seems to accompany this book."},{"Title":"Automotive Fire Analysis: An Engineering Approach","review":"I was recently referred to this book by a fellow investigator. After reading the book, I feel it is a great reference in respect to investigation of vehicle fires. The author provides insight into things to watch for during such investigations.

Since that time, I have used this book as a ready reference to numerous fires that I have investigated. While many of these fires involved vehicles, the publication also contains excellent information in regard to general fire investigation.I found this book to be very well written in terms that can be understood by lay people however at the same time, the information contained within can been very helpful under numerous circumstances. In addition, it also serves as a ready reference to many of the Society of Automotive Engineers Standards as well as the International Standards Organization.Ever since I have acquired this publication it has become part of my everyday investigative equipment. In the some 37 years I have been in the field of fire investigation, I wish I had more of this type of plainly written, very understandable and professionally compiled editions.I would suggest acquiring a copy of this book to anyone who is going to endeavor to investigate the origin and cause of vehicle fires. The information therein contained, including the scientific method, subrogation, appraisal and the Daubert decision, is also applicable to numerous other conditions which fire investigators are exposed to on an everyday basis. I feel this book should also be part of the information contained within any seminar which speaks to the field of fire investigation in motorized vehicles.Keep up the good work Mr. Barnett!Capt.

I use this book regularly in my work. It contains a great deal of information that is not available from other sources although some of the same information is available from other sources. I have checked the accuracy of the information when I have a question because I understood the subject differently. However, every time I have checked the information in an automotive context, I came to find I was incorrect. The chapter on Superior Court is one of the best when it comes to a full listing of Supreme Court Cases and the nuances of fire testimony for the CFI in court.I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to learn more about the subject of automotive fire. It is simply a different animal than structure fire."},{"Title":"Automotive Fire Analysis: An Engineering Approach","review":"I expected much more given the title of the book. Even considering the 2008 copyright date, some information is outdated. Digital cameras? No color photos? Most of the information is available from other sources which should be used due to regular updating. Over 25% of the book is devoted to citing codes, standards, listing definitions, discussion of case law, courtroom protocol, and basics. NFPA 921, which every fire investigator should have, covers the majority of of this much better. Good discussion of potential causes from vehicle components. No real discussion of fire origin area determination though some discussion of patterns which could have been greatly expanded as to their presence on metals and should have color photographs. Decent discussion of polymers and modern vehicle propulsion systems. Dwells too much on arson, though it is an important topic....\\"Signs\\" of arson can be very misleading though Mr. Barnett points out there can be innocent reasons for their presence. CD is interesting to watch, but again adds nothing new to others out there. The book jumps around in several areas which is confusing. The idea of the book is good but it would be better to have a flow from origin to cause to instruct on how to conduct a vehicle fire investigation. Overall, I was very disappointed in the book and feel that for the cost, the money could have better spent on other books out there."},{"Title":"Automotive Fire Analysis: An Engineering Approach","review":"I literally found glaring inaccuracies on every page. I intend to use this book in my future lectures as an example of the JUNK that is available on the market. I am angry that I paid full retail, a bit, but I really wonder how this got published. In fairness, there are a few items in the book that are at least good subjects to get the interested reader thinking, but it is amazing how the writer misuses terms, provides absolutely incorrect chemical information, makes statements regarding ignition of fluids and plastic components that are very wrong and clearly lack a foundation of the testing that he describes as important. The very worst thing about this book is that some people who are attempting to educate themselves in this field may rely on it as a source of information that, gained in the training stages of their career, they may then use in their own investigative endeavors and even teach this inaccurate info to others. Wow. I just can't say enough about why no one should buy this junk. Interestingly the author makes many curious comments about young drivers and users of automobiles that tend to define his own age. He also appears not to have discovered digital photography, and apparently has no understanding that digital has long superceded film in the forensic industry. Like another reviewer, I found that much of the book consists of \\"cut and paste\\" material from other publications, both private and public, and much of that material is way out of date. Look up the author. Note that, although he uses the term \\"engineer\\" often, he is not an engineer. Even though his company uses that term in their name! (Are you listening, California Board of Engineers?) And although he often refers (a bit snidely) to \\"fire investigators\\" and \\"certified fire investigators\\", he clearly is not one of those either."},{"Title":"The works of Ben Jonson","review":"The plays are mostly in verse, but the pages are laid out like prose.

To me the most useful chapter was the one for creating a wizard, and I was able to use that information to create interactive smart forms. I would have liked to see more on creating forms (what the author calls &quot;user forms&quot; - what we think of as VB forms) but at least there is some information. A plain VB book (such as John Smiley's &quot;Learn to Program with VB 6&quot;) is a good supplement to more advanced tasks a programmer might want to do. All in all, for someone with no programming experience, this is a useful book, easy to read and with plenty of exercises to practice with and a brief (could be longer) analysis of the code that accompanies each exercise."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Word 2000 Automation in 24 Hours (Sams Teach Yourself in 24 Hours Series)","review":"To be fair, it is not a bad book to learn Word/VBA.

Arguably, you already have this in the dev kit, but sometimes it's more convenient to just double check a book than to pop out your browser.The book tries to accomodate the changes coming in Jini 1.1 (currently in alpha), and while we can't predict what Sun has up its sleeve, the most significant changes only involve moving some packages around -- nothing that can't be fixed by just changing your &quot;import&quot; statements and doing a re-compile. Thus, I don't think this book will be obsoleted by 1.1.Important note: Jini is a fairly advanced topic. I think there's a basic assumption in this book that the reader is a strong Java programmer and has had at least some exposure to RMI, Beans (particularly the event model) and is willing to do something with a catch{} block other than System.exit(0). Arguably, that's an assumption not only of the authors, but of Jini itself."},{"Title":"Jini in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference","review":"Jini in a Nutshell is quite good book both for java developers and those who are familiar with CORBA or COM. The essence of network is open, connectivity and co-operation. Jini helps to do so. It is platform independence, the same as its super class: Java, which make it unique compared with other similar technologies. It is not just a dream with Jini that we can plug Jini devices into network and use services at the remote end of the network freely, anytime and anywhere. This book explains how to reach this dream. At the beginning, plenty of examples are listed to demonstrating the usage of RMI, directory service, remote events&iexcl;, clarifying the whole architecture and underlying mechanism of Jini. Then it comes to practice. Many sample codes are listed, as well as detailed explanation, which helps a programmer to master the idea behind those standardized classes and their interfaces, members, and methods. After I finish this book, I found I got the right way in how to build Jini applications and in finding more information about it. I always think this is what makes a books valuable and outstanding. The more I read the book on Jini, the more I believe Jini has its potential. For those who are eager to master the future, this book will be a good choice."},{"Title":"Jini in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference","review":"You know what you are getting with the typical O'Reilly &quot;Nutshell&quot; book, and this one is no exception. It's about half tutorial/introduction and half API/service reference and (just about) small enough to carry around. Just the facts, Ma'amThis edition covers Jini 1.0 in detail, with a glance at some of the 1.1 features. Don't let that worry you, though - Jini 1.1 and 1.2 only add a few new classes, services and tools, and a full understanding of Jini 1.0 is still vital. The introductory text is concise, and doesn't offer much by way of insight or experience. The examples in the tutorial are minimal and don't quite give enough information on installing and running the full set of services, but they cover enough of the API to be useful in almost all cases.If you need an API/service/tool reference for Jini 1.0, or a handy set of code snippets to solve your immediate head-scratchers, this is great. If you want to learn and understand Jini in depth or track the very latest API changes, you are better off with (for example) &quot;Core Jini&quot;."},{"Title":"Jini in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference","review":"This book is really not bad. It explains Jini in a straight forward manner, and is very useful for one that starts to learn Jini. It might be hard to understand for someone that knows Java and has no experiences in distributed objects, but don't blame the authors, distributed objects is not an easy topic. If it is the first touch to distributed objects, this book is NOT for you.This book is not sufficiently self-contained , readers should at least read the Jini specification to understand what the authors of this book try to explain.

His writing style is excellent and the book brings forth many truths.If I recall, he wrote this close to the time of the French Revolution as well as the birth of Marxism. So he had quite the perspective to compare what he knew with what he saw. As I read the book I kept feeling that this new America, was indeed the dream of what Toqueville desired.If you would like to learn more about an intelligent outsiders' view of early America, don't hesitate, buy this book. It's worth every dime."},{"Title":"Democracy In America, Volume 1","review":"This item is what it was represented to be, and I am most appreciative of the fact that I received what I paid for."},{"Title":"Democracy In America, Volume 1","review":"Interesting book written centuries ago with aspects that can still be seen in our modern society.

Barnett is a first-rate scholar and a skillful writer. She has studied in Germany and is an expert on Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Although she relies on a vast amount of research, the material is presented simply and directly. Rather than trying to inflame or lay blame on one person or institution or people, Barnett examines the historical and psychological elements of both individual and institutional behaviors and attitudes in Germany and Europe. Her approach is detailed, fair, and reasoned. In an honest and rational manner she presents all the factors that converged in Germany, beginning in the years immediately after World War I, to create Nazism and ultimately the &quot;final solution.&quot; This is a disturbing book. Almost from the first page you will find yourself looking into a mirror asking: &quot;Would I have been a bystander?&quot; &quot;Am I a bystander?&quot; Barnett's writing style is simple, direct, clear, and engrossing. However, don't be surprised if you fing it difficult to read more than a few pages at a time. Bystanders should be required reading in every Holocaust-studies, ethics, history and psychology class in every country in the world. If we can answer the questions &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; perhaps we save the world from another Hitler or another Holocaust. This book changed my life."},{"Title":"Bystanders: Conscience and Complicity During the Holocaust","review":"The author of this book is focused particularly on the phenomenon of the \\"bystander\\", not the perpetrators or the victims of the Holocaust. As such, it is an excellent study of the subject. I am reading it a second time, and this time around I am more aware that one area is dark: the complicity of corporations in the Holocaust. She does, however, discuss the failure of churches and NGOs to aid the Jews in their time of need, which amounts to a gross complicity. Corporations in the US and elsewhere were making Holorinth machine cards,selling the Germans autos, trucks, etc. But given the area of focus the author sets out in the beginning, it is an excellent study of its kind."},{"Title":"Genesis: The Beginning of Desire","review":"This is a truly wonderful book. This author draws on remarkable and broad fluency with text--from Shakespeare and Sartre to Harold Bloom, the Bible itself from Genesis to Chronicles, and rabbinic literature from the Tanhuma to Rashi to R. David Hutner. What pervades this textual fluency is a marvelous attention to language, to the words with which worlds are created.This book is no easy read. I recommend reading each chapter twice and highlighting or underlining, writing notes in the margins and discussing passages with a partner as you go. Active reading is required, but isn't that just what &quot;midrash,&quot; literally to &quot;search&quot; for the meanings of a text, is all about?This is a study of the book of Genesis but it is also a study of rabbinic midrashic exploration of the book of Genesis. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Genesis: The Beginning of Desire","review":"Avivah Gottleib Zornberg has compiled her essays on the weekly Parsha, and a lifetime of learning and teaching, to write these extraordinary commentaries on the Book of Genesis. She shares her own personal struggles for meaning &quot;to discover the ways in which life and text inform each other.&quot; With a particularly fluid writing style the author weaves together biblical, midrashic and literary sources - from Rashi to Shakespeare - and, for me, she makes Torah more accessible and brings biblical characters to life. The interpretations presented here are offered as alternative understandings to literal translations and not given as fact. The depth and detail with which Ms. Gottlieb Zornberg reanimates the texts of &quot;Bereshit,&quot; is extraordinary.

So much of what we get from the publishers today are works for beginners. In Lon Milo DuQuette's Angels, Demons, and Gods of the New Millennium we are fortunate to receive a work written for those who have more than a passing knowledge of Kabbalah, sorcery, and other arts of magick. Here is a book written with the authority of experience, yet without the overbearing weight of received truth. DuQuette speaks to us as if we were guests in his home who share his love of magick. Knowing the groundwork is already covered, he shares the fruit of long thought about, and experience of, magickal practice.DuQuette writes with a different voice from those of the greater lights of early in this century. His style has the personal qualities of Israel Regardie's but in the '90s it is just not possible to speak with such certainty. Instead DuQuette writes from experience, from successes and failures. He digests all this down to what he feels is important, even if the outcome doesn't fit the usual interpretations.For example, DuQuette plays with both conceptions of the AA (Argenteum Astrum): the group of people who worked with Aleister Crowley and his students on the one hand, and, on the other, the body of initiates that has been guiding humanity towards enlightenment since time immemorial. DuQuette raises the logical point that if this organization has been present &quot;since the dawn of consciousness&quot; and has been embodied in such great souls as Lao-Tse, the Buddha, and Pythagoras, then how can access to it be limited to those with pieces of paper signed by Crowley and his heirs? DuQuette moves the AA to a more immediate plane, where any student with right aspiration can find herself in the great chain of initiates.DuQuette's chapter on the Kabbalah is more basic than most others in this book, but it is pithy enough to give anyone a leg up on the study and practice of the discipline. He avoids the usual formulaic definitions of the sefirot and other components of this tradition by speaking from the distilled essence of his experience. One excellent display of his skill is his presentation of the Shem ha-Mephorash, the 72-fold divided Name of God from which a series of spirit names are generated. DuQuette boils down the abundance of turgid writing on this subject to a few pages accompanied by a chart, which Weiser obligingly prints in color in a foldout sheet. This, combined with the methodology presented in the later chapter &quot;Demons Are Our Friends,&quot; provides a sufficient, though sparse, basis for sorcery, the practice of spirit conjuring.A practice more common in theology than in magick is textual exegesis. DuQuette engages this discipline by explicating the Emerald Tablet of Hermes in light of the doctrine of the Holy Guardian Angel, the practice of seeking contact with the divine through a personal source, one's own angel. In his analysis DuQuette interprets the alchemical process of the Tablet as a way of attaining to knowledge and conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel - a key component of Crowley's magick.Such analyses are a necessary step in the evolution of magickal thought and practice. We can only improve on our methods by engaging with classical texts and practices in the light of our own experience; doing so illuminates the depths that we have intuited in these sources. Having no formal academy in which to share our insights, we are aided by DuQuette's book. He has moved our understanding of magick forward.Reviewed by Sam Webster, GNOSIS MAGAZINE"},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"This book by Lon Milo DuQuette surprised me. Not because it is well written - I'd heard Lon's presentation at the Denver ATA in 1998 and had experienced the eloquence and energy he commands (whether aided by unnamed entities or not I do not know). What surprised me is that for the first time the Qabalah came alive for me. I had read parts of the major works on it before - Waite, Knight, Fortune and others - but it has always seemed a dry, over-elaborate, even disembodied, system to me. My study and practice, except for Tarot has been in Eastern systems. I am still not a Qabalist but now I am able to understand the appeal the Qabalah holds for others.Lon explains the methods of Qabalistic scriptural exegesis - system for transforming words into other words - in a way that brings out their spiritual power. The text derived by these methods is not necessarily more profound than the exoteric one. What is important is that the process reveals a universe rich in interconnections which increase the more one seeks them.The value of the method is the process of seeking and finding these interconnections. This was an important insight for me because it does away with the objection that the correlation's found are arbitrary. They may seem arbitrary but the divine becomes present in the act of finding these correlation's. What starts out seeming to the random if found unexpectedly to reveal the cosmic order.Although Lon does not discuss Tarot, something like this occurs in Tarot divination. Suppose the spread includes the 4 of swords. Somehow a piece of cardboard with a peculiar picture connects to a late twentieth century person's need for respite from conflict. This is the miracle of divine intelligence operating in our lives and Lon's book made me able to see for the first time how Qabalah manifests this. His way of using Qabalah also resembles Tarot reading in that it is an active process, not simply study.Lon wears his extensive learning lightly in contrast with too many books on Qabalah which are ponderous, humorless and inflated. It could be said that the combines the authority of the Hierophant with the skill of the Magician and the playful charm of the Fool.Buddhism divides students into those of superior, average and inferior ability. With respect to Qabalah, I must acknowledge that I fall into the last category. This book's achievement is that it can reach even students like myself. I recommend it highly to anyone curious about Qabalah.Review by Geoffrey Redmond, CTR From The ATA Newsletter A publication of the American Tarot Association Vol. IV NO. 1 Winter, 1999"},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"I have to admit, I am a fan of Lon Milo Duquette. His 1993 THE MAGICK OF THELEMA is unquestionably the best introduction to the work of Aleister Crowley ever written. My only complaint is that he didn't write it ten years earlier. He not only filled in countless gaps in my magical education he did it with an easy-going manner that made this complex and serious subject seem more than interesting...he actually made it fun.Now, to my absolute delight, in his new book ANGELS, DEMONS &amp; GODS OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM, Lon Milo Duquette surpasses all his earlier efforts and unleashes his wit and insight on the most fundamental elements of modern magick and the spiritual significance of the New Age. The publisher, Samuel Weiser, calls it a &quot;liberal arts education in Wester Hermeticism.&quot; That is not an exaggeration, However, ANGELS, DEMONS, etc., is much more. It is a magical experience in and of itself.Is the Hebrew Qabalah the Zen of the West? What are angels and demons? Why on earth would a sane person want to deal with them? What makes the New Age the &quot;New Age?&quot; With disarming charm Duquette gently draws you into the introspective world of the modern magician, tickles you with hilarious observations and self-effacing confessions, then (often in the same paragraph) he slams you in the heart with breathtaking profundities.The book is fully illustrated with charts and timelines including a magnificant full color fold out diagram of the angels of the Shem ha-mephorash, Goetic demons and their place in the zodiac and the tarot.I have no doubts ANGELS, DEMONS &amp; GODS OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM (like THE MAGICK OF THELEMA) will become a classic. There is nothing in the field of esoteric literature quite like it...Perhaps because there are no modern magical writers quite like Lon Milo DuQuette"},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"Although Angels, Demons, and Gods of the New Millenium is not directly about the classical Golden Dawn System, it is none-the-less a valuable book for the student of Western Magic to have. And while the author is a Thelemite, the material in this book is not presented in an overtly Thelemic fashion. Lon Milo DuQuette has been practicing magic for over 30 years, currently heads the Heru-Ra-Ha O.T.O. temple in Southern California, and has vast insights and experience with the Qabalah, Enochian Magic, and techniques of magical evocation.As the subtitle of the book, &quot;Musings on Modern Magick&quot; suggests, this is actually a collection of essays on a variety of magical subjects including Qabalah, the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, the Procession of the Equinoxes, the pantheons of the Astrological Ages, Initiation, and the Goetic system of evocation. These essays are very easy to read because while Mr. Duquette takes these subjects very seriously, he does not take himself seriously. His light-hearted and self-effacing style is a welcome relief in a world of dauntingly deep and difficult texts on magic.Along with the essays in the book are a number of illustrations, tables, and diagrams. Most notable among these is a full-color fold-out diagram of the 72 Angels of the Shemhamporesch and the 72 Demons of the Goetia. This diagram shows their correlation in a way that is suitable for creating practical workings and is worth the price of the book alone.Mr. DuQuette's book is also very insightful in that it provides a glimpse into the creation and growth of a magician. His journey is presented in such a way that it is not over the head of a Neophyte, yet is filled with enough magical knowledge to keep the seasoned magician interested. Overall, Angels, Demons, and Gods of the New Millenium is a thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening look at the world of a true magician."},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"DuQuette has offered both a theoretical and pragmatic view of the Thelemic worldview for the would be Occultist. He begins with a brief explanation of his own Thelemic ideal in chapter one appropriately entitled \\"Confession\\" and as he progresses thru the book, each chapter subsequently offers his own opinion on how he has assimilated these theories into a workable and reliable form of personal Occultism.When we arrive in chapter two - \\"Qabalah, Zen of the West\\" - we shown that one can indeed feel not only comfortable with using but also with applying the Qabala to our daily lives by one who is as Western as it gets. What will help the neophyte is how DuQuette explains the complex arts of Gematria & Notariqon & Temura. These are Occult techniques whereby the student can take a word and translate it into a number and by doing so, see how it is related to other words that add up to the same number. Notariqon has to do with generating words from the beginning letters of a passage of scripture and Temura has to do with substituting one letter for another. While I have readthe methodology from other authors, DuQuette does a fine job of explaining in simplified terms.One of my favorite chapters is the third one wherein DuQuette discourses on the nature of the Holy Guardian Angel that each one of us allegedly has. Interestingly enough, the author shares his thoughts on how some non-Occultists have apparently achieved success without any Occult rites or practices. In fact, DuQuette gives his own theory as to how the individual can make the necessary contact with his/her own HGA purely thru constant thought and desire. His logic is well founded and workable.Finally the last chapter I truly enjoyed was \\"Demons Are Our Friends\\"! Here again this from a man who has DONE the requisite work and experienced first hand accounting of the Spirits. He is not a sit-by type of armchair theorist whose only pretending knowledge of the Goetia Spirits is purely speculative. And he confirms my own belief that \\"the whole technique of summoning and evocation is purely a matter of artistic taste.\\" One can venture into the realm of needing pentacles of protection, robes, wands, etc., and vocalizing all of the conjurations by rote memory because they're romantically enflamed by that mindset OR the practitioner can use Occam's Razor to cut to the quick of the matter and use only what is absolutely necessary to call for such Spirits.All in all, this book is excellent and well worth the investment. I give it five stars as it does include a nice bibliography and an index."},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"DuQuette does it again, where 'My Life with the Spirits' is an autobiographical account of his life, this work goes deeper into his practice and philosophy in a series of essays and articles bound together in one little volume. It's more informative and informational, less entertaining, but still with his unmistakable whimsical style that educates you through your giggles. The last chapter of the book is sincerely invaluable to the practicing Mage. Plus, finally a decent last word on the 'Are demons actual external entities, or internal psychological constructs of the human psyche' question.An outstanding work that is sure to be an Occult Classic deserving of a prominent place in EVERY magical bookshelf, regardless of your preferred magical/philosophical current."},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"His website shameless promotes himself, more people need to shamelessly promote this book. Chock full of brilliant insights into Cabalistic and Thelemic magic (and my fave, &quot;Demons Are Our Friends&quot; about Goetic Magick). This book is written for the more experienced practicioner which, in itself--in an time when nearly all books on Magick include mindless crap like arguing for the legitimacy for magick and then introducing the basics, like the LPBR--makes this book a Diety send!Buy it."},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"Students of the Western Mystery tradition and fans of DuQuette will be eager for this newest offering from one of the foremost Thelemic ritualists of our day. Seven chapters, each one a separate monograph, address topics critical to understanding modern magic. Though the author takes the subject of ceremonial magick very seriously, he tries not to take himself too seriously at all. He writes from his own experience, and his work is filled with humor, common sense, and valuable insight into this arcane world. Among the many diagrams and charts that illustrate the text is a never-before-published full-color foldout of the 72 Qabbalistic Angels of the Shem ha-Maphorash and the 72 Demons of the Goetia. The comprehensive bibliography enables further investigation, and a comprehensive index facilitates the use of this essential reading for worshippers of the New Millennium."},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"Lon Milo Duquette has done it again! He's given us another straight-ahead and witty exposition of several key topics in the occult sciences, a field traditionally shrouded by obscurity or cloaked by enigmatic double-talk that requires astute cryptographic skill to decipher. In his earlier landmark work, THE MAGICK OF THELEMA; A HANDBOOK OF THE RITUALS OF ALEISTER CROWLEY, Duquette presented the material in such a clear and user-friendly fashion that it opened the door for many an aspiring ritualist to start a program of practical work. ANGELS, DEMONS &amp; GODS OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM belongs to the same body of work, continuing a common sense approach to a very convoluted field of endeavor, only now with a much broader platform. Though confessing up front to a Thelemic bias, Duquette doesn't confine himself to this point of view, bringing his considerable magickal and life experience to the subjects at hand. His adroit humor which sometimes has a cutting sarcastic edge to it and the liberal use of personal anecdotes has the effect of making this material extremely relevant to everyday life.Essentially this book is about raising consciousness. &quot;The Great Work of the initiate/magician is overcoming imbalances and imperfections in his or her being, thereby achieving exalted states of consciousness.&quot; It also has the added effect of gently debunking some common superstitions, among them demons, viewing them as portions of our own brain which we project upon the world. It is interesting to see how Duquette utilizes these demons in his account of goetic magic though I personally don't recommend that kind of work.Other subjects include Qabalah, The Emerald Tablet of Hermes, The Precession of the Equinoxes, Egyptology and The Book of the Dead, and more. Having been a student of esoteric literature for over 15 years I've encountered these topics in a variety of forms, yet I received many fresh insights from these musings. I consider this book to be a valuable and necessary addition to any esoteric library. Oz Fritz Inner Journeys, The Independent Press Book Review Vol. VII, issue 3 Spring/Summer, 1998"},{"Title":"Angels, Demons & Gods of the New Millennium","review":"I hate to see this book limited to New Age categories, if for no other reason that it narrowcasts its appeal. Of course, Magick has little to do with &quot;New Age&quot; moralizing and everything to do with the timeless science of consciousness expansion. FEW, appreciate this more than Lon Milo DuQuette. His essays, &quot;Demons Are Our Friends&quot; and &quot;The Emerald Tablet of Hermes&quot; must be considered amongst the finest and funniest ever written on the subject."},{"Title":"Lust for Danger","review":"The plot is corny and unrealistic.

The same language is repeated over and over about how 'exotic' the locations are, and about the action in the book. I couldn't finish the book after starting to read it and being caught up in the unrealistic and down right hokey situations. In the first chapter there is enough cursing to please the crustiest sailor. There are editorial mistakes, grammar and comma errors which anyone with a basic understanding of the english language will find annoying.

It features a Bond like female agent for the Bureau of International Trauma Analysts or B.I.T.A. Yes, the German word for please. I found it something of a running joke as Agent phoned in from various places around the globe only to hear, \\"Bita\\" on the other end of the line. The book is filled with such very subtle humor, an aspect that I truly enjoyed reading. Make no mistake though, despite the sly asides, the book has plenty of action. It also has the very desirable Agent Night, Kathrin Night. Desirable but unlike her male counter part Bond, actually pretty moral by comparison. Or at least extremely difficult to seal the deal with, which makes her even more desirable.I found myself thinking of all the adjectives which are used to describe a character like James Bond. Rogue, womanizer, drinking man, and perhaps man about town. I compared those to the adjectives which would be applied to a standard female version and could understand Agent Night's more cautious approach a bit better.The action, like the humor and sexual tension, is pretty much non-stop. Put simply, \\"Lust for Danger\\" proves to be both lusty and dangerous as well as good fun. It's an enjoyable, fast paced romp around the world with a seductive female agent who tracks down the bad guy and foils his terrible plot. What's not to like?"},{"Title":"Lust for Danger","review":"Wow! Great read -- couldn't put Lust for Danger down! Very visual, kept me guessing, I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Lust for Danger","review":"Fast paced action, lots of twists to the plot, and held my attention all the way through to the surprise ending!

Although it is possible to read any of the books without reading those that came before it, Irecommend reading them in order from the getgo,starting with the very first, Lust for Danger. You will get to watch the phenomenon that is Agent Night who, from her inception, starts out in thisfirst novel as a gung ho fearless agent then through the struggles and transformation she undergoes in the other exciting novels. Close to being a super hero in Lust for Danger, this woman managesto outwit not only her opponents but the odds that are stacked against her. A little bit tongue in cheek, a little bit wildly daring. Each book about Agent Night is completelyunlike the others, unexpected but fulfilling. I recommend not only this book but the whole series."},{"Title":"Lust for Danger","review":"Agent Night is an intelligent, well educated and physically gifted woman. She works as an investigator and law enforcement agent not for a national authority, but for an international authority - the UN - thus she is a &quot;good guy&quot;. Yet she is a liar, apparently can not maintain interpersonal relationships and is addicted to the rush of adrenalin.The title &quot;Lust for Danger&quot;, also stated somewhere in the book, sums up nicely what Chris [a character] observed, &quot;You like defying death...you toy with it...you encourage it&quot;. I can only guess that Agent Night has experienced some psychological trauma herself that may have left her exceedingly disappointed with respect to interpersonal relationships. Or she may have a rather empty sense of self and thus needs to fill up that space with lots of travel, lots of excitement, lots of extravert stuff. Agent Night lusts for the adrenalin rush that perhaps in turn suppresses into unawareness ancient hurts or personal deficits. This lust may also be a death wish....As an analysis of a hero who is flawed, yes that works for me (after all, Agent Night works for the Bureau of International Trauma Analysts - perhaps it is Agent Night's trauma we ought to analyze)."},{"Title":"Lust for Danger","review":"Lust for Danger is one juicy novel with fantastic writing.

I did find it interesting to see how these Russian festivals may have influenced Bread and Puppet's work. What this book is, however, is a huge compendium of original material concerning street festivals in Soviet Russia from 1918 to 1933. It contains hundreds of photos and paintings on the subject, and gathers together what seems to be every single relevant report from Soviet books, magazines, newspapers, archives, organizational notes, festival plans, etc etc. The book also includes five essays which help point out some patterns and trends in this huge mass of material. However, the book does not attempt to give any more background, historical, political, or artistic, than is necessary to put its subject into a very basic context. I believe this book was meant as reference and research material, and as such it made for some exceedingly dry reading. I gave the book the rating that I did because it does what it sets out to do thoroughly and well. How useful a reader finds it, however, will depend on what they need from it. For original source material concerning Soviet street fairs it is a treasure. An in depth historical, political, or artistic analysis it is not, nor does it try to be."},{"Title":"Call No Man Master","review":"Historical novel about the births of the Mexican and Texas republics, and the injustices faced by Indians, Mestizos and other people of color, both in the U.S. and Mexico. I like how it displays the closely-tied relationship in history of both Texas and Mexico. The author allows Carmen Rangel, the main character, to escape certain death a few times too many to be real. Also, the mysterious healer-child Lupita is too easy a &quot;fix&quot; at times. But overall I enjoyed the book. It's simply written, making it easy to follow &amp; read."},{"Title":"Call No Man Master","review":"This book is pretty interesting. It makes you feel that you are in the story, it takes throughout the main events that happened during the Mexican Independence from Spain. I would recommend this book to anyone.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Determination of crystal structures (The crystalline state)","review":"This is the third volume in the series The Crystalline State edited by Sir Lawrence Bragg.

James (1965), \\"The Optical Principles of the Diffraction of X-Rays\\".) this is still an amazing book. While it is both seriously outdated and out of print, many details of the method of X-ray structure determination that everyone takes for granted nowadays are presented as new ideas and thoroughly explained in a thrilling way. While I would definitely not recommend this book to a beginner, it can be a great pleasure and enjoyment for the expert to read in this book. My copy spends more time on my desk than on the shelf."},{"Title":"Test Yourself MCSE Windows 2000 Network Administration (Exam 70-216)","review":"This series contains a quick review of each exam objective and a large array of questions per objective.The questions are relatively similar to those on the test and will at least give you an idea of where you need to brush up.I would reccomend this book along with any of the Coriolis or Syngress MCSE series."},{"Title":"Alcoholism and the Family: A Guide to Treatment and Prevention","review":"In the past, the problem drinker goes off for treatment, and the rest of the family was a secondary consideration. The authors propose a different perspective. Instead of just treating one member, treat the entire alcoholic family as the client. Each individual within the family structure should be an integral part of treatment, not just the drinking member. The author's treatment approach attempts to trace alcoholism back to it's root origins and describes how the problem is passed from generation to generation. The book describes many ways people perpetuate alcoholism, both consciously and unconsciously, and how it can be identified and treated. Specific procedures were included for prevention and for the diagnosis and treatment of the alcoholic family. The book was clearly written, and each chapter built upon the previous chapter, providing a lucid, sequential, and understandable text. The book was divided into four parts: (1) background; (2) etiology; (3) treatment; and (4) prevention. Part one is a review of alcoholism treatment and etiological theories. The controversial disease concept of alcohol was discussed first, followed by the physiological, psychological and sociocultural theories, respectively. The point was made that no one theory is correct, but rather, that all these factors contribute to the problem depending on individual circumstances. The Alcoholics Anonymous Model, Transactional Analysis Model and Behavioral Model of treatment were discussed, exclusive of other theories, and the authors ultimately suggest an eclectic approach. Treatment should fit the needs of the client and should be individualized. Part two dealt with etiology and proposed looking at the problem from the perspective of alcoholism as a family problem. Family therapy philosophy was reviewed, and the authors discussed the Communications Model, Systems Model, Structural Model and Social Learning Model. The importance of dynamics within the family of origin and the nuclear family was emphasized. Physiological, sociocultural and psychological theories of etiology were discussed, as well as the relevance of etiology for treatment and prevention. Part three dealt with treatment of the alcoholic family. It presented family therapy techniques that may be unfamiliar to the alcohol counselor and included techniques for family therapists who are inexperienced in working with alcoholic families. The authors present the view that the focus of treatment should be on the aspect of the family system that perpetuates the drinking behavior. This factor is unique in each family and should be evaluated without any preconceived notion about typical behavior patterns. Some of the topics discussed were family reports and therapist assessment of family structure; family therapy and A.A.; marital therapy; adolescent alcoholism; family violence; sexual dysfunction; children of alcoholics; art therapy; treatment of the alcoholic's spouse; and evaluation of family treatment. Lastly, Part four discussed the important issue of prevention. Primary, secondary and tertiary levels of prevention were explained and discussed. Alcoholism is a widespread problem that has been very resistant to treatment efforts. Many gains have been made by practitioners and researchers, but in many ways, the effective treatment and prevention of alcoholism are yet to be discovered. The textbook attempted to put the treatment and prevention of alcoholism into a family perspective. I found this book to be extremely informative and useful, and was written in a very readable and comprehensive manner."},{"Title":"Alcoholism and the Family: A Guide to Treatment and Prevention","review":"This is a good overview of the various theories in alcoholims, choosing an eclectic approach, one that is designed to benefit family therapists, helping them to have at their disposal information on alcohilism so as to be able to include counseling alcoholics and their families in their practice.However, there is information here that is of benefit to read for the recovering alcoholic him or herself as well as the family of alcoholics or anyone involved in treatment, recovery or counseling.It treats the subject of Alcoholics Anonymous in a balanced way, helping the reader to understand that AA does help many alcoholics for a number of reasons, but also, that it is a religiously rooted organization, one of the first steps in the 12 Step program is surrender to God. Some persons' religious ideals of personal philosophies might not coincide with \\"surrender to God,\\" which doesn't necessarily mean they are atheist. Some might be more intent of a self-determination approach, that is, fighting their way out of it, or relying more on their own strength, with help from others, and developing skills to do so.Of interest is that a significant percentage of alcoholics recover without professional assistance.Enough evidence is presented in this book to indicate that the medical model of alcholism, that alcoholism is a \\"disease\\" is more of a fallacy than fact. That while, the medical model providing a vehicle for needed distigmiation of alcohilism, and for the ability for the alcoholic to receive needed treatment, which might include medical attention and hospitilization, it fails to address the multi-faceted social, psychological, family, and other issues which often contribute to alcoholism. The medical model, then of alcoholism, is flawed, in much the same way as the medical model of mental health, ascribing mental health disorders to a \\"chemical imbalance\\".The author outlines various types of categories of alcoholics along with various solutions.The family is given special note in this book, which recommends alcoholism as a family, rather than an individual issue. Some families/marriage disintegrate after the alcoholic recovers. The goal is to preserve them family, to strengthen the family unit, while helping the alcoholic to recovery.Additionally, many therapies, theories and ideas are considered including the value, for some alcoholics, families, and especially children, of art therapy. It can be a way of expressing emotions without words, something that helps many children.Incest is considered in this book, as well as child abuse, which are more common, although certainly not exclusive in the alcoholic home.The book is very very well researched and documented. The material is not 21 century, but a little bit dated, from 1990s, earliest, but still very relevant and applicable now. (The very latest is not necessarily the most relevant or best). The information here applies accross the board.Would recommend this reference to therapists, family therapists, counselors, child abuse counselors, educators, alcoholics and their families, religious leaders or pastors/elders who might counsel alcoholics and their families, writers and alcoholics themselves."},{"Title":"Alcoholism and the Family: A Guide to Treatment and Prevention","review":"This bk brought forth a great deal of clarity andan even greater understanding of how alcohol trulydisturbs a families dynamics.

It starts with the basics: abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance, and how these relate to the ActiveX/COM programming paradigm. Best practices of object design are instilled in the early chapters of the book-practices such as relational modeling and interface design. The author illustrates the usage of the many built-in wizard tools that come with VB 6.0. Object lifetime events are thoroughly explained. An example of creating a custom, type-checked collection class is provided. Advanced error trapping and recovery are covered in-depth. The later half of the book puts these foundational concepts to use when developing ActiveX components. Examples show how to link a help file to an ActiveX control. And finally, a chapter dedicated to the practice of encapsulating the Win32 API in custom-built ActiveX components is given. Overall, I would recommend this textbook to my Visual Basic students."},{"Title":"Visual Basic 6 Object-Oriented Programming Gold Book: Everything You Need to Know About Microsoft's New ActiveX Release","review":"The back cover subtitles this book as an &quot;Authoritative Guide to Visual Basic 6's Most Powerful Features.&quot; This suggests an advanced programmer's handbook, a sequel to &quot;VB in 31 Days&quot; perhaps; and the book is not that.Instead, it is a well-written explanation on how to develop with Visual Basic to fit into the world of OOP, COM, and three-tier client/server.

The introduction is in many ways a wonderful work of analysis. The primary purpose it lays out for the book is establishing that radical criticism of for-profit media is not new or rare in this country, that, as in other countries, it has been around as long as mass media have. The book accomplishes this purpose admirably, providing key samples of what is clearly a long and rich tradition.There is a rapidly growing media reform movement in the United States at present, one to which the authors of this book have contributed through their work for an organization called Free Press. Many could be forgiven for imagining that popular revolt over concentration and abuse of media power is something new, or at least that it is growing because the concentration and abuse have become uniquely extreme.The review of history presented in this book suggests otherwise. While providing useful insights for the contemporary media analyst and opportunities for the drawing of lessons out of past failures and successes, this collection also provides a great deal of frustration. Here are all the familiar problems, in one form or another, stretching back for a century. Here are all the familiar solutions -- and even more radical solutions that we dare not dream of today. And here is an endless string of failures. This book is well worth reading, but requires a certain fortitude.When Franklin Roosevelt ran for reelection following his first term, U.S. newspapers favored Alf Landon. But Roosevelt used the radio to speak around the newspaper editors, and he won decisively. (Will the internet ever perform a similar function?) More than one media critic cited this election as an indictment of the press's failure to follow public opinion. Indeed. But a reader today is more likely to see in this episode evidence of a glorious era in which the public was able to ignore the commands of the press.At least one media critic excerpted in this book expressed concern in 1937 that FDR had won merely because he was a better speaker on the radio, thus revealing the danger that \\"a demagogue with dictatorial aspirations\\" might win some future election unless the newspapers gained the confidence of the public. The assumption here seemed to be that newspapers could provide more substantive content than any candidate could provide through what were not yet called sound bites.Today U.S. newspapers avoid substantive content like the plague and devote much of their coverage to analysis of who delivers the better sound bites. An argument could be made that the broadcast media have succeeded so far in eliminating substance from politics that the newspapers now follow along.However, FDR's fireside chats were not sound bites, but treatises, by today's standards. It is not at all clear that he won for superficial reasons. And the chief route by which substance squeezes its way through the media today is not in print but on C-Span, the cable network that employs camera crews mercifully devoid of commentators to transmit speeches and forums to viewers simply as the occur (though of course C-Span chooses which speeches to air and which not to).The fundamental difference between the election of 1936 and those of the late 20th century and early 21st century is not the form or conduct of the media, but the presence of a candidate like Roosevelt as the nominee of one of the two dominant parties. Today's media would never allow a candidate who threatened corporate power to gain such a nomination. Ralph Nader is effectively marginalized each time he runs. Dennis Kucinich and Al Sharpton were shut out by the media in last year's Democratic primaries. We learned more about their hair styles, their diets, their childhoods, than anything important - other than the \\"fact\\" that they were \\"fringe\\" and \\"vanity\\" candidates who didn't actually intend to win. The media promoted Howard Dean (which helped to exclude Kucinich and Sharpton) and then turned on him so hard that his head is probably still spinning. Who wouldn't trade this system for one that permitted the nomination of an FDR, regardless of how the media then treated the nominee?"},{"Title":"Staying Hard: The Only Exercise Book You Will Ever Need","review":"The exercises in this book are divided into programs, and you can advance from one program to another.

This means that I can now communicate basic likes and dislikes, express basic intentions and needs effectively using basic practical survival Spanish, ask basic questions and give basic answers, all while using my own original sentences. I have also learned quite a bit about how the language is written from the text which is included."},{"Title":"Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat (8 One Hour CDs/200 Page Illustated Text/Answer Keys & Tapescript) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat (8 One Hour CDs/200 Page Illustated Text/Answer Keys & Tapescript) is the best Spanish language course I have yet tried.I particularly benefited from the CD/Book combination.

Same great method and product. However, if you already have Behind the Wheel Spanish 1 I would recommend you wait for the sequel or Level 2 course before investing again in a different yet similar product. Both courses are great by themselves, but to purchase two similar Level One products from the same company may not be wise. Just buy one or the other and wait for the Level 2. I think Hugo's Advanced Spanish is a good one to use while waiting."},{"Title":"Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat (8 One Hour CDs/200 Page Illustated Text/Answer Keys & Tapescript) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This CD set was a complete letdown. [...] the CD case is cheap. You open it, and the CDs fall out. The CDs are clearly just made in a CD burner.What's worse is the content. You will NOT learn Spanish through this program. I studied Spanish in college, and I know this is nowhere near a complete course. It doesn't bother teaching the past tense! You learn just the present tense and a tiny, tiny bit of the future tense.The Spanish speaker is excellent, I must say, but the English speaker [...]will put you to sleep. He reads like a robot: \\"O...K...Luis....now...we...will...dis...cuss...the ..numbers...in...span...ish.\\" BORING!

The clarity and diction of the speakers on the CDs is wonderful. With this approach to language learning, you don't even have to rewind or switch tracks. The review is already 'built in'. It's perfect for the car because you just pop in the CD and the rest is automatic.

However, after going through four of the CDs and the first part of the book, it is my opinion that to get a command of the language you MUST read and study the book. It isn't a summation of the CDs at all. It contains new words and is a much better guide to constructing sentences than the CD. For those of you that want the convenience of audio, rather than having to read, you may want to do what I am doing. That is, go through the book and tape record what you are havig difficulty remembering (car playback).

My categories are as follows:1. CD Quality. I feel that despite the fact that Conversational Spanish does not yet have multiple tracks, the quality of the recordings and the CD quality is much higher than that of Pimsleur and other competitors I have tried.2. Voice Quality. This is where I feel Conversational Spanish is the unquestioned leader among all Spanish courses I have tried. Superb diction and voice quality throughout, but especially the native Spanish speaker. Obviously a voice professional (probably radio).Play the CD to any native Spanish speaker and they'll tell you 'Now that's good Spanish'.3. Price - Dirt cheap for what you're getting. Pimsleur offers no written material. With this course you get the 8 CDs plus the 200 page written text (and answer keys).4. Excellent focus on communication - This course got me speaking practical and useful Spanish right away.

I never thought learning to speak Spanish could be so fast and so easy.My course and CDs appear to be professionally produced and came in an attractive and sturdy container. The instructor and the Spanish speaker's voices are both excellent and they interact with each other beautifully. I love how they teach you to speak Spanish using your own original sentences. I am truly amazed at how much Spanish I have learned to speak in such a short time.I have taken several Spanish courses in college and have some understanding of the structure of the language. Several sections on three CDs were dedicated to the past and future tenses including the preterite past, the imperfect past and even the present perfect past. Both the near future and regular future were also thoroughly covered on the CDs and the text.. This combined with the present and present progressive tenses presented in a non-grammatical format makes this approach easy and a true winner in terms of its overall completness. Nothing I have tried even comes close.I found the instructor to be quite stimulating and informative and the Spanish speaker's voice is excellent as well. The English speaking instructor has taught at the university level at several well known colleges and was even rated as an excellent instructor by his students. This is verifiable and I checked it all out.Overall, the book and CDs are excellent. and are very easy to use and to understand making this the best Spanish course I have tried."},{"Title":"Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat (8 One Hour CDs/200 Page Illustated Text/Answer Keys & Tapescript) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I ordered this and Behind the Wheel Spanish for my husband for Christmas. Imagine our surprise when we found out that these two items are IDENTICAL, except for the titles. Even though the prices are different! Conversational Spanish even costs more, leading you to believe the products are different. So be careful. And while the lessons are useful, the format is the same as those of taped lessons - all they did was copy the tapes to CD's, so the instructions to rewind and play the sentance again don't work.

I bought Conversational Spanish 8 CDs with the expectation of learning some Spanish during my two hour daily commute. I couldn't have underestimated this course more. I learned A LOT of Spanish during my commutes and what I have learned I owe to this great course. The thing that makes it so effective for me is that all the Spanish comes with English definitions so I don't have to stop the CD to go look up meanings.Add to this the fact that Luis (the native speaker) always repeats enough so that if you space out for a second, get honked at, or whatever, you still catch the lesson.My impressions of this course are that it is simple, easy to understand, and effective at getting you 'conversational' in Spanish fast.I find it nearly unbelievable that I am able to speak as much basic Spanish as I now do in such a short period of time.By the way ....

You just don't feel like you will ever make it! Language Dynamics overcomes this feeling of 'overwhelm' by giving you simple yet useful basic bits of language to improve upon daily.First you crawl, fall down and then walk.Most foreign language courses expect the baby learner to run a marathon without the opportunity of learning to walk first.Conversational Spanish takes the time and effort to take you from the crawling stage, to the tottering stage, picks you up when you fall down, teaches to speak real Spanish little by little and then you just take off.No course does what this one does and for these reasons I highly recommend you try it."},{"Title":"Conversational Spanish in Nothing Flat (8 One Hour CDs/200 Page Illustated Text/Answer Keys & Tapescript) (Spanish Edition)","review":"In my opinion, no \\"single\\" language tool (a book for example) will make you completely proficient in a particular language.

That led to something called the Variance Gamma distribution. More recent papers yielded references to the CGMY model, where C is Carr, M is Madan, G is H&eacute;lyette Geman and Y is Marc Yor. And that led to Geman and this book.Despite those heavy academic origins, the book is well-written and should be accessible to practitioners in trading system design. It's especially comprehensive in its description of energy trading. There's an entire chapter on Monte Carlo and analytic solutions for pricing Asian, barrier and quanto options, for example.

Don't believe 'em. This book is unbelievably bad, especially the sex.No, the prose is worse than the sex.No, the sex is worse.I can't decide. Besides, the plot's awful too. Your average twelve-year-old, assuming they were willing to read this thing, would be able to guess the ending two-thirds of the way through the book. And then there are all those coy misspellings. ...Anyway, unless you really get off on male fantasies (told in interminable, self-regarding prose) about anachronistically feminist 17th C. witches whose sharp-toothed nether parts (can we say vagina dentata?) gruesomely castrate any man who, er, storms their citadel, this book isn't going to have a lot to offer you.Can I do the first sentence from memory? I think I can:\\"Little did I know, as I slipped in the birth slime between my mother's legs, that of the three women watching, two were witches and one was a hag.\\"Take that, Bulwer-Lytton!You may by now have gotten the impression that I think this is a bad book. You may even be wondering exactly how bad it is. I shall try to tell you.I first ran into Black Body while I was working in the editorial department of a New York City publishing house. It was the kind of place that publishes robust commercial fiction without a lot of pretensions. The editors there were literary right down to their fingertips, but very practical about it.These editors, who pretty much ate, slept, and breathed books, and who on top of that had a huge amount of experience reading bad, bad slush, regarded Black Body with a kind of awe. They had an official office copy of it, which they passed hand to hand, marveling. They showed it to authors and to editors from other houses when they visited, so that they could marvel too. \\"Books which are merely bad get published every year,\\" they said. \\"Perhaps once in a decade -- in a lifetime -- do you see a book this transcendently bad.\\"And they would know.I wish to state for the record that I don't have it in for H. C. Turk, his career, his books, or his publisher. I've never met the man, and I wouldn't know him from Adam. I'm writing this review because I honestly believe that Black Body is a remarkable book, and should be recognized as such.The lower echelons of the Amazon ratings are full of precious novels by MFAs that have lots of suspiciously worshipful five-star reviews and next to no sales. But if potential readers could be brought to understand that this book really is special, just the sort of thing to pass around at late-night readings, Black Body might start to get the kind of attention it deserves."},{"Title":"Black Body","review":"A million years ago when I worked in a mall bookstore, I got to bring home tons of stripped paperbacks. This one sat in a bag for ages because I didn't see how it could be interesting. Boy was I wrong. Black Body is a treasure. When I finally cracked it open and read this gorgeously great-humored and lovingly imagined story of witches, I couldn't put it down. My generic superlatives can't convey the sense of excitement and delight that I felt as I became immersed in the story of Alba the witch. Part of the fun of the novel is its historical and quasi-scientific plausibility. H. C. Turk's singular vision shouldn't be out of print. If you should run across a copy (and according to these reviews they seem to show up in the strangest places), pick it up, read it and cherish it."},{"Title":"Black Body","review":"I could not put this book down. Two nights in a row, I read into the wee hours of the morning, until I finished the book.This book invents a new way of viewing witches; as a separate species, not intrinsically evil, whose magic costs them horribly.The writing is incredibly rich and dense, with old-fashioned, long, syntactically challenging, clause-laden sentences.Dialogue is full of subtle wit, and almost Shakespearean puns. The story is about a white witch, a sort of genetic sport among witches,who is incredibly beautiful (in contrast to Turk's standard witches, who are very ugly - a characteristic of the species). The white witchunfortunately has a horrifying physical anomaly; she is sexually irresistible to human men (though she is uninterested in sex)but sex with her is a great mistake. Anexpert on witches, the lady Amanda Rathel wants to use this white witch as a weapon.However, Alba, a very loveable white witch, attempts to surmount her physical self in the name of love.This book is simultaneously a black comedy, a horror story, and a historical romance, AND the best book I have read in at least a year"},{"Title":"Black Body","review":"I bought my first copy of this at an airport to help pass the time on a cross-country flight. That was over ten years ago, and in the intervening time I have read and re-read the novel about 12 times. I am an avid reader, yet it is difficult to find anything that is truly satisfying--hence my many returns to this beautiful piece of literature. The only modern works that I have enjoyed nearly as much are Foucault's Pendulum and The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco. It is unfortunate that the work of H.C. Turk has not received the attention that is deserved. I am amazed at the people who hold up Hemingway and his ilk as the last writers of \\"Literature,\\" when their tales cannot hold a candle to the writing of Mr. Turk. Luckily for me, I managed to locate a hardcover edition (I was told it was the last copy from the publisher). It is one of my most carefully guarded possessions!

I felt like I had rediscovered a period in time that I thought I knew quite a bit about. The love story in this is bizarre but touching. I really wanted the couple to have a happily ever after ending(and I am usually not like that). I got so involved with the story line that I got mad when the book was finished. The heroine is kind of a modern day feminist by accident. She can't help the fact that when the men who choose to behave in a animalistic sexual way toward her get what is coming to them.

If you're like me, it may even color how you perceive all other works of fiction. Alba is so real, so utterly believable, you may forget this work of fiction isn't an autobiography. Black Body will chill your blood and haunt your darker dreams -- and you won't mind a bit."},{"Title":"Black Body","review":"Because I was 14 when I read my uncle's book, I had obviously not a great appreciation for good literature. However, when I started, you'd have to incinerate me to stop me. I read it in about a month(!) It was totally worth it! Graphic, and stupendously original and unique. I look to it for help on my future novel, and always will until it's complete. I'm fortunate to say that this was not H. C Turk's only book, and though I have not read anything else published, his non-published manuscripts are extraordinary. Everything he's written is extraordinary...settle down. A trajedy is that I haven't seen him for 5 years now. The only way to know what terrific literature your missing is to read BLACK BODY; again, and again and again. Sometimes when I see or hear things, very rarely, I can relate those to Alba; that just shows you how real H. C. Turk made her. Her attitude and fluent speech make her a radical babe, er...young woman. Books are the best way to absorb the excuisite deatil of the novel, but I think that allowing them (whoever 'them' is) to make it into a movie would be a fair idea to consider. I'm sure the other readers would understand... While you read it (one does and will) you can imagine what the things that happen to her, effect her paradigm of the 'sinners' and their lifestyle, 'tis romantic!My review is consummated...iiiiiiiiiiii and again!"},{"Title":"The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"The Greek philosopher Socrates is the the acknowledged Founding Father of Philosophy. Born in Athens circa 470 BC, in the time of its apogee, Socrates lived a poor life, not paying any tribute to the so-called frivolities and luxuries of life, thus irritating his many foes, which took monetary advantage of their philosophical practice. The great Socrates had Plato as his most dedicated disciple, among others, who set himself to write down all Socratic discourses, thus preserving to posterity the very special way of thinking Socrates had, known as &quot;maieuthics&quot;. Socrates did not leave to posterity any written document of his handwriting, and that is why that the dedication Plato had to him was important to us. It is something like the work of a match who kindles a very beautiful candle.Socrates was the son of a midwife and a sculptor and his very particular philosophical method was performed by means of very well-formulated questions, that showed that the answers to the questions asked were already there at the very first time, and only had to be delivered out of the inner self by means of philosophical questioning, something akin to the help a mid-wife does to a pregnant woman in her labours prior before the baby is born.In my opinion, the most important part of this small booklet is the Apology of Socrates, where the wisest of all men shows to the tribunal that the only superiority he had over his accusers was that he did not pretend to know anything at all, while his accusers boasted a knowledge they did not have. The ideals formulated or used by Socrates (&quot;Know thyself&quot;) were later adopted by the Christian religion and evidenced a man in a inner struggle with his internal &quot;daemon&quot;, a word which originally had quite another meaning than the modern one, and showed a man with a great coherence in life and, as Nietzche said, most important, a coherence in the face of death, cause to death he was sentenced by his accusers, who were, as predicted by Socrates, to be ruined after his death.Plato is the apparent heir of the socratic tradition and in this small opus pays his tributes to the master of his youth.I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This translation by Benjamin Jowett, a great translator of Plato's works, is the one you want to get if you are mostly concerned with beauty and elegance in a translation. There are other translations that are more accurate, but none more elegant and beautiful than Jowett. This translation was finished in the 19th century; it is the most famous of all Plato translations, although there are numerous other translations available today. (You will be able to find critics that love and hate each translator, so it is up to you to get the one that you think is most true and, if you are like me, most beautiful.)

I find this topic of interest because of the close relationship between Platonic thought and early Christian philosophy during the period of roughly 250-750 A.D. when the fundamentals of Christian doctrine were formed. It is clear from a reading of this series of texts why Plato, although a pagan preceding Christ for several hundred years, was very popular among Christian prelates, monks, polemicists, theologians and philosophers. The texts make somewhat awkward reading because they are presented in the forms of dialogue between Socrates and his friends and detractors and thus Plato does not have to express unequivocally what his own opinions are regarding the debates. The first text discussed in this volume is entitled \\"Euthyphro\\" and discusses the nature of piety. Here Plato has Socrates question many of the concepts associated with the polytheistic worship and piety of ancient Athens. Socrates' famous \\"Apology\\" is a treatise against the accusations of the courts of Athens. Socrates argues for the fact that only God is ultimately the source of wisdom and in all his interactions with fellow poets, artists, philosophers, statesmen, etc., he has not found true wisdom, at least not any wisdom that he himself does not already possess. In \\"Crito\\" Socrates debates with those among his followers who entreat him to flee Athens and take up refuge in a safer city. \\"Phaedo\\" contains the account of Socrates' last dialogue and concludes with Socrates' death by consuming hemlock poison as ordered by the Athenian court. Socrates explains that he does not fear death because the physical things of this world are impermanent and only the soul is ultimately immortal. Death is in fact an improvement in man's condition and he advocates a type of otherworldly asceticism (disdaining external appearances, food, clothing and human love) as the true path for the philosopher who wants to understand and contemplate the nature of reality in a pure fashion. The body dies and the soul is immortal and therefore the most important thing is to attend to the metaphysical realities while in this life. Socrates argues, among other things, that the soul is pre-existent of the body, a concept which was taken up later by the Christian philosopher Origen and later condemned as heresy. He also believes in a concept of the afterlife where the soul is either punished for wrongdoing or rewarded for good. Some souls go through a process of purification before they can advance, similar to the Roman Catholic doctrine of Purgatory. _The Trial and Death of Socrates_ is an excellent read about an important figure in the history of religion and philosophy, especially as it shows the mindset of one who was willing to die for his beliefs (martyrdom). Not all of Plato and Socrates ideas were adopted by the Church but despite certain discrepancies they were nonetheless influential."},{"Title":"The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Platos writings on Socrates dialogues in this book are very interesting and intellectually stimulating. I recommend this book for anyone interested in Socrates, Plato, philosophy, etc. And for $.80 you certainly can't complain about the price!"},{"Title":"The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Anyone interested in either philosophy or Western literature should read at least three of these four classics. The one I'd skip is the last and longest, the Phaedo. In it, Socrates - awaiting his death - explains to his friends why the soul is immortal, engaging in one of the least convincing and most tortuous of his famous arguments. The first essay, the Euthyphro, is instead arguably one of the best not just among the Platonic dialogues, but among ancient Western texts in general. It is nicely written, engaging and, most importantly from a philosophical perspective, convincing. In it, Socrates is on his way to hear the charges that will eventually bring about his premature death, when he meets the cocksure Euthyphro, who is about to denounce his own father. The ensuing dialogue features Socrates at his best, including a pretty good dose of not so subtle sarcasm directed at his pompous interlocutor. Philosophically speaking, the dialogue presents the best argument ever for why gods - even if they did exist - are irrelevant to questions of morality. Plenty of Christian theologians have tried to rebut it over two and a half millennia, and they have all abysmally failed. The remaining two dialogues, the Apology and the Crito, also concern two episodes taking place right before Socrates' death (respectively, his defense at trial and his explanation to his friends of why he accepted to die at the hand of the State, even though he had the means and opportunity to escape in exile). They too are splendid examples of philosophy in action from one of the best practitioners of all time."},{"Title":"The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This magnificent compilation has four Plato writings: \\"Euthyphro,\\" \\"Apology,\\" \\"Crito,\\" and \\"Phaedo.\\" Though apparently early works and not as complex or philosophically influential as later ones, they are immensely important in portraying Socrates' trial and death. They are our clearest picture of the historical Socrates and would be invaluable for this alone. Indeed, I have read hundreds - perhaps thousands - of books, and this is one of my ten or so favorites, mostly because of how moving the depiction of the great man's last days is. The story of Socrates' Apology and last moments is part of world literature's very fabric, an immortal part of Western cultural heritage. Anyone who wants to learn about Socrates should start here. However, the works have great value even aside from this; a few have indeed questioned their historical veracity. This does not affect their philosophical, literary, and political worth, which is of the highest, making the book doubly essential.\\"Euthyphro\\" is the least important work philosophically and probably not meant as historical, but it is still worthwhile. It examines the important \\"What is piety?\\" question and, like many Platonic dialogues, does not have anything like a definite conclusion. Some find this aspect frustrating, and it is certainly beguiling, but those who have experience with it come to love it. Like Socrates, Plato is after all too intelligent to give hard and fast answers; in all likelihood, he knows there are not any. What he does is far more important - lead us to think for ourselves and come to our own conclusions if we can. \\"Euthyphro\\" is a good, if relatively minor, example. It also introduces what philosophers call the Euthyphro Problem; here it is \\"Are good things good because they are loved by the gods, or are they loved by the gods because they are good?,\\" but it has been restated in innumerable forms. This is in some ways an unrepresentative dialogue and thus an unfortunate one to begin the book, because it seems to prove the stereotype that philosophy obsesses over inane, probably unanswerable questions of no practical use. The Euthyphro Problem seems truly asinine as given - or, in our post-postmodern world, simply irrelevant. However, we can begin to see its importance when we replace \\"good\\" and \\"loved by the gods\\" with whatever seems most pressing. Such is after all the kind of thing Plato wanted; we are not supposed to read in narrow literal terms but use him as a starting point for our path to wisdom. This is an instructive example of how Plato has been immensely influential far beyond his apparent significance.\\"Apology\\" is Plato's least philosophical and most unrepresentative work but arguably his most important and is among many readers' favorites, including mine. The book's title is misleading in that this is prose rather than dialogue; it purports to be Socrates' self-defense at his trial. It is historically priceless if so, as it gives his last public statements and some background about his life and the lead up to the trial. Even if not, it is of immense worth as a passionate, sound defense of individualism and free speech; its timeless evocation of these all-important concepts is forever associated with Socrates and the main reason he has been immortalized. The work also piercingly examines the often vast law/conscience gap and is thus an early higher law document. Finally, it is a sort of mini-dialogue in itself touching on and in several ways tying up classic Socrates/Plato themes like the nature of piety and goodness, responsibility toward the gods and the state, interpersonal relations, and life vs. death issues. It sums up Socrates and perhaps Plato better than any other work.\\"Crito\\" is a possibly partly historical account of the title character visiting Socrates in jail to inform him that he is able to escape via bribe; Socrates famously says that he accepts his sentence and argues down contrary pleas. This gives incredible potential insight into Socrates, in many ways telling us more about his character and thought than a full biography ever could. Again, though, it transcends this philosophically and otherwise and is particularly relevant politically. It also examines the law/conscience gap and gives further background on Socrates but is notable above all as a very early example of the social contract theory of government. This is an astonishing example of how advanced Plato was, as the theory is generally considered to have been founded by Thomas Hobbes nearly a millennium later. Even more amazingly, it is put forth more clearly and persuasively here than perhaps anywhere else, making the dialogue essential for anyone interested in political theory.\\"Phaedo\\" ostensibly details Socrates' last moments, including his last look at his wife and child, his last dialogue, his last words to friends, and his actual death. A large part of Socrates' image comes from this, and its potential historical value is inconceivable, though its historicity can easily be doubted since the work itself strongly suggests that Plato was not there. Even so, it is likely accurate in regard to the things that really matter and certainly a fine account of how it very well could have been. It is extremely moving; shot through with pathos, it is one of the most affecting things I have ever read. One can surely not read it without being overcome by emotion; I can hardly even think of it without misty eyes. Anyone who respects and admires this central Western civilization figure will be profoundly touched; his famous last words seem comic out of context but are very much otherwise here, telling us much about Socrates and moving us yet further. This would be one of the greatest works of all-time if it had no other aspect, but it is also a fine dialogue appropriately dealing mostly with death. Plato examines perennial questions like the soul's immortality and metempsychosis very thoroughly and thought-provokingly, and the conclusion - unsurprisingly, given the circumstances - has uncharacteristic certainty. It may not convince our cynical, empiricist, science-loving, twentieth century-surviving age, but the argument is certainly well-made and in many ways admirable. The dialogue touches on other important subjects also and is generally seen as the culmination of Plato's early, Socrates-centered thought.It is important to realize that these four works were not originally published together, but the trial and death connection means they are often collected. There are many such editions, but this is the least expensive and probably the most widely available, making it ideal for most; it also has extra value in that many versions lack \\"Euthyphro.\\" However, all should know that, like other Dover Thrift Editions, this is bare bones, having only a short headnote besides the text. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere; such things are very important in regard to texts of this age and importance, and most general readers will probably need them for comprehension. It is thus tempting to recommend the book mostly for those with some knowledge of Plato and/or Socrates, and it will be helpful to have read Plato previously. That said, these are Plato's most accessible writings and largely speak for themselves, arguably making this an ideal introduction, especially considering the price.The ever-important translation issue must also be kept in mind. It goes without saying that anyone who cares about intellectual issues, especially applied ones, must know Plato, as should anyone who wants to be even basically well-read. However, this is far easier said than done for most; he is so different from what now passes for literature, to say nothing of pop culture, that he is virtually inaccessible to general readers. Yet the importance of persevering cannot be overemphasized; the payoff is well worth the effort. As nearly always in such cases, reading him becomes far easier after the initial difficulty; no attentive reader will ever think Plato easy reading, but he is utterly absorbing once we get used to his style. He has a near-poetic beauty that all agree has never even been remotely approached in philosophy, and such mesmerizing prose is rare in any genre. His dialogues are an incredible form at once intellectually and aesthetically pleasing - an inspired combination that has perhaps never been bettered; many have appropriated it, but none have matched it. All this means that picking the right translation is probably more important with Plato than any other writer. This Benjamin Jowett translation is now quite old but still very accessible; it will work quite well for most, but anyone struggling should try a more recent version. For the average reader, the more recent, the better is generally true. The important thing is to read Plato in some form, and those who happen on a translation that does not work for them should keep trying until their mind opens in a truly new way - and once done, it will never close again.All told, though this edition is not the best for all, anyone wanting an inexpensive Plato/Socrates primer could hardly do better."},{"Title":"The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"The four dialogues collected in this volume tell the story of the trial and death of Socrates. The \\"Euthrypo\\" is a philosophical dialogue on the subject of piety and holiness, set against the background of Socrates' having been accused of impiety towards the gods. The 'Apology' contains Socrates largely monologic defense of his own actions. In this he defends his own devotion to truth, to seeking out the way of true Wisdom. His well- known claim is not that he is wise, but rather that whatever wisdom he has comes in knowing he and others are not wise. Socrates role as gadfly, as one who questions conventional truths is here highlighted. In the 'Crito' Socrates refuses the pleas of his friends, and shows himself to be a dutiful citizen of the state by refusing to illegally escape, run away from the death- sentence. In the 'Phaedo' Socrates nobly choses to accept the verdict of Death , and indicates that his concern is more with his own immortal soul than with the evanescent life in this world.The Four Dialogues together are central to Plato's thought, and constitute one of the central stories of Western Philosophy.'Philosophy' as Socrates practices it is an unending searching for the truth, an unending process of questioning and dialoguing , undermining one's own assumptions in the process. It is an exposing of the folly and error which is at the heart of most conventional opinion.In these 'Dialogues' Plato creates the figure of Socrates as first great hero of Western Philosophy. And this though Plato's own thought will have a dimension of certainty and discovery of the Absolute Ideal which aims to be go beyond Socratic activity and dialogue.These 'Dialogues' are not simply a central work of Western thought, but also a powerful work of Literature. They portray a remarkably , courageous figure, one who stands for the 'truth' and for his own moral integrity despite the entreaties and pressures of the mass of his countrymen. Socrates ia also the great martyr of truth, and as this sets the pattern for a whole series of 'heroes' of thought who defy Authority to present the Truth as they understand it.With all this there are questions to be raised about Socrates value- system, wisdom and general morality. He has often been faulted for neglecting not only the shrewish wife Xantippe, but his three sons, for in short holding responsibility to family as secondary value. His 'questioning - of- everything' attitude is of course one which comes most naturally to adolescence and the young people he taught, but is problematic for those adult Athenians who truly had to be responsible for running Athenian democracy under difficult times.This neat, small Dover Edition presents a classic piece of philosophical Literature in an attractive and inexpensive popular non- scholarly edition."},{"Title":"The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"While the logic propounded by Socrates in this account has since been successfully refuted as being flawed, it is his moral position which he was willing to die for which underlines the historicity more than the details of the ideas presented.

Greek intellectual contributions were given only a passing nod since it was really Christians who \\"invented\\" reason and logic. Or so our pundits told us (e.g., Stark'sThe Victory of Reason). What better way to find out for yourself than to go to the original source (or at least a translation of it). And what amazing discoveries are to be found in this thin volume. Here we see the mind of Socrates in relentless pursuit of truth. It's not knowledge through revelation but knowledge through reason. The Socratic dialogue stands in stark contrast to pronouncements from oracles and prophets common to this era. And because he dared question these pronouncements, he paid for it with his life.In Phaedo, Socrates contemplates his last moments. \\"For whence comes wars, and fightings, and factions? Whence but from the body and the lusts of the body.\\" The nature of the soul, the afterlife, heavenly mansions, purgatory, and hell as a \\"lake of fire\\" - so many influential ideas in the West have a germ right here. And further surprises await. Socrates is quite concerned with virtue, temperance, and the pursuit of wisdom. This is quite different than the impressions I had absorbed about the Greeks. True wisdom might compel someone to get their facts from the source.Some of Socrates \\"proofs\\" of things metaphysical may seem nave by 21st century standards. And more than a few of his speculations about the afterlife clearly exceed the boundaries of reason.

This timeless memoir of the years 1889-1909 documents her wide-ranging concerns, embracing public health, pacifism and feminism as well as philanthropy, working-class education and poverty alleviation. Nationalist hysteria damaged Addams's reputation as a result of her antiwar stance during World War I, but it recovered enough for her to win the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize. Students had mixed views of book and author. To some she is a revelation, but others see her as rather sanctimonious (a fair criticism to some extent). Her prose is accessible but a little archaic now, sometimes appearing flowery or pompous, which deters some readers.

From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"You have to be insane to like this book... wait... You have to be insane to even READ this book."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"Most of the people who reviewed this book were forced to read it in college, admittedly. A couple of them openly confessed to having given up part-way through. My question: Why are you reviewing the book you haven't even read? Granted, it's not a Hollywood film, but it is perhaps one of the greatest works of the 20th century, written by an author who stands on par with Gandhi or Mother Teresa in her committment to social justice. Think about it this way: Addams' settlement house (or Hull House, as it was called) was like an ashram built in the middle of Chicago's dirtiest late 19th century slum. She was doing social work of a kind that had never been done before - working with immigrants, single mothers, orphins, troubled youth and the unemployed. The scope of her sociological experience has never been matched. Politically, Addams was an advocate for the abolition of war, and these views not only secured her the Nobel Prize, but also a black-listing with the House of Un-American Activities. I don't see what is not to like about this book. It is autobiographical in the strict sense of the term, but Addams was larger than life. If you are even vaguely interested in ethics, social work, sociology, social justice, or democracy, Addams' story will inspire and amaze you. Her life was a paradigmn of exellence. It was a life that will inspire you to achieve greatness yourself. I cannot over-recommend familiarizing yourself with this figure, and 20 Years at Hull House is the best place to start."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"Like many of her fellow &quot;Progressives,&quot; Jane Addams was born in the midwest and received an exceptional scholastic and religious education. She was strongly devoted to her father and shared with him a reverence for Abraham Lincoln not just as a man, but as a living ideal against which all men should measure their ideas and actions. Typical of many reformers of her era, Addams was not attracted to evangelical duty. Missionary work left her with a sense of futile detachment from the wretched social conditions she witnessed in East London. After visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams decided to establish a similar settlement house in the rapidly-growing city of Chicago, where &quot;the evil and vices of American life seemed to be exaggerated.&quot; Her experiences at this settlement house are the subject of this book.Although, on the one hand, Addams seemed the typical Progressive; on the other hand she did not follow many of the ideas of the more radical reformers. She was very practical and refused to be swayed by the claims of certain social movements and untried panaceas. she did not become a socialist. Although she greatly admired Tolstoy, she found his message &quot;confused and contradictory&quot; and doubted its suitability to the situation in Chicago. She deplored any violent tactics associated with socialist and anarchist groups despite their &quot;noble motives.&quot; Addams demostrated an understanding of the ways in which strikes had a detrimental effect on people outside the labor movement (her dying sister was unable to see her family because the transportation system was blocked due to the Pullman strike. Unlike most reformers, she also had respect for the immigrant cultures represented at Hull House. A labor museum put native sewing machines and other instruments and crafts on display for all to enjoy.One observation made by this reader was the animosity on the part of European reformers toward the work of the settlement residents. Tolstoy offered petty criticisms and one English visitor concluded that reformers in America were indifferent to the plight of the poor because they could not recite the &quot;cubic feet of air required for each occupant of a tenement bedroom.&quot; Such remarks smack of a &quot;caring competition.&quot; Addams, however, was well aware that the settlement house experiment was far from complete. Jane Addams' honest and humble account--albeit long and sometimes rambling (don't let the skinny paperback fool you)--demonstrated her unwavering commitment to achieving the improvement and unity of humanity."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"Though Addams' prose often gets mired in the florid and highly mannered style of her era, this is a surprisingly compelling book. Free of the ethnic racism and stereotyping that blight many similar works of the era, Addams' account of her groundbreaking community center in one of the worst parts of late 19th-century Chicago fairly overflows with compassion and almost unbelievable fairness. Addams's intelligence is evident, and many of her ideas and attitudes seem decades ahead of their time. It's not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but &quot;Twenty Years at Hull House&quot; contains many gripping portraits of the desperation of immigrant life and the simple power of human decency."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"Twenty Years at Hull House is an outstanding example of the humanitarianism movement in America at the turn of the century. Jane Addams, the author and narrator of the book, was born in Illinois. Early in her life she began to see the effects of poverty on people. She recalls one incident early in her life of seeing a homeless man on the street. She asked her father why that was, and he replied that that was just the way things were. Her father was a Quaker and the most prominate role model in Jane's life. As a child she grew up wanting to be just like him. For a while, she aspired to be a mill owner just like him. Her mother is not mentioned in the book at all. Jane went to Rockford College and soon toured London. It was there that she came up with the idea of the Hull House. Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago. It offered day care and college level classes for women. Spawning from her work at the house, Jane joined many causes that she passionately fought for. These causes included working hours for women, child labor laws, and juivenile court. She could be considered an early feminist. Also from her work at Hull House, Jane started studing the causes of poverty and the effects it had on society. She was not satisfied with just the success of her house; she wanted to know why there was a need for it at all. Later in her life she joined the womens sufferage movement. Jane Addams was a wonderful reformist and feminist that sought to better the country. Twenty Years at Hull House offer insight into one of America' most interesting time periods."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"I am doing a History Fair project on the Hull House. I thought that I would just be quickly skimming over the book, but in fact i really enjoyed it and I ended up reading with a lot of intrest."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"Although, I did find this book to be hard to read at times, I did find it very interesting. It was an inspiring book, showing what a group of dedicated ladies can do when they set their minds to something. Jane Addams is quite the heroine along with the many other ladies that helped her run Hull-House. A very inspiring story. We should all be as dedicated to doing good in the world."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"Two great books that discuss Addams huge contributions to society are the more general &quot;That Jazz!: An Idiosyncratic Social History of the American Twenties&quot; and the Chicago-specific (where she ran Hull House), &quot;Altgeld's America.&quot; Check these out as well as this source material by Addams herself (quite a good writer, actually, despite what the 20-year-old reviewer said!)."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"In 1911 Addams helped found the National Foundation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers, and she was its first president. She was also a leader in women's suffrage and pacifist movements. In 1915 she helped found the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She received the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize (shared with American educator Nicholas Murray Butler).The Hull House could boast a group of about 2,000 people a week. It had facilities including: a night school for adults, kindergarten classes, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a coffeehouse, a gymnasium, a girls club, a swimming pool, a book bindery, a music school, a drama group, a library, and labor related divisions.The Hull House also served as a women's institution of sociology and Addams was a friend and colleague to the early men of the Chicago School of Sociology influencing their social thought of the time through her work in applied sociology, which became defined as social work by academic sociologists of the time. Addams did not, however, consider herself a social worker. She co-authored the Hull-House Maps and Papers in 1893 that came to define the interests and methodologies of Chicago Sociology. She worked with George H. Mead on social reform issues including women's rights and the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike. Addams combined the central concepts of symbolic interactionism with the theories of cultural feminism and pragmatism to form her sociological ideas."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House;","review":"I enjoy reading about strong women with great vision.

I would love to have been part of the Plato club, or study cooking, or sewing, or heard concerts throughout the week. I sometimes think we have so much going on in our lives right now that we don't take the time to slow down and cherish the simple things. This book did that for me. It made me want to study and focus on things. I know we have tons of technology available to us, but I wish we would still discuss philosophy, and I wish more people would read - I mean, really read. Not just the top twenty things out there.

I think I would have appreciated it more if I had been a little bit more educated on the writing style. The vocabulary was a little difficult for me, and I'm almost 20, but I thought that the underlying message was clear. Jane Addams was a brilliant woman, and a true humanitarian. Maybe someday I'll pick it up again.

I was, however, able to find it on other web site (DJ included) so there are still a few about - including on Amazon sometimes. I first saw this book at a friend's house and had been searching for a copy for my own house ever since.As all the 'Day In the Life' series, 75 or so photographers are let loose on a country (in this case, Ireland) for an entire day (May 17, 1991 for this book). Their resulting 800+ photographs depict the country and people, perhaps in ways you never thought of. Having been to Ireland myself a few times I found this book wonderfully refreshing without the contrived look often equated in the American mind of Ireland. You will find all sorts of photos from individuals at work and play, families, landscapes (how could you leave that out?), villages, sports, etc. Almost everything you could think of and a few that you would not.It would behoove the publishers of this series to return to Ireland to compare the changes wrought in the last decade for the Irish people. I'm sure even they themselves would be amazed!"},{"Title":"A Day in the Life of Ireland","review":"This is a collection of some photography, over the course of a single day, (May 17, 1991) by some of the greatest photographers of the 80's and 90's.

There were so many things left unanswered and dangling. I mean, it was an exciting read, but the end was just too abrupt for me. I didn't love this one, and all in all, I liked the first half better (the Corwin books). But, the series overall was very unique and entertaining."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"This book is subtle, sophisticated, and sleek. No one has ever written like Roger Zelazny and no one ever will. His work is satisfying as science fiction but also as a thought provoking and soul stirring work of art and literature. It is so filled with astonishing images that it has to called art. It is so lyrical that it also must be appreciated as literature. Perhaps it also like great music. A rich creation for all the senses."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"This a great work. It is the culmination of the series. Zelazny is amazing since the final book blazes with as much creativity as the first nine. All sorts of creatures are encountered. All kinds of new realities unfold. This book is an impossibility. It can't be that there are nine extraordinary books and that in the tenth book of the series, Zelazny is able to create as the last one an enchanting work of art that fulfills if not surpasses the earlier nine."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"This is the final volume in Roger Zelazny's Amber series.Merlin discovers he is a pawn in the game between the powers of Amber and Chaos, and is not too happy. It is all he can do to stay alive, however. The culmination of all the crazy, devious and violent power struggles in Amber and Chaos."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"At the end of &quot;Knight of Shadows&quot;, the series had a lot of open threads (the wheel ring, Julia, Jurt etc). Unfortunately, Mr. Zelazny chose the quick and easy way to solve it, and in a miraculous way all ends well. The superb plot and storyline of the first nine parts are not continued in this part, and the only reason for buying it, is that the Amber series is not complete without it. Alas."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"I am a huge fan of the first chronicles of Amber and have read that series several times. When Zelazny returned to writing Amber stories based on Merlin I had high hopes, but with each new book I found that the magic was slipping further and further away.In this final book it feels like Zelazny had written himself into a corner and just wanted to end it. There is no true conclusion here, only dangling plots that we will never see resolved.For the Amber completist, get it from the library and slog through it. Otherwise stick to the first five books of Corwin for that is where the true magic is held. Nothing will ever come close to the first five books and this last book is as far from that greatness as the Courts of Chaos are from Amber itself."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"Most people who've read this book don't seem to realize that there was a reason why so many plot threads were either left unresolved, or introduced fresh. This was the case with Courts of Chaos as well (book 5 in the series): Amber won the war, albeit at a terrible price, but there were far too many unanswered questions.The reason is that Zelazny was not intending this to be the end to the series, just to this chapter of the story. It is not a well-known fact, but Zelazny actually wrote five short stories that pick up after this book end (they were published in various magazines and, to my knowledge, have never been collected or even made easily available). Those five stories deal with what happened with Luke and the Pattern (#1), Merlin meeting Rhanda (#2), Frakir, after she got herself freed (#3), and Corwin making his way to Amber on a blue, shape-shifting horse from the Courts (#4 and 5).In those stories, it is revealed that spikards are sentient, Grayswandir and Werewindle are not swords at all, but instead changed spikards, a new race of beings - the Shroudlings, who live in the world behind mirrors - is introduced, and Castle Amber is alive and taking part in things.Zelazny was clearly bulding up to another series; unfortunatelly, he succumbed to cancer shortly thereafter."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"With the exception of a few weak steps in Sign of Chaos, Zelazny's Amber series has proven to be one of the enduring monuments of fantasy writing in the 70's and 80's. They are the logical culmination of a focus on the concept of 'world builder' first investigated in Isle of the Dead. In that volume world building was a spiritual activity and here, in the twin five volume series about Corwin and his son Merlin is is the politics of those who can wander the dimensions and 'find' worlds of their own design that is important.Prince of Chaos makes it clear that Order and Chaos are the great forces that drive events. And that it is the inhabitants, not the manifestations of the powers that must keep the balance. For all their instincts of preservation, the Serpent and the Unicorn would gladly have the universe destroyed if for one instant either side can rule unconstrained. Merlin, born and raised in the Courts of Chaos, but true son of Amber, finds himself maneuvered into the precarious position of potential heir to the dark throne. He despises the idea of wearing a crown, hates being manipulates, but his progress has been almost inevitable. He is a piece in a very large chess game.Zelazny builds this volume as a puzzle with Corwin charged with finding all the pieces and fitting them together. He must find his father, determine who among his relatives can be trusted, and make more than a few decisions of the heart. He is a young man surrounded by players who have been in the game for hundred, if not thousands, of years. And each victory means new threats to defend himself against.Zelazny manages to wrap up most of his loose ends while leaving considerable room for further amplification. There will never be another volume in this series, but the reader has so much material to work with that there are countless alternate new volumes resting in the heads of inspired readers, caught in the pattern of fascination that drives the plot. That these stories go on in our minds is the true charm of Zelazny's work. With today's focus on action rather than plot the art of the storyteller has almost disappeared from the genre."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"This is the tenth and the last (official?) book of the Amber Chronicles (the first one is Nine Princes in Amber). Although not everything is explained (isn't it the same in life?), it's a wonderfull ending. I wish if Zelazny was still with us he wrote another five parts."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"With Prince of Chaos Roger Zelazny brings his classic Amber saga to a close. The book is left slightly open ended as though he had conceived of additional novels, but died before they could be written.This book brings some satisfaction in that most of the major plot points are tied up, but the conclusion feels abrupt and rather contrived. Additionally there are some glaring continuity issues with the earlier books that distract from the pleasure of the reading experience.Although Merlin lacks Corwin's majesty and style, he has a more realistic feel to him. Corwin was always larger than life. Merlin is somewhat bumbling and obtuse which makes him easier to identify with as a realistic character.While this is my least favorite book in the series I highly recommend this series of novels to any and every literature fan out there. Roger Zelazny is one of those few SFF authors who assure that genre's place among more recognized forms of literature.Take my word for it and read these books. You won't regret it..."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"The final book in Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber is enjoyable, but alas, not among the best in the series. I found that the vivid, interesting characters, normally one of the author's strong suites, were overshadowed here by an overly elaborate plot. I understand why so much had to happen in this book: Zelazny was wrapping up this second part of the Amber series, taking care of all the loose ends built up around Merle in the previous few books. The author does a serviceable job in bringing the immediate situation to a satisfying conclusion, but I'd have preferred something -- dare I say it? -- darker at the end, less frenetic, and less determined to give us that satisfying ending.This was Zelazny's last entry in The Chronicles of Amber before his untimely death, and I do not plan to read the more recent Amber books that were penned by John Gregory Betancourt, since they are poorly reviewed. As such, I feel like I should come to some kind of conclusion about the series. So I'll say this: despite what I felt was a rocky start and some unevenness along the way, I'd recommend the Chronicles of Amber to anyone who enjoys page-turners about (take your pick) heroes, kingdoms, trippy travel through alternate realities, and general intrigue. The series as a whole is a cut above many of the skin-deep adventures that are published and soon forgotten. You will be introduced to characters, and a world, that will keep you pleasant company for some time.Instead of hunting down the individual books, if you don't mind lugging around something heavier, seek outThe Great Book of Amber: The Complete Amber Chronicles, 1-10 (Chronicles of Amber). It brings everything together in one volume, and is more readily available."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"I have had this tape on order for months, and I was quite excited when it arrived. That excitement dwindled when I poped in the tape and found that it was not Roger Zelazny who read this story, as the printed cover stated. The story is still good, but the 'flavor' that was built up by Roger's interpretations of his characters was spoiled for me.Worth the listening, but not worth getting excited over."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"I got this book in the mail and it was in good condition and i will read it and then recommend it"},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"\\"Prince of Chaos\\" ends Merlin's five book story arc. It includes a lot of fun magic, more revelations of the people and forces behind what's been happening to him all along, and some delightful (and surprising) character interactions. It's as much fun as any of the ten Amber books.Unfortunately, it ends with a LOT of plot threads hanging. Other reviewers have mentioned that \\"Prince of Chaos\\" was not supposed to be the last Amber book ... that Zelazny intended more. Unfortunately Mr. Zelazny succumbed to cancer before these intentions could be realized. Regardless of his intentions, readers are left with what is on paper. Outside of a few short stories which wrap up a few of the hanging threads, the rest are fated to elude us for eternity.The short stories are available in a hardcover book called \\"Mana from Heaven\\". Unfortunately it commands a pretty penny, so those stories are likely to cost you in the neighborhood of $30. As of this writing, used copies for some reason sell for even more.And so the brilliant but unfinished Amber series comes to a lonely end. Some questions will never be answered for us, which is sad. However, by the end of these ten books, we've experienced a remarkable talent at work. The read was more than worth it.Rest in peace, Roger."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"Roger Zelazny's passing was a personal tragedy to everyone who loves good Fiction and Fantasy. Prince of Chaos is the end of the Merlin cycle of the Chronicles of Amber, but it was clearly not intended as an end to the series.The book ties up a lot of lose ends, but leaves many questions about Amber, the Courts of Chaos and the royal families of both poles of existence.I have reaad the books written by John B, set in Amber's history, and enjoyed them, but Zelazny created this cosmos for us, and was clearly its Master.I would that I had discovered them while he was still with us, I would have certainly sought him out to thank him for letting us play in his worlds."},{"Title":"Prince of Chaos (Amber Novels)","review":"I love this series and was very saddened when Mr. Zelazny died before finishing it. The first series with Corwin as the central character was excellent, but I do prefer the latter half with his son Merlin.

I started reading this series when I was 7 or 8, it is a great first sci-fi series for young readers and a still holds up when I reread them as an adult. Zelazny's world is well thought out and complete with no annoying continuity errors as is in many other series of this kind. It helps to keep you submerged in the magical world without having to worry about being distracted by errors and logistical problems.

[12])","review":"This is a reprint of a book published in the 1830's by Sir Walter Scott as a favor to his son-in-law. Scott researches folklore, superstition, and witchcraft (through folklore, trial records, and previous scholars) in depth to give the reader a comprehensive body of knowledge. The modern reader will find more here than she ever knew. Countless court cases from all of Europe and especially Scotland (where the author resided) and England are presented. Scott writes from the point of view that he lives in a scientific age and that the possibility of these occurances is absurd, but, because he gives you all of the information from which he derives his opinion, you can make your own. Personally, I'm a fanciful person and would like to believe in ghosts and such, but in most of the cases he has plausible explanations for their being impossible (especially pertaining to witchcraft). Interesting to note, in not one of the cases of witchcraft did any of the accused, or the accusers mention goddess worship. Neither did they in any of the 'accepted' mystical hobbies of the era either. He talks of things of which I have never heard. For example, seers claimed to have captured fairies or slyphs in their crystal balls and they were not \\"seeing something\\" as in the movies, but getting the information from the agent inside the ball. It takes a while to read, as the editors of the period didn't know what to do with commas and run on sentences. Some of the words are outdated, and are used differently in our time than in his. This is an excellent book for both the sceptic and believer, as well as Christian or pagan."},{"Title":"Letters on demonology and witchcraft (Morley's Universal library. [12])","review":"Oddly enough, this book talks more about Faeries and defends many accused of witchcraft of influence by the fair folk upon the glens and moors.It is a remarkable work that has Scott's own articulate hand bringing a very interesting world of Celtic myths and fables to life while the rigors of a new age dawn upon them."},{"Title":"Letters on demonology and witchcraft (Morley's Universal library. [12])","review":"Published two years before Scott's death in 1832, this work is practically a meta-analysis of stories of witch-trials and persecutions mostly based in Europe with a few stories detailing the supporting or contrasting events as seen in Scandinavian countries and the Americas. Scott takes the position that the human mind is a fragile thing, imagination creates all kinds of scary things and if those culpable of their crimes were to behave rationally this wouldn't have, and shouldn't have happened. Succinctly - \\"every generation of the human race must swallow a certain measure of nonsense.\\"Filled with interesting terminology it can be a fairly taxing read, as Scott seems to have a proclivity to be long winded and seldom winds a story down in timely fashion. He also doesn't fear the use of incredibly superfluous detailing of the events and persons involved.Bridging the gap, Scott covers very well the transition from tribalism, mythology and lore to the intervention of Christianity, Christianities sectionalism and the resultant over-zealous persecution of person's believed to be witches / warlocks and the closed-minded, torturous methods used to inexcusably extract confessions from frightened people who were usually murdered (let\`s call it what it is, people) after confession in hopes that it would end their torture - and murdered anyway if they didn\`t self-incriminate until the last documented execution in Scotland in 1722. The belief was that they were guilty - based upon hearsay and the unwillingness of juries or prosecutors to speak for their defense. To have spoken in defense of a witch / warlock would only suggest that you, yourself, were in league with that person and their nefarious practices... so one can clearly see, this era, this often forgotten mar on the histories of Europe and America was little more than a campaign of fear and distrust. Of particular interest in the Calvinistic desire to persecute zealously simply because the Catholics were prone to let witches exist and were believed to be in league with the devil (the existence of the \`devil' was, is, and will always be good business for the church - best friend they've ever had).Scott also discusses legerdemain - magic, slight of hand and trickery being seen as types of witchcraft. Ranked with this are holistic medicine practitioners, and those who've fallen from the grace of the church (heathens or pagans).Terms and concepts of particular interest (to myself):- Ephilates: the sense impressions (real) that intrude upon and are incorporated into dreams. The mind rapidly creates a story to surround it (if one is interested in the concept: Freud should be read).- Blue Devils: phantoms seen as a result of constant intoxication.- Naiads: Sea nymphs, generally of two types: Evil, toward sea-men or beneficent unless her jealously is provoked.- Bhargeist: a specter, commonly associated with last name \`Dobie' and the bearer of said name.- Skald (Norse): Believed that to seek information and power from the Gods was a noble pursuit; not an impious endeavor as it would be in the Christian mind.- Ourisk (Celtic): a melancholy spirit usually lives removed from mankind.- Fairies (Finnish); Kobold (German); Bogle (Scottish); Goblin (British): all are generally mischievous but not necessarily evil. The worst done by a Fairy is child-napping to off-set the quota of their own kind that have to give to the devil annually.- \`Damnum minatum, et malum secutum': a curse issued, followed by an event relating to the curse.Means of torture:- \`Pricking': an effort to find \`the devils mark', a pricked spot where the person who has the needle shoved into them evinces no reaction.- Total extraction of finger / toe nails.- Forced sleeplessness and no reprieve from the means of torture.- Leg loading: from a sitting position, propping up the heels leaving the knees unsupported and putting heavy weights upon the joint. Would persist until a confession were forced or the knees broke backward."},{"Title":"Letters on demonology and witchcraft (Morley's Universal library.

What is refreshing, along with his basic candor, is that despite his enormous success he retains a humble and highly humane touch.Some of the most humorous anecdotes of &quot;Name Above the Title&quot; involve madcap, always colorful Columbia boss Harry Cohn, who took his Gower Street studio from the ranks of &quot;Poverty Row&quot; to the that of a giant. Capra helped significantly with box office smashes such as &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;,&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; and &quot;Meet John Doe.&quot; It took awhile, but the Capra film which has soared to top spot in the hearts and minds of the public was the 1946 release starring Jimmy Stewart, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot; The star was so enthused about the story that he pitched it personally to Capra after driving over to his house. Capra relates the time that he begged Cohn not to drop a struggling young cartoonist from the Columbia payroll, predicting that he would be sorry. Capra was right as the cartoonist was a young, meek Iowa farm boy named Walt Disney.One of Capra's great contributions was directing and producing the excellent World War Two documentary series &quot;Why We Fight.&quot; He tells about being called into the office of Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, who asked him to undertake the project. &quot;But I've never done a documentary!&quot; a surprised Capra replied. Marshall pointed out that he had never run an army before either, and that the American way during the critical war period was for citizens to learn jobs with which they were previously unfamiliar. Capra saw Marshall's logic and the rest is history.This autobiography is fascinating enough for the interesting information about Capra's life. What makes it even better is that you are reading the revelations of a good man who did his best to instill positive values into his films, and to help in his distinctive way to make America a better country."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"I have never read such a fascinating auto-biogrophy. Frank Capra is not just a brillent directer, but a surprisingly good writer. Though it took him more then three years to write, THE NAME ABOVE THE TITLE was sure worth his time, and yours.The around six-hundred page book covers Capra's life from his childhood as a Sicilian imagrent living in Los Angles to his retirement from film in the early 1970's. Early on you discover how important family was to Mr.Capra, and the impact that his father, mother, and dozen brothers and sisters had on him. I was also surprised to learn that as a youth Frank loathed this country. The book goes on to tell about Franks work as a gage writer for silent films, and how when he first signed-on with Columbia, the studio was considerd a joke.There a number of major themes throughout the book, among them the importance of family and friends, patriotism, the changes in the Hollywood system, and the importance of a good storie. One thing I particularly enjoyed was to learn about the many diverse friends that Capra had, among them Russian-born composer Dimitri Tiomkin, space-telescope name-sack Erwin Hubble, and even Ted Gusile (better knowen as DR. Suess).This wonderful book is so many things, it is the storie of Capra's life, it is fifty years of Hollywood history, and the bible of Frank Capras philosophy on life. If you are interested in any of these things, then read this book."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"This is not a Hollywood confession, it is not a self serving ego trip, it is solid autobiography. Frank Capra made it by himself, he endured poverty, humiliation, and disappointment. He had brains, artistic sensitivity, and a boundless store of energy. As the son of immigrants he was given nothing except a work ethic. He worked his way through Cal Tech and got an engineering degree. With little job opportunity after graduation, he bummed it for a while over the southwest. Then he landed a job writing gags for Mack Sennett. He grew from there by writing screenplay. Capra was at his creative best when portraying realistic themes. The next step was directing, where he carried his realism to the top. Early in his career, Capra saw the Academy Award as the sign of artistic excellence,and set out to win one. He poured every ounce of his creative energies into his films. On several occasions he knew he deserved an Oscar, only to be disappointed again. Then he made it with &quot;It Happened One Night.&quot; Yet to Capra everything went wrong in making the movie: the wrong leading man, the rewrites, the arguments, the mistakes, the frustrations, the last minute changes. Your first Oscar is your toughest. After that Oscars came naturally to Capra, and he won a bundle of them. Now his &quot;name was above the movie title&quot; on the marquee. The book chronicles the making of his best films, each more interesting than the last. But Capra was more than Holloywood. He stood for artistic integrity and decency. He was generous and willing to help others; he also had his ememies, and was large of ego. He gave unsparingly of himself during WWII as the officer in charge of making Allied training and propaganda films. There's more about this man, much more. Its worth every moment of your reading time. Next Christmas, when they run &quot;Its A Wonderful Life&quot; on TV again, I guarantee you will appreciate the film more than ever. I would recommend this book to film buffs, and lovers of history or biography."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"To begin with, several adjectives to describe this wonderful book: 1.) candid, 2.) inspiring, 3.) poetic, 4.) instructional, 5.) spiritual, 6.) humanitarian, 7.) humorous, 8.) compassionate, 9.) courageous. From what I gather, it took Capra approximately three years to write this book, and what book it is. To be honest, this book is perhaps one of the best pieces of work we might ever have about the legendary director, the course of the twentieth century, and the people who have helped shape the film industry. This book demystifies the often deified directors, actors, moguls that ruled Hollywood during the golden age, reminding us of the universal bonds of humanity that link us all to each other. In many ways, it reads like a Frank Capra movie -- life-affirming to the end. For the younger generation (X'ers and Y'ers) who might question the values of their fathers' generation, this book is a must read. Underline this fact several times because when Capra takes you into his fold and shares his world, it is an experience you won't likely forget. Most history books seem to be written with a detached sense of objectivity from an supposedly impartial historian. The results of such labor is often an uninspiring book that keeps the reader at arm's length from the fascinating history, often boring the reader to no end. No so with Capra's autobiography. Capra reminds the reader that people are still simply people, no matter what generation, no matter which occupation. There are always going to be saints, martyrs, bullies, intellectuals, clowns, idiots in every walk of life. Such an example can be seen when Capra served in World War II and was privy to a touching moment with the great Admiral Nimitz. The old war hero had just come back from seeing three thousand men he had sent off to war -- some of them now without limbs, others without faces, yet all of them saluting him and thanking him from the bottom of their hearts. Nimitz broke down and wept, his shoulders so burdened by the sadness of his men's suffering. Hitting his desk over and over again the Admiral cursed the war with ever fiber in his being. After a brief moment to recompose himself Nimitz thanked Capra for being in the same room... allowing one tortured soul to connect and draw strength from another. Personally, it is easy to find yourself laughing when he laughs and crying when he cries. Like all classic works of literature, this book is so fresh in content, that it inspires the reader to look into his/her own heart and find the beating pulse of humanity and to take pride in the fact that one such as Capra was able to do so much through his films. I look forward to reading this book again and again. And perhaps, others will agree and do likewise."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"I cannot figure out which is more amazing and inspiring: the man, his films, his life or his autobiography.Every autobiography will pale in comparison after you read this one.

Do not think the book is dated: yes, some of the names are meaningless to us today but the perspetive and lessons contained in every single page are timeless. this book tells you better than any others how movies are made or should be made..."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"All in all, I liked it. Very entertaining but I have a hard time believing all of it. It reads just a bit too much like a Frank Capra film: all the characters are overly colorful and they all speak like...well, Frank Capra characters. I get a little wary when an author can recall complete conversations he had--fifty years prior--almost to the point where a person stuttered or mispronounced a word. He doesn't simply recount conversations, he actually quotes them all, in depth, with all added nuances, and seemingly verbatim. Really?"},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"I began reading this book almost by accident at a friend's house while I was house sitting and I haven't been able to put it down. Great book about the beginning of movies and all the changes that it went through. Focuses, obviously, on Frank Capra's career but since he knew so many people from the early days of movies I always find myself wondering who he is going to meet and talk about next. He is currently discussing the making of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Jimmy Stewart."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"Frank Capra is an American icon. And so I devoured this book because I wanted to believe the man who made all those warm idealistic holiday movies was a softy at heart. But like many complex contradictory movieland success stories, his is the tale of a would be chemist who traveled to Northern CA and basically conned his way into a director's chair, parlayed it into comedy serial shorts and later stole the hearts of millions as the chief filmmaking brain trust behind Columbia Pictures.Moreover, while his cinema of the everyman celebrated the man in the street and the underdog, his elitist right wingnut politics betrayed his conscience and made him a sell out to the very same system he satirized in his early films. The best parts of the book reveal how he disproved \\"Capracorn\\" schmaltz-labeling critics, outlived rogue Columbia studio head Harry Cohn and retained his epic status in the pantheon of American cinema despite losing his family box office mojo by the early 1960s.This autobio reads like a behind the curtain confession of a classic film Wizard of Oz. Fame and fortune changed him and at least a third of the book is devoted to his political leanings and events and actions therein that helped him transition from directorial saint to Hollywood conservative snob. The irony of his controversial persona is that his body of work does not lessen his historical relevancy as the lensman who sold us good will each holiday season. If he never bought it, we did."},{"Title":"Master Photoshop 5.5 VISUALLY","review":"I found this book to be refreshing compared to the other overly thick manuals that are available for beginners of photoshop.

This book was GREAT for studying at work - the illustrations helped me grasp new concepts and techniques about Photoshop, without having my computer in front of me! The book is lavishly illustrated (hence the &quot;visually&quot; in the title) and this is a great learning aid. A lot of the information stuck in my brain because I could see a visual reference in the book. It's also a good book to just thumb through, and find out how to use a new technique.I wouldn't want to rely on it as my *only* Photoshop book, but I found it to be a great study aid. I intend to get the Photoshop 6 edition, since I have recently upgraded my software. The only downside to this book is that all the screenshots are of Windows!

Through bitter lessons, he has learned that beauty equals faithless.It is in this way that &quot;Midnight Bride&quot; avoids the cliche of the too beautiful heroine.The Duke of Westleigh is cold and imposing. He has his honor and always abides by society's rules.Rachel, however, sees beneath the surface of the Duke's condesention. She realizes he's an insecure man who clings to the rules of society to give his life order and structure.It is in this way, that &quot;Midnight Bride&quot; avoids the cliche of the cooly arrogant duke.Suson takes characters we've seen in dozens of books and makes them different - more alive. Regencies can only have so much variation. They're all set during the same time period. The all deal with the ton and its rules.Through careful writing, she avoids the pratfalls of a Regency era book by adding depth to her characters. Supplying them with interesting back stories. And adding a decent subplot to the novel.This is the first in the &quot;Midnight&quot; series.

But his cold resistance to Rachel's sensuous charms spurs the desperate lady to abduct the aloof and arrogant lord in a misguided attempt to force his hand.ACTS OF LOVEBitter experience has taught Westleigh to mistrust beautiful women- and his brazen capture by the ravishing Lady Rachel only confirms his low opinion. But the discovery that Rachel's life is in serious danger convinces the stubborn Duke to re-examine his warring feelings- and to finally open his guarded heart to desire...and a glorious, perilous love.I really liked this book, it was a wonderful read. The story line was intriguing and Suson has a light and easy writing style. My only trouble with the book was the 'conflict' towards the end of the book where Jerome accused Rachel of adultery was resolved through physical proof, as apposed to blind faith in her. Otherwise this was a good book, well worth the read."},{"Title":"Midnight Bride","review":"Midnight Bride takes the old story of a masked bandit and adds a twist, the bandit is not the hero of this story and the heroine does not fall in love with the dashing criminal, instead this highway criminal draws both leads together.Jerome Parnell is the Duke of Westleigh and he is somewhat unconventional, his best friend is a groom and his brother is a masked bandit. He is in Yorkshire attending a house party hoping to find his brother and persuade him to give up his criminal ways.Lady Rachel Wingate admires Jerome from the moment she meets him, he saves the life of his groom and Rachel is enchanted with his bravery and quite honestly his physique but Jerome does not reciprocate her good feelings. He has been burned by women in the past and is suspicious of Rachel but she is unlike any noblewoman he knows. She is kind, gentle, a healer and very loyal.Lady Rachel comes to the aid of his brother when he is injured and Jerome must rethink his feelings toward her. Rachel, however, knows she wants a lifetime with Jeremy but he is stubbornly set against marriage. Furthermore she wants out of a betrothal to an odious man picked by her scheming Aunt.Rachel doesn't realize that danger has been stalking her and when it looks like attempts have been made on her life, Jerome steps in to protect her. In this regard, Jerome is completely noble, he takes his responsibilities seriously but he is way too quick to jump to conclusions. Fortunately, when misunderstandings occur between the leads they are usually solved fairly quickly, Rachel is not too stubborn to clear the air.The leads have a passionate relationship and Rachel is a very fine heroine, she is bold and supremely likable.

Since many of the sporting cartridges he used are obsolete this book is a valuable reference work for the student of the big game sporting rifle. Unlike many ballistic technicians Taylor repeatedly comments on bullet performance and that a sporting rifle bullet must be used according to the designer's intent. It is the fisrt such book I have read that repeatedly and forcefully cautions against using too-powerful rifles and too-tough bullets on game because of the danger of the bullet passing through the target animal to wound one or more behind it.All the more interesting is the fact that Taylor's experiences span the black powder express days, the rise of smokeless powder express rifles and the advent of small and medium bore high velocity &quot;magnum&quot; sporting cartridges. He provides sad comments on dead sportsmen who placed too much faith in high velocity magnum small bore rifles.Taylor is one of the few African hunter-authors who has great experience with the famed .600 Nitro Express. His comments are enlightening, and tame the beast, so to speak.Taylor has strong opinions on rifles. He favors double rifles above all others, is fond of single shot rifles and does not like bolt-action repeaters. He speaks, of course, as one who shoots from very close range and admits that things are different in North America.

Her father, Jed is killed at the opening of the story and he sounded like a thorough rat. Lindsay's mother dies at or shortly after childbirth, so Jed takes the girl to his wife to be raised with his other daughter, Sybil, 8. Lindsay has a maternal half sister named Alice, whom we meet later in the story.Sybil is a cliche literary sociopath. Resentful of Lindsay from the outset, she torments the girl, cuts up her doll clothes (Lindsay's interest in making doll clothes led to a career as a clothing designer in N.Y.) and throws a pair of scissors at her, narrowly missing her face. Sybil is the classic spoiled antagonist who, unlike wine, does not improve with age.Jed favors Lindsay and all but ignores Sybil. This is not good for family relationships. It is interesting that the stepmother, who has no name and is only mentioned in passing, readily accepted Lindsay and her father's open admission of adultery. Was she a saint or a martyr?

A third novel (and I'm sure the 20 or so sequels that followed this one) was not needed at all.As mentioned in the title, I found this third novel really disappointing. I stopped reading it a couple of times because I found it so tedious and dull (which was never the case with the first two novels), and was glad it was over when I finally finished it!Honestly, the only good part about it was seeing Tarzan's determination to save his family, and the long over-due conclusion to a particular character. Other than that...I really felt it was a waste of my time.Which is a shame, because Mr. Rice Burroughs is quite a fine writer, and the first two books were fantastic."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"\\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" is the third novel about the Lord of the Jungle by Edgar Rice Burroughs. \\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" finds the ape lord settled in civilized London as Lord Greystoke. But he becomes the target of his enemy, Nikolas Rokoff, and his henchman Alexis Paulvitch. The pair abducts Tarzan's Jane and their infant son Jack. Tarzan ends up stranded on a desert island, but with the help of Sheeta the panther and Akut the great ape he makes it back to the mainland. There he meets Mugambi, the giant chief of he Wagambi tribe, a character who goes on to become Tarzan's lifelong friend and ally (a welcome relief after the way virtually all of the natives were just a different sort of jungle animal for Tarzan to torment and kill). This odd group heads off together after the kidnappers into the deep jungle and when Tarzan finds them he lets his inner beast come up with creative ways of making them pay for the mistake of taking his wife and son. If you start reading the Tarzan novels in particular, or the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs in general, in the same order that they were written, then \\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" is pretty much around the time that it becomes clear that the storyline is usually the same. Our hero is separated from the woman he loves and spends most of the book getting her back. You can throw a baby into the mix, change the impediments placed in the way, or alter the locale from Africa to Mars, Pellucidar or the Land That Time Forgot (far and away the best part of the recipe), but the basic plot remains the same. Burroughs was also getting tired of having to write about Tarzan, which he would prove in the next book in the series, \\"The Son of Tarzan,\\" where baby Jack grows up to become Korak the Killer. Unfortunately there were more than twenty more Tarzan novels to come, which would rely more and more of a formulaic approach."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"This is as addictive as previous Tarzan's stories. In this one the archenemy of Tarzan finally gets his desserts. You have to read it!"},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"\\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs was published in May and June of 1914 in \\"All-Story Cavalier\\". The better known details of Tarzan and Jane are handled in the first two books, but this book seems to get less of a mention than those two, or even then the following book in the series. For myself, I think this book contributes a key factor to the legend of Tarzan, that of his mastery over many animals, and his ability to call them to his aid.At the start of this book, we learn that Rokoff has escaped, and by the end of the first chapter he has kidnapped Tarzan and Jane's son, as well as Tarzan and Jane, though Tarzan doesn't know that Jane has been taken. Rokoff takes Tarzan to a tropical location by boat, and forces him to sign over his fortune, before letting him off. Tarzan believes he is getting off in Africa, and so he believes he will quickly be able to make his way back to society and chase down Rokoff, but he soon learns that he is on an island.For a while, it looks like this book will somewhat mimic \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" in it being a series of events depicting Tarzan vs. Rokoff, or Tarzan vs. some kind of wild animal, but that is not the completely the case. Burroughs puts his wonderful imagination to use and puts forward the idea of Tarzan being able to force his will over some beasts, and indeed some humans as well, and that he can then call them to aid him, and that they can call him as well. So, while it is true that the book essentially deals with those same kinds of events, Burroughs manages to make them much less repetitive to the reader than they were in the first two books.Many of the weaknesses of the first two books still exist here, but to a lesser extent, and that is why I found this to be the best of the first three Tarzan novels. One of the oddities of this book is that it ends with our heroes being in much the same position as they were before. We do meet some new characters, such as Akut, the leader of a tribe of apes, and Sheeta, a panther which Tarzan manages to master, and a villain or two are eliminated, but other than that their situation is much the same when the story ends. Ultimately, the story isn't as repetitive as the previous two books, and Burroughs' new ideas help it feel fresh and new, so I am giving this a higher rating than the first two books of the series."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"Tarzan, aka Lord Greystoke, and his wife, Lady Jane Porter Greystoke, are happily ensconced in their London home with their newborn son when the wrathful and utterly monstrous Russian villains from the previous book (THE RETURN OF TARZAN), Rokoff and Paulvitch, hatch a scheme to wreak their vengeance on the ape-man and his family once and for all. The child is kidnaped, and the parents separately taken away - Tarzan is thrown off on Jungle Island off the west coast of Africa, there to make his way slowly back to the continent to find his wife and child, and to rid himself of his enemies once and for all. One would think that by this time the wily and seemingly resourseful villains would know that just shooting Tarzan in the head is the only way to get rid of him, but that wouldn't be much fun, would it?On the island Tarzan makes friends with a tribe of anthropoid apes similar to those that raised him, in particular their somewhat smarter chief Akut; later he also finds powerful allies in Sheeta, a half-tame panther, and Mugambi, a native African chief. Finally in this third book, the legend of Tarzan as movie- and tv-viewers were to know him is complete: now when he makes his terrible battle cry, the \\"beasts\\" of Tarzan are at his beck and call to do his bidding. He has truly become \\"Lord of the Jungle\\".The Jungle Island sequence aside, THE BEASTS OF TARZAN is something of a letdown from the previous two books; the plot is an example of what would become all-too typical in Burroughs - take away the hero's wife and have him chase the bad guys for the whole book. All of the major characters, good and bad, make dumb mistakes at various points upon which the plot hinges; isn't Tarzan versed well enough in the ways of human deceit by this point not to be duped into going down to the bad section of the docks at night, alone, just because a stranger tells him that he'll get his child back? Too many examples of smart characters acting stupid, and an abundance of coincidences, make this more than a little silly at times, and the pacing is ridiculously fast even by Burroughs' standards.On the plus side though, his writing does improve here; he manages to create some real pathos in the character of the \\"evil\\"-looking, but kind-hearted Swede who protects Jane in the middle of the book, and there's a striking passage near the end where Rokoff kills a young tribesman and steals his boat that has a real poetic quality to it - a real feeling that indeed, these African \\"savages\\" in their natural habitat are far better off than we cynical and greedy westerners. We also get to see Jane acting more resourceful and less the damsel-in-distress than before; this is the first time where she really seems to be an appropriate partner to her super-heroic husband.Still high-grade pulp entertainment, then, though perhaps the weakest overall of the first half-dozen or so books in the series."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"First off, if you are interested in the Tarzan series, you can get this book and the next one together in theTarzan 2-in-1 (The Beasts of Tarzan/The Son of Tarzan) (Tarzan the Classics) (v. 1)for about half the price.In this third Tarzan things start out with Tarzan settled in to English life. Of course, its not too long before he finds himself in the jungle again, this time accompanied by a motley crew of jungle animals.

I am sure the book would deserve 5 stars if I could read it."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"To celebrate \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\"'s centennial this month--Edgar Rice Burroughs' first Tarzan novel was released in the October 1912 issue of \\"All-Story Magazine\\"--I have been compulsively reading the first novels in what eventually became a series of some two dozen books. Book #2, \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" (1913), was a fairly direct sequel to the initial classic outing, while book #3, \\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" picks up the tale several years later. This novel originally appeared in serial form in the pages of \\"All-Story Cavalier\\" magazine in 1914 (the popular pulp had debuted in 1905 and would end its run in 1916), with a cover price of...10 cents. It made its first book appearance two years later. The shortest of the first four Tarzan books, coming in at a mere 159 pages (I refer here to the popular series of Ballantine paperbacks of the 1960s, which introduced Tarzan to a whole new generation of readers), it is a relentlessly fast-paced and compact affair, and fairly gripping from its very first page.On that page, Tarzan--now the father, with his bride Jane Portman, of an infant son, Jack--learns that his archenemy from book #2, Nikolas Rokoff, has just busted out from a French jail. And on page 2, he discovers that Rokoff has wasted little time in wreaking his vengeance on the noble Lord Greystoke. Jack has been kidnapped, and Tarzan and Jane are soon captured and brought by ship to the deserted \\"Jungle Island,\\" off the coast of west Africa. Tarzan is marooned and left to his fate, Jack is to be handed over to a tribe of cannibals, while the devilish and lustful Rokoff has other plans for the nubile Lady Greystoke. All this, in just the first 13 pages! Ere long, Tarzan explores his desert island, becomes friendly with an ape tribe headed by the intelligent anthropoid Akut, tames a vicious panther named Sheeta (Tarzan's rescue of Sheeta and subsequent bonding with the jungle cat may recall to some readers the Biblical story of Daniel and the lion), and finds his very own Friday: Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi (!), a black native who, ultimately, also bonds with the Ape Man. And so, with this motley crew of man and beasts, Tarzan attempts to make it to the mainland and rescue his son and wife....\\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" as mentioned, is absolutely relentless in its pace--indeed, the entire novel is essentially one long chase sequence--and wastes zero time whatsoever in setting things up. Bang, right out of the gate, we are off and running, and the thrills just never let up! Action highlights of this entry are Tarzan's underwater fight with a crocodile, Tarzan and his crew invading a ship full of cutthroat mutineers, Tarzan's escape from the clutches of a cannibal sacrifice, and Jane's solo flight through the jungle, the crazed Rokoff at her heels. As usual, the book's chapters are arranged in cliffhanger fashion, with Burroughs practically daring his audience to stop reading. Also, as usual, the novel is presented with overlapping and concurrent story lines alternating for our attention, a device that is a tad confusing in some instances. Still, it all ultimately manages to hang together. The character of Tarzan here is very much the savage we have come to love from book #1 (he was a man of civilization for at least half of book #2), killing his animal prey and cutting out bloody steaks to devour raw. In a fascinating early segment, Burroughs shows us how remarkably proficient the Ape Man is at staying alive in the wild and at woodcraft, as Tarzan, on his first day on his desert isle, makes himself a stone knife, a bow and arrows, a loincloth, an arboreal shelter and a fire; no one on CBS' \\"Survivor\\" has ever done better, to put it mildly! The novel is an excellent showcase for Jane, also, who has not previously seemed nearly as brave and resourceful; likewise, the villainous Rokoff is presented as more diabolical, vicious and cravenly than ever, and his comeuppance toward the novel's conclusion is a satisfying one.\\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" in short, is a highly successful, extremely exciting entry in the Tarzan series, if not a perfect one. Par for the course, Burroughs makes a few flubs here and there (such as when he refers to Rokoff's lieutenant, Alexis Paulvitch, as \\"Alexander,\\" and when he writes that Tarzan had, in book #1, given the ape Kerchak a chance to escape, rather than Terkoz), but most readers will be too caught up in the fast-moving sweep of events to care, or even notice. As I've written elsewhere, even after almost 100 years, these books can prove highly addictive. For example, in \\"Beasts,\\" Paulvitch manages to escape Tarzan's clutches and flee into the jungle. Guess I'm going to HAVE to proceed on to book #4 now, \\"The Son of Tarzan,\\" to see what happens next...."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"The first two Tarzan novels were filled with action, adventure, and excitement. The third book,the beasts of Tarzan is much less exciting, as the plot is very repetitive.This time around, tarzan learns that his son has been kidnpped by an old enemy. Tarzan tries to rescue his son but ends up stranded on an island.Possibly the worst parts of the book were the ones that focused on Jane, since she can often be very dull. She, too has been taken, and she again lands on the same island ss Tarzan.While this book may not be the best in the series, I would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in the Tarzan books because it concludes the second one."},{"Title":"The Beasts of Tarzan (Tarzan (Tantor Media))","review":"BEASTS OF TARZAN is an escapist's dream come true. There are so many adventures and cliff-hangers in it that you'll wish it would just go on and on and on. Villains abound. Lions, crocodiles, and savage tribes all try to best The Ape-Man. Fortunately, Tarzan gets much needed help, always just in the nick-of-time, from his small band of friends: Mugambi the chief of the Wagambi, Sheeta the leopard and Akut the king of the great apes on Jungle Island. Did I mention that Tarzan's bitterest foes are involved in the events that begin the story and cause our hero no end of worry? No?

Unlike the first two stories in the series, TARZAN OF THE APES and THE RETURN OF TARZAN, I didn't feel this story moved well. There was a lot of action and great characters, but much of the story seemed redundant. I read over and over about Tarzan eating raw meat by preference despite his being \\"civilized.\\" I didn't think that added to the plot. Plus, there were several instances in which both Tarzan and Jane misjudged other characters or made poor decisions that put themselves or others in peril. Once or twice would've been believable; but when it kept happening, the story became less appealing.Don't get me wrong, THE BEASTS OF TARZAN is still worth the read. It has all the adventure and danger that you expect from a Tarzan story, and, for me, the dimension added by animal characters was extremely interesting. If the first two hadn't been so fantastic, I probably would have given this one a higher rating. I'm looking forward to reading the other Tarzan stories. If you're a Burroughs fan, definitely DON'T skip this one.

Following the text are more questions reviewing what was read, and finally, a few more questions pertaining to applying what has been read.It's logically laid out, although I found some of the questions to be worded in less than ideal ways.If you're a believer in and follower of Christ, this study guide will almost certainly improve your understanding of the Book of Revelations."},{"Title":"Revelation","review":"This is the 4th MacArthur Study Guide that I have used, in as many years, to keep up my summer Bible Study.It is organized in such a way that my study can be quick and informative or more in depth if suggested verses are pursued.MacArthur's study guide is efficient and intelligent.

Michael Fletcher shares years of experience and insight into why churches plateau while others continue to grow. 90% of churches never break the 100/200 barrier. Why? You may be surprised.This book is simple and down to earth. The issue may be much simplier than you thought. One leadership configuration and stragegy that caused you to grow can be the very thing that hinders your growth in the future. Most pastors and elder boards do not know how to transition in order to create room for growth. Unknowingly, they're putting a lid on the growth of the church. You'll never become a medium-sized church if you have a small-church mentality (in who and how decisions are made - if shepherding isn't structured so that people are cared for).I have read many church growth books but none has helped me as much as this book. Buy this book, read it, and get ready for the lights to turn on."},{"Title":"Leadership Transitions for Growth","review":"As a church leader in a church that is in transition this is a real help in understanding where we are at and where we are moving forward to...it is a study guide we are using during leadership training sessions at church."},{"Title":"Leadership Transitions for Growth","review":"This book has been released as \\"Overcoming Barriers to Church Growth: Proven Strategies for Taking Your Church to the Next Level\\", which includes a seventh chapter on \\"What If the Church Is Not Growing at All?\\"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a VERY useful and concise book on church growth."},{"Title":"Remote Access 24Seven (24Seven)","review":"This book is a good book if you already know something about working with modems and RAS.

Owners of any relatively current version of Mueller's book (say, 8th Ed. or later) have no real need for this edition... with that book, a few HOW-TO print-outs, scissors, and glue, they could make their own!Never the less, this book is still a great guide to hardware. The non-Windows perspective makes it an excellent complement to Minasi's or Bigelow's book, and it is fairly current (with coverage of RDRAM, DVDs, and FireWire). The CD comes in handy, too.

It was a Herculean task, and even now, I am not completely happy with the book. I feel there is more material that we could have added in, especially where network and kernel configuration are involved. (O'Reilly has good books on network configuration, especially SendMail.) However, to include all the material that I wanted to include would have moved the project back by months, cost LGS serious money, and doubled the size of the volume.Probably the best thing about this book is the Linux Everything Disk. Originally, MacMillan wanted to include Caldera with this book, but I felt that was a waste of time. LGS put together a disk including a pared-down Debian install and a bunch of smaller Linux utility distributions, plus some tools for configuration. It was a hack but a useful hack, and the disk is almost entirely GPL. I think the disk alone probably justifies the price of the book.(NB- the book having been completed, I have moved on to other projects.

Whiting began his history with allied forces making their final advance on Berlin. It seems like the advance was accompanied by moments of peace and safety, coupled with moments of extreme and fanatical combat. The Germans were facing two massive armies, the Soviets in the East, and the British and American forces in the West. With no where to go, the Germans either attempted to surrender to the more hospitable Americans and British, or fought to the death against the Soviets.I found the fall of Nazi Germany, and the subsequent power struggles that developed in order to gain control of the destroyed state most fascinating. Upon the death of Hitler, Grand Admiral Doenitz assumed command of the Reich. However, other top Nazi officials still wanted to maintain a certain level of pull with the new leader. It seems that Whiting views Doenitz as a man more concerned with salvaging what was left of the Germany state rather than securing his own power. Unfortunately, Eisenhower saw only one way to halt the allied assault, unconditional surrender. Doenitz had no choice but to comply.Aside from chronicling the battles for Northern Europe and Berlin, Whiting did a most impressive job discussing the geopolitical ramifications that followed the fall of Berlin. For example, Churchill desperately wanted American forces to push as far East as possible in order to stem the Soviet land grab. Eisenhower finally consented that the Soviets did prove a vast threat to the European continent, but by that time the Soviets had developed a strong foothold in Eastern Europe. Whiting also discussed the death of Franklin Roosevelt and the effect his death had on the Japanese theatre. It seems that it is Whiting's contention that Truman's use of the atomic weapon was less about destroying the morale of the Japanese, and more about creating a fear in the Soviet Union.Whiting's book is an excellent book, filled with insight and food for thought. It is a shame that his work has been out of print from so long, but it would still be a wonderful piece for any World War II library."},{"Title":"The Guide to Owning Central American Cichlids","review":"The book is gradually moving toward obsolescence, but only because other C/A Cichlid surveys have the advantage of being written at a time when discovery of these fish is at an all-time high.

About a year and half ago I started an engineering job at an international construction firm who was building a new nuclear power plant. The nuclear power industry was poised to see some growth in the upcoming years due to increasing energy demands and an aging workforce. The career potential was huge.Upon starting my job, I quickly became aware of all the perks. My bank account swelled, I was learning new skills that separated me from the general population of engineers, and I could see the future waiting with more work in the nuclear power field. One thing I didn't see right away was what I had to give in exchange for this. The job consisted of sitting behind a desk for 10 hours a day, running computer simulations and typing away at reports. The reason I got into engineering was to create, build, and design things. But here, there was little to no design work and no real engineering, at my job. I was turning into a cubicle zombie. I wasn't being challenged by this job. There was no growth or autonomy. To the corporation, all employees were indistinguishable from one another.The company I worked for was very skilled at taking care of their workers. Paid overtime, relocation payments, retirement programs, all sorts of money was being thrown at the workers.You could see people rationalize their work. Sure this stuff was boring, but hey, look at my retirement savings! Look at my paycheck! You could see it in your co-workers faces, the blank stares at the computer screens, the dreaming of vacations or of buying the next car. Everyone was planning for the future, not realizing they were throwing away the present.Enter big corporation life. An easy trade was being made; simple, boring work for high pay. At its best, corporate life makes you feel unfulfilled and unimportant. At its worst, it makes you feel like you're losing your soul.I realized that no amount of money was worth what I was doing. Health insurance be dammed. If I had to type up one more dry boring report, I would lose it.Alan Harington describes a similar situation in his book Life in the Crystal Palace. He tells of how alluring a high salary job with good benefits is. \\"Who cares if the work is interesting...let me hear about your retirement program.\\" \\"I want to be comforted in knowing I'm being taken care of\\". Looking at the job prospects right now, it's easy to see how a large amount of people would happily take these boring jobs with good benefits. The thought of being taken care of by a large corporation may be a thing of the past, but just how quick would everyone go back to that type of a workplace?What Harington's book asks is, are we willing to sell ourselves so cheap? The thought of trading our present happiness and energy for the promise of safety through retirement funds and the comfort of a couple hundred bucks a month towards health insurance can seem so logical at times. This book shows us the ludicracy of large corporate life. He reminds us that our country was built upon people doing hard, meaningful work, not by pushing paper or submitting our TPS reports. We are a group of thinkers, builders, doers.Next time you're thinking about switching careers or starting a new one, read Life in the Crystal Palace. It will help you steer clear of the \\"comfortable\\" corporate life in return for a more fulfilling career . As for me, I left the corporate life last year for a small startup firm and never looked back."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Windows 98 in 21 Days","review":"Despite this books 600+ pages, it's probably the most non-technical computer book I've ever read.

In scientific terms, it is a rigorously written book on tensor algedra which which is the mathematical formalism essential to describe the physical properties of crystals. The mathematical complexity of the book is rather elementary and hence could be used for a senior level advanced undergraduate course as well (typically it is used as a first your graduate course text). The first half of the book discusses equilibrium properties of crystals (permittivity, piezoelectricity, elasticity etc.), therefore a rather modest background in physics is needed. The second half of the book that is devoted to transport properties may require some &quot;general&quot; background on the basic principles of transport phenomena and irreversible thermodynamics. This book, in my opinion, is a very well written book that places the physical properties of crystals in an &quot;easy to comprehend&quot; mathematical framework eloquently. It is an excellent text book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Physical Properties of Crystals","review":"This is a book easy to read and to follow from the beginning until the end. It is worth to get it if you are interested in the relationship between symmetry and properties of any crystalline material.It is broadly explained the derivation of the 32 point groups and they relation with the piezoelectricity, strain, thermal conductivity, etc.It's an essential book for both, Materials scientists and students."},{"Title":"Physical Properties of Crystals","review":"This book is good for people who has some idea about space groups and point groups in crystallography. Knowledge of those is not necessary but makes it much easier for people who does have that knowledge. Being from mechanical background I have not studied symmetry groups yet. Also, determining properties of second rank tensors by comparing them to quadrics was a little confusing for me since my math background is not that strong. It's an excellent book otherwise for understanding how crystal properties depend on the inherent symmetries present in a crystal and how by reducing the number of independent constants the math can be simplified to a great extent. The book was recommended to me to study wave propagation in anisotropic media. Hearmon's bookAn Introduction to Applied Anisotropic Elasticity.was more suited towards that once you know the number of independent elastic constants for a particular crystal lattice. If you are interested in knowing how to determine the independent constants, Love's bookA Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity (Dover Books on Engineering)has a good account of that."},{"Title":"Physical Properties of Crystals","review":"This is an amazing text. Nye methodically and somewhat rigorously presents the arguments behind why certain property tensors take on specific characters for different crystalline materials. Nye is uncannily lucid in his explanations- don't worry if you have trouble with tensors. Nye has an amazing introduction in this book (I think because he ties things to geometric interpretations rather than algebraic). Similarly, if you aren't familiar with the physics related to the property, or it has been a while, Nye briefly reviews what is relevant and where in the governing equations the properties fit. I would recommend as a prerequisite anIntroduction to Crystallography, especially if you are a little rusty on your crystal systems. Nye does give a brief summary, but I found it a little lacking.As far as the main subject of the book, for example, thermal conductivity is actually a second-rank tensor, but for the materials most often encountered (by engineers, anyway), it reduces to a scalar times the identity tensor. This, as well as other properties, reflect the underlying symmetry of the crystalline lattice, and Nye takes us through why certain components of the tensor are zero. This generalizes for higher-rank tensors such as elastic stiffness/compliance, or piezo-x effects, and all are discussed. It is more than just the symmetry of the lattice, however; there are thermodynamic arguments to be made as well, and Nye hits the high points of these as well. He also gives values for the different constants at room temperature for different materials, and in some cases discusses issue with the measurement of the constants (but really, there are better books for this, likeElastic Constants and Their Measurements).If you are a materials scientist or an engineer/mechanician doing work with solids, this book definitely belongs dog-eared on your bookshelf. I can't recommend this enough."},{"Title":"Physical Properties of Crystals","review":"Because it's difficult or impossible to calculate the properties of solid matter by use of quantum mechanics (\\"ab initio method\\"), scientists and engineers turn to alternative methods. One such method, continuum mechanics, assumes that the material under consideration is continuously distributed throughout its volume and completely fills the space it occupies. Obviously this assumption is false: in reality, the atoms of a solid are arranged in symmetrical patterns called crystals (with the exception of glasses) and there is considerable space between the atoms. Properties of the unit cell of each crystal can be measured (with respect to appropriate reference axes), and the data can be put to use by scientists and engineers. In this method, the physical and chemical properties are represented by tensors and matrices. But let's be clear: the experimental values have to be input as components of a tensor--the theory does not in any way allow us to actually calculate the properties of matter. Furthermore, the tensor relates the response to the applied force in a linear manner. Thus the nonlinearity of many phenomena cannot be captured by this method (although there are valiant attempts to use second and higher order effects, as per a Taylor series expansion). Also, the components of the tensor are assumed to be constant, but in many cases they are not. Finally, the orientation of the crystal is arbitrary (though usually certain conventions are followed), which means that the components of the tensor are coupled with the choice of reference axes and will change with a different choice.What I like about Prof. Nye's book is that he admits all of this up front, unlike some other books on material tensors or continuum mechanics. On p. xvi of the Introduction, he says \\"It is, of course, part of the task of physics to explain the values of these tensors for any particular crystal in terms of its atomic and crystalline structure. That is, in a sense, the next stage. Here we are less ambitious; we concern ourselves more with the form and general significance of the tensors than with their actual numerical values.\\" Part 1 of the book reviews the basics of vectors and tensors, and states Neumann's Principle (\\"The symmetry elements of any physical property of a crystal must include the symmetry elements of the point group of the crystal.\\") Part 2 covers equilibrium properties (paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility, electric polarization, stress and strain and elasticity, and piezoelectricity). Part 3 covers transport properties (thermal and electrical conductivity and thermoelectricity), and Part 4 covers crystal optics and optical activity. Each chapter of each part ends with a summary (and some chapters have an additional summary in the middle). Exercises with real data are scattered throughout the text; solutions to some of them are given in the back of the book. There are numerous appendices, a bibliography, supplementary references and notes, and one index for authors and another for subjects.The treatment of elasticity is traditional: Hooke's Law (which assumes a linear relation between stress and strain) is stated, and a fourth-order tensor is derived. In reality of course, Bridgman's experiments have shown that solid volume is inversely proportional to the square root of the applied pressure. The real variables are pressure and volume, which are scalar. What actually happens is that the applied pressure reduces the interatomic distance between the atoms, but the atomic forces resist this change.Overall, however, this is a very fine book and recommended for all solid-state physicists, chemists, and engineers. Just don't expect to be able to actually calculate the properties of matter with it..."},{"Title":"Physical Properties of Crystals","review":"The typical problem that I have been faced with since I was a grad student was how to write down the simplest mathematical expression for a physical relationship such as stress versus strain. This book gives you a clearly explained and justified procedure for achieving such a result. One only needs to be familiar with matrices and linear algebra to benefit from this book; knowledge of Group Theory is not required.A good example of what is contained is Nye is seen on pp.138-139 of the book in the chapter on elasticity. For a crystal of class bar/4, with the bar/4 axis parallel to x3, the axes transform as 1 to 2, 2 to -1, and 3 to -3. In the four suffix notation (i.e. where the compliance s1122 has four indices) Pairs of suffixes then transform as 11 to 22, 22 to 11, 33 to 33, 23 to 13, 31 to -32, and 12 to -12. In the two suffix notation (i.e where the compliance s12 has two indices) these transformations become 1 to 2, 2 to 1, 3 to 3, 4 to 5, 5 to -4, and 6 to -6. Therefore s11 transforms to s22, telling us that s11=s22. But s15 transforms to -s14, while s14 transforms to s15, indicating that s15=-s14=-s15. But it is only possible for s15=-s15 if s15=0. So by symmetry we have already found that for class bar/4, s11=s22 and s15=0. In addition to explaining how symmetry arguments work, Nye has table that lay out diagrams showing which elements of the 6x6 comliance and stiffness matrices are zero and which elements are equal for various crystal classes.One particularly important topic treated by Nye is how to represent stress as a function of strain for a hexagonal material. With Nye as a guide you can understand Teutonico's classic papers proving that the stress field of a dislocation can only be determined analytically for the case of a hexagonal material (Phil.

I spent my evenings slowly digesting the relevant pieces of this book, and Griffith's \\"Introduction to Electrodynamics\\"Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition)With no lecturer to aid with the material, Nye's extreme lucidity helped me digest the material I needed to understand and progress while working in the lab.This is an exceptional text for its highly lucid and engaging writing on what could be a very dry subject"},{"Title":"Your Y2K Personal Protection Plan","review":"I work with Jim Hickman's brother Joe. He (Joe), is also my best friend, not to mention a brilliant Pharmacist. When Joe and Jim were kids they had the standard &quot;I.Q&quot; test that the Dept. of Education deemed necessary to determine how many lights were on and who was home. According to Dot,(their mother), they both scored off the charts. But, bless her, to this day she has never let on who scored higher. Jim, at his first attempt to write a book, not only was published, but of all the (Y2K), books in print rated in the top 5 reviewed by the Wall St. Journal. He has done his research, and written a no-nonsence &quot;Guide&quot;, a reference if you will, just in case..........

I tried to buy a copy tonight and it isn't available. Maybe by next year?"},{"Title":"The Night Before the Night Before Christmas (Reading Railroad Books)","review":"I like how this book is realistic yet kid friendly. My 3 yr old can relate to almost every page and it teaches him a few new words like &#34;needles&#34; on the tree and &#34;sugar plum&#34; to which he always calls out it's candy! And he laughs when the baby pee pees on Santa. He also likes when the girl says &#34;bad kitty&#34; because our pets are always knocking down ornaments, too. It is almost creepy how close this comes to depicting our family, my husband even came down with the flu, too.

Moore's Christmas poem is one that parents can really identify with! It's about all the things that can and will go wrong during Christmas preparations, like burnt cookies. Yet the spirit of the holiday wins out. My daughter really likes this book and I think it is a pleasure to read to her. I don't agree with the editorial review that it, \\"...scans awkwardly and does not easily lend itself to sharing aloud.\\" I love the illustrator's style too.

The different versions of this poem must number into the hundreds; if not the thousands. I can remember that a group of us wrote our own version when I was in high school which was based on a \\"Beatnik\\" theme and included some very good illustrations which alas, was not appreciated one little bit by the folks who ran the school and the local PTA. (Hey, it was their loss).Anyway, this little book is yet another and I have to tell you right now that I love this little version.\\"Twas the night before the night before Christmas,with too much to do.Our tree wasn't up yet,and Mom had the flu.\\"Let me state right now that the art work in this one is comical in nature and an absolute delight. The artist, Mike Lester has captured the spirit of this little verse and the circumstances perfectly.\\"Dad tied the tree to our car.\`This will just have to do.'Mom nodded glumlyand sneezed, \`Ah-ah0CHOOO!'We dragged in our treethrough the front door.It dropped half its needlesall over the floor.\\"I think one of the reasons that this book is so appealing is that there is much truth on each page and children are able to identify with it instantly. I dare say that the sort of situations addressed here are played out in numerous households, to one extent or another, throughout the country each year.\\"When he plugged in the cord,not a single light lit.Did we have extra bulbs?Yes...but none of them fit.\\"When all is finall ready, the family enters their home only to find that the family cat has pretty well destroyed tree, decorations and all.

Fortunately, Amazon was able to get us a copy in time so we were still able to enjoy our yearly reading. This book is a fun read for the whole family. The kids will love the rhyming & pictures.

I did have to consult the OpenBSD FAQs and other material on the Web, however.The only quibble I have with this book is its presumed target audience. The intro says &quot;Knowledge of Unix is not assumed,&quot; but I would recommend that you not even consider starting a firewall building project unless you have good knowledge of UNIX, networking, and basic system administration. If you're picking up this book with that background, though, you will find it a very detailed and helpful guide to setting up your firewall.By the way, the book is geared towards OpenBSD 2.5 but the website has a lot of good updated information on the latest release, 2.7. Plus it has a bunch more examples beyond what is in the book."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"This book starts off discussing why we need firewalls, along with a good recap on how TCP/IP works. (Even showing how Ping of Death, and TearDrop work!) The real meat doesn't start until Chapters 6 &amp; 7, installing/configuring Linux, and Chapters 8 &amp; 9 installing/configuring OpenBSD. Chapter 10 discusses tuning the firewall, showing BOTH Linux and OpenBSD setups, which is a nice touch.Pros: a) Theory _AND_ Implementation in the same book! b) NOT a dry read. Just the right mix of a little humor. c) Covers both Linux and BSD, nice if you want to switch or are interested in seeing how the &quot;other&quot; OS does things.Cons: a) A little superfluous at times, the information probably could be condensed a little. b) For Linux, David Ranch's online &quot;Trinity OS&quot; security guide is more resourceful. &quot;Linux Firewalls&quot; by Robert L. Ziegler continues where this book leaves off. I would love to see a &quot;BSD Firewalls&quot; which continues in the same tradition.Summary: &quot;Building Firewalls for dummies&quot; would sum up this book quite well. A GREAT intro for step-by-step firewall setup."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"A very good introduction to OpenBSD and Linux security issues. Assumes very little knowledge, so newbies will learn much, but not at the expense of more complex topics. Authors, IMHO, view OpenBSD as the platform of choice for running your firewall, but also give you a top to bottom installation/configuration guide for Linux as well. Funny asides and conversational tone make this book an easy read, for the most part, and much more readable than many other computer books I've read."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"As an funny and well-written introduction to firewalls and why they are necessary, as well as a paen to OpenBSD, this book is excellent. As a guide to building one's own using OpenBSD, there are better methods and more up to date instructions on the web. The book's companion website is a mess and has been under construction for months.Two things are particularly out of date. First, it seems that more effective OpenBSD firewalls are configured as &quot;bridges.&quot; This configuration is not mentioned in the book. Second, the book discusses a version of OpenBSD that is several generations old, one that was apparently arranged differently on the distribution CD. Moreover, the key piece of OpenBSD for constructing a firewall, according to instructions in the book, ipf, is apparently going to be removed from future distributions because of licensing problems. (I believe it has already been removed from the lastest OpenBSD distributions on the OpenBSD website but may remain on the 2.9 distribution CD.) Figuring out how to install and configure the latest version of ipfilter will send you on one of those time-consuming webquests. There's no help in the book,If the website were functional and updated the book, the book's other content (primarily background but useful background), might make this book worthwhile. As things stand now, it is better avoided. (Try a Yahoo! search instead.)"},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"I found the book very informative and easy to understand. They actually wrote it to teach rather than blow their own technical horn."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"This book is Gold for any security professional and network administrators (even with a poor background on the subject). It is written in a *very* practical/easy-to-stroll-thru fashion and with a nice &amp; funny style.It also brings to the attention of the public an amazing OS (thx Theo!): OpenBSD and shows you how to install it from scratch &amp; configure IPFilter, the firewall piece that comes with OpenBSD. The Linux part is also very interesting. There is also a companion Website that contains updates and tons of useful info/scripts ...If you are onto some serious security stuff, buy an OpenBSD CD and get the book. Otherwise stick with Linux and get the book anyways."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"Geared towards the first time Linux user, this book covers all aspects of setting up a Linux firewall. This is the book to get if you just got a broadband connection and are thinking about using that old Pentium or 486 as a firewall, and have not put Linux on a machine before. At this writing (03/2000) the companion website is not up, so you will have to follow up with Ziegler's book (5 stars, but geared towards a more knowledgeable user) to tighten things down."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"A really good book and also a fun read (nothing dry and boring about this one). If you've had any formal education if computer science, it's likely you'll know a lot of what's in the first 2 or 3 chapters... but there also might be some material you don't know.I did think, however, that the authors could've toned down the windoze bashing a little. I don't necessarily like windows but I do think that it's probably the _right_ os for some who might also use linux/bsd for their firewalls if the authors wouldn't bash their desktop os of choice so much.Other than that, and I repeat, it's a very good book and worth reading if you're setting up a firewall for the first time."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"This is a great book for people who already know that they want to deploy a free open source firewall solution to secure their network. While somewhat dated (e.g. Linux: ipchains and not iptables, OpenBSD: ipf and not pf), the book gives detailed and comprehensive directions for buidling a firewall platform, deploying a firewall and event sheds some light on the security policy development and maintainance such as securing various network services.The books covers basic security, continues on to choosing the \\"right OS\\" (providing an enlightening discussion on Linux vs OpenBSD) and getting the right hardware for the job, and then dives right into building stuff, complete with commands and \\"cut-and-paste\\" firewalls rules.The last part introduces the reader to the basics of intrusion detection and system monitoring, both valuable parts of any firewall setup.One of the great features of the book is the author's humorous style. I rolled on the floor laughing about \\"naked penguins\\" and \\"hairy sysadmins\\".Overall, get the book if you are planning to build the open source firewall solution or even if you believe that security books can be fun to read.Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA ... is a Senior Security Analyst with a major information security company."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"This book is VERY well written. It was one of the very best technical books I have ever read. Some of the info is a little dated, but the topics discussed are GREAT history. I personally get tired of security writers dismissing older exploits as they are still being used today. In addition, the majority of the first half of the book is devoted to security background and explanation of the types of major exploits.This was the first tech book that I have ever read cover to cover. It was that interesting. The authors had a very conversational style that keeps you hooked and entertained.I HIGHLY recommend it."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"This book is awesome. It assumes no prior networking experience and walks you through networking basics as well as basic security issues such as Denial of Service, spoofing, etc. Chapters with complete step-by-step installation instructions for both Linux and OpenBSD Unix are included, so it's very easy for any beginner to build a firewall for their home (or office) network.Tell people that you've personally built your own firewall using OpenBSD and you'll be guaranteed an approving nod from even the cockiest alpha geek!"},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"This book is useless to anyone able to use an internet browser. I love the style, but it disguises a useless waste of paper. Two years ago, this would have been a marvelous book. Now you'd be better off flushing your dollars down the tube. If you connect to the internet via DSL, this book won't help. If you connect via a dial-up and want the latest firewall configuration, this book won't help. If you want to know about primitive hacker attacks or where to buy outdated OS CDs, software available in newer versions on the web, this is the book for you. (The book's website, touted on the backcover, in the book, and on the publisher's website, is a stupid mess. It does not contain the information the book says it contains and consists largely of empty pages linked together. Polite questions and requests to get it together go unanswered. Give it a try, and you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"Building Linux and OpenBSD Firewalls is truly a wonderful introductory guide into the world of network security. Written for the novice to intermediate user who is protecting their LAN or PC from on line attacks, I found the entire book interesting, relevant and surprisingly witty.

Answer: Drop them off the nearest cliff.)"},{"Title":"Building Linux and Openbsd Firewalls","review":"While this book does have lots of examples, I don't like this book because more then %50 is filler. I don't want another book explaining how to install linux/bsd, or what an IP address is. If you don't know what a TCP/IP address is, this is the wrong book for you.

It is clear these events marked the point in his life at which Malcolm X turned towards Islam.I highly recommend this book which was written in 1946 for anyone who would like to understand Islam in a very simplified and practical approach that offers a view for a better world.Amazingly, the author of this book Abdel Rahman Azzam Pasha is no ordinary writer. A dedicated and balanced statesman and a fierce warrior and officer at the Ottoman Army who has led and organized the Libyans struggle against the invading Italian troops and one of the very few men who actually made the \\"Arab League\\" foundation come true, which entitled him to become its first Secretary General. Abdel Rahman Azzam Pasha was also a minister in Egypt and a soldier in the Balkan and alongside other former Ottoman officers were trying to re-organize the Arab world based on idealistic Islamic views to unite arabs.Reading this book in 2008, over 60 years since it was written; the book still makes great sense and is indeed eternal in its own rights for being able to still practically offer a better view for a world system based on faith, right and justice. Furtheremore, Azzam Pasha in his introduction of the book says: even if you don't agree with Islam or God, you could still find a very meaningful theory that can actually solve our modern world problems."},{"Title":"The eternal message of Muhammad","review":"The book was never inteneded for the western reader but rather for the Muslim reader over 30 years ago. Its aim was to bring the message of Islam to the modern Muslim in a style that he/she could understand and practice in their day to day lives. Thus, not only the fundamentals of belief are explained but also social and political issues that were effecting the Muslim world at the time. It is said that Malcolm X was given a copy of this book and it had a great effect on him brining him towards Sunni Islam.It should be pointed out that the author was an Arab nationalist and so there are without doubt points in the book which are not shall we say, orthodox. Still, this is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Colloquial Portuguese: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"In Japan, we have lots of difficuties in finding the textbook for conversations of European Portuguese.I'm very happy to find this.Actually it doesn't have the detail about grammer,but don't worry, we heve some useful ones in Japan.Next time I visit Portugal, I hope I can make many friends with Portuguese.Thanks a lot!!!Muito obrigado!!!"},{"Title":"Colloquial Portuguese: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"This book is completely on Continental (or European) Portuguese.At times, dialogs between Brazilians are presented but words and sentence structure is Continental, something Brazilian speakers would never say or use. Don't get me wrong. This book is okay if your aim is to learn Continental Portuguese (10 millions of speakers). If you are interested in Brazilian Portuguese this book will be no use and might teach you wrong."},{"Title":"Colloquial Portuguese: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"Once again a course from Routledge that is all but destroyed by a very common error. No wordlists.For some reason, quite a few of the authors in the Colloquial series seem to be under the false impression that providing English translations of the dialogues is a satisfactory substitute for listing the new words. I disagree 100%. There are no languages that can be translated word by word into English and the result of this is that you end up not knowing which words in Portuguese that corresponds to a given English word.The result of this is that you can memorize the phrases in this book like a parrot, but that won't get you any far and is no better than a much cheaper and more extensive phrasebook. As you're not given the chance to learn and repeat new words, you simply won't be able to construct sentences on your own. This makes the book rather unhelpful for learners. Look for Teach Yourself Portuguese instead. The cover is not as nice, but the content is much better with proper word-lists in each lesson, more extensive explanations and full coverage of the differences between European and Brazilian Portuguese."},{"Title":"Colloquial Portuguese: The Complete Course for Beginners (Colloquial Series)","review":"Being Brazilian, I can tell that there are indeed several differences between Brazilian and European Portuguese, but the main difficulty are the local expressions that differ a lot and the pronunciation/accent. It is harder to understand the European accent than the Brazilian one. Grammarwise, the main and maybe only significant difference is the use of the Gerund in Brazil for continuous actions, forsaken long ago in Portugal. However, both countries do speak the same language and one can be understood in either one regardless what &quot;Portuguese&quot; he or she learned. By the same authors, there is the &quot;Colloquial Portuguese from Brazil&quot;, which has enough grammar discussions and real life dialogues based on &quot;Brazilian Portuguese&quot;, despite using over formal and unnatural structures, sometimes. A comment on the first review made about this book: What is &quot;Continental Portuguese&quot;? Is Brazil an Island? Or is Europe the only &quot;Continent&quot; with capital C so that the Portuguese spoken in Portugal can be labelled &quot;Continental&quot;?"},{"Title":"Lingo and Shockwave Sourcebook","review":"I found this book well written and interesting. The authors introduce Lingo in an easy-to-understand and interesting way, although if you're a total novice in Lingo scripting, you might find the example projects used in this book a bit overwhelming. I have some Lingo programming experience prior to reading this book, so I was able to follow the examples pretty well, and I also learned some useful tips and tricks from this book. One downside about this book is that the book was published in 1996 or 1997, and was written probably for Director 5 originally. I encountered some problems when I tried to run some of the examples on Director 8. I wish the authors will update examples in this book."},{"Title":"Lingo and Shockwave Sourcebook","review":"Some of the pre produced scores have mistakes. The author goes into great detail in parts of projects and then completely ignores other points leaving the reader baffled at times. The book references frames in the score without referencing the channel they are in. The author must think points like this are obvious, but since this is a learning manual he presumes too much. In one exercise the author uses a trick to highlight sprites on the stage using a one pixel sprite as a place holder and then switching the highlighted sprites with this single place holder. The trick is in setting the registration point in strategic locations on the highlighted sprites. The author however, never explains how one can accurately set these registration points, leaving the reader quite frustrated. In a direct quote from the book &quot;As of this point, the sequence of frames that the movie will play at startup is 1,2,85,86,87,89,3,4...&quot; which would be fine except the sequence should include frame 88 also, and it does, which leaves the reader very confused if he doesn't understand that this is just another mistake in the text. The book states that the author can be contacted through a link at the website of their publisher. I never found the link and when I sent an e-mail to the publisher I never received a reply. Compared to the last Director/Lingo instruction book I studied (Macromedia Director 6 and Lingo Authorized) this book is lame, however I am an admitted newbie, but then isn't that the point? The feeling I got from this book is that it wasn't written by a &quot;teacher&quot; but if you are intuitive and have no problem reading between the lines you'll be O.K. (you might even learn by working through the inconsistencies). If however, you need specific, concise instruction (like I do) this book might not be for you."},{"Title":"Build Your Own Pentium III PC","review":"This book contains some useful technical information about selecting components and hardware for your computer. Unfortunately, the author's woolly and fuddy-duddy writing style means that you've got your work cut out to learn everything you need to know to build your own.Pilgrim, like many technical writers, seems incapable of writing in a coherent and logical manner, and his judgment of what is salient information often way off the mark. He can't or won't stick to the point -- which the book's title suggests is building your own computer. The book contains endless comparative anecdotes about his early computer purchases, and also spends far too much time measuring up obsolete XT, 286 and 386 systems with today's fastest machines. We all know computers are faster and cheaper now than they were five or ten years ago, so why keep going on about it? The book's title implies it is a hands-on manual, but in reality it often leans heavily toward being an overall history of computers, with far too much space wasted on discussing obsolete technology. This leads to a suspicion that the writer might have lifted large sections of text from his previous books and didn't bother to update them properly or remove outdated material.Large sections are also devoted to discussing general computer usage (such as the ridiculous paragraph on &quot;Designing a Good Presentation&quot;) in a tone that suggests they were written for a junior high class. &quot;Facsimile machines have been around for quite a while,&quot; starts the section on the fax machine. Well thanks for pointing that one out for those of us who have been in prison or space. Hardly the kind of stuff someone who is seriously considering building a computer needs to be told. Some questionable grammar (particularly a consistent, irksome misuse of a definitive &quot;the&quot;) and punctuation also slow down the reading process.The book also contains endless repetition, with some passages appearing partially or in their entirety several times under different section headings throughout, sometimes even on the same page. Endless padding also pushes the book's page count well beyond what it needed to be. These last two points are the fault of the publisher -- this book sorely needs a good, critical edit (much like this review) and could easily have been condensed by 200 pages (ditto). Presumably the idea of repeated passages was for each section to function discretely, but in reality the information is so poorly organized it's necessary to read the book cover to cover to avoid missing vital pieces of technical information.But the biggest criticism has to be reserved for the fact that, for a build-your-own guide that runs over 600 pages, this book is woefully lacking in specific help on actually putting your machine together. Instructions comprise little more than &quot;plug the memory into the motherboard&quot; etc., and the reviewer at the bottom of this page is accurate in saying there are only about 10 pages on putting a computer together. Considering a Pentium III is a Slot 1 machine, there is also far too much time spent talking about Socket 7's. Likewise, the author derides other books for their lack of information on formatting and partitioning hard drives, then proceeds to write an inadequate and confusing section on these two important procedures that first-time builders will definitely need help with.Although Pilgrim seems to know his stuff technically, overall there is a feeling that this book was created without much attention to detail. Small inconsistencies and inaccuracies -- such as a reference to modern video cards having &quot;32Kb&quot; of VRAM (he surely means 32Mb) and in one instance USB supporting up to 128 devices (elsewhere he says, correctly, the number is 127), throw everything into doubt. There is also a feeling that the book was already outdated when it went to press -- always a problem of course with books on a fast-moving industry, but it seems they didn't even try to see that it was current when it hit the shelves.I would give this book three stars as a general reference guide to hardware, but only one star as a step-by-step guide to building your own computer. Unfortunately yet another in the great tradition of hastily created and rather sloppy computer guides."},{"Title":"Build Your Own Pentium III PC","review":"While this book was a thorough and up-to-date authority on many many hardware subjects, the actual building tutorial was quite lacking.

Basically this book just explains in very breif detail how the system all works together.The most difficult thing in building your own system IMHO is deciding which components will best meet your needs and will work well together. I did not get any helpful info from this book along these lines. In fact the author does not even seem particularly knowledgeable about the subject matter in the book.

This book is not just about instructions on how to make your own PC. It gives really important history and background information which is absolutely vital and fundamental to any novice trying to get a good grasp of the subject. By the time it came down to actually building my own PC, I had as good a grasp of the subject at this level as the author himself without having read any other book on the subject. It gives you all the information YOU need to be able to make your OWN judgement about what YOU WANT to build. Best of all, the author has written it in such a personal fashion that you will feel he is actually talking to you and you can imagine him working away in his garage - enabling you to see and appreciate things in a crystal clear way. It left me absolutely mesmerised. Every technical book is only valid for as long as the technology mentioned in it is also valid when you read it. Since computer technology moves really, really fast, the reader should consider some information that was current when the book was written to look at it from a historical point of view - this does not negate the validity of the information in any way. The author makes this fact clear by mentioning phrases like &quot;By the time you read this....&quot; followed by his comments about how things might have changed when you are reading the book at your time - and quite often he is spot on about his predictions, which I am sure needed a bit of digging. The flow of his language is wonderful and I feel sorry for those who criticise it because their first language isn't English - mine isn't either. The only matter you should be careful of is when you read about binary numbers but thats really to do with software at a core level - something that really did not concern me at this level.

I looked at the star ranking, but didn't read the reviews. I should have, because it would have helped me much better after reading the reviews. I am somewhat savy, but I was disappointed by this book because it didn't talk to me on a level of what type of product (or brands) would be best for me depending on my budget. For example, besides price, what makes the difference in components I pick? Is it speed? Will they work better? Some products that I buy might not work better if I buy the wrong companion component... this book didn't tell me that.His writing leaves much to be desired.

Indeed,the main character is fortunate to have a mother such asDew describes."},{"Title":"Fortunate Lives","review":"This novel explores themes of loss, individuation, family and friendship. The story is told with low expressed emotion built on the premise that still waters run deep and what is felt does not always have to be communicated.There are several plot lines in this book. A family deals with loss after their son dies in a tragic accident. Years later, their oldest child gets ready to leave for college and these wounds open again. Meanwhile, a truly gross holier-than-thou nymphomaniac professor enters their lives and 'adopts' them. The mother for some reason is unable to set limits or boundaries with this woman.

The author also then discusses the Evangelical response to Tractarianism, modern ecumenism and the influence of the Charismatic movement on the Church of England. It is helpful to note that none other than John Wesley celebrated Holy communion five times a week and that George Whitefield too longed to partake of it, sometimes twice on one day. Scholars have concluded that the Wesleyan revivals were also a revival of a high view of the Eucharist inside the Church of England as some 250 hymns were written about the blessings and benefits one receives from the Lord's Supper by none other than Charles Wesley during the first wave of Evangelical revivals that swept through Britain and the Colonies in the mid 1700s. When Evangelicals weren't reacting to High Churchmanship or fending off Anglo-Catholicism we see that they too held a high view of the Eucharist as a means of grace despite the potential problems that might arise when one holds an even higher view of justification by faith."},{"Title":"Time on Target: The World War II Memoir of William R. Buster","review":"Most biographies about World War II participants have focused on two distinct groups of persons: those that served as high ranking military or political leaders or those who served as ordinary soldiers in the field. This follows the well-established practice of studying history from either above or below. While both of these types of studies are important and useful, those in the middle strata of a conflict can enlighten and inform on a much broader range of topics. General William R. Buster's memoir &quot;Time on Target&quot; is a first-rate example of this type of scholarship.Buster recounts his personal and professional experiences from his graduation from the West Point class of 1940 to his command of a battalion as a Lieutenant Colonel. Buster was one of the first officers in the US Army to begin training with armor and mechanized artillery, and was instrumental in development of tactics and theories for use by these forces. Buster was assigned to the Second Armored Division, and served throughout North Africa, Normandy, and central Europe with this organization. With his unique positions witin the military higherarchy, Buster recounts wonderful episodes involving general officers to privates.Buster also observes non-military functions and activities, which makes this a unique World War II narrative. He gives colorful accounts of travelling the country in his newly purchased Pontiac convertable, courting his wife-to-be Mildred, and army-base life. Buster also tells of the death of close friends and interaction with refugees and homeless families in Europe. The Postdam Conference and refugee-assistance mission are also documented by Buster.This book is a useful tool for anyone interested in World War II. Buster relates military, social, and technical information from one of the most unique perspectives during the war. While other works may give more details or a better overall coverage of the war, few can match Buster in the description of his personal wartime actions and impressions."},{"Title":"Spring, 1862 Dear Daughter.(Poem): An article from: African American Review","review":"a wonderful intro to a necessary voice in our landscape.

Is that anything like wonderbread?\\" I actually read the sequel to this book, BORN OF FLAME, years before I ever found a copy of this title. Since it is out of print, it can be mighty hard to find. The book is probably best described as a young reader's space opera or science-fantasy. And despite the rather disconcerting names, it turns out to be a fairly good read.Spacebread is a large white cat who is an intergalactic space traveller and adventuress--sort of a Han Solo of the feline persuasion. Having just returned from a dangerous mission, she's ready for some rest and relaxation--that is, until a murderous theif steals her belt buckle and kills an one of her friends. Now, Spacebread is off on another adventure, to reclaim her belt buckle, avenge the death of her friend--and possibly to stop more dastardly plots that surround her quest. Along the way, she gains an unusual mix of allies. A vegetable alien slave being who Spacebread rescues from harm, a blind woman who can see what others cannot, and a very dashing black cat. Soon, Spacebread's quest becomes about more than a missing belt buckle--and the fate of an entire world may hang in the balance.This is delightful space opera! Think spaceships, swords and swashbucklers! The author writes a fairly serious and dramatic story, and despite the unconventional characters he people's his worlds with, the story is convincing in its melodrama. I have to admit, the pictures included in this book tended to jar me. Because, unlike the text, which treats the existence of intelligent cats in capes and boots, and floating vegetable aliens with ice guns, as normal and likable characters, the pictures tend to take a less serious approach. The resulting art feels like a caricature and doesn't quite match the tone of the writing.For a light read with plenty of adventure, this might just fit the bill. Young readers who are interested in cat fantasy stories will probably like this. While not as archetypal as Star Wars, or as memorable as The Three Musketeers, it is an entertaining adventure--pure fun for a rainy afternoon or a late night under the covers with a flashlight. If you can find this book, and enjoy it, be sure to check out Born of Flame which continues the adventures of Spacebread.Happy Reading! ^_^--shanshad"},{"Title":"Spacebread","review":"i was waaaaay too into this book when i was a kid. it's shaped my life. definitly give it to your sci-fi-prone, cat-loving daughters. it'll give 'em confidence and a great little world to get lost in."},{"Title":"Spacebread","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books.

Colonel William Winterstein should be commended for his courage in exposing the deep secrets of the Space Program. Upon finishing this book I came away with two impressions. The first being how suppressed the history is of the fact that it was the German Scientist who propelled the U.S. into space and on to the moon. It's amazing how neglected and hidden this fact is, as if it would be an embarrassment to our country.The other of course is the much more troubling fact; that these great scientist were targeted by the DOJ's Office of Special Investigations for obviously nothing more than vengeful political gain. Now, years after his prosecution, Arthur Rudolph's story is one of our nations greatest tragedies. The conduct of the OSI, from the Directors Rosenbaum & Sher, on down to the prosecuting attorney's is a story of government sanctioned terrorism. There's no other way to state it, sheer, appalling unjust reign of terror.The fact that despite the clear and wrongful conduct of Neal Sher as Director of OSI (who has since been disbarred for his actions in steeling from WJC'sHolocaust victims relief funds), that he goes un-prosecuted for his crimes continues to be a great mystery. It demonstrates that some people are abovethe laws and some groups have the powers to control the judicial system of our government.Perhaps herein lies the interesting fact that while the book was published in August, Amazon has book sellers selling used books for $12. Is this to give an impression the book and its contents are worthless? Look at who endorsed the book and what they have said! Clearly, some people have much to hide. This book should be required reading by Aviation Historiansas well as any and everyone interested in knowing just how corrupt and 'sold out' our government can be!Heinz BarteschSan Rafael, CA"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Space Age: An American Gift to Humanity","review":"Edgar Mitchell was the Lunar Command pilot of Apollo 14.\\"Secrets of The Space Age\\" is an important addition to U.S. history and to the record of U.S. efforts in space.Edgar Mitchell, Sc.D.Capt USN (Ret.) Apollo AstronautCol. Winterstein is a courageous patriot and pioneer of America's space program from its birth with the testing of the captured German V-2 rockets to the landings on the moon. He has a great, but sometimes dark, story to tell about America's advance into space and about what became of the men who took us there.Patrick J BuchananWinterstein's book is a must read historical milestone. It begins with the advent of the space age of America. He was custodian of the German rocket team led by Dr. Wernher von Braun, who were invited to come to this country by President Truman immediately after WWII in 1945. He convinced von Braun to keep his team intact. This led to America's space victory in 1969, when von Braun and his team launched humankind into the space age by placing U.S. astronauts on the moon. Thus von Braun's dreams came true for opening up the new frontier for the peaceful use of all humankind. The final days of America's greatest space hero are also revealed in most interesting detail.Dr. Carol Rosin, President, Institute for Cooperation in SpaceDear Bill:I found your book interesting and was impressed by the facts concerning the history of the von Braun Team who contributed to our missile activities.A major goal was established in the early 1960's by President Kennedy, who transferred the Army Ballistic Missile team, (led by von Braun), to Marshall Space Flight Center of NASA, except for Dr. Arthur Rudolph, who was kept by the Army to finish the design of the Pershing missile, then he joined the MSFC team at a key management and technical responsibility for our Space Program in the early 1960's.Joseph C. Moquin (Former CEO of Brown Engineering when Brown was a contractor supporting the Apollo Program)Immigrants working together in harmony and peace have made America the great nation it is! Lt. Colonel William E. Winterstein Sr.'s story of Arthur Rudolph is one such story. Rudolph designed the Pershing missile and he was directly responsible for designing and building the huge Saturn launch vehicle, which put man on the moon. This great feat put America into the lead during the Cold War.However after Rudolph had dedicated his life to the US space effort, he was wrongly robbed of his honor and citizenship and exiled by the OSI, an agency within our government. This true and \\"unbelievable\\" story may be a forecast of things to come for US citizens? Read \\"SECRETS OF THE SPACE AGE\\" and be forewarned.Martin Hollmann, President of Scientists and FriendsCol. William E. Winterstein, the author, merits great commendation for his superb chronicle of the outstanding American rocketry and space travel legacy of Dr. Arthur Rudolph. As stated in the text, the OSI produced no evidence of wrongdoing by Dr. Rudolph pursuant to our request for evidence under the Freedom of Information Act.Robert Sellers Smith Lawyer involved with Arthur Rudolph's AppealEvery American who cares about justice and historical truth owes a debt of gratitude to William Winterstein for this first-hand look at the US space program, which he reinforces with valuable research and illuminating insights. The author is a World War II hero and internationally known rocket specialist who rose to the rank of US Army Lt. Colonel. He supervised security involving the 118 German rocket scientists, headed by Dr. Wernher von Braun, who came to the US after the war to help build America's guided missile program. From 1945 through the 1960s, Winterstein worked closely with von Braun and his team.In perhaps the book's most important section, Winterstein takes a close and courageous look at the US government's persecution of Arthur Rudolph. Few men contributed more to mankind's first landing on the moon than Dr. Rudolph, a German-born scientist who capped a brilliant career as production manager of the giant Saturn V rocket that in 1969 carried three American astronauts to the lunar surface. Praised as one of this country's greatest scientists, he was awarded numerous high honors, including NASA's Distinguished Service Medal.In 1982, more than a decade after his retirement, the \\"Office of Special Investigations\\" -- a US government agency set up under Jewish-Zionist pressure to serve narrow, un-American interests -- began a campaign to brand Rudolph a Nazi war criminal for his role in Germany's wartime V2 rocket program. Rudolph was stripped of his US citizenship, and forced to return to Germany. A German government investigation found no grounds for bringing charges against the elderly man, who died in early 1996.Winterstein untangles the complexities of this politically-loaded case, marshals facts that exonerate Rudolph, and delivers a stern but persuasive indictment of US government injustice.Mark Weber Director Institute for Historical Review1) In 1993 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeal held that OSI attorneys (in the Demjanjuk case) had acted with reckless disregard for their duty to the court and that they had committed \\"fraud on the court\\". Yet no one was fired and the OSI is still in operation. Years of observing its activities have convinced me that their approach is fundamentally flawed and incompatible with international human rights standards. In my opinion the OSI is un-American, undemocratic, unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers money.2) The German rocket team served the people of America with loyalty and distinction. The American people and all humanity owe them respect and gratitude for their significant contribution to the space program. The uses of science are in the hands of good and bad politicians. Science and technology are apolitical.Alfred de Zayas an historian who authored numerous books including Nemesis at Potsdam. (G&ouml;ttingen)American educated lawyer (Harvard) and former Secretary of the United Nations Human Rights Committee and currently professor of international law.He is President of the United Nations Society of Writers & Secretary-General of the PEN Club in Geneva, Switzerland.The author, who worked closely with members of the Wernher von Braun Rocket Team for many years, is highly qualified to present the historical events in the USA. Like many high ranking army officers, who had a direct knowledge of the Team's work during WWII he disagrees with the discrimination and railroad attempts of the Office of Special Investigations that started in 1982. Supported by extensive documentation and logical conclusions he hopes that the injustice will be corrected.Dr. Walter HaeussermannThe author studied a huge amount of \\"Rudolph case\\" documents. He discussed this topic over many years with Rocket Team members and other interested persons. Based on his military and juristic background he concluded that the United States Justice Department has done to its citizen Arthur Rudolph a grave injustice by lying and distorting facts, which led to his expulsion from this country. The book updates the public on the shameful mistreatment that this outstanding scientist received from the country, which he had chosen, as his post-war home and for which he had contributed major advances in technology and management. These unlawful \\"Justice\\" Department actions have disgusted thousands of his former coworkers in Government and Industry and they want these illegal actions revoked and the distorted space history corrected.Konrad DannenbergConfirmation of Dr. von Braun's remark about Bill WintersteinErnst StuhlingerSeptember 13, 2002.Colonel William E. WintersteinDear Bill,Thank you for your letters of September 9 and 10. - I would like to make three comments:(1) my remark to Constance of May 2000 In Huntsville should be expanded somewhat, as indicated in my letter to Constance (enclosed).(2) there were 5 members of the von Braun team who left the team (for greener pastures: Magnus von Braun, joining the Chrysler Corporation; Martin Schilling, joining the Raytheon Corporation, Theodor Buchhold, joining General Electric; Adolf Thiel, joining Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge; and Hugo Woerdemann, starting his own company.3). In the summer of 1969, after the three astronauts of Apollo 11 (Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins) had returned safely to Earth, I remarked to von Braun that it was really fortunate that he decided in Fort Bliss during the late 1940s not to accept one of the lucrative offers from industry, but to stay with his team and the American Government, and to wait patiently for better times. \\"Yes', he said. \` The credit belongs to Bill Winterstein. He persuaded me, and I believed him!\\"Bill, I hope this will be useful to you.

All of these efforts were intended to help the motivated improve their understanding of good writing as well as their skills in writing.The Pocket Guide to Writing in History replaces all of my earlier efforts in one handy resource. With an introduction to research, note taking, formulating and supporting points with evidence, citations & bibliographies, it's an excellent guide for advanced high school and college students in writing in-class essays or lengthy, long-term research papers.The Guide briefly considers the different types of history writing assignments, and offers unique suggestions for preparation and execution for each format. Its primary referencing focus is on the Chicago style of foot/endnotes, the style most widely used in history. Plus, the 5th edition includes more up-to-date citation format examples for internet sources, a big improvement from the 4th edition.Writing is a key skill in this discipline, but most teachers have little class time in which to teach it. As a stand alone student resource, the Guide is the best option I've found.

It talks about the types of writing assignments that are used in history and how to approach them. It gives a straightforward explanation of each step in the process of writing a research paper. It has a nice explanation of what plagiarism is (although like most scholars she describes it as a form of theft rather than fraud) and how to avoid it. Finally, it gives University of Chicago forms for footnotes and bibliographies in the back.When compared to the other introductions to history writing on the market--and I've looked at over half a dozen of them--Rampolla's book is shorter, more to the point, and less expensive than all of them (MUCH less expensive than some). The publisher is to be commended."},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide to Writing in History","review":"This is a great intro to writing history papers and any research paper in general. Dr. Rampolla is one of my favorite teachers and I know from experience that she definitly knows what she is talking about in her book. The new edition is even better with a guide to researching over the internet! I would recommend this to anyone who like me writes a lot of research papers."},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide to Writing in History","review":"I started teaching first year university history this year, and was looking for an inexpensive yet thorough resource to recommend to my students.

I never cared much for writing in my history courses until i had this with me. The authour of this guide really knows how to associate the outside world and set examples to get you started with ideas in writing a good history paper."},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide to Writing in History","review":"This book is a pocket guide and lives up to the name. Everything is summarized and made simple. Sometimes the simplicity leads to confusion, but the guide acts as a reference to solve the problem by finding another source. Overall, by itself the guide is okay, but utilized with other manuals, it is a great tool."},{"Title":"Colored Pencils","review":"Has good examples for how to achieve different effects. Several use colored pencils along with other media (watercolor or felt pen). My main interest in the book was the four 6 to 10 step examples (including specific colors)to learn techniques using grapes, stawberries, apples and cherries."},{"Title":"Colored Pencils","review":"Ordered a number of these for teaching students in my art class. Works great because of the step-by-step instructions and photos."},{"Title":"Don't you turn back;: Poems","review":"This book is a collection of 45 poems organized along four themes, including \\"My People,\\" \\"Prayers and Dreams,\\" \\"Out to Sea,\\" and \\"I Am A Negro.\\" The language of the poems is simple, with common words. Some poems employ dialect, while others use rhyme. Most poems are ten lines or less, with some poems only ten words long; only two poems are longer than one page. Although often addressing the subject of race, many of the poems speak to universal and stirring themes of dreams, pride, and possibility. The poems are accompanied by several full-page woodcuts done in black, white, and terra cotta; the type picks up the same color scheme. The illustrations are stylized and handcrafted, depicting everyday scenes pulled from the poems. This collection also includes an introduction by Arna Bontemps and indexes of the poems by title and by first line. Young readers will be attracted by the longer, more descriptive poems, as well as the lyrical poems. However, many of the short poems written in plain language are deceiving in their simplicity and many readers may not appreciate these poems as poetry. As a whole, the book lends itself more to the study of Hughes' work and of African-American culture than to leisure reading."},{"Title":"On Great White Wings: The Wright Brothers and the Race for Flight","review":"There is no shortage of quality biographies of the Wright brothers (I particularly enjoyed The Bishop'sBoys by Tom Crouch), and with the Centenary of their historic powered flight coming up in 2003(December 17th), there are likely to be a few more added to the shelf. An author (or authors) wouldtherefore do well to have something about their book that will distinguish it from the others. In theexquisite new book, On Great White Wings, Fred Culick and Spencer Dunmore have found just thething to separate them from the crowd; not only do they explain the technical details of the Wrightbrothers achievement in the most accessible prose you're likely to find, they also provide a plethora ofphotos and diagrams that give the reader a brand new appreciation for the brothers' feat and for theirother, less well known, accomplishments.The illustrations, over 200 in all, include actual photos of Orville, Wilbur, and the various iterations oftheir famous Flyer; vintage photos of Kitty Hawk and other locations of importance to the story, andmany modern color photos that serve as helpful reminders that these were real places, real men and areal machine. Meanwhile, the authors rescue the Wright brothers from the mythology that has grownup around them--that they were little more than gifted tinkerers--and shows just how knowledgeableand innovative they truly were.The book also includes a few pictures and some information about a project that Mr. Culick, aprofessor of aeronautics at Cal Tech, is involved in, which will seek to duplicate the Wright brothers'feat. Well, almost duplicate it, that is. It seems that the original Flyer is so unstable that it is widelyconsidered too dangerous to try and fly an exact replica.Any reader looking for just one book about the Wright brothers will find this one to be adequatewhere the text is concerned and quite probably unsurpassed when it comes to illustrations. But, ifyou've the time and the inclination, I'd recommend that you read Bishop's Boys for its morecomprehensive treatment of the Wrights and then refer back to On Great White Wings when you'retrying to visualize their remarkable flights.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"On Great White Wings: The Wright Brothers and the Race for Flight","review":"I've purchased several of the books on the Wright Brothers released in anticipation of the centennial. This is the best I've read so far. I especially enjoyed the many photographs of the several Flyers and of the brother's home, workshop and test locations in Dayton and NC.I also appreciated the way the author examined and explained many technical details of how the flyer was rigged and how the controls operated.This is one of the few books about the Wrights that explains the true importance of what the Wrights discovered, the secret of coordinated control of roll and yaw.This book is well disserving of space on the coffee table of any aviation enthusiast."},{"Title":"Harlem: The 30's; Postcard Book: Postcard Book (Postcard Books)","review":"It has been said that a picture can say 1000 words. These postcards are indicative of that. The national museum of art has released a book of postcards by Aaron Siskind entitled Harlem the 30's. A wonderful collection of depression era photographs depicting harlem at that time. Most books about Harlem seem to mostly be preoccupied with the Harlem Renaissance and the people around that time. Harlem the 30's is about a different time a time after the renaissance when the depression hit the country. The collection is a real snapshot of what it was like to live , work, and play in Harlem in the 1930's. These 30 black and white postcards are not of celeberties but of real people from professionals to the street vendors to the children, even the homeless. Well worth it if you are a collector of B&amp;W postcards like myself, or like want to see a good piece of history."},{"Title":"Harlem: The 30's; Postcard Book: Postcard Book (Postcard Books)","review":"It was barely worth the four bucks I paid.

The main problem in my opinion is that there is just not enough story here to justify buying the book for a child to practice with, unless you were going to get it for them as a preschooler, and then let them read it later, or else use it with younger siblings.The artwork is colorful and bright, and there is rhyming, but the silly story (a good thing), isn't one that's likely to keep older children coming back for week after week. Not like the \\"Little Bear\\" and Seuss stories, or the \\"Frog and Toad \\"books.The Accelerated Reader designation is 1.5 by the way, which means that this book is suitable practice for children reading at the mid-First Grade level.

It's a great biography and also gave me a feel for what early New England life was like."},{"Title":"Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theologies from the Underside","review":"I first read 'Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theologies from the Underside' for my first theology class in seminary, and it has remained a book I've returned to again and again throughout my seminary career. One of the most impressive features of this text, articulated in the very title, is the diversity of voices contributing to the collection. The contributors include men and women, Asians, Africans, African-Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics and Native Americans. The contributors list reads like a who's who of modern liberation theology.The contributors are Steven Charleston, James Cone, Mary Potter Engel, Robert Fukada, Bonganjalo Goba, Jacquelyn Grant, Carter Heyward, Anita Hill, Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz, Kwok Pui-lan, Mercy Amba Oduyoye, Mary Pellauer, Sharon Ringe, Young-chan Ro, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Andrea Smith, C.S. Song, Susan Brooke Thistlethwaite, Leo Treadway, and Victor Westhelle. Just a reading of this list should compel most persons interested in modern theology to want to explore this volume. One of the key elements in the approach to theology from these writers is that they intentionally seek not to speak to or for particular communities (or, even less, the whole of humanity) but rather with and on behalf, clearly identifying their own specific and eccentric starting points.The theologies herein presented are very contextual, as indeed all are, whether they admit to that or not. They are intentionally communal and praxis oriented, intended not for 'mere' thought and speculation, but to be put into concrete action in the world. The theologies are prophetic and constructive, viewing any and all sources with a critical suspicion that lessens the likelihood of oppression. They are open for revision and growth, and frequently not afraid to admit to not knowing.One thing obvious from this text is that there is no monolithic liberation theology -- rather, there are many theologies that fall under the heading of liberation, that look for the preferential option for the poor and oppressed of different character. However, all have significant elements in common, such that they can fit well together into the overall systematic framework Thistlethwaite and Engel provide here. The 'classic' categories of traditional systematics are employed, but with new emphasis. The doctrine of God is not a metaphysical examination, but rather a questioning in a more practical sense of who God is for us. The editors move the section on eschatology, traditionally consider 'end things', forward, to show that we are always living in the midst of eschatology, and that we must concentrate on things now, not just a distant, ambiguous future.The editors combine the rest of the sections under the broader heading of 'Grace' -- creation, sin, Christology, community, healing, scripture. All these fall under the broad definition or influence of grace from God. There are more chapters devoted to dealing with scripture than any other topic; looking at the biblical texts from particular contexts (both the mujerista and the feminist perspectives) as well as the approach by Kwok Pui-lan of the Bible in non-biblical worlds. We in the Western world seem to forget how intrinsic the biblical text is to us, and how foreign it can be to non-Western readers.This is an important volume, an accessible and interesting collection of essays that provide a good introduction and a good overview of liberation theology for beginners and for more advanced readers."},{"Title":"Bevelyn Blair's Everyday Pies: The Ultimate Workday, Weekend, and Special Occasion Pie Book","review":"I am fortunate enough to know Bevelyn personally and to have sampled many of her cakes, pies and other delights.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bevelyn Blair's Everyday Pies: The Ultimate Workday, Weekend, and Special Occasion Pie Book","review":"I fell in love with Ms. Blair's recipes in her book, \\"Everyday Cakes\\". Short, to the point, and real prize-winners, every one I've done. I found the same with this book. Like the prior reviewer, what is truly appreciated is that they WORK! I've bought so many cookbooks that either waste a ton of time with peripheral stuff or pretty photos, but then can't deliver the goods when it comes time to actually cook out of them! You needn't worry with Ms. Blair's work. It does help if you know basic cooking techniques simply because the recipes are quite brief on those. What happened to her cookie book? I'd love to get a copy. This, along with her cake book, is a real primer for dessert-minded cooks."},{"Title":"Bevelyn Blair's Everyday Pies: The Ultimate Workday, Weekend, and Special Occasion Pie Book","review":"Over the years cookbooks have evolved from mere collections of recipes to works of art replete with photographs and the colorful ramblings of the authors. This book harkens back to the former. It is a comprehensive collection of pie recipes, nothing more, nothing less. There are neither photos nor charming anecdotes nor historical notes.The collection of recipes is extensive and the ones I've tried (pineapple meringue, lemon grand meringue and a number of the angel pies) have been satisfactory. However, the instructions are skimpy and an inexperienced baker might find this less than acceptable.If you are tired of the chitchat and art and want recipes plain and simple, this is the book for you.

At least, you had better believe this, if you want to benefit from this book. Smith is talking to hands on hobbyists, which want truly unique machines. Often heavily souped up. The pages of the book are in colour, which helps show even motherboards and videocards as pretty. Candidly, those of you who think this is impossible should pass on this book.The text goes through the basics of each type of component, for virtually all the types that can go into a computer. As already mentioned, motherboards and videocards. But also power supplies, memory, monitors etc.It is important to note that the photos are not just of isolated items. Several series of photos show clearly how to install a component. The colour photo sequences are well done. More useful than traditional black and white sketches that vendors might supply. These are common because vendors have slim margins, and more elaborate colour diagrams are costly. So the book tries to address this gap, amongst the issues it addresses."},{"Title":"Maximum PC Guide to Building a Dream PC","review":"I bought this book in '05 when I got the itch to build my own system.

However, I was often confused by what was happening, when it was happening and who was involved. There were too many characters.

With clarity and confidence, the author presents key moments in the life of Lois Moran. He also spends a third of the book exploring her relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald. Buller had a vast amount of information at his disposal: Moran's journal and autobiographical notes, her son Tim, and Moran herself. Plus, he researched numerous books and contemporary newspaper articles. Intimidated? Don't be. Buller pulls all the pieces of the puzzle together for us, in a seemingly effortless flow of historical events. Don't know the works of Moran or Fitzgerald? Buller provides clear summaries. Then, he takes us to the next level by analyzing how Moran influenced Fitzgerald. In addition, the book provides many pictures with helpful captions. Even if you've never heard of Lois Moran, this is a \\"must have\\" for anyone interested in F. Scott Fitzgerald, movies, or the Jazz age."},{"Title":"A Beautiful Fairy Tale: The Life of Actress Lois Moran","review":"I had never heard of Lois Moran - now I am a fan! Richard Buller's fascinating account of this remarkable woman is brilliantly researched and beautifully written. Why more has not been made of this shining Hollywood star is a curious mystery. Happily, Mr. Buller fills us in with style. He describes the era adroitly and offers surprisingly intimate historical nuggets, sly humor, and a deep poignancy that moved this reader to tears. I felt as if I were walking with Lois every step of the way. Like meeting an old friend for the first time. Her gleeful, almost childlike kinship with life attracted sparkling people and events; yet her \\"grown-up\\" values guided her to always hone her gifts and to help others. A unique example that despite our heartaches, we can indeed create a \\"beautiful fairy tale\\" of our lives. A delightful, revelatory read. Inspiring."},{"Title":"A Beautiful Fairy Tale: The Life of Actress Lois Moran","review":"Lois Moran's life and body of work, so carefully portrayed by Richard Buller, are a living tribute to the wonderment of Lois Moran, the person. Here is a portrait of some eighty years of giving without reservation to the people of this planet.The author's insightful and diligent research, coupled with some memorable findings in her journals, papers and photographs, have made this book a true and masterfully constructed literary achievement."},{"Title":"A Beautiful Fairy Tale: The Life of Actress Lois Moran","review":"I suppose I first encountered Lois Moran as most people did, via Scott Fitzgerald's portrayal of her as Rosemary Hoyt, the ingenue in his tragic 1934 romance TENDER IS THE NIGHT. Since Arthur Mizener identified Lois Moran as Rosemary's \\"original\\" in his 1950s biography of Fitzgerald THE FAR SIDE OF PARADISE, her name once again became recognizable, and we began to think of her as a silent film star who must have beeen cute, but surely without talent otherwise wouldn't her performances have survived? Now Richard Buller steps forward with this biography of the actress herself, both in and out of her relationship with the great novelist, and his book shows us that she's perhaps even more interesting when considered as an actress alone, and not just a Lolita-like playtoy.Buller explores the bond between Gladys (Lois Moran's mother) and her daughter, and rebuts the myth that Gladys was a conventional stage mother who disliked her daughter's interest in married men. Gladys is worthy of a book all of her own! She took Lois from their settled life in Pittsburgh and brought her to Paris as a teen to escape the repressive US climate of the day, and to show her daughter life in big beautiful capital letters.Stardom in the movies was only a sort of lagniappe to Lois, who abandoned Hollywood when she married in 1935. And she was signally a free-lance player, one who evaded the contractual obligations of any one studio (except for a brief and not too happy contract with Fox). That may have precipitated her withdrawal from cultural memory, however, for I think in the classical cinemaa the studio really built their stars up, and the ones who played it free-lance aren't as well remembered today. (We know Clark Gable, for example, better than we know, say, Irene Dunne.)Buller has uncovered three short stories that Lois Moran wrote about Scott Fitzgerald, it's a shame that his publishers couldn't have authorized their publication in an appendix, for the excerpts he quotes are fascinating. Just as tantalizing are his descriptions of some of Moran's movies. I for one am going to go on a hunger strike until Turner Classic Movies schedules a showing of WEST OF BROADWAY with John Gilbert--the ultimate \\"bad luck\\" movie from Buller's description.Lois Moran went to Broadway and starred in two Gershwin musicals (OF THEE I SING and LET 'EM EAT CAKE), then married an industrialist who ran Pan Am, Clarence Young. In the Youngs' luxury apartment here in SF's North Beach, on Vallejo Street, they hosted a secret wartime conference with FDR, Lindbergh, and other luminaries. I'm going to go there later today and try to talk my way into the graces of the current owners of the building and photograph the room where it all took place. After Clarence and Gladys died, Moran's later struggles with alcohol make for sad reading. What a story! And what a woman!"},{"Title":"The sound I saw: The jazz photographs of Roy DeCarava : January 20 to March 20, 1983","review":"I believe this book to be one of the great secrets of the 20th century. Roy De Carava's paper back version of The Sound I Saw is an unblievable collection of jazz musicians photgraphed with an eye that sees what is not there. His images of John Coltrane and many other great musicians are captured in light that is so soft and minimal that it is difficult to think of anyone else who could have achieved what he has done. His creative heart and mind are beyond category and this book was never available in great numbers. At the time of its publication it received little publicity and I feel priveleged to own a copy. The larger and expanded hard cover version published after 2000 is also extraordinary and both of them are gems to behold. That Roy De Carava is not more widely known is an indication of the ignorance that still exists about what photography is.In years to come future viewers will come to appreciate just how much of a real creative soul this man was and how his creative eye was way beyond the average person's perceptions. I treasure these images and his vision of jazz musicians and see them on the same level as Rembrandt - without any hesitation - as his delicate use of available light and his perception of the right moment is beyond criticism.

Noyed, is devoted entirely to a single letter. The idea is to give beginning readers a fun way of mastering letter recognition by telling an entertaining story highlighting a single letter. In \\"Fred, Me, and the Letter F\\" we meet a boy whose friend is named Fred and learn about all the things they find that begin with the letter \\"f\\" when they go camping together. Throughout the book words with the featured letter are highlighted, with miniature color illustrations above important words in the text (rebus drawings of friend, fish, feather, fire, etc.), and color photographs. The ultimate goal is for beginning readers to get to the point where they can read these books for themselves.The first thing young readers learn is the difference between the capital letter \\"F\\" and the lowercase letter \\"f.\\" Children are also introduced to the way \\"f\\" can be at the beginning of a word like \\"fish,\\" in the middle of a word like \\"giraffe,\\" and at the end of a word like \\"calf.\\" You will find lists reflecting these three categories in the back of the book, along with Fun Facts about fish, flapjacks, and frogs, as well as suggestions for books about each of those three appropriate for the beginning reader (e.g., \\"Dr. Seuss's \\"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish\\"). Because not all of the words that begin with the letter \\"f\\" are highlighted, young readers will have plenty of opportunities to find more examples of this most important letter on their own as they work on reading this book on their own. Then they can move on to the thrilling sequel, \\"Grandma, Grandpa, and the Letter G.\\""},{"Title":"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, Vol. 4: The Great Democracies","review":"I had been meaning to read this book for a number of years. It has sat in my book shelf collecting dust. The pity is that I did not read it sooner.Churchill provides a lively and readable account of the great democracies of the 19 th Century. He starts with the years following the Napoleonic Wars and concludes with the Boer War. In between, he covers the American Civil War in some detail as well as progress in the other English speaking nations of Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. He also touches on other issues in Europe, particularly the rise of Germany under Bismarck.I can thoroughly recommend this book to the reader of general history. It has whetted my appetite to go back and read the earlier volumes. If they should be half as good as this one, it will be a pleasant journey."},{"Title":"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, Vol. 4: The Great Democracies","review":"This book concludes Churchill's four-volume history of England and to a lesser extent, the U.S. (and to a much lesser extent, Canada, South Africa and Australia).Although generally good, at times Churchill's pro-English biases shine through. In a way, the whole set seems to be the story of a country growing up and the end is kind of a happy arrival in adulthood. It is interesting to read an &quot;outsider's&quot; view of American history, however."},{"Title":"In the New World","review":"I picked up this book on a whim and found it engrossing from the first page. Since I was born after the baby boomers, It explained alot of things that I had always wanted to learn more about. Certain cultural references made about those times have been cleared up for me. I didn't give it five stars because it is a little wordy, but it is a great commentary on our culture. Read this book if you are a history buff."},{"Title":"In the New World","review":"Although I had to read this book for school, I found it to be suprisingly good. I would reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book was awesome. It takes a very very deep and granular look at SQL server. I just got a job as a SQL DBA and I wanted to know everything there was about SQL server. For three months I read this book on the bus to and from work, and now, when an issue comes up at work, i am AMAZED by how much I know. He also really prepares you with the transition to SQL 7, hinting at possible new features as he goes along. If you had only read this book, you would know more about SQL 7 than you think!Only 2 negative comments: Very pro-microsoft and anti-competition. Oracle has GOT to do some things better than SQL Server, but you would never know that by reading this book. Also, this book is NOT A REFERENCE book. It is a story about SQL Server, and if you get to the end, you will be a kick-butt DBA."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This is a must-have for any *serious* SQL 6.5 DBA or developer. It is not the only book you must have, it does NOT explain how to use SQL Server (hence the bad review given by someone who had never used it). It explains, very clearly, how it works, and what happens under the bonnet. Reading it really gave me a very clear understanding of what goes on, which means I can use it better, more efficeintly etc. There is a great section on Query optimisation, which I've just started, but so far so good.If you want to learn how to use SQL Server, get Wynkoop's &quot;Using SQL Server 6.5 Special Edition&quot;, if you've got that or similar, and want to know more, get this one."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"If you are new to SQL server or TSQL, you should buy a TSQL reference or &quot;teach yourself&quot; type of book rather than this book. After you finish learning TSQL, then BUY THIS BOOK and STUDY EVERY PAGE. When I first started learning SQL this book was too advanced for me. But after getting a grip on SQL syntax, you will realize that this book is truly the BIBLE. I have bought 4 SQL books (plus I have all of the books on line) - and whenever I can't find an answer in all of those other books I know that it will be in Soukup's. And it always is.This is not a &quot;how to install&quot; SQL server book - as some seem to have mistaken it for."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"It is not often I give 5 stars (except when I eat Chinese food). I learned more about SQL Server from this single book than any other source. Concise and clear explainations. Detail where it needs to be. I used this in developing my first SQL Server 6.5 app. I am so confident now I can talk intelligently with DBA's and systems people. From VB to admin to BCP to T-SQL. If I had a reference like this for other products I would have very few books. Great!"},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book MUST be on the shelf of anyone seriously using SQL Server. It has information not found anywhere else, and the author immediately establishes his credibility. The chapters on locking, cursors, architecture, and performance tuning provide information that is invaluable for developing high performance apps, and that information cannot be found anywhere in the rather mediocre documentation of the product itself, nor in the knowledgebase at microsoft.com. This book is not for the novice. I note there was one bad review here of the book - by someone who had difficulty installing SQL Server. This book is not for him for sure - and Soukup is pretty clear on that. In fact, that chapter is not at all about &quot;Installing&quot;, but rather just planning for the right hardware and baseline configuration to go with. It has a great discussion of RAID configurations, and I realized that I had been running a suboptimal RAID-5 system (as my Proliant came configured). After a long weekend, I reconfigured everything in lines with the guidelines in this book, and saw an immediate, significant improvement.I hope this book will be revisised quickly when version 7 ships !Thank you Mr Soukup for this great work."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"We have to admire people like Ron Soukup.

I had never failed and exam before! With this book, my score improved by 250 points. Material I couldn't find elsewhere was answered in abundance in this book. ( As an example, I failed to find material concerning an update in place elsewhere, yet there are 13 pages concerning that topic in this book). Very thorough, yet enjoyable. A must read for anyone preparing for the SQL Database Design exam."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"I read the book carefully and found the topics of SQL Server Architecture and Locking to be very important. Especially, the book has covered architecture part in great details, which no other books mentions about.

It touches on EVERY aspect of SQL Server 6.5 that you want to know about, and is written in a very readable format. This is very important when the subject matter is technical. Let's face it - no-one relishes this stuff, so when a book such as this is written in a manner which MAKES you want to read on, that's a great thing!Well done Mr Soukup."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"The majority of this book covers transact-SQL, so if you're a developer, you may benefit from this. If you're charged w/ setting up a SQL server and want to take full advantage of Enterprise Manager, then skip this book."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Get the facts straight from the source. The author is convinced that MS SQL is the best thing since sliced bread and that fact alone makes you want to keep reading. His positive and professional attitude puts the reader in the right mood to absorb and learn. He's not the &quot;neutral observer&quot; kind of author usually encountered (he's a member of the development team).Simply put, this book has the most actually useful, less known information about MS SQL I've ever seen (I've read more than 6 books on the subject). No &quot;idiot-proof&quot; hand holding, no useless screen shots. This book assumes you HAVE used a computer before and that you ARE a computer professional. Every suggestion given in the book is accompanied by the logic behind it as opposed to &quot;change this setting to this value because I say so&quot;.Soukup is now on my list of &quot;must-read&quot; authors. Thanks Ron."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book is very technical and dense and is definitely one of those few stubbon ones that demand an undeterred mind to read. Everything Ron has to say is important and the time and effort invested to acquire his specialized knowledge is worthwhile."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"A very readable book that provides a unique insight into the innards of SQL Server. This book has a lot of information that you will not find elsewhere. I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Very informative book that examines the SQL Server rather than the SQL Language. Good coverage of history. Well written and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book is a must have for anyone working with MS SQL server. It is in the same class along with the classic &quot;Advanced Windows&quot; and &quot;Inside MFC&quot; developer books. And it is perhaps much more readable due to author's experience as a true insider with broad perspective. Chapter 1 is an interesting business case study of how SQL server became what it is. It sets a new standard for the inside type books. Although it doesn't go in length on replication and distributed features, I would hope that we will see revision or updates after SQL server 7.0 is released."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"I bought this book based on the good reviews it received here,but I was severely disapointed.Soukup claims that installingSQLServer is easy. &quot;I'm proud to say that even a novice can comfortably install SQLServer in less than 10 minutes&quot;, he writes in the book. But nothing could be further from the truth. I've installed databases on UNIX (Linux and SolarisX86) and personal Oracle for Win95, without any problems, but SQLServer stubbornly refused to install on my WinNT 4 Server. In spite of numerous problem reports Soukup doesn't even mention that you might not be able to install SQLServer on your machine, let alone give you any guidance about what to do if you do have problems.In addition to these problems I found that the rest of the book is bloated with advocacy and fluff. I've worked with one SQLServer installation that crashed several times a day. Yet there is no entry for &quot;reliability&quot; in the index.Soukup was general manager for SQLServer and this book appears to be an advocacy job instead of an attempt to address the problems that people have encountered with his &quot;child&quot;. Interestingly, he notes the frustrations that some customers have had with SQLServer, but apparently feels no obligation to try and provide fixes or a work around for them.This will be the first book that I've been forced to return for a refund in a long time. And it definitely does not deserve the good reviews it has received."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Only by really understanding how a sophisticated piece of software works can you get the most from it as a developer. This book provides so much information, you could almost use it write SQL Server for yourself! Ron Soukup also shows that technical literature does have room for personal comment and amusing anecdotes.Well done Ron, I eagerly await 'Inside SQL Server 7.0'"},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book was very helpful for preping for the test, as was the MS training books I also bought. The difference was that Soukup's book was interesting to read."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"I had a lot of expectations for this book when I ordered it, and it has fulfilled those expectations.

If you do anything with SQL Server (including admin), you will find the whole book really illuminating."},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"Surprizingly, this is a reference book that can actually be read, a 'Soul Of A New Machine' for MS SQL Server. It is also the only book to have a useful section on Extended Stored Procedures in the whole search list and includes working C code on the CD ROM. Its ended more than its share of my rants about how lame SQL Server can be in places by explaining why a design decision was made. This book will quickly become an old friend because its like sitting next to the design team on a long flight and having them fill you in on how the product was actually built. For all of its strengths though, its more of a thought piece than a 'how to' piece. Try ISBN 0-672-31190-9 for DBA instruction and ISBN 0-672-31244-1 for programming Triggers, Stored Procedures etc. Personally I find it gratifying that Microsoft still honors intellect enought to publish such a book. After 25+ years of programming I really enjoy hearing from the 'Grey Beards'. You have to have this one!"},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","review":"This book is probably one of the most complete ones I have read so far.

In that case, I will assure you that it is everything you could possibly expect from the editor of Competitor Magazine and then some. As you read the captions and relive the moments in each year's race summary, you can't help but smile with gleeful anticipation of your next trip to the finish line. If you have difficulty explaining your compulsive addiction to your family and friends, this book will help bridge the gap. The pictures are stunning not only in their completeness but also in the quality with which they have been reproduced. You might remember the scene from a videotape or broadcast or maybe you were even lucky enough to see it live. But never have you seen the athletes leap from such glossy pages with the detail and ferocity that they do from Babbitt's creation.Still, perhaps you don't really know who Bob is. Honestly, I didn't realize he had been inducted into the Ironman Hall of Fame in 2001 until I saw the list in his book. I understood his mantra and I have always been happy to digest his publication whenever I stumble upon it. But, I never really assimilated what was so unique about Bob Babbitt until the night I spent with my nose glued to the pages of his book. I read every word, cover to cover. This was the night before a relatively important half Ironman race. I should have been sleeping, but I was transfixed.I had always wondered why so many have said that Bob Babbitt has given back more to the sport than anyone else. The answer to my confusion lies entirely in the perspective that this humble and humourous man so graciously shares with anyone and everyone. Yes, you can get all of the factual history from Tinley's voluminous musings. And you get get the buzz of Kona from reading Mike Plant's Iron Will. You can be an armchair pro by reading about Brad Kearns' adventures. You can obsess about every detail of each workout in your schedule with Joel Friel's guidance. But none of these experiences give you the cumulative clarity and insight you get from Babbitt.Babbitt's true gift to all of us is his understanding of how we view the giants and dwarfs of our sport, how we obsess about the great battles all the way from the front to the back. Babbitt can see exactly how we respect the grueling journey, the brutal conditions and obscene distances that make Kona so much more than just another race. Sure, Phil Liggett can bark through the leaderboard with his charming accent and amusing wit. Mike Riley can keep a crowd dancing for hours. Both of them are legends of our sport and without them it just wouldn't feel authentic. But neither of them can bring the experience home to your coffee table after the fact the way Babbitt has. While it may be impossible to dislike Babbitt and his clearly selfless ambitions, it is even more difficult to put on his glasses and not see Kona more clearly than you ever did before. You simply cannot read his words and not feel the excitement and drama he wants to share with you.There are only two pages of the book that really don't belong, 48 and 49. They exist as a sad testament to the reality that nothing about triathlon seems to make any financial sense. Those two pages, however, are overwhelmingly offset by 126 and 127. Relive those 80's haircuts, see Jurgen in his Zorro shot, and revel in the cheesy humor that Babbitt has gotten all too good at through the years. If you want one reason to convince you of Babbitt's greatness, flip to this pair of pages and stay a while. In a sense, it's a mild spatterring of his life's work. It's also an extremely abbreviated list of the major players in Kona. But look beyond the faces, hair, gear, and race attire and you'll see Bob Babbitt waving at you from the pages of his book. He is inviting you to share his vision for a moment, making you feel like the most honored guest he has ever known as he serves up heaping portions of grit, determination, courage, and desire.I put together the best multisport race of my life the day after reading this book. Thanks Bob!"},{"Title":"25 Years of the Ironman Triathlon World Championship","review":"Forget about the coffee table,t his book is one you should keep by your bed side and dream of the Ironman.In one book, the author manages to capture the characters and color that define the Ironman Triathlon-this will become the quintessential history on the event and it earns the 25th anniversary title.From the historical race figures such as Dave Scott and Mark Allen to the Judy Molnars, this book reaches the common reader and fanatic. The pictures are great, I am going to take mine with me all season and have people autograph their pages...Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"25 Years of the Ironman Triathlon World Championship","review":"In short this book is superb , anyone that has had anything to do with the Ironman and especially those that have finished the Ironman will relish this book . The book provides a wonderful historical documentation of the Ironman through words and photos .

The book also lists the the placegetters of every race since the inaugral race of 1978 .Put it along side Tinleys historical photo book . Well worth getting this one !"},{"Title":"25 Years of the Ironman Triathlon World Championship","review":"This is truly a coffee table book - the photographs are stunning and the stories are amazing. The Hawaiian Ironman is a special race and this book conveys all the beauty, drama, joy, and pain that make up the unique experience of the race.Leave this book on your coffee table and you will be touched again and again by the memorable images and inspirational stories.

Introduced how and where the potential attack may happen and several techniques to avoid attack. Detailed information how to use Java signing tools (for Netscape Signing Object and Microsoft Authenticate Code)and security APIs.However, from the developer's point of view, some very important topics such as Public/Hybreed Encryption, SSL, EJB, Servlet topics are way too light. Almost no touch on CORBA and RMI. Some of the contents can be obtained directly from SUN's site and most of the examples in the book are not ture client/server, and also borrowed from SUN's tutorial.The Author may not target the audience as developers but the architects of network security. However he spends a lot of chapters to explain the security features (i.e class loader, file verifier and security manager) coming with Java programming language and how to customize/modify them. Anyways, as a developer, I am disappointed with the examples given (no innovation from the author but basic copies from SUN and very trivial).Since I am new to Java programming language let alone security issues, and there is very limited resources available both on the book market and net, I still obtained valuable information from the book, I gave it four stars. For real world security developer guru, the book only introduced basic java network security and cryptography APIs."},{"Title":"JAVA 2 Network Security (2nd Edition)","review":"This is the greatest computer book I have ever read.The first three chapters of the book are an introduction to Java security, and they are very helpful to people who are new to Java security, just like me. The same concepts are covered later in the book in greater detail, so it may appear that there are some repetitions, but in reality the author informs you many times that if you are an expert, you should probably go directly to Chapter 4, and read the advanced topics.In fact, this is an advanced book. Nevertheless, you will not get lost even if you are a beginner. The author covers advanced topics with a very simple approach and even tells you how to perform the simplest operations. While this can be sometimes boring if you already know Java programming, I guess that basic information is always useful, especially if readers are not very familiar with the topic.In this book you will find the architecture of Java security as well as advanced topics such as cryptography, SSL, Java and firewalls, Netscape and IE Java security, Java plug-in, and many other things. There are many examples and screen captures that help a lot. The final result is that, after reading this book, you will feel like a Java security expert.There are some imperfections, but overall, this is a great book. If you are interested in Java security, buy this book. You satisfaction is guaranteed."},{"Title":"JAVA 2 Network Security (2nd Edition)","review":"This is an excellent book.

Yet, after reading this book, I feel that we will be able to create a fully secure applet -- creating a trusted applet and making it work with encrypted communication between it and our server.The technical information is delivered clearly and concisely. But I also enjoyed the first couple of chapters which describe Java Security for the &quot;intelligent non-specialist who does not need all the details.&quot; These chapters will be extremely useful for me when I explain to my bosses why we should use Java Security. I highly recommend this book.(No, I have no relationship to the author or the publisher. I am really just a satisfied reader)."},{"Title":"JAVA 2 Network Security (2nd Edition)","review":"This book suffers from horrible editing. The book starts by repeating itself with the same information on class loaders and verifiers, then continues on to repeat itself on javakey and jarsigner. They actually appear to have copied the text from one chapter to another.Later, the book has a 26 page description on servlets and their uses. Only six pages are used to describe the security model for servlets, which, by the way, is the same model that all java programs run under, and is described in several other chapters.After continously repeating itself, the book finally settles down into insulting your intelligence. They actually tell you what to type in to compile and run each example. The book actually says &quot;We compile this code using the java compiler: javac Count.java&quot;. I may be wrong, but I think people reading an advanced java book know how to compile and run programs.There is even one example where they give you a screenshot of a program's output, then give a written description of the program's output.There is still some good information in this book, but the bad editing makes it hard get."},{"Title":"JAVA 2 Network Security (2nd Edition)","review":"there are few books, which really explain deeply the security with all its issues.

This book is written by 5 authors, you will find that different authors talk about same topic in different chapters.

At first, the author shows that Stella begins an ordinary young woman's life into the dating world. With a stable background such as hers, one would think that she was fully equipped to deal with relationship.However, that was not the case. Throughout the book, Victor shows that there were some glitches in Stella's background (especially in what her mother never taught her about men) that did not equip her for the strong heartbreak that began her path to emotional depletion. When one puts the pieces together, it all becomes clear that every facet of Stella's life affected her relationships, especially after she became emotionally vulnerable from her break-up with Kevin.Facing Our Skeletons details some very interesting stories that most women will probably not want to talk about even though they identify with them. The book is everything but ordinary. Victor not only talks about the characters, but she also takes us into their mind and helps us to understand why women do the things that they do. With the powerful contents of the book and all the priceless life lessons and \\"self-therapy\\" sessions that we get from Stella, I felt cheated that Facing Our Skeletons was not much longer than what it currently is.Other than this, I can say that Victor put a lot of effort into not only providing the readers with a \\"good\\" book, but a \\"good\\" book to learn from. Let me just warn you that this is not really a book for a \\"simple-minded\\" reader. Victor gets her props!"},{"Title":"Facing Our Skeletons","review":"I am not usually a reader. A friend of mine handed Facing Our Skeletons to me. From looking at the cover of the book, I just knew that something interesting was on the pages. I was right. All I can say is that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Facing Our Skeletons","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK, I COULD RELATE TO SOME OF THE CHARACTERS, IV'E BEEN IN SOME OF THESE SAME SITUATIONS. IT'S ABOUT LIFE AND LEARNING HOW TO MOVE ON AND GROW WHEN WE NEED TO.IT'S A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS GUIDANCE IN THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS."},{"Title":"Facing Our Skeletons","review":"First of all, I am almost convinced the author of Facing Our Skeletons, Carmel S. Victor, knows me. The story is mainly about this young lady, Stella, who starts off in what she thought was the perfect relationship. That was until she got her wake up call. Since then, Stella never healed from her failed relationship before moving on to the next one. She kept the same habits and expectations. She wasn't able to start moving on until she started facing her own skeletons and focus on her spiritual life.This Rebecca character was something else. She reminded me of my ex-best friend, very sneaky and competitive. She did a nasty backstabbing move on Stella.Dev was a hot mess. But, what I liked about him was the fact that he was honest with Stella from the get go.My favorite character was Marcia. That girl was crazy at first, but I am glad later on she decided to give that new guy, Robert, a chance, even though he wasn't her type.All the characters were realistic and interesting. Just about each one of them reminded me of someone I know in real life.Sometimes I was so mad (especially with Stella), at times I laughed so hard(when Marcus was caught in the lie about his age), when Stella felt depressed, I felt depressed too.This is one of those books that you can't help but become part of the story."},{"Title":"Facing Our Skeletons","review":"Stella is a woman that has a knack for loving men that do not love her in Carmel S. Victor's novel, Facing Our Skeletons. Initially, Stella falls in love with Kevin, a man who is faithful and loving until he goes out and cheats. Although Stella is pregnant, and Kevin's unfaithfulness hurts her, Stella refuses to see the warning signs. Blind to the obvious in each relationship thereafter, Stella does not see her errors in judgment of character and continues to make the same mistakes over-and-over. It is no surprise when turmoil and sadness become Stella's constant companions. Tired of the status quo, she takes a step back and puts her love life in God's hands.I found this novel to be lacking when it came to suspense and conflict. The novel had a lot of material to work with but failed to keep my interest. Although Stella was interesting and so were her relationships, there was more telling then showing. With a little more plot and some action or suspense, this story could have been a little more engaging. If this is a self-help book the story would have benefited if the author had told it more in a nonfiction voice rather than fiction. If this story was meant to be fiction, the needed elements of suspense and conflict were missing.Once Victor studies the craft, avoids point of view and change in voice conflicts, and decides if she will be a fiction or non-fiction wirter, she will recognize her potential to become an excellent writer.T.

I identified with each and every character in the story. At times I cried and at times I laughed. Overall, I was totally inspired."},{"Title":"Facing Our Skeletons","review":"I rate this book as excellent. The author, Carmel S. Victor did an amazing job at exposing the innermost emotions of the characters. Facing Our Skeletons captivated my mind with its real life stories of real people who have real character defects that are interferring with their ability to find hapiness from within. Every single character in the book (especially the women) reminds me of my own life or someone that I know. I thought I was the only one who went through certain things. The book caused me to want to take a closer look at my own emotional life and spiritual life and do a little bit of cleaning up in my own closet."},{"Title":"Facing Our Skeletons","review":"As I was reading this book, my colleagues were very curious as to why I was reading a novel on relationships. Facing Our Skeletons provides a series of excitements, hope, fear, and deceptions that go with the experience of falling in love. The book depicts the story of Stella and her three subsequent relationships with the following gentlemen: Kevin, Michael and Dev. Although Stella has strived to find the love of her life in each of these three men, she has found instead the brokenness of heart and soul.The book has 124 pages and is broken into 33 chapters. The author has captured both the appetite and the imagination of the reader through each dialogue. She has also proven that she is an accomplished novelist by allowing the story to flow with her command of the English language.The construction of the book, including its cover, meshes well with its chapters and lends itself successfully to the subsequent drama and suspense of each of the characters. Each dialogue is preceded by an anecdotal which leads the reader to follow the story with ease and clarity. Victor projects the issues and the many intra-personal conflicts that kept lulling Stella into the arms of the wrong partner.The content of the story conforms to the nomenclature of such disciplines such as psychology, sociology and conflict resolution. Victor presents the characters as individuals who wanted the best out of their relationships but were unable to fulfill their wishes due to their own individual issues. However, Stella was able to overcome the pain of her unstable relationships through self-actualization. Finally, she decided to change her life's priorities by putting God first.I highly recommend this book to all men and women who are thinking about dating or who are currently dating. This novel offers some prescriptions or ground rules for what to look for in an intimate relationship in terms of red flags. It is specially recommended to practitioners in the field of psychology, sociology and conflict resolution. Although the quality of the manuscript was excellent, I was able to identify two typos. Nevertheless, the credibility of the content of the novel does not suffer since those typos did not alter the meaning of the story. I give this book an \\"A.\\"Reviewed by Manes Pierre, Washington DC, August 5, 2004"},{"Title":"Facing Our Skeletons","review":"This book is a tale of a strong woman blinded by society.

More than people realize, individuals have the power to control their role in a relationship, and to direct how that relationship is going to work.In FACING OUR SKELETONS, we meet Stella a woman in constant pursuit of a knight in shining armor. She's an intelligent, beautiful single mom and seems to have what so many women want. But she believes the hype that she needs a man to be whole and since she does not have one, it affects her self-esteem. She hungers for something that does not exist, the perfect romantic relationship.Stella experiences one bad relationship after another, accepting insensitive treatment by the men with whom she's involved. She is so busy concentrating on pleasing others her relationship with herself suffers. Stella has no idea who she is, and until she knows herself, how can she know what she wants to give or receive in a relationship?FACING OUR SKELETONS had the potential to be a really great story, but sadly it fell short. It starts out like a novel, but slowly seems to evolve into a self-help book with Stella preaching to readers about what they should not accept in a relationship. Another issue I had while reading this book was that the book was written in first person and there seemed to be no transitional statements. For example, Stella is telling her story and then all of a sudden she is involved in a conversation with a secondary character. This was very distracting to me and took away from the story. However, I did admire Stella. She never gave up on herself no matter what. With stronger transitions and stronger editing FACING OUR SKELETONS could be a good book.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawksof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"What's Beyond Loving....","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. For a long time, I have been feeling lost as a single parent. After reading Cynthia's book, I have learned that I am not alone and most importantly, there is something that I can do about it. If you are a parent, you have got to read this book! Thank you Cynthia Keen for writing it!"},{"Title":"What's Beyond Loving....","review":"This book exceeded all my expectations because it contained original, thought-provoking ideas. I did not find any rehash of ideas from other books I have read on parenting. The author (Cynthia Keen) reduced in common sense language the path to engendering happiness in ourselves and in our children.The first step is to define what we want. What is it that we want from life and the parenting experience? By making this explicit to ourselves, we will influence our behavior toward our children and so influence them to positive development. In sum, we want them to be happy, well-developed human beings.So Keen answers the question of her book, \\"What is Beyond Love?\\" by telling us that we must facilitate our \\"children's deepest being\\" to develop an ability to be responsible (in a sense they must become \\"response-able\\") to the circumstances of life. In turn they will be better response-able to their life circumstances/problems to achieve what they will later define/want from their own lives. That capacity to live and love life--to actualize one's capacity/achievements--will be to our children their happiness. So as the title suggests, love in itself is not enough--we as parents have to go a step farther and act to assist our children to develop character and be responsible (or \\"response-able\\") people. To do so will engender in them a greater capacity to view life as a gift--a treasure to be revered--and so have the highest expectations of life and for themselves.Thus Keen tells the reader that there are plenty of life opportunities (provided by divine Providence) to develop that innermost being or character in our children. However, this process is counterintuitive (that is, it might contravene what we feel as love). We as parents need to allow our children to experience the effects of their own negative decisions no matter how much we may want to interfere from a sense of parental love (and so Keen explains \\"what is beyond love\\"). Keen is careful to advise, however, this should be within reason, of course. To illustrate her point, she cites an example from her own life (pp. 66-67) when her own son was suspended from the school bus for several days for misconduct on the bus. Keen flat out told her son that she would not drive him to school. She instead recommended that he contact friends for a ride to and from school. She ingenuously (and ingeniously?) coached him on other possible alternatives to include phoning the school principal, which is what he did! He called the principal at home on a Sunday evening (without Keen's interfering or participation) and arranged a compromise with the principal so that he would be able to ride on the school bus. (He was to receive his discipline through other arrangements at school.) Unlike many parents who would otherwise \\"love\\" their children and so drive them to school notwithstanding, Keen's point was to teach her son that he had an ability to respond to the circumstances of his life (to be responsible or in my own words \\"response-able\\"). The result was that he became more self-confident, more responsible for a positive outcome of an otherwise adverse situation. Keen posits that if a parent interfered in such circumstances the parent would first risk the child feeling not bound to the law of cause and effect; and secondly make the child feel incapable of meeting similar problems on his or her own, problems that may, in some cases, be worse in the future. Keen advocates that the parent go \\"beyond love\\" and help their children develop self-confidence by allowing them not to precociously solve their own problems per se, but, more importantly, to learn cause and effect in society; to respect other people; to value self-control; to recognize limits, boundaries, and rules; and to build self-confidence in their own ability to effect positive outcomes to their circumstances in life (without parental interference).Let me pause for a moment. Keen's ideas are not tough love tactics. Tough love typically is motivated by intent to punish or humiliate whereas Keen's intent is that the child have an immediate appreciation that he or she can favorably determine the outcome of their adverse circumstances with confidence. Unlike the tough love parent, Keen has already defined what she wants from her parenting experience, and that is that her children treasure life and have the highest expectations of themselves. Tough love would presume that the hard knocks of life would influence children toward becoming self-confident, happy individuals. It does not, and Keen would not endorse this tactic as representative of her thoughts.To continue, the difficult moments of parenting, then, are for Keen opportunities provided by divine Providence to influence the development of our children. If we are willing, the Divine Spirit will use us as parents to develop our children's character through the adverse experiences of life. When our children are frustrated or fail, this is a clue (better, a cue) that we must correct something. To repeat, we as parents must use these opportunities for teaching our children about respect for other people and their property; understanding the cause and effect relationship of behavior on other people and circumstances; understanding how our self-control influences people and circumstances; understanding tolerance and acceptance of others--in a word: understanding to respect life and other living beings. AFTER a child has developed that character, then they will be best prepared to meet the challenges of life with high confidence and expectations in themselves; this here is then the key--our children will then be \\"response-able\\" to establish and achieve their life goals--they will feel confident, nay, deserving to them--this development will result in great contentment and happiness for them and even to us as parents--in a word, their self-actualization within the miracle of life . . . this is the point of Keen's book."},{"Title":"Instant Web Pages!","review":"I moderated for Sierra for a few years for Web Studio.

Unless you're a beginner with Hemingway, there's very little of interest here, except perhaps Hemingway's remark that he writes every novel as though he were going to die afterwards.

The details and bits get absorbed into my subconscious, and eventually \\"happened\\" as far as my brain is concerned. Of course, there is some literature where one wants that cerebral infection of bold ideas and beautiful prose; reading those classics ties us with the past, allowing us to share experiences with species-mates of previous generations and, hopefully, improves our own vision of the present. \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" by Sinclair Lewis is just such a novel.\\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is an alternative version of the 1936 U.S. presidential election. But, instead of FDR garnering the nomination from the Democratic Party, the nod is given to Berzelius Windrop. Windrop abuses the vulgar side of democracy to get the masses behind him, raises a standing domestic army of \\"Minute Men\\" and reverts the U.S.A. to a fascist state.Lewis's window into these events is through the eyes of Doremus Jessup, a small town Vermont newspaper editor. In Jessup's view, the world has been turned upside down. During the run-up to Windrop's reign, Jessup believed that America would prevail - that plain-talking, thinking people who work hard and view themselves as part of a community would never allow the likes of a fascist into the White House. In the New America, intellectuals and liberals are vilified as unpatriotic, and Doremus Jessup finds himself immediately up against the rising stars of Windrop's administration: those people that had been disenfranchised by the previously free market and those of Jessup's peers willing to secure their own status at the cost of widespread social injustice. Sound familiar?The corruption of democracy described by Sinclair Lewis is far in excess of the actual state of the American Union. However, I did have to read over 100 pages before the emerging tyrant, Berzelius Windrop, engaged in practices unrecognizable in today's political repertoire. The parallels were uncanny though, and as a hard working, intellectual liberal myself, I have benefited from absorbing Lewis's made up history. \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is a prescient wake-up call that it CAN happen here.Sinclair Lewis, F. Scott Fitzgerald and me, spent our formative years in Minnesota. I originally purchased \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" to get in touch with my roots. I can strongly recommend this novel to all those Americans (not just those in the North Star State) that favor liberty and community over autocracy and power."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"\\"If the people of a democracy are allowed to do so, they will vote away the freedoms which are essential to that democracy.\\" - Snell PutneyMost of what Sinclair Lewis wrote since he won the Nobel Prize isn't worth reading. It Can't Happen Here is a notable exception, perhaps the only one. The \\"It\\" in the title refers to a fascist regime taking over the United States. The easy reply is that it HAS happened here; proving so is a bit more challenging. Very well then, let's.One of Lewis' traits is to date every book he writes; another is to inject real people into his fictional stories. Both habits reduce his timeless commentary and observations to period pieces, which may be why his books aren't much read any more.The story starts in 1936, when fascism had already invaded several European countries, and threatened to spread. It follows a small-town newspaper editor through the U. S. presidential election campaign and its aftermath. Berzelius Windrip (\\"Buzz\\" to his friends, \\"Buzzard\\" to his detractors) wins the election by promising immediate relief from the economic depression, and immediately clamps down. His followers, dubbed \\"Minute Men\\", enforce Windrip's various whims.Those who express opposing viewpoints are treated as enemies of the regime, and are jailed, or worse. When the prisons become full, concentration camps open. Executions multiply exponentially. Soon, enemies are found within the ranks, and the dictatorship starts feeding on itself. Two coups later, the military has taken over, and war against an easy victim is declared.Meanwhile, an underground resistance is formed. Initially, it's easily infiltrated and quashed, but as the military demands more and more men, internal policing is diluted, and resistance is, if not completely uninhibited, at least easier to accomplish.The novel invites comparisons to today's political situation:Does the successful candidate who promised a better economy deliver a worse one? Naturally.Is the President a mere front for more sinister interests? Accurate.Are judges replaced with cronies? Legally.Do vicious thugs enforce laws, some of which exist? Check.Do loyal Brown Shirt types do the dirty work? Bush uses entrenched government enforcement personnel for that. The closest private equivalent would be rabid talk show hosts.Does mindless patriotism mask far deeper problems? Perhaps you've noticed.Travel restrictions? Got 'em.Are spies everywhere? Not in human form. Orwell foresaw the ubiquitous cameras.Are old books burned? Christians certainly host such bonfires, and libraries and universities keep their collections \\"current\\", but old books can still be found in private collections and used book stores. On the other hand, since the September 11 terrorist attacks, publishers have been shying away from letting \\"controversial\\" topics become new books.Is free speech restricted? You bet.Are newspapers and other media also restricted? Not necessary - since they've become government, religious and corporate mouthpieces, they censor themselves.The inevitable war? More than one.Concentration camps with sadistic guards? Only for foreigners. So far.Has government provoked paranoia? Why do you ask?Is human life cheapened, degraded, and expendable? Except for fetuses. Once you're born, you're a target.Yikes! Does Dubya stand for Windrip?Some of the parallels weren't new when this book was written. Entertainment as news became big business during the Roaring Twenties. Splitting families apart occurred during the misnamed Civil War. Depending on that vague yet reliable Someone Else to thwart those dastardly Bad Guys is as old as America. And government has always been run by low-lifes.There are also some differences. Windrip abolished Congress, but Bush has a partisan Congress to do his bidding. Windrip was popular enough that he didn't have to commit election fraud. Bush has yet to be overthrown. And in Lewis' book, the dictator came from the Democratic Party, while the Republicans are the good guys - imagine that.Still, the similarities far outnumber the discrepancies, and indicate that the United States is on the fast track to fascism, if it's not already arrived. You might try to find and read It Can't Happen Here - before all known copies are burned."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"In the 30's, it seemed that democracy in America was on its last legs: Fascism and Communism seemed to have history on their side and to be sweeping aside every other form of government. Lewis, an old-fashioned Liberal, saw the clear possibility of a uniquely American (and yet drearily familiar) Fascism, one that conformed to Mussolini's definition: a merger of State and Corporate power. (Very few people know that a group of industrialists mounted a well-organized attempt at a fascist coup during FDR's administration. Unfortunately for them, they solicited a general with republican ideals who ratted them out and they all went to prison.)Though Lewis is windy and opinionated at times, there are strong characterizations and sharp observations. I particularly liked his depiction of refugee Americans running up against the compassion-fatigue that Europeans who fled Fascism in the 30's were finding in their host countries.In these days of narcissistic American bellicosity, many people are remarking on this novel's prescience. Though I think it's been somewhat oversold as a book of prophecy, I recommend it for people who are already avid readers of 20th century American history and want a window into the volatility of America between the wars, before FDR saved Capital from Socialism.My usual disclaimer: I hate being forced to rate books with asterisks, as though they were air conditioners. I give any decent literary novel 4 stars."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Why does it rank above Orwell's \\"1984\\" in importance? Well first of all, \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" predates 1984 by 13 years. Secondly, 1984 was written after WWII, while Lewis' book was written before it. That's a very important thing to try and keep in mind when you are reading this book. If you are successful in remembering that this book predates WWII, then it will absolutely blow your mind. You would have thought Sinclair Lewis lived through the Third Reich when really, in 1935, Hitler's government was still in a rather embryonic state.Lastly, Orwell wrote of \\"Big Brother,\\" a fictitous an almost god-like sci-fi entity; Lewis wrote of \\"Corpos,\\" a much more realistic and close-to-home horror. And if you don't know what he meant when he calls them \\"corpos\\" then you need to pay closer attention. Remember the old Mussolini quote, \\"Fascism is a collusion of CORPOration and government\\"? Enough said.I'm not trying to take anything away from \\"1984,\\" which was great; but this book by comparison receives almost no attention. It's not even really that easy to find in a store. Why was it so overlooked? The book is a little slow in places, and the writing is sometimes convoluted. Lewis is of an older generation than Orwell, and wrote in an older style which is a little dated today. But if you can get through the first half, the second half will give you nightmares."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I read this book as an adolescent after WWII and before the McCarthy era. I read all of Sinclair Lewis's books and I think that he accurately portrayed the citizen of the U.S. of his time. When the present administration (not really elected) began its repressive tactics, I remembered this book. I think that all Americans who think that there is no danger in allowing the president to acquire monumental powers and who are not afraid of an insidious takeover of our most basic rightsshould read this book. Although the characters are exaggerated and very much Lewis's particular style, Lewis portrays clearly what can happen if we allow the government free rein. It's amazing that this book was written before Hitler; it predicts the take-overs of the modern dictators."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I will start my review by quoting another review: \\"In a republic such as ours, we get the government that the most afraid deserve. If enough people get afraid enough, we could have a form of dictatorial leadership sprout here.\\" (Steven Savage, Sept. 23, 2005)When one reads a Sinclair Lewis novel, one must always keep in mind that, as a satirist, Lewis always writes with a \\"point\\" in mind. To my eyes, the above quote sums up Lewis's point well. \\"It can't happen here,\\" Lewis's characters obsequiously say. That is, until it does.The country Sinclair Lewis paints for us is one scared to death by economic insecurity and the threat of communism. These fears are briliantly played on and the nation is whipped into a frenzy by Democratic candidate Buzz Windrip. He will, he says, redistribute wealth (everyone likes that, right?), defeat the communist (nothing wrong there!) and look out for the little guy (which everyone thinks describes them). What Windrip, a once-country-bumpkin now ambling through history, actually does is quite different. His first act in office is to try and pass an amendment to the Constitution relegating congress to an advisory role only. When congress refuses, Windrip declares a state of emergency, and uses his \\"war powers\\" to lock up all dissenting congresman and force the amendment through anyhow.Suffice it to say that from there, it goes down hill. A less futuristic version, perhaps, of \\"1984,\\" \\"Anthem,\\" and \\"We.\\"Though I loved the message of the book (libertarianism against a centrally-planned state), as a story, it is surely one of Lewis's weakest. The plot becomes quite cliche and cumbersome, while the characters are divied up into the ever-predictable and obvious \\"good\\" and \\"bad.\\" (I expect this of lesser writers like Ayn Rand, but not of the astute Sinclair Lewis.) In other words, it is an enjoyable and poignant novel, but you will likely not be blown away with anything here.A quick warning to those tempted to read the book solely or primarily to find paralells with the Bush admin. While there are plenty to be had (using excuse of a war to expand presidential authority, the utilization of the Christian vote, Buzz Windrip's \\"common man\\" charm,) these readers might be disappointed. For all that, Lewis is equally hard on the left (fake promises of money and programs to the working class, the urge to nationalize things like healthcare, the mere fact that Windrip is a democrat, etc.) Lewis's stance seems neither republican nor democrat (he is way too smart for that!) Rather, lit seems more Whiggish and libertarian. (Good for him!)To close, while \\"It Can't Happen Here,\\" will not disprove the notion in the book's own title, it will - or should - at least give its readers pause to consider the possibilities."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"\\" Sinclair Lewis, the first American to receive the Nobel Prize For Literature, wrote this satirical political novel in 1935, a time when the United States and Western Europe had been in a depression for six years. In this novel, Sinclair Lewis asks the question - what if some ambitious politician would use the 1936 presidential election to make himself dictator by promising quick, easy solutions to the depression - just as Hitler had done in Germany in 1933.\\"As frightening and politically current today as it was then..."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I found this book to be quite unnervingbecause a lot of the problems it talks aboutcan be found in America today.

Yet......"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Good read of how any democracy can be subverted into a fascist state. Not just &quot;thinking Americans&quot;, but all thinking people should read this book."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"This 1935 novel begins in a small town in Vermont which has the differences of classes and people to represent the United States in a nutshell. There is talk by some to prepare for the next war by military training in college. From that, Sinclair Lewis builds a fantasy 1936 election between two fictional candidates: Walt Trowbridge and Berzelius Windrup. \\"Buzz\\" Windrip is a chameleon of a politician who easily adjusts to any audience. [Was he modeled after Huey Long?] But a lot of the references mean little to those born after 1965. Buzz's campaign speech is a clever parody of real politicians: he wanted high wages and low prices, etc. Chapter 8 has the \\"Fifteen Points of Victory\\", which may be as satirical today. The fifteenth point creates an Imperial President. [How close are we to that today?] The oratorical skills of Windrip suggest another Wilson, or maybe a Hitler (Chapter 9). Many of the details are now obscure (Chapter 11). Chapter 13 gives the author's opinion of the many reformers who sought a better world. Chapter 17 explains how this Corporate State was organized, and how it controlled and exploited most of the workers, who were now in \\"labor camps\\" (company towns?). The resulting inflation allowed Big Business to pay off old debts cheaply, and doubled their wealth (Germany in the 1920s?). Promises made to the people are deferred, then forgotten. A physician who protests the arrest of Doremus Jessup is summarily shot, and his property confiscated; his wife and child left homeless.The story continues with Doremus Jessup seeking to oppose the rule of Windrip. He starts to print pamphlets (Chapter 26). A modern state, by controlling the press, various associations, and the armed forces, can dominate the population better that in medieval days. The mismanagement by the Corpos is measured by the increasing poverty of the people (Chapter 29). Finally, the Minnie Men come and take Jessup away (Chapter 30). Jessup is beaten, then given a virtual life sentence. \\"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\\" said Newton. Effingham Swan discovers this in Chapter 33.As happens with other criminal gangs, personal conflicts lead to changes. \\"Buzz\\" Windrip is deposed by Lee Sarason. Next month Lee Sarason was shot by Secretary of War Haik, who became the new Chief. Haik becomes a Puritan Emperor after purging the administration (Chapter 35). Changes at the camps gave Jessup a chance to escape (Chapter 36), and then cross the border to freedom in Canada. There was a story about Mexican bandits invading a Texas tow - when everyone was away! This meant war. But an unanticipated rebellion occurred against the Corpo regime, and split the country. Jessup will be sent back as a secret agent (?) to organize resistance. In the last page Jessup is awakened so he can flee a Corpo posse, and continue the struggle for freedom. Like other dramas, the question of success is left unanswered. This is worth reading, even if as out-of-date as \\"Looking Backwards, 2000-1887\\" or \\"The Iron Heel\\". They give different views of a possible future. Perhaps the first novel on this subject was \\"Caesar's Column\\" by Ignatius Donnelly."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"A fascinating look into the political climate of the 1930's. In some ways, Lewis missed the boat (genocide was too much even for him to contemplate), in others he gored oxes that a Y2K reader would find difficult to swallow (his most despicable villians have this apparently nasty habit of preferring same sex partners in group sex games). At times it is a chore to read (particularly at the start) as he spends more time in political commentary than in plot development, but the insight into the 1930's mind more than makes up for it. The particular targets of Lewis' contempt are just about everybody. Fascists, Communists, Liberals, Conservatives, Homosexuals, Jews, Blacks, Capitalists, Religious leaders and constitutional democracy all receive the point of his spear. But, probably the true value of this work, Lewis does identify as the one true villian as those in the middle, the people who take no extreme position, because it is their unwillingness to take action that allows the extreme elements to take over and make the evil happen. Overall, it's a great wake up call to anyone who thinks it can't happen here, and who feels someone else should take the risks. The reader must ignore the prejudices (particularly as to homosexuals and persons with religious beliefs) to get to the core message, and for some this may be more than they can do. Three stars because it is such a chore to read, I imagine most readers give up after about 100 pages as too much dreck to get to the story, but it's worth finishing."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I give this book mixed marks, but I still recommend it. Its premise and argument get five stars; its execution as a novel may get two. I think the premise of this book shows flashes of genius, and several aspects of it are still both funny and chilling by turns. The features of the book that are most clever are its conception of what an American fascist president would look/ sound like, and its sketch of how power may change hands from a rational democracy to a corporatist/ fascist state. \\"Buzz Windrip,\\" the \\"Corpo\\"-party's figurehead, is anti-federal, anti-press, pro-corporation, willfully anti-intellectual, speaks in a chummy, populist idiom, and he drips with sentiment and religiosity. His brown-shirt-like security force, which eventually supersedes the national army, is called \\"The Minutemen,\\" and they wear quaint, throwback uniforms. One notes Windrip often says things that Michelle Bachmann or Rick Perry or similar \\"folksy\\" candidates nowadays intone. E.g., \\"When I am protestingly dragged from my study and the family hearthside into the public meetings . . . I try to make my speech as simple and direct as those of the Child Jesus talking to the Doctors in the Temple.\\" We know this personality on the major political stages moreso in 2011 than we would have in 1960, oddly, when it was cooler to be rational in politics than it is now (God help us). Sections of Windrip's ghostwritten autobiography called \\"Zero Hour\\" are highlights of the book and seem like they could have been written by several known candidates within the last five years. As a cultural argument, this book is often good: e.g., the Corpo University, filled with sports, military rituals, and bland engineering courses, is made a utilitarian cog in the statist machine in ways suggesting not only counter-reformation-style \\"patriotic\\" editing of textbooks and setting of curricula (see Texas, 2010), but also state universities that have devolved into technical colleges for \\"citizens\\" or consumers rather than places that encourage robust thinkers. But as serious fiction, the book struggles to define its characters, who mostly remain prototypes, and worst of all, the action in the book is often rendered in sketchy, synoptic ways that resemble an authorial outline. Lewis wrote this book quickly, and it wasn't to its benefit. Lewis seems to impatiently avoid giving events in the novel any gradual drama, poetry, or suspense: rather, the novel is a rapid (and long) catalog of events that merely . . . \\"happen.\\" That many of the events are tragic, darkly funny, and plausible, doesn't redeem the novel from its rather hackneyed style and mode of development."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Weird; a book with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Weirder is how, if one didn't know when it was written, a reader might see it as being about any number of events and regimes in the last 80 years, including some very recent ones and some ongoing international actions. As a dystopia, it's one of the better books I've read lately. I wasn't fond of the writing style, including the many, many offhand references to authors I've never heard of in order to communicate everything those authors communicated and more. Dry in places, most engaging in the final third, and still somehow relevant, I don't know whether to recommend this book, or who to.

In these frightful pages an unscrupulous Buzz Windrip is elected President in 1936 on a platform of Corpism - giving all jobless work and each family $5,000. Once elected, Windrup uses his personal police force (Minute Men) to arrest Congress after they refuse to surrender their power. Soon there is martial law, with the Minute Men running forced labor camps for jobless, and concentration camps and special courts for dissenters. Witnessing this is newspaperman Doremus Jessup from Vermont, plus his friends and neighbors. After trying to flee to Canada, Jessup ends up in a Concentration camp. There his fellow prisoners are beaten, urged to turn in their friends, and sometimes shot without trial. After two years of this nightmare, a ray of hope appears. President Windrup is deposed in a coup, his even-worse desposer is murdered in another, and a sort of revolution begins seeking to restore Democracy to the USA.Sinclair Lewis wrote this book in 1935, two years after Hitler grabbed total power in Germany during the Great Depression. The parallels to Nazi Germany are obvious (Corpos=Nazis, Minute Men=Gestapo). Too bad few saw the danger as clearly as this author. Lewis has a slightly thick style, but these pages soon fly past the reader, and remain a solid reminder of the fragile nature of democracy and freedom."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"\\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is a staggering read, in terms of its unflinching cruel look at reality - the fact that something like what Sinclair Lewis describes can very easily happen here in America. Lewis' novel examines the very fragile nature of democracy and how everyday citizens can get swept up in the charisma of a fascist leader. What may make the novel even more astounding in premise is that it was written during the Great Depression before Hitler's most unfathomable intents were made known; much of what happens throughout America in the novel mirrors what happened in Nazi Germany with ordinary citizens turning a blind eye to injustice in the name of reform and prosperity.The story is told mainly through the viewpoint of Doremus Jessup, the editor of a daily newspaper in a small Vermont village, who always tells the truth no matter what. He witnesses firsthand (and through radio and newswire accounts) the fervor that surrounds the presidential candidate, Buzz Windrip and rightfully fears what will happen to America when Buzz is elected. And with good reason, for Windrip's 'Fifteen Point Plan' includes an impossible scheme to make every citizen rich, except of course for the Jews and Negroes. With Buzz elected as president, America quickly becomes a nightmare of a dictatorship, with everything from speech to education being controlled, with subversives either killed or placed in concentration camps. How can Doremus tell the truth and provide for his family if it means putting everyone close to him in danger? Are one man's moral obligations to what is right worth sacrificing everything for? It's a question that Doremus struggles with throughout the novel.Sinclair Lewis penned a brilliant and scary satire with \\"It Can't Happen Here\\", a story balanced by its odd wit and humor. But the story is too often sidetracked by its very own main character; parts of the story meander for pages with no apparent end in sight. It's almost as if Lewis had more to say on the subject but wasn't quite sure how to work it in to the story. Despite the setting of the mid-1930s, the truly frightening aspect of \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is exactly how applicable it is to today's world. Readers will recognize certain fears and hysteria that have marked these few years since September eleventh, and in a year of presidential elections, this story may make readers think a little more carefully about the power of persuasion."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Some of the elements of \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" were specific to Lewis's time. The home-style fascism he adapts from the European version of the 1930s succeeds by a demagogy that might have worked during the Depression, but would be political suicide nowadays: in an imagined 1936 election that unseats FDR, the empty-headed \\"Buzz\\" Windrip wins the presidency by promising a minimum income for all American families and a wealth cap on the rich. Could anyone dream of such a platform succeeding today (outside Berkeley or Santa Monica)?Still, there are elements that make this book riveting and current: the manipulation of fear and greed, the polarization, the demonizing of opponents, and the absolutism of ideology: Either you're on our side - totally, unconditionally - or you're a traitor.While I found some plot turns a little hard to swallow - most notably, the speed with which Buzz and his cohorts (he has a Karl Rove-like handler) are able to break down America's legal system and impose rule by thuggery - the central idea that hallowed traditions like rule of law and checks and balances can, under the right conditions, be subverted, is something we really need to think about. Fear and laziness are indeed democracy's enemies."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I often had to remind myself that this book was written in the mid 1930's. Much in the book is such an on-target description of what is happening today. The following thoughts of Doremus are eerily close to our present day leader.\\"The one thing that most perplexed him was that there could be a dictator seemingly so different from the fervent Hitlers and gesticulating Fascists and Caesars with laurels round bald domes; a dictator with something of the earthy American sense of humor of a Mark Twain, a George Ade, a Will Rogers, and Artemus Ward. Windrip could be ever so funny about solemn jaw-drooping opponents, and about the best method of training what he called 'a Siamese flea hound.' Did that, puzzled Doremus, make him less or more dangerous?Then he remembered the most cruel-mad of all pirates, Sir Henry Morgan, who had thought it ever so funny to sew a victim up in wet rawhide and watch it shrink in the sun.\\"Yes, it can happen here."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"What a terrific novel. I laughed all the way through, perhaps even as far as the priestly Falck tending to blemishes on his overcoat in the Trianon Concentration camp. Doremus Jessop is a political hero, in spite of his disregard for organized religion (if he gathers at the home of the Catholic pastor Perefix, who tends to be perhaps closest ideologically). Doremus Jessop, proprietor and cheif editor of the Fort Belulah, NH newspaper, is the protector of Democracy in its truest American form; it takes 350 pages to show just how and why. Humour, in the form of the crispest tongue in cheek political satire, underscores the novel, perhaps even in a suspenseful scene as the young Sissy Jessop attempts espionage in the presence of the lecherous Ledue by attempting to copy his high security keys into wax and toilet paper in Ledue's bathroom. Humour, and suspense, real, tragic suspense, walk hand and hand, compliment each other perfectly. This book has serious undertones, displays how unnervingly similar a Gestapo type command could break out over America, and perhaps may still bear relevance despite having been produced in the 1930's, as we witness today a heightened dependence on security and surveillance. This book is relevant."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"The parallels between the mid-30's and 2010 in the US are remarkable. Lewis tells a very chilling and humorous tale of what can happen when a charismatic leader comes along during a period of disparate distribution of wealth and persistent and widespread unemployment. He warns of what can happen to the rest of the previously successful and comfortable population (the educated middle class) when they are trapped between the greed of big money and politics and the desparation of the disenfranchised.I think every American should read this book.

Lewis has a fantastic ear for language and tone. His satire is always spot-on.

Deserves more readers!"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"This is an interesting story of a fictional Fascist takeover of the United States originally published in the 1930s (note: pre-World War II) - during the \`golden era' of FDR and around the time that Marine General S. Butler was actually approached to lead an overthrow of FDR and establish a Fascist regime in America (see Jules Archer's book entitled \`The Plot to Seize the White House').The storyline can be summed up by badly paraphrasing some old ideas:1) When good people don't act, evil persists and wins2) When they came to take the Jews, I did nothing. When they sweptin to take others at different times, I did nothing. When theycame for me, there was no one left to help me.The tale begins with an election process where the cultural elite are pushing for change and a presidential candidate to lead them to a different worldview and behavior. Their candidate wins and this misguided elite riff-raff fade into the smelly dustbin of history as he asserts his grab for change and power (this has happened before and will happen again) with his version of \`brown shirts' assisting, and humanity suffering the results of the elite's stupidity.The story continues on with the Fascist takeover and describes the radical changes imposed. The storyline shows the deadly nature of the changes when the main character's (a New England newspaper editor) son-in-law is summarily executed for insulting some junior Fascist leaders while trying to protect the main character in a kangaroo court type proceeding.The concentration camp sections are more realistic and a lot more humane than those of actual World War II Nazi Germany.The tale concludes with uncertainty. The struggle continues with no resolution after a series of governmental coups and the rebel movement gathering strength.The author, Sinclair Lewis, has a habit of creating names for his characters which are highly distracting to the reading flow. The book's story line is interesting but is weak overall. The anti-government characters appear and act like foolish amateurs, although the government hacks are portrayed as more criminally inept in the plot. Another interesting feature of this pre-WWII novel, are the occasional brief references of the solidarity of fascist in America and their kind in Germany and Italy.Considering the fears of a segment of American society and considering the political climate in America in 2009, this book is an important cautionary tale. Another thing to remember, during the 1930s many cultural and business elite did envy and wanted to imitate Hitler and Nazi Germany. Plus, business corporations have never had as much power and ability to control and dominate things as they do now within the United States (see \`Shock Doctrine' by Naomi Klein for some examples)."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"The story of a fascist takeover of the United States by big business. The chief strength of the novel is its chilling portrayal of the United States after the bad guys win power. However, for the modern reader, Lewis's novel suffers from several faults.Most seriously, there's a lack of context. Sinclair Lewis didn't need to provide context to his contemporaries in 1935; it was obvious that the United States was in a depression and that there were demagogues all around. However, the the protagonist newspaper editor and his family and friends are comfortable and seem largely unaffected by the desperate times. Without context, the appeal of the populist demagogue who gets elected is unclear, and lends a confused tone to the book. Also, the editor protagonist is uninteresting. He correctly refers to himself as a \\"bourgeois intellectual\\" who faithfully reads the New Republic and is unconsciously and sneeringly condescending toward anyone who doesn't share his enlightened political views. He's the sort who happily and unthinkingly voted for Adlai Stevenson in the 1950's and for Mr. Obama in the 2000's. He's also ineffectual. The book picks up a little narrative momentum when he belatedly starts to fight back after the inevitable fascist takeover, but he spends most of the book bemoaning his helplessness to prevent what he sees is coming or as a hapless victim of the thuggish corporate state.If you look at the trillions of dollars Presidents Bush and Obama distributed over the past year to their cronies on Wall Street and in Detroit, you can make a good case that we live in a corporate state today, albeit one with the trappings of democracy. The illusion of choice makes us happy, but whoever we vote for, the plutocrats will always win. The chief value of the book today is that of its portrayal of a rotten state devouring itself and the collateral damage to its citizens."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"All right, little roughed up, but readable...edges in back chipped and cover split, not as clse to being what was lead to expect."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"These 2 books were purchased for my son in Texas.He is completely happy with the purchases,has added them to his library collection of old books.I'm thankful that you have this type of purchase available.

There are so many parallels in this book with what we observed in the last presidential administration: military tribunals, attacking people who speak out against the government, people spying on each other, warrantless wiretaps, takeover of the media by propagandists. This book, like \\"1984\\", should serve as a warning to all Americans that a fascist dictatorship CAN happen here - it nearly did in 2000 and 2004 - and that it behooves all of us to safeguard our democracy because it can so easily and quickly be taken away.

As dated as it is (1935), its themes will be quite familiar to Americans today. It starts with the highly contested election of an oafish yet strangely charismatic president, who talks like a \\"reformer\\" but is really in the pocket of big business, who claims to be a home-spun \\"humanist,\\" while appealing to religious extremists, and who speaks of \\"liberating\\" women and minorities, as he gradually strips them of all their rights. One character, when describing him, says, \\"I can't tell if he's a crook or a religious fanatic.\\"After he becomes elected, he puts the media - at that time, radio and newspapers - under the supervision of the military and slowly begins buying up or closing down media outlets. William Randolph Hearst, the Rupert Murdoch of his times, directs his newspapers to heap unqualified praise upon the president and his policies, and gradually comes to develop a special relationship with the government. The president, taking advantage of an economic crisis, strong-arms Congress into signing blank checks over to the military and passing stringent and possibly unconstitutional laws, e.g. punishing universities when they don't permit military recruiting or are not vociferous enough in their approval of his policies. Eventually, he takes advantage of the crisis to convene military tribunals for civilians, and denounce all of his detractors as unpatriotic and possibly treasonous.I'll stop here, as I don't want to ruin the story -- I can imagine that you can see where all this is going."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Sinclair Lewis' greatest achievement with &quot;It Can't Happen Here&quot; is his ability to reflect the subtle holds that Fascism can take in an otherwise rational and democratic country. Each step of the plot, no matter how seemingly insignificant or unrelated, contributes to the inevitable political conclusion. As the story progresses, it gradually becomes clearer to the reader how our individual prejudices and selfish desires can collectively turn us against the very freedom America prides itself upon.Fascism is here viewed as an implosion of American culture: the weight of mass media, of the desire for security and comfort, and of endemic nationalism caves in at the touch of a charismatic politician. Lewis exposes the weaknesses in our country's foundations; he shows a careful yet precarious balance of society and politics where we otherwise think we are solid. As others have noted, this book preceded the rise of Nazism in Europe. It is a testament to Lewis' grasp of fascism that much of his novel was mirrored in the chaotic climate of 1930's Germany and Italy.Where the book falters, however, is in some of its more outlandish caricatures of the villains, including orgies, bed-time assassins, and overwrought speeches. Despite the power of these metaphors, they weaken the plausibility of &quot;it can happen here.&quot; Nonetheless, this novel serves as an excellent warning against the dangers of cults of personality and of mob mentality. I strongly recommend &quot;It Can't Happen Here&quot; to remind anyone that the freedom of thought should not be taken for granted."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"....it can happen here. Anyone who is aware of current news and political issues and history, will find this book, written in the 1930's, to be astonishing. I read this in high school, and remembered it years later when I was putting books on my web page. Why did I remember it? Sinclair Lewis wrote this long before the world became aware of what was going on in Nazi Germany. This illustrates the often ignored fact that we can tell what is going on around us, if only we listen to the signs and signals, and stop burying our heads in..oh, well, in books and the internet and TV shows. He takes the story to America, where people's response to what's going on in the world is &quot;It Can't Happen Here&quot; (not that any of us would say that these days...). Anything that Can't Happen Here, then, isn't our problem. Until, of course, it happens here...This is a good book to read if you like messages in your fiction - (did you enjoy reading &quot;The Lottery?&quot;)"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"To quote one of the characters early on: \\"Like h*ll it can't.\\"Windrip is the charismatic politician: a great showman, but not comfortable when people use big words. He's swept into office on a tide of revival tent enthusiasm and anti-intellectual popularism. He promises a pot of money for everyone, and (this is the 1930s, remember) promises to put in their place all the right minorities with the strong arm of his loyal followers. Of course people vote for riches for everyone - or at least, everyone who matters.Then he's in. The loyal followers become a private army, answerable to no one. The nation is redrawn into a network of concentration camps, prisons, labor camps, and terrified citizenry. The bulk of the book documents the incredibly rapid decline into barbarity. Despite the crushing tyrrany, a resistance emerge, and among people who might not have looked very brave. Without giving any spoilers, the end is ambiguous but optimistic.The first half of the book is pretty much guaranteed to give you that sinking feeling if you've read the news in (or about) the America of Pres. Bush II. The rise of fundamentalist Christians as a political force has a familiar sound to it. So does the the discussion of \\"... when the hick legislators in certain states ... set up shop as scientific experts and made the whole world laugh itself sick by forbidding the teaching of evolution.\\"I want this book to be irrelevant. I want people to look at it and ask \\"what is he talking about? who could believe even the first word of it?\\" I want its warning to be forgotten by people who no longer need to be warned. The fact is that this 70 year old book still as relevant, familiar, and as urgent as ever. This book still matters - or should.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Given that Sinclair Lewis published this book in 1935, it is difficult to imagine that he wasn't influenced by the little known, aborted attempt by some of America's leading industrialists to promote a military coup in 1934, an attempt to oust control of the U.S. Government from FDR that may only have been prevented by the democratic integrity of General Smedley Butler. Regardless, Lewis penned his own version of a corporate/Fascist takeover that begins with demagogic populism and ends with armed militia, State control of the media, racism, and eventually, concentration camps and executions.IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE is an extraordinary book, but not for its literary merit. On that score, the book is provincial and horribly dated. Lewis's writing style features convoluted run-ons and his dialog is often laughable. The book's plot grows increasingly over-the-top as the story progresses (including two assassinations in the White House, no less), the characters are absurdly stereotyped, personal relationships are superficial at best, and the characters' names (Macgoblin, Itchitt, Cowlick, Coon, Reek, Skittle, Reverend Paul Peter Prang, Perley Beecroft, Senator Porkwood, and an avid pro-Communist with the inevitable first name, Karl) hearken back to the days of Nathaniel Hawthorne, medieval morality plays, and THE CANTERBURY TALES. For reasons I couldn't fathom, Lewis also seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with Upton Sinclair.So why read IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE? Divide the book into two elements, the setup and the resolution. The resolution is heavy-handed, more a prediction of Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia than any likely events in the United States. By contrast, the setup is brilliant, and remarkably prescient of today's political environment. Consider just a few aspects of the novel:-- A President lacking in intellectual capacity but blessed with a Zelig-like ability to appear as a regular guy and everyone's drinking buddy, \\"...almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his \`ideas' almost idiotic...his celebrated humor the sly cynicism of a country store...[who would] jab his crowds with facts and figures - figures and facts that were inescapable even when, as often happened, they were entirely incorrect.\\"-- A mysterious Presidential advisor cum puppet master, a wizard at politics and P.R. who \\"scientifically\\" builds up his candidate over seven years and then engineers the President's populist campaign, one that includes \\"tax reform\\" through the promise of painless, debt free grants of $5,000 to every American family.-- A holier-than-thou Presidential advisor who engages in homosexual orgies.-- A blatantly pro-Christian and anti-feminist Administration that opposes the teaching of evolution.-- A Presidential Administration dominated by Big Business and run in the name of, and for the benefit of, Big Business.-- An evangelical Christian radio minister who commands a virtual army of followers called the League of Forgotten Men.-- An administration whose first objective is to elevate the power of the Executive by simultaneously weakening the role of Congress and all but dismissing the Supreme Court.-- An administration that maintains complete control over information flow, asserts editorial control over the mass media, issues false and misleading pronouncements, suppresses independent reporting, and doctors its own statistics.-- A mass exodus of Americans to Canada, evolving eventually into a white Underground Railroad when America's borders are sealed.-- A President surrounded by like-minded yes men, isolated by his staff from the truth, and increasingly removed from contact with ordinary citizens.-- A Presidential Administration that concocts a phony war with Mexico to create an external bogeyman and distract the citizenry from the country's true problems.IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE is indeed happening here, at least in part. This book paints a deeply troubling scenario that makes it well worth reading despite its literary shortcomings. Sinclair Lewis was on the right track, just seventy years ahead of his time. Read it, and pray that the more outlandish parts of this story don't come true as well."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Sinclair Lewis is a genius in understanding the American public and the American mind. Yes, he is cynical and somewhat over the top, yet his poignant view about how politicians can manipulate non-thinking people and make them believe that they are part of the \\"club\\" (i.e. the ones in power are your intimate friends)and vote for them, even if it is against their daily life interests, still holds true today. One only needs to look at the last elections, where the same manipulations happened as Lewis described in his book in the 1930's. Even if the outcome this time around might be less drastic than those described in the novel, the parallels are amazing. One could read the book and think it was written a few months ago. Astonishing! The language is also delicious, like slow melting chocolate, to relish."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"This novel seems better plotted than other Lewis books, including Main Street, Babbitt, Elmer Gantry, and Arrowsmith. Also, in comparison to these other novels, Lewis spends more time developing characters other than the protagonist (in this novel the protagonist being Doremus Jessup, a newpaper editor). Buzz Windrip, the fascist Senator who wins the 1936 presidential election; Windrip's Secretary of State Lee Sarason; and Shad Ledue, Doremus Jessup's handyman, all seem more fully fleshed out than characters of similar status in Lewis's earlier novels.Readers interested in twentieth-century American politics will find this novel very entertaining. Buzz Windrip's political platform, which promises to establish limits on personal wealth (particularly that of African-Americans), to enact governmental control of &quot;big money,&quot; and to limit the power of labor unions, appeals to the public in the same contradictory way as Bill Clinton's 1992 platform, which called for both tax cuts and increased government spending. (And in the same fashion as a conservative Republican platform that calls for less government influence over private lives but, at the same time, more laws to protect and uphold &quot;middle-class family values.&quot;)As a fan of Lewis's more light-hearted satire, as seen in Babbitt, I found the darkness of this novel difficult to take. The only parts that made me smile were the quotations from Buzz Windrip's campaign autobiography, Zero Hour, that appeared at the beginning of several chapters. But how can you make funny the takeover of America by humorless, bloodthirsty fascists, who hope to annihilate all opposition to Buzz Windrip and his plans to control every cent that is spent, every idea that is thought, and every word that is spoken?On the whole, this novel isn't Lewis at his best. However, it isn't a disappointing novel, and anyone who likes to watch political talk shows or read about politics and politicians should find it worth their time."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"This is a book of 'a 'Liberal', scorned by all the nosiest prophets for refusing to be a willing cat for the busy monkeys ... at worst, the Liberals, the Tolerant, might in the long term preserve some of the arts of civilisation.'Why is he a liberal? Because 'everything in the world has been accomplished by the free, inquiring, critical spirit', and 'the preservation of this spirit is more important than any social system whatsoever.'But this formidable book contains also a clear warning: 'the men of ritual and the men of barbarism are capable of shutting up the men of science and of silencing them forever.' 'We can go back to the Dark Ages! The crust of learning and tolerance is so thin.'This book is the story of a democratically elected US dictator: a demagogue with a racist and antifeminist agenda, who turns the US into a fascist State: 'He treated the entire nation like a well-run plantation on which the slaves were better fed than formerly, less often cheated by their overseers, and kept so busy that they had time only for work and for sleep.'This book is the work of a visionary (Mao's China, Franco's Spain, Stalin's USSR, Pinochet's Chili, Pol Pot's Cambodia, Suharto's Indonesia, Hitler's Germany, Castro's Cuba...): 'People were afraid to say whatever came to their tongues ... men looked about to see who might be listening before they dared so much as say there was a drought ... for someone might suppose they were blaming the drought on the Chief.'Opponents were incarcerated, shot or put in work-camps. Books were gleefully burned and the media turned into mere propaganda.The fascist State here, however, is torn asunder from within (personal infighting, power cliques, brutal murders) and from without (those people who without fear of their lives continued to fight for freedom, democracy and tolerance).The main character in this book, a courageous editor of a newspaper, should be an example for today's newsmen, who are completely gagged by the powerful and paralyzed by autocensure.Sinclair Lewis is also not blind for general human weaknesses: permanent insatisfaction, envy, following of prophets 'who had felt called upon to stir up the masses to save the world and save it in the prophet's own way', or falling for 'men of superior cunning, of slyer foxiness than slower-witted men, however worthy.'This book is a tremendous achievement and still very actual.A must read."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"As a novel, especially on with Lewis's talents, it falls short of being great. But since it was intended as a piece of biting satire, it doesn't have to be great.I decided to read it because of the present administration. I've known for years the topic of the book but just didn't make room for it in my reading schedule. It is haunting, but not so much for the current administration.It is still possible for parts of the events of the novel to happen in this country. In a republic such as ours, we get the government that the most afraid deserve. If enough people get afraid enough, we could have a form of dictatorial leadership sprout here.Still, what I found most eerie was his description of the oppression and how the oppression was turned into a machine. This book was published in 1935, so it was written during the time that Hitler was making his initial changes to Germany. What Lewis wrote was amazingly close to what happened there. This means that Lewis had a preternatural grasp of the human mob mentality and that he could apply it to Germany with the scant material available at the time. In that respect, the novel often made me nauseous.The novel is funny, wry, frightening, and more human than I expected. I also find it very important that the novel ends in the way it does--for those who would rather not know in advance, I will refrain from saying how. I would recommend it to just about anyone."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"\\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is Sinclair Lewis' precient tale of an oafish, charismatic leader taking over the United States and instituting a facist mode of government. Grim as the subject of this book may be, you can rest assured that democracy in this counrty is not being replaced by a religeo-facist mode of government. You can rest assured that we have fair elections in which the governors of Florida and New Mexico do not illegally disenfranchise Black and Hispanic voters. You can rest assured that the owner of a voting machine company in Ohio does not contribute money to the ruling party and vow to deliver his state's electoral votes to the ruling party's candidate. And you can rest assured that his company's voting machines are not closed systems with no method of verification.You can rest assured that the ruling party does not send paid operatives into a contested state during an election to intimidate vote counters. You can rest assured that a terrorist mastermind whose family has decades of business relationships with the ruling party leader's family will not somehow find a way to lead a cataclysmic attack on New York and you can definitely rest assured that the ruling party won't succeed in lying and covering up their own failure and complicity in this event.You can rest assured that the ruling party won't use terrorism as a pretext to erode our civil liberties and give itself absolute power. You can rest assured that the ruling party will not officially sanction torture in places like Guantanamo, Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan, Iraq, and in the numerous countries to which it sends its political prisoners for interrogation.Most importantly you can rest assured that the ruling party is sane and objective. You can rest assured that it listens to the world's scientists who overwhelmingly agree that we are on the brink of an irreversible environmental cataclysm. You can rest assured that it listens to its generals when they state that more troops are required to successfully govern an occupied country. You can rest assured that they listen to their economists and security experts when they request urgent attention to an issue of grave importance even if it does not conform to the ruling party's ideology.You can rest assured that we are not living in a nation where the President's top political adviser would expose a patriotic member of the intelligence community to get revenge against her husband, and we do not live in a country where this person would get away with such a crime through continuous lies and obfuscations.We do not live in a nation where the unelected, illegally installed fascist regime would destroy the middle class, and wage war on the poor in order to further bloat the already porcine class of billionaires with yet more tax cuts. We do not live in a religious theocracy in which the highest courts are run by fundamentalists who want to interpret every law according to their personal faith. And we do not live in a nation in which the mass media and government are owned by corporations that bombard us with lies and brainwashing on a minute-by-minute basis.So when you read \\"It Can't Happen Here\\", remember that this is just a fictional \\"what if\\" book written in the thirties and is in no way suggestive of our present reality."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Sinclair Lewis is a great author, whose more celebrated novels (Elmer Gantry, Main Street, Arrowsmith, Babbit) all portray middle-American life in the early 20th Century (the good and bad). Lewis is unafraid to satirize and lampoon the most disgraceful features of our culture.\\"It Can't Happen Here\\" was written after his career had peaked and is not quite of the standard of the above works. Lewis was very concerned about the rise of fascism in the 1930's and the indifferent (or even sympathetic) reactions many Americans had to it. His point was that totalitarianism could happen here, particuarly in such a mood of indifference and denial.The book is a fascinating portrayal of the ascension of Senator Buzz Windrip, who upsets FDR for the Presidency in 1936, on a 15 point, fascisitic platform (state control of all banks, huge buildup of the military, persecution of Jews and unbelievers, subjection of blacks, etc.). Within six months, Windrip manages to abolish state governments, consolidate all universities, mussle the press (including the books main character, Doremus Jessup), etc. Riots and revolts break out, but they're repeatedly crushed by Windrip's private army, the Minute Men.In time, Windrip sets up concentration camps for all dissenters, while likewise employing a successful state propaganda organ to convince the world that life in America is much better. But a massive resistence movement develops, joining socialists, liberals, even mainstream conservatives (it's lead by Windrip's Republican opponent in the '36 election), and staged from Canada.The book centers around the life of Doremus Jessup, small-town Vermont newspaperman, and his family, in their active resistence to the \\"Corpo\\" regime. Though his life is destroyed by the end, Jessup continues to work for the revolutionary movememnt (which succeeds in invading much of the midwest afterwhich Windrip is overthrown in a coup by his cheif aide).The book is a fun read, and evokes much sympathy for the Jessups and their co-conspiriters. At the same time, it lacks the careful realism of Lewis' other works. The time-span is less than three years, which is fairly implausible. Lewis fails to address the fact that the U.S. (like Great Britain and Canada) is fundamentally different in background than Germany, Italy or Russia. America's strong democratic tradition and passion for individual liberty would make establishing and maintaining a successful dictatorship would be very difficult here (though perhaps not impossible, particularly in the depths of the Depression). Certainly, it'd take more than a few years and would involve much more bloodshed than depicted in this book.However, Lewis' book is quite thought-provoking. One of the byproducts of our successful democracy is that Americans often take their most basic rights (such as free speech and association) for granted. This book forces one to reflect on how lucky we are to live where we do and when we do, and always be vigilant in defense of our rights. In this era, with Bush and Ashcroft trying to curtail some of those rights in the name of \\"homeland security\\", such reflection is needed.I reccomend \\"It Can't Happen Here\\", but not to those unfamiliar with Sinclair Lewis. Read at least one of his better works (listed above) first."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE was published in 1935, during the Great Depression, when totalitarianism was rampant in Germany, Italy and Russia. At the same time, homelessness, labor unrest, and demagoguery were spreading across much of America.Many thoughtful citizens worried then about tyranny coming to America, though they differed on whether it would come from the right or the left. Today, the book's powerful title remains a household word, even as the book's plot and characters have seemed more and more outdated.But if the story is so out of date, why is the book back in print and enjoying a new readership during both Republican and Democratic administrations?I think it's because Americans understand instinctively that tyranny can happen anywhere. Concentration camps and labor camps were not invented by the Germans or the Russians. Today many Americans sense that great economic, political and social change is coming and they are looking for ways to visualize what dangers might lie ahead.IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE remains a powerful dramatization of tyranny at the human level. Its heroes and the villains are timeless, and its relentless progress toward societal collapse resembles what we've seen time after time under despotic rule. The book still offers a useful look at how our lives might change if American democracy were replaced by American tyranny.The story begins with lighthearted humor and caricature, as if not taking itself too seriously. Then the nastiness starts and the humor turns dark. By the end, it's clear that tyranny happened precisely because so many people assumed that it couldn't.I suggest you give it a try and see what an American tyranny might look like. Just to make sure you can see it coming."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Somehow, in 1935, Sinclair Lewis could see what was going to happen in the United States in the years 2008-2016. I can't believe that this book is not getting more attention and acclaim in the &#34;not so mainstream&#34; media. It is so good, and so accurate. Everyone in this country should read this book."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Sinclair Lewis wrote It Can't Happen Here in 1935 to warn Americans about fascism. Many Americans had similar feelings to the Fort Beulah friends of Doremus Jessup: fascism could not happen here. There are enough similarities between Buzz Windrip, the American fascist elected president in the novel, and the Louisiana senator Huey P. Long, for people to wonder if Sinclair Lewis was referring to the Kingfish.In reality, Lewis was more concerned about someone like Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler than Huey Long. He believed that an American fascist would appear as a defender of liberty and freedom, cloaked in nationalism. Adolf Hitler took control of Germany through free elections, and gradually reduced dissent through his secret police under the cloak of socialism. He played on the public's fear of communists by first eliminating them. Gradually, he expanded his definition of a threat until nearly everyone came under suspicion, including socialists.The novel begins with many references to obscure figures of the 1930s. Much like readers of today know of the Octomom, the audience of the Depression knew of the Dionne quintuplets. The reference was not obscure when Lewis wrote the novel, but it is today. Fifty years from now, people will remember Nadya Suleman as well as today's readers know the Dionnes. A reader will probably be able to enjoy the novel without understanding some of these references, but - if you are like me - you'll want to know them. The Wikipedia on the internet proved to be an invaluable resource for such a task.Governor Eugene Tallmadge of Georgia declared martial law during a textile strike. Cotton Tom Heflin was a white supremacist senator from Alabama. Floyd Olson was elected Governor of Minnesota on a populist-labor stance. When Lewis wrote this novel, Olson was considered a presidential candidate. Olin Johnston was another governor with a populist bent; he was from South Carolina. Norman Thomas ran as a socialist, for president, every four years. Today, there is a school in Murray Hill, a neighborhood of Manhattan, named after Norman Thomas.Wilbur Voliva was the head of the Zion Community who espoused the flat earth theory. During his tenure, a strict code of morality was imposed in the town of Zion on all persons who set foot inside city limits. It was unlawful for women to wear short dresses, high heels, bathing suits or lipstick. Ham, bacon, oysters, liquor and tobacco were banned, as were drugstores, medical buildings, movie theaters, and globes. A ten o'clock curfew was rigidly enforced. Whistling on Sunday was also prohibited. These laws were enforced by Voliva's police force, called the Praetorian Guard, whose helmets carried the word 'patience' and whose sleeves bore images of doves. Policemen wore Bibles and clubs on their belts. The Praetorian Guard was a perfect image for Sinclair Lewis in writing this novel.Dr. Francis Townsend was an original proponent of an old-age pension system upon which the Social Security system is based. Milo Reno was the leader of the Farmer's Holiday Movement in Iowa during the Depression. Frustrated with the lack of help for struggling farmers, Reno proposed that they Buy Nothing - Sell Nothing. People have to eat, and Reno felt that the farmers had the upper hand in such a struggle because they had the food needed by people to eat. Violence by radical members of the Farmer's Holiday Association discredited the organization and led to its demise.Tom Mooney was one of the most celebrated prisoners of the times. He was convicted of the Preparedness Day bombing in San Francisco in 1916, and remained in jail for 22 years, until he was freed when the evidence was too overwhelming that he was not involved in that particular plot. In a way, the Marty Tankleff case is a more recent example of an innocent man who was wrongly imprisoned. One difference is that the Tankleff case only had vague political overtones. The arresting officer still insists that he arrested the right man for the death of Tankleff's parents, even though DNA evidence is contrary.Bernar McFadden was a physical fitness guru. McFadden had an idea that fasting was actually beneficial for the long term health of people. Actually, his idea is not too corny. It may be better to go without processed foods that are high in trans fat, saturated fat, and sugars, but the body ultimately needs nutrition.The funniest reference was a turn-of-the-century cartoon figure, Caspar Milquetoast. He was the man who spoke softly and got hit with a big stick, in the words of his humorous creator. By the 1950s, the term Milquetoast was used synonymously with a timid character. I believe I first encountered the word reading a novel of E.L. Doctorow. It is in the dictionary, but people do not use the term in everyday conversation today.The term \\"grass widow\\" is not used today. A few years ago, I encountered the term watching a silent movie, shown at the Brooklyn Public Library. After the movie, I asked a few other people if they knew what the term meant. Although none of us knew, Mr. Webster could translate. People now use the term 'separated' instead of calling someone a grass widow or grass widower. You'll also find the term grass widow used in this novel by Lewis.With so many names and terms mentioned in the novel that are no longer used, it is odd that few other reviewers consider this novel a cultural artifact. I will say here that I do look for some historical significance in most of the novels that I read.Although Lewis stated that his novels do not celebrate the wholesomeness of American life, this particular novel is more downbeat than his novels of the 1920s. \`It Can't Happen Here' was too depressing for this particular reader. America became a police state, taken over by the Minute Men, who were modeled on the private police of Adolf Hitler in Germany, and possibly, by the private police of Voliva. There were even theme songs similar to the Horst Wessel Lied that was popular in Nazi Germany. One hundred Congressmen were jailed, habeas corpus was suspended, and justice was meted through military tribunals. Some can argue that these actions have occurred in America during the Civil War, just after the Civil War, and during the Iraq War of the George W. Bush administration - but they have never occurred to the degree that events occurred in this novel. In that respect, the scenario of Sinclair Lewis was not realistic.There are reasons why this novel can intrigue many readers. It does reflect a realistic concern of the 1930s, perhaps not in America, but certainly in Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Sinclair Lewis is a fine storyteller, although one could opine that he was not at the top of his game when the story was written. It is hard for any author to match the game that Lewis brought to his novels of the 1920s. Lewis also discussed the threat of fascism before it became an international concern. The story was entertaining, and the reader could always hold out hope that the New Underground could overthrow the fascist regime installed by the elected president Buzz Windrip. The Lanny Budd series of Upton Sinclair was a better depiction of the horrors of international fascism.Sinclair Lewis wrote this novel years before Lanny Budd, and well before others in America noticed the danger of dictators in Italy and Germany. \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" was a well-deserved best seller for Lewis, but today, other novels with the same theme have surpassed it."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"It Can't Happen Here, Sinclair LewisThis 1935 novel begins in a small town in Vermont which has the differences of classes and people to represent the United States in a nutshell. There is talk by some to prepare for the next war by military training in college. From that, Sinclair Lewis builds a fantasy 1936 election between two fictional candidates: Walt Trowbridge and Berzelius Windrup. \\"Buzz\\" Windrip is a chameleon of a politician who easily adjusts to any audience. [Was he modeled after Huey Long?] But a lot of the references mean little to those born after 1965. Buzz's campaign speech is a clever parody of real politicians: he wanted high wages and low prices, etc. Chapter 8 has the \\"Fifteen Points of Victory\\", which may be as satirical today. The fifteenth point creates an Imperial President. [How close are we to that today?] The oratorical skills of Windrip suggest another Wilson, or maybe a Hitler (Chapter 9). Many of the details are now obscure (Chapter 11). Chapter 13 gives the author's opinion of the many reformers who sought a better world. Chapter 17 explains how this Corporate State was organized, and how it controlled and exploited most of the workers, who were now in \\"labor camps\\" (company towns?). The resulting inflation allowed Big Business to pay off old debts cheaply, and doubled their wealth (Germany in the 1920s?). Promises made to the people are deferred, then forgotten. A physician who protests the arrest of Doremus Jessup is summarily shot, and his property confiscated; his wife and child left homeless.The story continues with Doremus Jessup seeking to oppose the rule of Windrip. He starts to print pamphlets (Chapter 26). A modern state, by controlling the press, various associations, and the armed forces, can dominate the population better that in medieval days. The mismanagement by the Corpos is measured by the increasing poverty of the people (Chapter 29). Finally, the Minnie Men come and take Jessup away (Chapter 30). Jessup is beaten, then given a virtual life sentence. \\"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\\" said Newton. Effingham Swan discovers this in Chapter 33.As happens with other criminal gangs, personal conflicts lead to changes. \\"Buzz\\" Windrip is deposed by Lee Sarason. Next month Lee Sarason was shot by Secretary of War Haik, who became the new Chief. Haik becomes a Puritan Emperor after purging the administration (Chapter 35). Changes at the camps gave Jessup a chance to escape (Chapter 36), and then cross the border to freedom in Canada. There was a story about Mexican bandits invading a Texas tow - when everyone was away! This meant war. But an unanticipated rebellion occurred against the Corpo regime, and split the country. Jessup will be sent back as a secret agent (?) to organize resistance. In the last page Jessup is awakened so he can flee a Corpo posse, and continue the struggle for freedom. Like other dramas, the question of success is left unanswered. This is worth reading, even if as out-of-date as \\"Looking Backwards, 2000-1887\\" or \\"The Iron Heel\\". They give different views of a possible future. Perhaps the first novel on this subject was \\"Caesar's Column\\" by Ignatius Donnelly.This story was inspired by a true event, the attempt to stage a coup d' etat during Franklin Roosevelt's first term. The plotter picked a charismatic but patriotic Marine General who denounced the plotters. This was Lewis' last book."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I recommend this deft audiobook rendering by Christopher Hurt of Sinclair Lewis' last true success, \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" (1935) and that prediction of an alternate history. It's strange as it happens almost as it's published, more or less. A 1936 FDR's re-election gets shunted aside for a corn-pone fascist recalling that played by Andy Griffith years later in the film \\"A Face in the Crowd.\\" Berzilius \\"Buzz\\" Windrip takes over as president, with a clever calculation of xenophobic rhetoric and progressive bluster that appears buffoonish, until he solidifies power with the 50 million during the Depression desperate enough for \\"hope and change\\"--out of a nimble combination of populism, prejudice, and pandering, Windrip, a homegrown dictator with a down-home twang and an aw-shucks demeanor, matches the might of the Hitlers and the Mussolinis, in Lewis' dire (melo?-)drama.Playing this a year after the Occupy movement started and while the Tea Party tries to balance power-sharing with compromise, it's intriguing to hear of the \\"League of Forgotten Men\\" under Peter Paul Prang, Methodist bishop, early on attempting to align anti-corporate cant with pro-nativist slant. It reminds me of how a campaign, if it somehow managed to connect the anti-banker with the pro-populist attitudes, might work itself out in today's America, after what we don't call another Great Depression, but dare to label only a Recession. Communists rally and socialists bicker, but the left cannot block the desperate \\"League\\" and their combined alliance with Buzz's right-wing minions. Lewis, from the depths of distress in the 1930s, took a bold move in making his story conform so closely to possibilities extrapolated from real-life scenarios and threats of unrest around him.Sure, as with any Lewis (see my Aug, 2012 review of the Library of America edition of \\"Main Street\\" with \\"Babbitt\\"), the abundant preaching, soap-box sermonizing, satirical foils, and the cynical cant can get heavy-handed as our doughty foil Doremus (these names!) Jessup goes to battle on behalf of the editorializing (today he'd be blogging and tweeting), earnest, well-intended but understandably reluctant liberal ethos. However, as Buzz rapidly consolidates control with his uniformed Minutemen, what had been a tottering capitalist system and a parliamentary democracy quickly learn that citizens better call him \\"The Chief.\\" Or else.Philip Roth's \\"The Plot Against America\\" (see my review) trod similar terrain recently, and that book shared with this one some plot leaps and expository compression. Parts do go on a while, and Lewis can get carried away with his invective and his intricacy of how Buzz's New Order establishes itself. However, seeing this spanned the then-near future of 1936-39, it's amazing how the gulags, concentration camps, and tyranny were anticipated. Also, as the long-winded if appealingly recognizable protagonist calls himself a \\"small-town bourgeois intellectual,\\" this doughty. sixty-year-old, \\"well-meaning, cloistered\\" journalist his wife calls \\"Dormouse\\" deflects criticism before we can do so, or his neighbors and then his foes--foreshadowed by Shad Ladue.I admit a soft spot for sociological literature of this era--I like John Dos Passos' \\"Manhattan Transfer\\" and \\"USA\\" trilogy, tellingly; this earnest, hectoring, self-consciously inflated, detailed style has fallen long out of fashion from the bestseller list. Similarly, Lewis likes to hear himself talk on the page through protagonists like himself. It's can be awkward now and then but, as with Doremus, it becomes endearing, for the teller (at least sometimes) realizes he carries on.As eighty-plus others beat me to this book, my comments cheer on the audiobook. Christopher Hurt (for Blackstone Audio) captures the no-nonsense dialogues of Vermonters, the faux-hick accents of skilled operatives in the Beltway and beyond, and the gentler tones of those fearing the dictatorship's tyranny. I urge you to hear this novel, as reading it may tempt you to skim over a lot of the wry, poignant, or impassioned prose that Lewis ladles on: \\"ape with a manicure,\\" \\"a human blackboard, \\"certificates of pedagogy,\\" come to mind out of many well-crafted phrases with a pictorial or punchy effect. Hurt navigates his way through the somewhat-dated contexts skillfully, and highlights the humanity beneath the bluster.A discovery at the end of 12 hours of this audiobook: Hurt leaves out the last few sentences, on the final page of the Michael Mayer-introduced reprint. He stops at the bottom of the penultimate page, and for me, that improves the conclusion!I kept nearby that reprint in tandem, to check phrases, look up allusions, and ponder monologues and dialogue. The best parts ironically were the chapter colophons from Buzz's (or that wonderfully oily Lee Sarason) \\"Zero Hour.\\" They smack of many a ghostwritten political screed or supposed autobiography rushed out a year or season prior to an election run!"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Shipping was fast and the book was as advertised.

It doesn't matter that the characters are cardboard cutouts and the events described happen simply because, to Lewis and his admirers, fascism develops the same way everywhere: Demagogues come to power, round up liberals and communists, suspend free speech and the rule of law, then invade Mexico. That's the just way fascism works, no need to analyze it.In a story remarkably lacking in dramatic tension, Doremus Jessup, a liberal small town news editor and a man who always makes a point of eating Chinese food when in the big city, endures much humiliation and physical abuse from his social inferiors, particularly from his hired man, Shad Ledue. In the end, he escapes his tormentors and finds refuge in-- where else?--Canada.Strident liberals like Sean Penn might praise this message, but the book has little entertainment value and is remembered now only for the title and as the source of the bumper sticker aphorism, \\"When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.\\" Actually, this last line is not in the book and may not have even been uttered by Lewis."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"where is my original review? where can I find the e-mail address to write to you about it without having to fill out another review?I know the address will come up once I submit this.Thank you!"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"...

Don't give him too much credit though. He seems to have directly based all of his ideas for the takeover of America on the subversion of the Weimar Republic. The book as literature is okay, but it is NOT Shakespeare. I would still highly recommend reading this, if for no other reason, for the sake of having said you read it.The reviewers who drew a parallel to Modern America clearly never read any material about facism. There are many books that detail the horrors of a totalitarian regime. I would recommend reading \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" and \\"The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956\\" both by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Another good bet would be \\"The Joke\\" by Milan Kundera."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"The first reviewer, Charles Haberl, does an excellent job describing the content of this insightful book and rightly draws the similarities to our own times.I only wish to add a few points:First of all, Sinclair Lewis drew his inspiration for writing this book from his wife, Dorothy Thompson. Dorothy was a journalist born in New York and was listed along with Eleanor Roosevelt as one of the two most influential women in America by \\"Time\\" magazine in 1939. Dorothy was outspoken against the Hitler regime and became the first American journalist to be expelled from Nazi Germany, and folks, this was in 1934! Hitler hadn't even shown his hand yet! AND, interestingly enough, an astute Dorothy Thompson wrote an article after WWII \\"cautioning American Jews about Zionism as it would lead to dual loyalty\\". Today, we see this dual loyalty in the Neo-cons who have sold their American soul to their militant worshipping satan...The title of the book, \\"It Can't Happen Here\\", about \\"it happening here\\" is an obvious political knock on those who actually think this can't happen in the USA. Under Dorothy Thomnpson's influence, Sinclair Lewis was shown how fragile democracy is and how easity it can be subverted as detailed in Charles Haberl's review above. This book is also mentioned in the book,Dictators, Democracy, and American Public Culture: Envisioning the Totalitarian Enemy, 1920s-1950sas being part of the culture in the American dictatorship milieu (see my reveiew of that relevant work).The other thing I found very interesting about \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is the mention by Sinclair Lewis of \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\". Perhaps this is the pamphlet that served as Lewis's blueprint for the tactics used by his dictatorship regime.And finally, I'd like to point out one final, but most pertinent contemporary parallel of Lewis's dictatorship: \\"...in a couple of years now, ON THE GROUND OF PROTECTING US, the Buzz Windrip dictatorship will be regimenting everything, from where we may pray to what detective stories we may read\\".Why is it that so few people can see through this TERROR, TERROR, TERROR, mantra of our current administration?"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"While the time isn't clear -- I'd guess shortly after WWII -- it is mandatory reading for anyone who worries about the loss of individual liberties in the US, as well as movement to a \\"security state\\", written long before current concerns."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"The book is what I expected, did have a minor problem that it has several discs that are in the set will not play in my car, which is where I listen to audio books.

When Fascism comes to America it will appear wrapped in the flag and carrying a bible. Look familiar?"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"\\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is an interesting yet totally overcooked fable about America in the 1930s when it gets overtaken by an ultra nationalistic dictator. Clearly Sinclair Lewis was making a statement about the times, and no doubt he was chastized for being so brazen and, perhaps, seemingly \\"un-American\\". So he deserves kudos for bravery. Unfortunately much of the book is unreadable, being nothing more than hysterical rants.However one cannot help but wonder whether such anarchy come to America? Of course the answer is 'yes'. So on that note the book should be read. Or better still, I hope someone updates it, smoothes it out, and makes a film adaptation.Bottom line: an important socio-political statement of 1930s America which is still valid in the 21st century. Too bad it's not well-written."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I was drawn to this book by a quote from it I had read: \\"When fascism comes to America, it will be draped in the flag and carrying a bible.\\" Strong and provocative stuff, no? I wondered why I had never encountered this book before, and why it is not better known. It turns out there is a good reason, and that is because the book is virtually unreadable--apart from that one quotation, apparently.Lewis's premise is that fascism could establish itself in America with relative ease if the country is sufficiently worried about some threat--in this case, the great depression. The book's ironic title comes up in slightly varied forms in several early conversations. The clear implication is that it certainly could happen here, \\"it\\" being the consolidation of power in the hands of a demagogue who offers relief and protection to a frightened nation.But the path Lewis takes in making this important point is exasperating beyond words. We first must get to know a small-town newspaper editor and his whole tedious family, and attend cocktail parties and picnics with him, and learn that his hired man won't do as he's told around the garden, and on and on. It's as if you know a person has desperately important news that you want to hear, but you must first allow him to recount, in detail, how his business is doing, and what a splash his daughter made at her ballet recital. I gave up on the book after 60 pages or so.What decided me in the end was a growing conviction that Lewis himself didn't take his subject seriously. The novel's villainous demagogue is named Berzelius (Buzz) Windrip; he becomes President. His bible-thumping supporter is Paul Peter Prang, and the rational small-town journalist is Doremus Jessup--Doremouse to his wife.I submit that no one who intends to write a serious novel about his country's descent into fascism would choose such cartoonish names for any of his characters, let alone the main ones. Such flippancy causes readers to smile at things that should be frightening and disturbing. It also comforts them with the false assurance that any potential dictator would be immediately recognizable by his outlandish pronouncements or at least would be ridiculous in some way.It would have been more effective by far to give evil a bland, friendly face, as Orwell did in \\"1984,\\" and to give the villain a common, ordinary name such as might belong to the fellow across the street. A name like, oh, I don't know--you think one up."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I read this book in high school and again last week. And after reading it over Thanksgiving break, I became more thankful for our admittedly imperfect democracy.All too many people (including other reviewers of this book) describe any disturbing or annoying political developments as \\"fascism\\": liberals attacking the economic ineptitude and warmongering of the Bush Administration, conservatives attacking the \\"nanny state.\\"But Lewis shows that real fascism isn't democracy led by crazy idiots. Real fascism is dictatorship led by thugs.In Lewis's fascist state, government critics (or even people whose property the local politicos covet) are sent to concentration camps, where they are routinely killed and tortured. The borders are guarded so Americans cannot easily escape (though a few manage to do so anyhow). There is no opposition media, no chance to escape to Canada. By contrast, our America, despite wars and economic problems, is still more or less a free country. And as long as people can (erroneously) call their politicians fascists without being flogged with steel rods, it will continue to be one."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Excellent book. Very well written. I would recommenda must read for everyone."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"it's absolutely happening here. the gangmembers will probably be the evildoers' new police force"},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Sinclair Lewis had his time in the 1920s. He poked fun at the middle classes, and it was a success. Main Street, Babbitt, Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, Dodsworth were his bestsellers. He won the Pulitzer for fiction (and rejected it), he won the Nobel (and took it). And then the Great Depression came and annihilated his subject.He had to look for a new one, and found politics (which had not been entirely absent before either, but had always come along in a mocking tone). He changed his stance from satirical observer of the presence to satirical prophet of the possible future. The difference is marginal. He was still scornful about the world that he saw. The world was probably scornful about him --- apart from the fact that his prophecy of American fascism was a huge bestseller. So there was some gumption in the country, the Americans were not all proto-fascists or Bushists or Palinists... Sorry, I got carried away here.The nonsense spoken in the past by the good citizens was so much like what I read and see today, it is uncanny! I had thought the \`freedom fries' stupidity after the French \`desertion' from the Iraq \`coalition of the willing' was something new. I learned from Lewis (and maybe I had known it before, but had forgotten) that good American patriots turned sauerkraut into liberty cabbage during WW1.Listen to the general's speech at the Rotarian ladies' annual dinner in Vermont 1936! An outburst of epidemic patriotism, spiced up by the Daughters of the Revolution (do they still exist? I wouldn't be surprised at all. As Lewis wrote: for the first 50%, they glorified the Founding Fathers, thereafter they attacked everything that these men stood for), it sounds so like Rush How-low-can-you-get, it really is uncanny. Where did Lewis get this prophetic power?The story is set in Vermont in 1936 (published 35!), in a town of perhaps 10000 souls and 20000 bodies (and Lewis even questions whether that many bodies were inhabited by souls). We accompany 60 year old Doremus Jessep (\`Dormouse'), the town liberal, on his peregrinations through the world of awakening US fascism. He says early on that no country in the world can get more hysterical than the US.While much sounds familiar and similar to contemporary politics, the profile of the main negative hero, fascist politician and then President Windrip (nice name), is not what we would see today. Windrip wins with a populist campaign that combines high income taxation, higher salaries for everyone, and import barriers with anti-unionism, anti-redism, anti-feminism, anti-intellectualism, anti-semitism, anti-everything not Christian- ism, outright racism against the black population, aggressive expansion of militarism, suppression of free thought and speech and wild threats of war.Windrip's SA is called the MM, as in Minute Men, with white or khaki shirts. As one of them says so convincingly: Windrip puts an end to all this free speech and libel of American institutions.His election campaign includes openly an announcement that he will introduce an emergency law, which will sideline the Supreme Court and give absolute power to the President.True to fascist movements, the anti-big money rhetoric is nothing but a protection racket. The anti-Jewish attacks are blackmail for campaign support.Once the inauguration is over, all hell breaks loose...Emergency is declared, things then develop in the same way as in Germany: terror from above, rule of law is abandoned, concentration camps are started, opponents are murdered... (written in 1935, which was fairly early during the Nazi rule; Lewis had the benefit of insider information from his wife Dorothy Thompson, who was a journalist in Europe with access to German information. On daily life under a dictatorship read Brecht's Fear and Misery in the Third Reich. Lewis is not much different, except geographically.)And the mocking tone stops.Just to avoid misunderstandings: the man Windrip is nominated for the presidency by the Democratic Party, in 1936. The party refuses Roosevelt a second term. Roosevelt starts his own Jeffersonian Party but loses the election. The candidate of the Republican Party is the hero of the story: he loses, goes into exile and starts resistance from Canada. So no simple 2 party warfare here.My assessment of the novel: 5 + stars for political interest; not more than 3 + for artistic value. This was a quick shot and suffered from most weaknesses of Lewis's earlier novels. Total 5 minus."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Although this novel is known largely for its still-timely political and sociological insights, it has much more to recommend it - humor, suspense, violent adventure, and even some domestic drama with a couple of surprising twists.

It will seem ponderous in pace to more casual readers, with little besides political foreshadowing to hold interest. However, with the ascension of the villain around page 100 begins the \\"meat\\" of the work: quickly the narrative transforms into a visceral, terrifying experience. The reader's patience is rewarded with a story that engages you on an emotional level beyond most novels today.As far as dystopia-themed works go, this ranks number one on my list. The characters, environment, and interactions are believable. Man isn't utterly defeated and hope isn't totally extinguished, but the notions of \\"liberty\\" and \\"progress\\" have been taken down a few notches. In such a world, the characters do their best (or worst).If your attention holds beyond the introduction, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"I was a big fan of Elmer Gantry -- this book is pretty amazing as well -- His character development always leaves me in awe."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"This is one of the most unusual offerings from novelist Sinclair Lewis. Unlike many of his previous books, it was written in great haste and the subject matter is exclusively related to electoral politics. In some respects, the material is dated, unlike other totalitarian nightmare novels like \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World,\\" because it is set in a fixed place and time. The election in contest is that of 1936 and the question to be answered is whether or not voters weary of the Great Depression are prepared to sacrifice individual liberties and accept fascist dictatorial rule.Given the political climate in the contemporary USA, this warning from the past still seems relevant today. Too many people seem willing to follow the Pied Piper rather than asking questions and making difficult choices."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"The \\"IT\\" that can't happen here -- 'here' meaning in the USA -- is the rise of power of a brutal corporatist dictator, a demogogue who exploits the electoral process to establish a reign of unscrupulous corruption and repression. Written in 1935, during FDR's first term, Lewis's obvious 'models' are Benito, Adolf, and Josef, with Francisco waiting in the wings. Lewis was living in Europe most of the time during the 1930s and thus closer to the scene, but even so his depiction of the viciousness and bloodiness of the dictatorial regimes is astonishingly vivid, as if he could see into the darkest lagers and gulags of power-gone-insane merely by imagination. One has to wonder: if a dipsomaniac novelist from a hick town in Minnesota could envision the full horror of F*SC*SM before its crescendo, why was most of the world blind to it?That most people were blind to the possibility of an American counterpart to Adolf, that precisely because they assumed \\"it couldn't happen here\\", is the starting point for Lewis's fiction, in which IT does happen. What even Lewis couldn't foresee is how regularly IT could and would happen, even after the defeat of Adolf and Benito -- in China, Haiti, Chile, Argentina, Uganda, Iraq, and scores of smaller countries -- the rise of unbridled torturocracies. To quote Lewis: \\"All dictators followed the same routine of torture, as if they had all read the same manual of sadistic etiquette.\\" Does that ring any bells, Americans of the 21st C? The descent toward F*sc*sm begins with the willingness to torture.But \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is not a simple novel of realism. It's patently not realistic at all. It's a burlesque, a carnie show comedy, a sly sardonic satire not only of events in Europe but especially of smug provincial America, Lewis's favorite target of scorn. And it's bitterly funny most of the time. Some readers have been puzzled by the farcical names Lewsis gives his characters: Porkwood, Macgoblin, Windrip, etc. It's his distancing technique, friends. His object is the revelation of absurdity at the core of American boosterism. I didn't expect to be so royally amused by Lewis's humor as I was by the first third or so of \\"It Can't happen Here\\". Lewis had a tendency to stretch his satire past the moment of laughter, but this time he wrote genuinely funny stuff.Not all of the novel is burlesque, however. For once, Lewis has a tale of action and suspense to tell. A plot, in short, and a good one, with a sympathetic hero in the shape of Doremus Jessup, a small town journalist who fights tyranny with the only weapon he has, his own integrity. Lewis's more famous novels - Babbitt, Elmer Gantry, Arrowsmith - are modern-day picaresque, fictional episodic life histories. \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is structured as one man's fight for survival, compressed into a matter of months, against overwhelming forces of villainy. This time Lewis wrote genuinely exciting stuff.The villain, Senator and then President Berzelius Windrip, is truly a nasty piece of work, a \\"libertarian corporatist\\" (yes yes I know the word 'oxymoron') who thinks like Dick Cheney but talks like Sarah Palin. One has plenty of Windrip's rhetoric to base the latter comparison on; most chapters of Lewis's novel have incipits quoting from Windrip's imaginary manifesto Zero Hour. 'Zero Hour' was, of course, not written by Windrip himself but by his evil 'brain', Lee Sarason, a perverse genius who eventually betrays his master. How's this for a sample of the mentality of their leadership: \\"\\"Once... governments had merely let themselves slide into a war, thanking Providence for having provided a conflict as a febrifuge against internal discontent, but of course, in this age of deliberate, planned propaganda, a really modern government like theirs must figure out what brand of war they had to sell and plan the selling-campaign consciously.\\"\\" Windrip's chosen enemy was Mexico, conveniently closer to Here than Iraq.Windrip's thugs are called \\"Minute Men\\" and his party becomes known as the \\"Corpos\\", standing for \\"Corporatist\\", but their philosophy is in fact unbridled capitalism. It's been well demonstrated, in Chile for instance, that statist tyranny and free-market capitalism are NOT strange bed-partners. Our hero Doremus, imprisoned in a labor camp, \\"\\"was afraid that the world struggle today was not of C*mm*nism against F*sc*sm, but of tolerance against the bigotry that was preached equally by [both]. But he saw too that in America the struggle was befogged by the fact that the worst F*sc*sts were they who disowned the word \\"F*SC*SM\\" and preached enslavement to Capitalism under the style of Constitutional and Traditional Native American Liberty. For they were thieves not only of wages but of honor. To their purpose they could quote not only Scripture but Jefferson.\\"\\"Talk about prescience and pertinence! Too bad Lewis never tried his hand at science-fiction!Lewis's own ideology is 'a hard nut to crack' and perhaps full of contradictions. He was an aloof, scornful elitist with a sincere partisanship for the plain folk he so bitterly satirized. He managed to combine a reverence for individualism with a belief in the value of community and some measure of socialism. Lewis was a writer, not a social scientist. The conflicts in Lewis's vision make this piece of fiction all the more lively, and \\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is, for me anyway, the liveliest of Lewis's books."},{"Title":"It Can't Happen Here","review":"Lee Roscoe has recently ( 2005) adapted Sinclair Lewis's novel It Can't Happen Here to the stage. This play is a militant agitprop work and is available to people who want to produce it for an audience in a militant perspective to fight against the present erring developments of Bush's presidency and to advocate the necessity to impeach him and his vice-president as the last defense against their systematic attack on the Constitution, hence the American people and the World's population. This enables us to rediscover the plot imagined by Sinclair Lewis in the mid 30s who was afraid of the possibility for a populist candidate to become President of the US and lead the country to some kind of fascist dictatorship. Apparently this fear is being revived in the world, or rather in some countries by the war on terror launched by President Bush and that has brought some fairly frightening developments against basic civil rights: the possibility for the police to know what you borrow or check in and out in public libraries and the restriction under which the librarian is not to tell you about it; the negation of habeas corpus for a whole set of people who have been imprisoned in Guantanamo for years without any basic constitutional or plainly universally recognized rights like the possibility to communicate with the outside world, the right to have a lawyer, the right to be informed about the charges that are leveled at them, the right to be tried in a normal court in due time and following proper procedures, etc (the procedure is so unbelievably wrong that quite a few of these prisoners have been released without any charges after several years of detention amounting to so many years of suffering, social cultural or professional damage, and even psychological torturing, and no damages, compensation or reparation when released); and of course the normal reaction of some American people who believed what they were told and started leveling harsh words at opponents and even at times taking harsh measures against opponents. The text of this play is being circulated on the Internet. The same mindset is developing in other countries, like for instance in France where some consider that the election of Nicolas Sarkozy for instance is leading to the same kind of mechanism that will necessarily lead to a police state if not fascism.The process imagined by Sinclair Lewis is simple: a populist elected candidate and the defense of the absolute freedom of all markets to liberate the creative energy of capitalism and get us out of all possible crises. This will lead to work camps for unemployed people; the ruin of all independent newspapers and the hunting down of all alternative expression and media as unpatriotic if not anti-patriotic; the ruin of all businesses that do not support the policy of the President; the creation of some kind of militia to keep an eye on everyone; the increase of the powers of this militia that would have authority over all other police forces and even over justice. Of course one of the first triggering elements this President would need is some menace from a foreign country, hence a war against this menacing country, be it true or imagined, and a designated accomplice inside the country defined as anarchist, communist or terrorist. And the old world is then perverted enough for fascism to be born in the very sanctuary of human rights and civil liberties, and then \\"M and M\\" becomes Militia Man.It is interesting to see this revival. It reveals several elements that we must keep in mind if we want to understand what is happening in the world. People are really afraid of the future in this changing world.

It's the best book about cartomancy I've ever had and I still use it very often.The book has a first part dedicated to common notions about cartomancy. The part dedicated to Major and Minor arcana is very complete. Major Arcana are presented with a full description of their appearance and inner symbols followed by a very indeep explanation of their meanings as for love, work, friendship, health clearly divided into paragraph both if the card is right or reversed. Places and time assigned to each card are also given.Minor Arcana are also throughout explained both for their right and reverse side. The Minor Arcana part is not so indeep as the Major Arcana one but this is clear as the Minor Arcana hold less symbols to be unveiled.This book is a valuable means for those people who are discovering cartomancy, no more incomplete information but a reliable and insightful source!"},{"Title":"The Jews of New Jersey: A Pictorial History","review":"Without this great book, we would have no fantastic collection of the faces of jews that have impacted New Jersey's history.

Start with those and then by all means read this and everything else that is Cather. She's GREAT!!"},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"This book tends to go off in other directions"},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"This is a simply written but thematically complex, metaphoric story, replete with subtle nuances. The events that transpire are seen primarily through the eyes of a boy who comes of age, a contrivance that the author successfully employed in her best selling classic, \\"My Antonia\\". Here, it is no less successful. Through the eyes of Neil Herbert, who lives in Sweet Water, a prospective railroad hub on the Western plains in one of the prairie states, the reader gets to know Marian Forrester. She is the much younger, envied wife of one of the town's more prominent and wealthier citizens, Captain Daniel Forrester, a former railroad contractor.As Neil grows into a man, his adoration of the lovely Mrs. Forrester undergoes a change. He sees her fall from the pedestal from where he and all the townspeople have placed her and sees her, really sees her, warts and all, for the first time, when he discovers her involved in an unexpected peccadillo. It comes as a shock to him that she may not be all that she seems to be. Still, his life is closely entwined with hers, as his uncle, with whom he lives, is Captain Forrester's personal attorney and of the same social standing in this socially circumscribed backwater.Just as Neil's perception of Mrs. Forrester begins to change in his eyes, so do the fortunes of the town and that of Captain Forrester. As Mrs. Forrester physically deteriorates under the strain of the vicissitudes of fate, so do the town and its surrounding environs. As she revives, leaving behind her old values and adopting new ones that are anathema to those who respect the traditional ones, her revival parallels changes in the town itself, as the old makes way for the new. These changes also parallel the shifts occurring on the American frontier, as social mores and personal values undergo a change, and those stalwart pioneer values give way to new ones.Beautifully descriptive of a bygone era and laconic in its pace, this is most certainly a novel to be savored. Fans of the author will especially enjoy it."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"The story of a beautiful woman in the declining frontier town of Sweet Water is told by a studious young man who adores her from afar in this wistful, melancholy novel by Willa Cather. Niel Herbert is a sensitive, but substantial young man who makes the acquaintance of Captain and Mrs. Forrester, the town's leading citizens. Captain Forrester had been a railroad man - a builder, one could almost say a conqueror, who had originally chosen this out-of-the-way Midwestern train stop to make his home. His wife Marian, 25 years his junior, is the woman every man in town desires, and whom every woman in town envies. A native of California, she has grace, beauty, and youthful energy. She respects her husband's money and power and social position, but we don't often get the impression that she loves him. Instead, her head has been turned by a smarmy young gold-digger.In a story that is more about characters than about action, motivations often start out hazy, and only gradually come into focus. It quickly becomes obvious that Niel is in love with Mrs. Forrester, and that Ivy Peters (the underhanded lawyer Marian hires) is an ugly sadistic snake. Less clear is the nature of the relationship between the Captain and his wife, which seems founded more on mutual admiration than on love. And ever present through the novel are the geographic, social and economic realities of the declining frontier town, which had once been rich and abundant with promise, but which has become choked with a citizenry that has neither the unforced elegance of Mrs. Forrester, nor the strength and vision of her husband. The Captain shows his strong social conscience by supporting the bank, even when it takes a toll on his own solvency. Compare this with his wife's willingness to allow Ivy any latitude in getting her what she wants, regardless of who suffers. Cather shows parallels between the decline of the social order and the destruction (exploitation) of America's natural beauty and resources, and lays the blame not only on those small-minded, shortsighted individuals who sacrificed things that were good and true for their own immediate personal gratification, but also on those who saw it happening and failed to stop it. Mrs. Forrester can always move to another frontier, or find herself another rich husband, but who will repair the dust bowls that she leaves behind?This novel is a quick and easy read, and while there are intimations of sexual encounters, none are portrayed so graphically that modern teens would be likely to be shocked, although most will find the story a little too dry for their tastes. Many adults will probably feel the same way. There is no real humor in this book, and little that could be called uplifting, either, so while this book makes powerful statements about society, the roles of women, and the need to protect our natural environment, it should only be recommended to those who are devotees of serious literature."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"In the opening sentence of this short novel, Cather describes Sweet Water, the Nebraska town in which it takes place, as \\"so much grayer today\\" than it was a generation or so before, when the story takes place. When she wrote those words in 1923, she couldn't possibly have known how prophetic or poignant they would be today, as that part of the country has continued to lose population and become dotted with ghost towns in the decades since then. But sad as that may be, it only adds to the brilliance of this story of times that changed and a community that didn't keep up with the changes.As per usual for Cather, her heroine is seen mostly through the eyes of a young male character, about whom we know less in the end than we do about the woman he tells of. Taking place toward the end of the nineteenth century, it's a coming of age story for the both of them and for the land they call home, and, one could argue, for America at large. (Subtlety always was among Cather's strongest points; it's never easy to tell for certain whether her stories really are only about individuals or whether they're intended as an allegory for the loss of her beloved Midwestern frontier.) As the times change, so does the place of her protagonist, Mrs. Forrester, in the insular community due to some circumstances she can't control and some she can but won't. Like the title itself, the story ultimately leaves it up to us to decide whether she is ultimately better or worse off at the end than at the beginning and whether her fate reflects poorly on her friends and neighbors or herself, or both.The one certainty is a loss of youthful exuberance on the part of the town as a whole, which Cather paints vividly as a bustling young community at first and a wounded, declining one not long thereafter. We're left on our own to decide what it all says about Mrs. Forrester, her generation, women in society as a whole, and Cather's own opinions about it all. It's not easy to leave so much ambiguity without leaving the reader frustrated, but remarkably, that's just what happens here."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"This book is from Willa Cather's middle period of writing -- between My Antonia and Death Comes to the Archbishop. This may be the least known but best portion of her output.As does My Antonia, The Lost Lady pictures the American frontier in the middle west and its closing due to urbanization, the demise of the pioneer spirit, and commercialization.Together with its picture of the changing of the West, the book is a coming of age novel of a special sort and a portrait of a remarkable, because human and flawed, woman.As with many of Cather's works the story is told by a male narrator, Neil Herbert. We see him from adolescence as an admirer of, and perhaps infatuated by Marian Forrester, the heroine and the wife of a former railroad magnate now settled on a large farm in South Dakota. Neil matures and leaves to go to school in the East. We see his idea of Ms. Forrester change as he learns that there is both more and less to her than the glittering self-assured woman that meets his young eyes.The book is also the story of Marian herself, of her marriage, her self-assuredness, and her vulnerabilty. She is independent and a survivor and carries on within herself through harsh times and difficult circumstances, including the change in character of her adopted home in the midwest.This is a tightly written, thoughtful American novel."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"A novel of retrospection, A Lost Lady (1923) tells of events several decades earlier, when the rapid growth of the railroads was both expanding - and ending - the western frontier. But that is the larger, the national, backdrop against which more intimate dramas are played out, dramas that have to do with youth and age and beauty, and with adultry, sadism, and the growth of a young man, Niel Herbert. Niel idolizes Captain Forrester's young wife, Marion, and in this he is not alone. All who visit the Forrester's home find Marion's warmth and vitality captivating. In Cather's imagination, Mrs Forrester embodies the natural energy of the west itself: ageless and utterly unselfconscious of its own vibrant beauty. So, too, the Captain stands for all that once was the best in America but is now being lost in a greedy bid for money and land; the Captain is a man of conscience - strong, honorable, solid as a mountain. Their home, Sweet Water, is a kind of Eden on the prairie, and even the willow stakes he planted to mark his property lines come to bloom.Over time, as Niel matures, his &quot;lady&quot; too ages. And when the Captain dies, she falls on bad times, hurt rather than aided by advice from her lawyer. Her fall however is as much moral as it is financial - or at least it is in Niel's eyes. He notes that she has begun to use cosmetics and sherry. He finds her voice too loud, her laughter too forced. Niel loses his lady- or perhaps he gives her up.There is a kind of poignancy to this brief novel, and a unity that is as pleasing as the story itself. It is, on the one hand, the story of the West's golden youth and fading future. On the other hand, it is the story of a young man's growth and an aging woman's refusal to live as others would prefer."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"Like the majority of Cather's works, \\"A Lost Lady\\" immediately draws readers into its straight-forward narrative, and brings otherwise unremarkable characters to life with very concisely-worded descriptions. This novel tells the story of Marian Forrester, the wife of a much-older former railroad construction manager living in a small town in the Great Plains. Her beauty, polite reserve and the fact that she is from California make her a magnet for attention to the people of this small town. Most of the story is told through the eyes of Neil Herbert, a young man who has admired Mrs. Forrester from near and afar since his boyhood. I believe that the book's title refers more to Neil's perception of Mrs. Forrester as being somehow lost rather than a reflection of the actual situation, since Mrs. Forrester proves herself unexpectedly resourceful in many ways. Perhaps the most interesting aspect oft his rather too-short novel is the skillful way that Cather integrates her themes and leitmotivs: there's Cather's well-known fixation with the closing of the pioneering era of the American prairies, as well as her rather subtle portrayal of racism, as seen in the German immigrant boys who \\"know their place.\\" This novel is definitely among Cather's better works of fiction."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"What a beautiful story! What a magnificent writer Willa Cather is. This relatively short story is sure to captivate any fan of hers who has not had the pleasure of perusing this gem yet. If you enjoyed \\"My Antonia\\" and/or \\"O Pioneers!\\", then I can guaranty you, you will simply love this novella.\\"A Lost Lady\\" is the story of Marian Forrester and her much older, but very charming and amicable husband Captain Daniel Forrester. The Forrester's live in the small Western town of Sweet Water. The novel is written through the eyes of a young man Niel Herbert who also lives in Sweet Water and is good friends with the Forrester's. Ever since he was a young boy, Niel, along with just about everyone else in Sweet Water, is truly entranced by the grace, charm and beauty of Mrs. Forrester. She is the true embodiment, the aesthetic ideal of the perfect woman. However, as Niel grows up and becomes a young man he slowly but surely learns that this goddess is not without her flaws and short comings. In many ways, Marian Forrester, is our American version of Flaubert's Emma Bovary. However, Cather paints for us a much more simplistic, endearing, and sympathetic character than the latter in my opinion.This is such a beautiful piece of literature. It may not take the average bibliophile long to finish this work, but the favorable impression it will leave upon you makes this one to good to pass up. My only knock, I wish the story was longer, for I was truly absorbed from the first page to the last.5 STARS without thinking twice!"},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"I've read most of Cather's novels and this is pretty close to the top of the list. More sophisticated and complex than the well-beloved (by high school English teachers) 'My Antonia', 'A Lost Lady' plays with similar elements but seems (in structure and content) so much more successful. 'A Lost Lady' explores the fragile role women played in society around the turn of the century and, as such, stands up admirably with Wharton's 'The House of Mirth'. For other interesting Cather, give 'The Professor's House' and 'My Mortal Enemy' a shot."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"Critic Leon Edel wrote of Cather, \\"The time will come when she'll be ranked above Hemingway.\\" Well, I'm there! In fact, I've been there since I finished \\"O Pioneers.\\" For the last several years, I've been reading her books in order and just marvel at Cather's talent, her insights, and the economy of her writing.I was disappointed in \\"One of Ours,\\" the Pulitzer-Prize winning book that preceded \\"A Lost Lady.' The Midwest sequences in \\"One of Ours\\" were fine, but Cather seemed lost in unfamiliar territory when the setting switched to World War I France. \\"One of Ours\\" was a memorial tribute to a beloved relative of Cather's, so perhaps her emotions got the better of her writing and her observations.I was glad that she returned to the land and people she knew best with \\"A Lost Lady.\\"Every word in this little book rang true to me. Every character - major and minor - was alive and fully realized. The events and settings - all vivid and deeply credible.In fact, I stayed in bed all one morning to finish this book. Like a great mystery - this was a \\"page turner\\" for me. Cather sprinkles delicious hints throughout that propelled me forward. The satsifaction I felt at the end was similar to what one feels after finishing a first-rate mystery - only here the satisfaction was on the much higher plane of great literature.If you've read \\"O Pioneers,\\" \\"Song of the Lark,\\" or \\"My Antonia,\\" you know that Cather understood strong, admirable women. What a revelation that she could ALSO write a great book with a charming but weak woman as its central character. We admire and like Marian Forrester for her wit and grace, while at the same time we deplore her superficiality and hypocrisy.Like Neil, we never are quite sure who Mrs. Forrester is, what she thinks, or what motivates her. But that is precisely what makes this book such a work of art - and so true to life. I expect to reflect on Mrs. Forrester, Neil, the Captain - even Ivy Peters - and the others for many years to come.This probably should not be the first Cather book you read. \\"O Pioneers\\" or \\"My Antonia\\" are probably better choices. But don't lose sight of this small but dazzling jewel."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"i had heard a lot about willa cather (death comes for the archbishop, my antonia) but i had never heard of A Lost Lady until i went to the bookstore and found it, picking it mainly because it was short. however, once i started reading it i never wanted it to end! i think it is one of her finest novels and i wish more people knew about it. mrs. forrester's struggles are so real and timeless."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"In the tiny town of Sweet Water, in the open Western plains, freedom, toughness and human ingenuity ring supreme; for the inhabitants trying to cultivate and civilize the land and its outlaying citizens, those are paramount attributes that one must indeed have. But Sweet Water is different from other cowboy and Indian meccas, primarily because it has been somewhat tamed by the Transcontinental Railroad and the assorted luxury homes that stand solitarily in the vastness of the plains. Yet, the hardened iciness of such an existence is diminished by the warmth and sprightly charm of Marian Forrester, an aristocrat who brings the finer tastes to Sweet Water and its rough and tumble citizens. Married to Captain Daniel Forrester, she is fond of his pick-oneself-up-by-bootstraps mentality and of his pioneering spirit; he symbolizes something of the old order, the old value system, which is slowly ebbing away. And he is taking an epoch with him.While there are many other characters, the primary ones are Mr. and Mrs. Forrester, Neil Herbert, Judge Pummeroy and Ivy Peters. Neil had a childhood crush for Mrs. Forrester or at least he had a crush for what she represented: femininity in the wilds, refinement, openness, stellar attributes that would make any boy or man be drawn to her. Over time, however, his perception of her changes when he witnesses some lascivious behavior that he would least of all expect from her. Because Mr. Forrester is so sick and Mrs. Forrester is always alone-especially during the winter season-she claws at whatever physical and mental love she can get-for her marriage is more like a friendship between a nurse and a patient. As that is so, Neil grows up with the Forresters; he knows all their secrets, all the ins and outs but doesn't say anything. He has his own idiots to contend with, particularly Ivy Peters, an arrogant boy, later a young man, who is cocky, cold and just not a likable guy. He resents Mrs. Forrester, seeing her as a snob, and he lets her know it when she falls on hard times, which happens bit by bit as the Old West gradually ceases to be what it once was and the magical pioneering spirit is slowly looked upon as something from a bygone era and nothing to be repeated.A Lost Lady was a splendid read, not because Willa Cather captures the essence of loneliness as experienced by Mrs. Forrester and what that loneliness leads to, but she captures the period and the diminishment of the beauty of the hilly terrain, of campfires, of cowboys and Indians and of the fiery rough hewn landscapes that made the West and Midwest so magical and something beyond the human imagination. As wonderfully as it is rendered, it is also slowly yanked away to the point of Sweet Water being no more. Neil, who had some disappointment in Mrs. Forrester, because she so symbolized his childhood and of his environment, moved beyond it, reflecting only on the good memories, his judge/uncle Mr. Pommeroy, who encouraged him to study architecture and the whole mish mash of wonderfully peppered characters. People pass on and others, like Mrs. Forrester, find new joys in love. There is a lot to be said about A Lost Lady; it is sad, evocative of pleasant memories and some not so nice, and it conveys a very hard truth. Sometimes you simply can't go back, for nothing is forever."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"I was amazed at how fast I received this item after purchasing it! The price was reasonable, too.

The novel is subtle and nuanced but lacksthe energy of O Pioneers and My Antonia which are novels thatCather seems to put an extra amount of heart into.

You can feel his angst over his puppy love for her battling the static vision he needs from her. She however, has her own longing to keep living and loving to her fullest ability. They both find a type of peace in the end.Cather explores how well we can actually know and understand others. As a young woman the aging heroine marries a much older man. He comes from another era, from US pioneer times, with it's unique code of men and women, right and wrong. Even though this code seems brittle from the outside he as an individual manages to see his wife as a complete person with her strengths and foibles as well as her dreams of what might have been or could be. He honors her with his more complete and intimate understanding in a way the heroine worshipping boy can't. The boy grows up and begins to see the gray where before he only saw black and white. Cather always excels at showing the range of human emotions and she does so in such few words and without maudlin emotion."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"This is a simply written but thematically complex, metaphoric story, replete with subtle nuances.

I was impressed, frankly and I think I'll read more.Set in the 1880's/90's in Nebraska, this book chronicles the relationship of a young boy/man and the wife of a wealthy local luminary. As the boy turns into a man, his early admiration for the lady turns into contempt. Is this about a human relationship or rather a metaphor for the rise and decline of the plains economy in the aftermath of the railroad? Maybe both.One interesting aspect about this book, and, I suppose, all of Cather's work, is that she is writing about a period some twenty or thirty years prior to the era when she was writing. I thought that was pretty cool. She seems like an early example of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; style fiction writer.Good stuff."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"Many other reviewers have expressed more or less my sentiments about this book, but I shall add my own voice. 'A Lost Lady' is very short but extremely rich, with the elegance of a waltz but the depth and richness of a symphony.

Beautiful, lively, kind, aloof yet she shows a warmth and depth that Neil (the protaganist) was unused to in his frontier town.Over time, heart-ache and isolation eventually cause her to lose her soul.Cather is a genious in her quiet portrayial of this lonely woman and the on-going breaking of her spirit. Loneliness invades every word, every image and every character in \\"The Lost Woman\\".I would recommend that this novel be listened to as well as read.

As she revives, leaving behind her old values and adopting new ones that are anathema to those who respect the traditional ones, her revival parallels changes in the town itself, as the old makes way for the new. These changes also parallel the shifts occurring on the American frontier, as social mores and personal values undergo a change, and those stalwart pioneer values give way to new ones.Beautifully descriptive of a bygone era and laconic in its pace, this is most certainly a novel to be savored. Fans of the author will especially enjoy it."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"It is possible to read this book in one hour. But the danger of doing so is to miss all the subtleties of Willa Cather's writing, which although simple has deeper and deeper meaning the more you think about what she says. Her use of language gives her writing a unique personality which will appeal greatly to some.There are two main characters, the Lady and her admirer and, as is often her style, Willa Cather's narrator is a young man recounting the story as he sees it. Niel is 12 at the start and when the book ends 20 or 25 years later, he is a mature man. But he really only understands what has happened right at the finish.The setting is rural prairie country of the USA. The pioneers have established the small community of Sweet Water which is an important railroad hub. There are the shopkeepers, tradesmen, ranchers and labourers, but the Lady owns the biggest property with her older husband. They are very popular. They are generous, successful, kind and she is captivatingly attractive to all.Young Niel is smitten and adulates her. His uncle is the local judge and the two families often get together and the Lady takes upon herself the upbringing of Niel as he grows. But in life there are up and downs and in Sweet Water there are many losses. The railway goes and Sweet Water becomes a back water. Financial losses are heavy and draining. The pioneers are replaced by uncouth people who can only see dollar signs and not appreciate the loveliness of the country. So slash and shoot seem to be the order. The Lady's husband dies and she disappears.All these losses are happenings and do not directly redound on the character of the Lady herself. So why is the Lady lost? Actually she isn't, in practice, but everyone has a mental picture of her none moreso than Niel and as he grows and sees what she is really like, he decides that he doesn't at all love what he sees and he goes away without saying goodbye.Right at the end we hear of the final episode in the Lady's life that takes place in Buenos Aires, The Lady has remarried another wealthy landowner and she is still enjoying life and is as captivating and popular as ever. But when she dies she arranges for her second husband to pay the maintenance of her first husband's grave in Sweet Water and demonstrates that her spirit still lives on in the place.Suddenly, Niel realizes that the image he had of his Lady was unreal. Now he sees her as she truly is/was. The Lady is not lost, but what is lost is Niel's childish portrait of her. Instead of this immature image, he has discovered her true personality and actually, she is human with all the imperfections that includes. And at the end, he realizes that he actually prefers her like that.The descriptions of the places and people are absolutely vivid, yet require only a few sparse words to draw out the full, deeper signficance. The novel itself with its twists and turns and unexpected meanings is brilliant. The writing about change and how it affects places is worth reading on its own merit. I have seen the same kind of changes in my own lifetime and they had the same sort of effect on me too. Willa Cather captures the essence. It is a work of genius."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"Ms. Willa Cather has a way of deceiving her readers. Her novels are small simple looking stories when you begin and then you realize you are reading much more. Things are not always as they seem. I loved A Lost Lady-if only I could hear her laughter once more...."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"I thought A Lost Lady was a really good, fast read. The characters were complex, especially Mrs. Forrester and the Captain. Mrs. Forrester was the devoted and kind wife at some times and the lying, deceitful adulteress at others. I had a hard time deciding whether to love her as Niel did, or hate her. The relationships were as varied and complicated as the characters, and that's what makes A Lost Lady so great for analyzing."},{"Title":"A lost lady","review":"I had to read this for a college class, and I wasn't thrilled about it.

The book begins with boys from the 'rabble' of the town illicitly swimming and hunting on the 'lady's' property. Her gentility is framed by their subservience and also their need and ruthlessness.There are two immortal lines in the book, one at the husband's downfall (involving the 'n' word), one at the lady's ('You sit still. I'll take out the horses.') These intensely jarring catharses of the ruthlessness of the genteel society the lady represents break wide-open what might otherwise be--and has often been taken for--a simple lament of that 'old order'. There is lament for the beauty of wildness, both human and natural. A lyric description of the the marsh, destined to be drained, nears the sublime. But this 'little gem' has wicked edges."},{"Title":"Women and Spiritual Equality In Christian Tradition","review":"This book brings into perspective women's positions in medieval and early modern Christian traditions and has aided me in my own studies.

Very entertaining and a cool glimpse inside a start-up. What struck me as most interesting about this book is not what's said, but what it makes you think about: How much has changed since the history of when this story happened. In the compressed and accelerated time-space that current technolgy resides, the ability to experience history and learn from it becomes all the more important."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I read two books and saw a play this weekend. &quot;Scent of the Roses&quot;, starring Julie Harris as Annalise Morant, was an excellent production. Besides reading Albert Einstein's &quot;Relativity&quot; (his mass-market summary of General Relativity), I also read &quot;Burn Rate&quot;.It seems to me that Michael Wolff has 20/20 eyesight and a very passionate heart where a brain should be.His story was very compelling and the narrative was more than digestible. &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot; was almost grueling in its conclusion and the last line from chapter 5 had me wondering how much Douglas Adams Mr. Wolff had read.The last chapter, though, left me reeling. It was as though Wolff had survived the vicious rapids of the River Wild only to be able to recount how cold the water was. Not unlike anyone who had been thrown in the water--admittedly he does have a certain flair for the storytelling--helplessly breathless for his ordeal but not really any wiser.It was clear, though, Mr. Wolff got caught up in Internet Time and never really caught back up with reality. The Internet is moving fast--that's for sure--but Wolff never really &quot;got&quot; the Internet: he had observed the speeding train from the embankment, where it would appear to be accelerating uncontrollably. He never got the view from the caboose: where, inside, things seem to be moving and behaving normally (except for the occasional jolt--the outside world making a bump in the tracks) and the *outside* world appears to be a blur. The people on board--the twenty-somethings he never really had much direct exposure to--had never really stood on the embankment (&quot;media&quot;) and therefore couldn't know that the blur outside was somehow discernable to the former generation.It was like complaining that Pepsi didn't taste as good in a plastic bottle as it did in glass. The sensation is vaguely familiar but it won't be one that I can explain to *my* kids.So Wolff was right to observe that the Internet was a cultural revolution but wrong to assume that it would be media. WRONG.Wolff was wrong to observe and not to experience the revolution for himself. He tried to do what most media moguls do: mold culture into a form that can be easily transported and exchanged at a profit. His media is the dinosaur that would take its place in antiquity alongside the assembly line. His linear order--where *his* thoughts and *his* dreams and *his* authority flowed down a straight and narrow path to *his* audience (the masses)--is incompatible with the order born of chaos. He would have known that if he hadn't tried to manipulate the train *from* the embankment.Michael Wolff has the tendency, I think, to believe that AOL killed his business, in some not-too-literal way. AOL is, of course, probably just an anacronym for Microsoft, or chat, or the web, or whatever non-media force has temporary control of the Internet. What he fails to understand, though, is that AOL is just a reflection of its audience, much like the media. Television is self-perpetuating only because the Thursday masses want to preserve the lifestyle. The Internet will keep moving at a train's pace until those who make up its collective consciousness decide they'd like to stop and observe the blur outside.The best journalists have always found a way to get inside the action, to explain it and to make it real for those who don't share the same points of reference as those directly involved.&quot;One of the fascinating things about [the Internet], and one of the things that makes it almost impossible to predict, is that virtually any prediction you make is bound to come true.&quot; -- Burn Rate"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"During the early chapters I was fascinated and repulsed by most of the characters, &quot;weird Stan&quot; was the only one I could relate to. Michael Wolff is an opportunist that did not understand the Internet audience, was my view. His vision felt wrong; as the chapters went by, Michael not only explained what was wrong, but also presented a new view. His communication versus media anthology for the Internet is interesting.I have always thought of the Internet as a raw data source, where the chaos of conflicting information is gathered, filtered and analyzed within the specific requirements of the user. Whether this method is used to design an Intranet or buy a car, all viewpoints have been considered and outside bias has been avoided (hopefully).Regardless of what you think the Internet's function is I think most visitors to Amazon.com would agree that the best media for an unfolding story is a book. If you want an entrepreneur's lessons learned story or a morality lesson for Sunday school, this is the book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Nice stuff about the industry and life inside a start-up. Lots of recognizeable names pop up as bit players - Barry Diller, Halsey Minor. The big revelation in the book, however, is how venal and greedy all the characters are - including the author. Makes you wonder why anyone would want to be an entrepreneur. And like most books about the New World, it feels dashed-off and sloppy."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I too worked for Wolff New Media writing the NetBooks. Michael Wolff struck me as one of those fairly arrogant, not-much-time-for-the-little-guy entrepreneurs. I always assumed he was just like the many suits who were always coming through the office. It never crossed my mind that he was having his own private war with these guys, the investors or venture capitalists or whoever they were. His book is not only a total eye-opener but it's an amazing piece of writing. I read it one sitting. I can't believe that all this was going on around me and that I had no idea. I guess this book is like Barbarians at the Gate or Liar's Poker, but it's different too. It's real writing. It's great writing. You're in Wolff's head--a place I never imagined I'd be or want to be. But damn if it isn't one of the funniest places I've ever been."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"A friend of mine leaked me an advance copy of this book, and I must say that I was more than pleasantly surprised. I was blown away. I have been working in the internet industry for more than three years, and I have yet to see a book that captures the spirit of the business as accurately as this one--the chaos, the bad (and costly) decisions, and the air of incompetence that pervades the whole atmospehre. I would recommend this to anyone who liked either Liar's Poker or Day of the Locust. It was funny. I couldn't stop laughing."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Two thirds of the way through &quot;Burn Rate,&quot; you're ready to cry, &quot;Enough, already!&quot; Michael Wolff doesn't know when to quit. He must tell the reader a dozen times that the east coast is &quot;content,&quot; the west coast is &quot;technology.&quot; And that nobody &quot;gets&quot; the technology, least of all the stupid, greedy, inane venture capitalists who populate the halls of his memoir. The entertaining part is a financial suspense story: will Wolff get the capital he needs to finance his company. A one-eyed visionary who &quot;gets&quot; the internet, leading the blind who don't (mostly newspaper types), Wolff drives you nuts with self-absorbed descriptions of his travels, his meals, his finances ... his cyber-friends, and above all his enemies (lawyers, bankers and venture capitalists), who come across as unmannered snarling monsters in cheap suits.Most unrealistic is Wolff's change of heart in the last 50 pages, when he walks away from his company having decided that the internet isn't &quot;media&quot; after all, and that the newspaper types to whom he's been preaching just want to use the web to sell ads. (Duh.)His gratuitous parting shot is at Microsoft. Wolff doesn't think Gates gets it, either. Whatever &quot;it&quot; is. The one heroic figure in the book is Alison, Wolff's lawyer-advisor-spouse, who tells him (often) that it's time to get out. She's great! Hand in hand, poorer but wiser, they walk into the sunset. What an old-fashioned resolution!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Which is a shame, because we need someone to toss some water on the Internet hype and this writer seems prepared to do so. In telling the story of his company, the author's strategy was apparently to present himself as the only normal man in a land of fools, charlatans, and con men. Unfortunately, the author is no Mark Twain. The book is quite funny but mean-spirited. And the author seems to take pride in the fact that he was a bad businessman. There's no shame in heading a company that didn't succeed, especially in the volatile Internet world. But this guy seems to adopt the literary world's pretensions that business is a de classe vocation anyway, and that his foray into entrepreneurship was slumming."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Michael Wolff is a professional business writer - a journalist in fact. This fact is important for two reasons:1 - He writes clearly and well.2 - While living in the Internet Gold Rush, he took notes on the details of conversations, instead of the meaning (or so he tells us).So, this book is another interesting view in the ways and means of money. Smart money, dumb money, no money for tomorrow's payroll and all that.It's not written to give glamorous insight into how the author is a brilliant visionary, sharing his ideas with you, or anything that you'd find in a typical business book. It's a detailed narrative about life in the trenches. It certainly seems true enough to me.For that reason, it's worth reading, since most books push an agenda of their own, and this book doesn't really seem to have an agenda or something to prove. From the internal evidence, the author has tried to write a fun, compelling story that might sell, in order to make some money.He succeeded. At least, the writing of a story worth reading. I have no idea about the money."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"oh, just what the world needs: another volume of the typical ceo-who's-smarter-than-everyone story, only this time it's done with the special michael wolff brand &quot;look at who i got to talk to in the exciting world of New Media!!!!!!&quot; hubris (cf. his column in the industry standard). overblown, overlong, and overly self-promoting, although i guess that's the one skill he seems to have picked up as a result of his hustling with the big boys.when you're reading it, the one thing you notice about BURN RATE is how stupid everyone else seems. when you're done with it, you realize how stupid the book actually is."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I worked at CMP during the time Wolff writes about. While some of what he says is true, his descriptions of people in the company is cruel and insensitive. He describes one of the best journalists in the computer industry as &quot;a drawf in a wheelchair&quot; I believe. And he belittles the founders of CMP, Gerry and Lilo Leeds, for the crime of being old. They've accomplished more than Wolff ever could dream of. But, I suppose he has a family to feed, too, and the only way to do it is to insult, offend, draw caricatures instead of real people. One thing I will say for all the people at CMP involved in Netguide in the early days--they were trying, and sure they made mistakes. But so what? Everyone screws up. May Wolff be able to retire on the royalties of his book, or live off his lawyer wife. One sure thing--ain't nobody gonna want to be *his* business partner. Burn those bridges, Mike!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Revenge of the Words. After reading all of the hype, buzz, and reviews about this book I had to buy it. After all, I have been in Wolff's seat dealing with VCs, preferred stock, and critical market timing. Sadly, I found that the book is a long gossipy account of the early days of the web but very short on humor or advice for the entrepreneur. I normally grade business books by corner foldovers (to locate good advice or a pithy quote) and lol's (laughing out loud - or lots of laughs). This hyped book got 0 foldovers and only 2 lol's. A good business book like &quot;Dilbert Zone&quot; or &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; or &quot;Die Broke&quot; will get a dozen of each. When I finally finished this hyped ho-hum story, I realized that I had been had. But that was the point! Wolff is a writer and now he has now learned how to promote. So what better path to revenge than to hype and ripoff with his mighty pen. Hence the slapdash gossip tome (with several annoying typos) to! prove that he is now a master of timing and positioning."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"It's about that time about ten years ago - those thrilling days of yesteryear - when the Web was new, that's the time well captured in Burn Rate by Michael Wolff. Aptly cover the 24 weeks or so when 'content was king.'Like many others, Wolff could not resist the opportunity to be a part of a medium in its infant days. His delivery is generally well paced, often witty. It is old news now of course, and says nothing of Google or AOL since its merger with Time. The time capsule effect is for the better.What is your business model? When Netscape met advertising. The conundrum of the CPM [Cost per Thousand] trade press advertising model. And the larger more targeted more economical online version. Can software tell you what music you may like better than a skilled critic? In those days the folks with the money had not been on the Internet anymore than they have used Del.icio.us these days. Would the Internet level magazines? Minimal entry cost, but then what? Users taking control of news delivery systems. Pathfinder. Burning venture capital faster than achieving revenue. If you build it...It's all there."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is a great book. The author has a great view of the industry and, more importantly, a well-founded self view.Though written in 1998 (i.e., AGES ago in the Internet industry), a lot of the observations he makes are still relevant today, particularly in the post-bubble world. One of the observations he makes is that &quot;a few years from now when people hear the phrase \`dot com\` they will laugh&quot;, which is uncomfortably close to where we actually are.His discussion of where Time Warner and AOL were and wanted to b in the early days of the Internet boom are also interesting, given how things have ended up with the two companies.Finally, the author's epiphany towards the end about the fundamental flaw in his own net business was for me very profound, but I won't spoil that for other readers."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Although his &quot;magazine&quot; style shows in the first 1/3rd of the book and it seems a bit choppy to that point, the rest is very well written and takes on more of a bookish feel. And as far as insider view of the industry, take it from another veteran who's been around the net since 1994, he's right on the money in several places. This is a book I could truly relate to and anyone interested in starting a new net based business should take a look."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"After a couple of stabs, just finished Wolff's book. First few times aborted over the insider-y, New York media sensibility. Don't really care too much. Too much Conde Nast, Newhouse, on and on ...But then I got deeper and kinda fell for it all.Wolff is candid, thoughtful, and surpisingly open what a duplicitous greed-head he was in the Internet's go-go years (Round One). While the post facto allegations about how he abandoned ship are undoubtedly correct, that doesn't make the book any less interesting -- he sounds, in the book, as if that is precisely what he would have done in the circumstances.Finally, in answer to someone below me who says that he/she doesn't like how Wolff makes it sound like Internet entrep is one big bended-knee vsiit to financiers ... well, too bad. Speaking as someone who has been on the capital-giving and capital-receiving side of things, that is exactly how it is. Nasty, but true."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This book reflects some of my own experiences with an internet start-up (although mine was on much smaller scale). Looking back at many events I witnessed, I can really relate them with Michael's story. It will make me think twice before going into any kind of &quot;partnerships&quot; or funding agreements.After reading this book, the question of what one really wants to do in the future becomes crystalized and in need of an honest answer.If you have any interest in the internet business, this is an amusing and insightful way to learn more about what's out there!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Next up: How Donald Trump survived his Daddy's money, How Nelson Rockefeller survived the shadow of his family's name, how George Bush survived his years of failing oil companies.The book is reasonably refreshing in its self-assesment of knowing virtually nothing about how the internet would affect publishing and how anybody would make any money off it. Its candor is also refreshing in describing how they had so little to offer but were so willing to sell it at a high price to the even more gullible (&quot;they want how many million for the contents of my palm pilot?&quot;)If the author were a disinterested party reporting the actions of others, one would have to rate this book 4/5 for good writing, clarity and candor. As a player who took huge sums of money from investors, suspecting the business was a house of cards, one can only wonder if he shouldn't be in jail. As a book, I have little choice but to recommend it. The description of AOL alone is worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Burn Rate has the same kind of appeal as the Jerry Springer Show. Readers are only educated to the extent that they learn that it's bad to lie, cheat, and steal, and that people who make a habit of doing these things (especially if they lack good business sense) are likely to run into difficulties. It's nice that Wolff is able to work through his failures by writing a story in which he projects his negative feelings onto all of his peers and ex-associates. Unfortunately, the book lacks pathos, so it's a bit less gripping than other forms of therapeutic expression. I have to admit that I was entertained by the clever caricatures of everyone Wolff lied to, swindled, and stepped on in his fruitless quest for a quick buck. But if you want to learn something useful about business or entrepreneurship, read books written by the investors and entrepreneurs who succeeded."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Burn Rate is author Mike Wolff's autobiographical account of his rags-to-IPO ride on the Internet bandwagon. It's a quick and easy read, entertaining throughout but also scathingly sad in its implicit criticism of the hype and hoopla built around the Internet and those who think they \\"get\\" it.A flat synthesis of Wolff's story could read: man as ethical artist, man gets seduced by fast money and faster-rising second round valuations, man gets lost on the path to immortality, man comes to his senses, rights himself and will never do it again, he thinks...and therein lies the rub as told by Wolff.Burn Rate is less a story about the facts, buzz-words and players in dotcom world than a tongue-in-cheek tale of the siren call of wealth. You get the feeling that writing this book was Wolff's attempt at self-therapy, his \\"f--- you\\" money directed to the dotcom fraternity with all its insider conferences and financing schemes, he was sheepishly compelled to belong.Wolff chronicles the rise of dotcom fever and companies in the decade of the 90's, sweeping along rich and poor, talented and talentless alike, and giving rise to a new generation of anonymous, dsyfunctional middle managers brilliantly fleshed out in the form of the \\"AOL executive.\\"With the AOL executive as the eponymous everyman of the \`90s, some of the funniest passages in Burn Rate describes Wolff's befuddlement in his own increasing lack of ability to discern wise men from fools. For who would have thought that this could be the kind of industry that elevates a back-packing, self-exiled hippie expatriate, like Louis Rossetto to millionaire and cult hero?How much of a catharsis Burn Rate turns out to be for Wolff (or, for that matter, for his readers) however, is debatable. He concludes, \\"Nobody knows what's going on. Whatever we agree on today will be disputed tomorrow. It's a kind of anarchy. A strangely level playing field. The Wild West.\\" In other words, the Internet biz keeps enticing by its lack of absolutes.In the end, there remains a off-putting smugness in Wolff for having been there. Writes he, &quot;We are the leaders of an industry without income&quot;. Now that, indeed, is a paradigm shift that leaves this reader, despite being entertained, with a flat taste in her mouth."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"\\"Burn Rate\\" is one of the best business kiss-and-tell books I've read in a long time. As the former CFO of a venture-backed Internet company, I know many of the people Wolff describes, experienced many similar situations, and admire/envy him for really telling it like it is (even though he'll probably never eat lunch in this town again &lt;g&gt;).Not all investors, venture capitalists, and investment bankers are calculating and greedy, but enough of them fit that mold that Wolff's vivid portrayals ring true. Woe to the entrepreneur who thinks his investors are his friends who won't try to squeeze him when the going gets rough.His tale of Magellan being left at the IPO altar by Robertson Stephens, its twirl around the dance floor with Wolff, and its eventual fire sale to Excite, the company that precipitated the IPO jilting, is filled with intrigue because of the Maxwell connection. What he doesn't detail, unfortunately, is the backroom machinations of a prominent VC and Excite investor who pressured RS&amp;Co. to drop the Magellan IPO.Wolff's depiction of AOL as one of the great dysfunctional companies of the Internet boom years is dead-on. I know, first-hand, that trying to find anyone at AOL who actually had the authority to make a decision was an exercise in futility. AOL management at the time was like the novice surfer who found himself riding a tsunami and somehow today, inexplicably, has made it safely to shore.Revealing himself to be not only a victim but also a perpetrator of the Internet gold rush, Wolff's fleecing of CMP shows he is no saint. When considered in the larger context of the book, it makes painfully clear that whether you are buying a business or \\"buying\\" investors for your business, \\"Caveat Emptor.\\"Strangely enough, the business plan I wrote for my company in 1994 (that helped to secure funding from one of the \\"Big 3\\" Silicon Valley VC firms) prominently quoted some Internet statistics reported in the Wall Street Journal that had been compiled by Michael Wolff ! &amp; Co. While I'd love to come full circle and quote from \\"Burn Rate\\" in the business plan I'm currently writing, I'm afraid it would hit too close to home for most VCs to stomach."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"The main thing I took away from this book was how impressed I was by Wolff's writing skills. He has a very absorbing way to describe people and events. His ability to question and criticize his own ideas and actions makes his cutting descriptions about other characters more credible. I'm sure some of the people in this book were none too thrilled to see it (Machinist and Rubin especially).I would have rated this book 5 stars if the overall story had been just a little more interesting to me. Some sections tended to drag, but they were offset by others that were exceptional. If you have any interest in the tech boom and bust, I think you'd enjoy reading this book. I can't imagine there are many other choices out there written by someone with as much perspective and writing skill as Wolff."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I do not understand the problems other reviewers found with Wolff's character throughout the book. He writes with extreme honesty (which is hard when you are passionate about your business). He does not go into the trouble of portraying himself in a positive light--he writes about actual things he said and did--what is the problem when you find his actions less than photogenic? This only increases the value of the book.Nor does Wolff lambast everyone else, as has been implied. There are a lot of examples of people he is friendly with, or even admires: Hayden, Isaacson, etc. Yes, the majority of business men portrayed are not cast in the attractive life. it would seem to me that preserving the appearance of decency in a cutthroat environment is practically a superhuman task. I think that the brutality of Wolff's honesty (and the fact that he is writing about failure rather than success) have been a turn-off for some readers.The interesting thing about the book is that Wolff is taking a somewhat philosophical approach to the Internet business models and (truly in the spirit of NetGuide) tries perhaps a bit too hard to distinguish content companies from other Internet players (nowadays the lines are more blurred). The theoretical stuff is not necessarily fun to read, and the real book starts with Chapter 7, when all of a sudden he and his personal fortune are put in a big squeeze by the evil investors. The drama of his struggles to keep the company afloat (and not his relationship with Time Warner or CMP) is what fascinates me in the book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Among the various books available on the topic of startups, etc, this book most closely and frankly puts across the relationship between the Founder of a startup and the VCs who finance it.

At times, the author seems almost aplogogetic, but that is always better than cockiness.A very good buy!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I know this world - I've spent the past ten years in technology marketing. And I've never read anything that described it in quite the forthright manner that Mr Wolff does.His anecdotal portraits of the 'players', including himself, are refreshing, and frankly, horrifying. It's amazing what you can get used to when you are confronted with it every day, and this book was an excellent way to stand outside the internet world and look back at it through the eyes of one of these players.I can understand his nearly overwhelming urge to projectile-vomit at yet another presentation to 'vulture' capitalists. And his discussion of the 'art of the deal' is brilliant.And jeez, if Rageboy thought it was good it must have something going for it!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I have a personal acquaintance with six(!) of the people Wolff writes about. In each instance, it's uncanny what an accurate, and, I'm afraid, devistating portrait Wolff draws. He has an incredible gift for mimicry, and a talent for going right to a person's weakest spot. That is, I suppose, cruel, but on the other hand it's true. I swear when Wolff writes dialogue it's as though your speaking to the actual person. Perfectly captured. It's eerie. Believe me I know. I was out last night with one of the people written about at some length in the book and I kept giggling (to myself, of course) and also kept wondering which version was truer the actual person or the one in the book. Bizarre! But cool!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"As a management consultant, I read a lot of business books. Unfortunately, very few stick in my mind after two or three days. Burn Rate, however, is a book I will not forget for a long time.Like Michael Lewis &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; a few years back, epitomizes all the hysteria of an industry driven to madness by tales of massive profits and even more massive failures. &quot;Burn Rate&quot;, however, doesn't shy away from using real names. I always wondered which Harvard grad became the infamous Human Piranha from Michael Lewis' book. You won't have any such questions with &quot;Burn Rate.&quot;This is by far the best business book of the year."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Having worked in the internet business during the timeframe encompassed by this book I found it quite interesting to hear an &quot;insiders&quot; account of mergers, acquisitions, raising capital and running an internet start-up during the early days of the 'Net. The book is insightful, fast paced and often humorous. I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Who hasn't read this book? Everybody but me,until now. I finally picked it up on a flight. It really is sensational. You can't put it down. It might be the best book I've read all year. I'm in awe of it. In a way, it's almost worth it to have you business go belly up and not make an Internet fortune, if, instead, you could write this book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"An amusing tale of the early period of the Internet wherein speakers at conferences frequently used the phrase &quot;we just don't know...&quot;.Wolff comes of like something of an observer, rather than as a participant. The other characters are well drawn.One nit: I found my edition to contain editing mistakes..."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is the best book that's ever been written about the technology business!

No sourpusses please."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is a wonderful read. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and will most likely refer to it for years to come. It offers insight into the tulip bulb internet craze in which we live.

Good news: He's done an incredible job of writing about the technology industry. The only other book that comes close is Kaplan's Startup, but even that's not the same league. Startup is still a business book, Burn Rate is a real book. You won't just learn stuff, you'll feel it. I'm really excited about this book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"People next to me on the plane must of thought I was crazy. I kept laughing out loud in hysterics as Burn Rate describes the underbelly of Internet business. Even if you have never turned on a computer, and want to understand what all the hype is really about, read this book. Mr. Rubbin (the investor in the failed company described in the book) paid $4 million for his copy--the rest of us are getting off cheap."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"In &quot;Burn Rate&quot; Michael Wolff violates two major taboos of the technology industry: telling the truth and having a sense of humor. Reading his hillarious and horrifying insider account of the rise and fall of a New York-based new media firm felt to me like the first breath of fresh air since the early-nineties beta-launch of Mosaic. And this guy can actually write! My God, lets elect Wolff to congress, that other stronghold of the two taboos, and have him write a book like Burn Rate about Washington!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This book reads like a novel. It's totally suspenseful. It kept me up through an entire night. You're swept along in the drama of a person with a good fight to wage and worthy enemies to beat. The characters are both real and amazing, not only great portraits but fascinating, reviting people from the smart-aleck dwarf to the brilliant but evil banker to the scam artist AOL executive to one of the best wives I've met in a book (we should all have such a wife). But it's a real moral tale too. And in the end, of course, the bad guys win. But first you laugh and laugh."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Having worked in two start-ups, I can say that this book is probably says things that need to be said. People always say the money will come, but it never does. The hard thing about a start-up is how much you need everybody else, and, because they know it, the chances are very good that you'll get taken advantage of. Start-ups are exciting, but it's an excitement that after you've been through a few you can do without. In the end of the book, Wolff says he might do it again. I wonder if he actually would. It's an exciting book that, to be honest, made me sick to my stomach."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"A fine business biography, brings us right into the heartaches of dealing with venture capitalists, getting screwed around by untold people and, most importantly, offers some profound insights about the internet. Thank you Michael for showing us that the emperor is very nearly naked. Please write more, soon."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This book is incredibly funny. I worked at CMP which is one of the companies Wolff discusses in the book. I was on the floor. The descriptions of these guys at CMP couldn't be truer and couldn't be funnier. THEY ARE NAILED! God, I hope they read this book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I can't believe that Wolff would acknowledge so much about himself in a book. Burn Rate reveals Wolff's petulant nature, and documents his downward spiral into a money-grubbing loss of integrity. His tale tries to drag everyone he met during his push for IPO down with him, making this a pathetic and depressing read."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This book, written in 1998 about a company that collapsed in 1997, is quite prescient in many aspects except in the implicit assumption in the subtitle that the &quot;gold rush years&quot; of the internet were over in 1998, while in fact 1999 and early 2000 would prove to be the peak of the dot-com craze.The book is overall very funny (although sometimes a bit repetitive). I've read that former employees of the author do not necessarily remember him fondly for his actions, but for outsiders, this is a fun and interesting book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I was selling my company when I first read this and the deal was taking forever. I kept getting the feeling that I was about to get screwed. Then I read this book and I KNEW I was going to get screwed. This book is a perfect example of what happens when a smart, idealistic guy with a potentially good company starts running with the wrong crowd - financial guys. The result is a despressing page turner."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"As a writer, Mr. Wolff certainly has the ability to tell a story. However, his definitions of &quot;media business&quot;, &quot;communication business&quot;, &quot;technology business&quot; and so on are inconsistent and problematic. No wonder he didn't know where his comany was headed."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"\\"What's Your Burn Rate?\\" \\"Oh, about half a milion a month or so,\\" I shrug. \\"Rest in peace, baby.\\"A firm's burn rate is the amount of money a startup company consumes each month in excess of its income. Firms that burn capital too fast will go out of business. Those that burn capital too slowly risk falling behind in innovation and market share growth. Internet startups tend to burn capital quite rapidly. That is why they take so long to make a profit, if they ever do.Burn Rate is the story of how Wired started, as told by Michael Wolff, its founder. Primarily a print media writer in his former life, it is interesting to see him learn the wily ways of the venture capitalists in the fast-moving Internet business games. More than a high-tech startup story, this is a sociological study of the financial wheeler-dealers in the mid-1990s Internet business. It reads like a novel while it educates the reader. You will learn why the stocks of these sexy firms rise ever higher though the future holds nothing but a continued stream of red ink. Sanity, anyone?"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Writers and Journalists don't make good entrepreneurs...The whole Internet landscape is changing so fast, and the question is, are you willing to change your business as quickly just to survive? The hype does through so many stages so quickly, it was first: &quot;be wired and cool&quot;, then &quot;content is the king&quot;, then &quot;Push&quot;, then &quot;distribution is the key&quot;, then &quot;Portal and retail&quot;, and who knows what's next. So how do you sell stuffs on Slate? How do you morph PointCast into a Portal? If you started the book version of Wolff's NetGuide, now how do you support the &quot;sex chat&quot; and start selling Viagra online? Editorials and journalistic value? &quot;you are so nineteen ninety one&quot;, as the kid said on the Simpsons...Pop quiz: how many Web enterprises failed last week?To make a play on Internet, you have to have Money, vision, willingness to do whatever it takes to 'get there', and be lucky enough to come in at the right entry point with the right offering. Wolff sort of jumped into this &quot;new media&quot; with the idea of perpetuating his old media value and habit, it's no surprise to see that he wasn't comfortable with anybody other than his old media friends.So now, what's is this 'new media' thing? What are the basic value and assumptions here? Are we in this to 1) make money? 2) change the world? 3) conquer the world? 4) do something new and cool? 5) survive?It's a pretty cool reading BTW."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Petty comments take a little away from an otherwise entertaining book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Wolff is an egomaniac who uses his ability to write to make himself the center of the story. The book is highly readable, even a page turner type, but it is also very narcissistic. It makes important points and can be entertaining but in the end it is one man's point of view. It is not an even-handed treatment of the subject. I wanted something different, but still enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"In 1994-95 I used to blow into NYC to have lunch with Michael Wolff every couple months. These meetings were great infusions of energy for me because the guy truly &quot;got it&quot; in a way that was rare back then -- and sadly still is. We stopped meeting after he took on an equity partner whose attitude toward the net I couldn't stomach. This outfit struck me as bad news and I told him so. About a year later, I heard Michael had bailed out of his own company, basically as a result of the head-on collision I had suspected was inevitable. I was deeply impressed. Personal integrity has not exactly become a commodity in this industry.While the book details an all-expense-paid trip to hell at the hands of the clueless and the venal, it's also a rolling-on-the-floor laughing-out-loud funny read. What a coup: the unvarnished truth as purest entertainment! Whether you were there for these events or not, it's hard to imagine you won't love the book. Unless, that is, you're among its targets. Well met; well deserved; well written and delicious. Five stars and clearly headed for the charts."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"While I don't know the whole story, Wolff seems to have a lot of experience, and little business smarts. Heck, from the few descriptions of his wife, SHE seems to have more business smarts. This is certainly an interesting, well-written book (he's a writer after all,) but the fact that he drove himself to near insanity as well as bankruptcy all in the name of pure greed leaves me feeling this book has no real point other than \\"How I wanted to get rich, or die tryin!\\" He described endless begging for money, which seems to be the central point of the book. You will find an interesting set of stories here, but the message is a rather shallow one if there is one at all. But then I guess that was the point of most of the internet bubble as a whole."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is not only a great read, but it is totally consistent with my experiences working for 4 pre-IPO high-tech firms. There is something surreal about the world of the startup and the money that chases it. I've worked for several ex-finance types who cynically thought that they could profit from the stupidity of others (cluelessness is as cluelessness does). They could have come right out of the pages of this book.Wolff portrays this world as sort of an elaborate Ponzi scheme, with the backers looking to unload their startups before anybody discovers that they are worthless (by 'they', I think I'm referring to the firms). That's consistent with what I've seen. Wolff also describes the strange vampire community of PR firms, sales people, executives, lawyers, accountants, bankers and others who specialize in feeding off of nave entrepreneurs. That's consistent with what some of the startup parasites I've encountered, all looking to get a piece of that easy money. After all, it isn't the entrepreneur's own money, so it is no wonder they spend like there's no tomorrow. (Like Machinist, I also check out the cars in the parking lot as a guide to how profligate the execs are.)The history of the Internet, and some of the seminal events that took place in the 1990s, and the description of how the VC game works are very accurately portrayed. Besides serving as an introduction to the experiences that a startup undergoes, this book is a useful guide to the recent history of technology, but it is hardly a dry academic tone. In spite of dabbling as a CEO, the author is primarily a professional writer. He knows how to tell a story, and he does a good job of it. This is an autobiography written by a pro who has had significant experiences in an area of interest, so it should be no surprise that this is a compelling book.I enjoyed reading it very much. It is both informative and entertaining, providing an important personal account of some of the most interesting years in recent business history. It is comparable to Bronson's &quot;Nudist on the Late Shift,&quot; but in this case, the author actually had the opportunity to view the craziness from the inside, instead of being a detached external observer. I hope I'm not giving away the ending by saying that although the author flirted with Satan for several years, he apparently emerged with his soul intact. ;-)"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This book is enthralling. I loved it. Business really is warfare. And he put me right in the middle of it. I kept thinking about the internet experience I had just finished with and completely identified. If you are involved in the media, new, old, or middle aged, you will relate to this book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Michael's book about his experiences while trying to float his internet based publishing company and the characters he encounters makes for a terrific read. I started following the internet culture through the likes of Wired Magazine back in 1994 and it was interesting to hear the background on many of the deals that have occured since. I'm not sure though if this small glimpse of the industry converted me to the new economy, it still seem like the snake oil salesman are still around."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"The best reason to read this book is that it is very well written. The author isn't really a techie, he's a writer, and it shows. It's also nice to read a business book that is so personalized. You see his internal reactions to the various oversized egos and assholes and the people in the industry who just don't know what the hell they're doing. His picture of the venture capitalists was especially vivid. Some of the scenes, like the dealmaking attempts, were just gripping, and his description of dealing with AOL was almost surreal. It makes you wonder how AOL can actually operate as a business, they're so weird and flaky. A really good read."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Ah...Business in Silicon Valley isn't that easy!!!

The intensity of the latter left me with nightmares, I felt very real and believable. Gently and ever so politely squeezing each others sensitive body parts eyeball to eyeball until someone blinks.Reminiscent of dealing with a relative with whom you have significant areas of conflict- like war there are no ultimate winners only richer and poorer losers. The almost total lack of predictability of the Internet future is amazing. Overall entertaining and informative."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is my favorite book yet on the Internet &quot;go-go&quot; years. What distinguishes Burn Rate from the other Internet books that I've most recently read (AOL, Release 2.0) is the quality of the writing. Wolff is a writer first - and while he may be a fatally-flawed deal-maker (and a unscrupulous one), he weaves a gripping narrative through the few hundred pages. His characters have depth - I actively rooted for and against different people in the book. The other two books - both of which I read with great expectation - are comparatively dry, choppy, and I never really cared about anything or anyone in them."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This book should be required reading for 'new world' MBA students as it is a revealing (as well as hysterical) view into how business will be conducted in the 21st century. It also provides fair warning for entrepreneurs thinking of using venture capitalists to fund their businesses!Besides being hugely educational it is also great fun to read. Not since 'Liar's Poker' has the insanity of the business world provided so much fun. Don't read in public places if you're embarrassed to be caught laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Sweet jesus, this book had some passages that made me laff...and wince. Chilling and true. Hell, having lived through some &quot;Burn Rate&quot;-style dramas myself, I could relate."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is scary how real this hits the nail on the head. Michael Wolff actually takes you inside the tornado of mayhem as the financial markets went wild for these internet pure plays."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I can see why people were so scathing about it. He doesn't pull punches. He got in bed with financial types he didn't like from the start, and hated by the end. He didn't stay entirely clean himself, and he's surprisingly candid about it. At the end, he is shriven (sort of), leaves the field, walks away from a big pile of money, and returns to writing.If you read some of the pissy and not so pissy backstory pieces that came out after his book, you're told that he abandoned his employees for his own needs (true, but after many months of pretty much shredding cash, and without any short-term or long-term hope of success). You're also told that he manufactured people, incidents, dialog. Hard to say without having been there. But I've met many people like the people Wolff describes, and I don't doubt that they would act precisely as they are acting in reaction to the book, including denying everything whether true or false.Brill's Content ran an extremely fatuous piece back in October 1998 that moves me to profanity when I read it; it's attack journalism without balance. The piece quoted many parties' gripes with the book without confirmation except from other parties with gripes. Wolff wrote a pretty funny story about getting the pin stuck in him as Brill tried to maneuver him into the formaldehyde.It's still unclear to me why people don't want to believe his account of events. I don't know if it's true, but my descent into the Internet maelstrom, during which I met or worked with many interesting content and ecommerce types, confirms the tenor of what he describes. I'm inclined to think that a little dramatic license and a lot of fact inform the book.A number of reviewers (and Amazon.com customers) describe Wolff's ego as enormous. I don't see it. This book is a bunch of beech branches beating him in the back. He doesn't let anybody off easy - okay the Hoover's folks are nicely presented, as counter example - but he presents himself as the money hungry nut he was during those crazy days. But he walked away from a big pile of cash (as I did, somewhat around the same time, but in substantially different circumstances), and lived to tell the tale. And write a successful book about it, in much the same style and mode of interest as Jerry Kaplan's Startup."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Believe it or not, not every Internet entreprenuer gets out with a successful IPO. Wolff, a true New Media pioneer, gives us a marvelous insider's view that a winner simply could not provide, and the book is such a great, insightful read, I'm glad he failed so that we can get this peek. So much more than sour grapes, Wolff burns bridges and shows all the players with their masks off, himself included.A book like this will always receive negative reviews from types who can't trust the motives of anyone who didn't come out a winner, but these same people readily accept as gospel any puff piece that states Steve Case's visionary genius built AOL rather than the marketing side kick with the simple idea sneak into American homes and fill the sock drawers with start up disks. Not every story is pretty, not every success is the inevitable result of brilliance and elbow grease. Do not write off this work because Wolff's business didn't work out. Rather, enjoy his sadder but wiser perspective. Enjoy a glimpse of everything that happens to successes, also, but somehow never makes it into the Business Week cover story."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I think I've read everything about this business--Po Bronson and Michael Lewis books most recently--and nothing anywhere compares to Burn Rate. First of all, Wolff, either fearless or crazy, doesn't suck up to anybody. Second, this is not just good writing, this is amazing; you start to read the sentences outloud they're so good all kinds of memorable lines stay with you. Third, Wolff's book is about character, the real stuff that makes people do what they do; you recognize the people here, you understand them, they're real--they aren't some model people who inhabit Silicon Valley and the Internet Industry (Lewis's book the New New Thing is all about inventing that sort of model). Burn Rate is brilliant. It makes you sweat it's so good."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Bored with pulp novels but not ready for a serious tome? My book of the year is Michael Wolff's Burn Rate. This is a grunt's view of the early internet battles. Wolff is predatory in his language, honest in his insecurity, writes well but actually knows his stuff. You'll learn &amp; have a belly laugh. Add it to Liar's Poker, Up the Organization &amp; Feargal Quinn's Crowning the Customer as must-reads."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"As a former worker in the Internet world, I found this book both a juicy read, and laugh-out-loud (lol) funny. Wolff spares no one in this account, least of all himself.He perfectly captures the insanity of the &quot;go-go&quot; Internet mania years -- with companies paying huge premiums for, in some cases, as Wolff's wife so insightfully theorizes, just a particular domain name.Few Internet-era celebrities are spared, as Wolff dishes on several &quot;big names&quot; in business of the day.A great, entertaining period piece on the dot-com era.- Julia Wilkinson, author, &quot;My Life at AOL&quot;"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This book is about Wolff's short-lived foray into Internet entrepreneurship in the mid-90s. In addition to recounting his own company's fortunes, he seems to have been tuned in to just about everything that was going on with the net industry, so it's a great overview of the whole cyber-landscape too. Mainly, it's a chronicle of the moment when the Internet shifted from being a marginalized geekfest to being Big Business.He has great chapters on Wired magazine, on AOL, on Microsoft, and on his own attempts to secure venture capital for his company. The third chapter, \\"The Art of the Deal,\\" was hysterically funny and thoroughly horrifying at the same time. At first I thought, reminiscing, that I was at perfectly the right age to have taken advantage of the Internet boom, if I'd had the presence of mind. But then, as I read further, I became more and more relieved that I'd never done so.This book was published before most of the recent upheavals in the Internet world: The ascendancy and hegemony of IE in the browser wars (after Netscape effectively abdicated); AOL's ill-fated acquisition of Time Warner; and, of course, the \\"dot-bomb\\" to which many of us owe our current unemployed status. The book, therefore, lacks the scope and perspective of a historical document, but is very much a \\"view from the trenches\\" look at the way it seemed to a smart and thoughtful (and literary) guy who was there.One of my primary reactions was of nostalgia. Ah, remember when AOL was Mac-only? Not only that, but it was only one of several available online communities: Delphi, Prodigy, CompuServe, Sierra... Remember when it seemed like there were only five of us who knew that AOL and the Internet were not the same thing? Remember when there was no Web? Remember when there was no Amazon.com? Remember Micropayments? Remember Push? Ah, them was the days.Most of all, Wolff does a pretty good job of stopping every now and then to take stock, to wonder philosophically what it's all about: Is the Internet media, or just a big telephone? He doesn't figure out the answer, of course, but that's not what philosophy is about. Taking the long view, I think it's books like this that are going to help our society, 25 or 50 or 100 years down the line, figure out what the Internet boom/bust, and the 90s, were about."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is certainly the best book I've read about the Internet industry and probably one of the best business books I've read ever. You can't put it down and you laugh out loud (truly) many time a chapter. The interesting thing is how much controversy this book his inspired--because in its way it's not controversial at all. It's just an incredibly good story. Even the terrible things Wolff supposedly says about people are really more comic than anything else. My guess is that there is just so little objectivity and self-awaresness and skepticism in the Internet business that one a honest point of view comes along people freak. Anyway this is not a book that anybody who is interestesting in technology, money, business, and the general state of American culture and American writing is going to want to miss. Also, if you just want several hours of cough-up-your-coke laughter, try it. I guarantee: you'll wish you had written it!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"I really liked this book and got to learn about the hardships entrepreneurs go through in a startup.I was also not much aware about the differences in thought between West Coast and East Coast IT companies.Finally, kudos to Michael Wolff for potraying an honest,funny and nerve wrecking real life story and am happy he is doing what he likes to do!!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Burn Rate is an occasionally pedestrian personal history of the internet business world that rises above itself because of its special point of view. Uniquely for a business writer, Michael Wolff actually ran his own internet-related publishing venture for years. The bad and the absurd things that happen in this book (and there are many) happened to him, and this gives his account immediacy and a pungent flavor that would be missing in a third-person account.The book covers the internet business from 1994 to 1997, when Wolff was trying to cut a deal with Magellan or AOL or Ameritech or the Washington Post, while keeping his venture capitalists at arms length. His \\"burn rate\\" is high-he's spending half a million bucks a month-and the money is always about to run out in a few weeks. He has no hope of turning a profit in a reasonable length of time and so he needs a deal, fast.Wolff is always on the verge of that deal, always about to sell out for more money than he thought existed, only to have the whole thing collapse in acrimony or apathy or a shift in the corporate zeitgeist or whatever. Back then, everybody was making internet commerce up as they went along (the term \\"e-business\\" was a couple of years off) and huge sums of money always seemed about to be made or lost on hunches or whims or loopy idealism. Wolff has a keen eye for the resulting nonsense, and he can write about it without condescension because he realizes that he was just another asylum inmate. Overall, a good, fun read."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Seriously, this book gotta rank with Wired, Yahoo, Netscape, and, yes, Amazon as one of the things that shaped the net.

Five stars, three cheers, etc."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"As someone who works online for a large and lumbering giant I found Michael Wolff's account of the rise and fall or Wolff New Media hilarious and poignant. I recognised many of the types, and even more of the lines they used.All around this business there are people who are asking themselves the central question he poses (and getting depressed by the reply). Is the web media? Only partly. Is it communications? Only partly. But content is expensive, chat is cheap.In the 1720s, appalled by the explosion in the print media and the grim quality of most of what was being published, Alexander Pope wrote The Dunciad, denouncing all the Dunces - the incompetent poets and pamphleteers of the day. Wolff is like Pope - amazed and revolted by the birth of a new mass (communications) medium which has empowered the hucksters, shysters and illiterates of the world. In the eighteenth century the poets and the printers survived. And so did Pope."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"&quot;Burn Rate&quot; and Jerry Kaplan's &quot;Start Up&quot; are the two books I use to cover the comprehensive part of case study for my course: &quot;New Venture and Entreprenuership&quot;. It couldn't come out at a better time. The author offers his truthful and vivid view on all the accounts behind the scence including his own bad behavior. His tale is honest and sincere. One can really learn a great deal from this book. Even you are not a MBA student, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Michael Wolff has taught us an ultimate lesson: In order to succeed in a big way we have to be a big visionary first. He became a guru of text/graphic based Internet because he saw the edge from afar outside the net. Now what's next? According to the author of a brand-new book called &quot;Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality,&quot; our future hinges upon Virtual Reality as a network of coordinated five senses combined with teleoperation. The author calls it a &quot;new genesis&quot;. I believe that book is going to become 21st-Century's bible of electronic revolution."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Wolff's writing is honest, with a touch of satire and simultaneously educates us! Burn Rate is his factual account, of a writer turned businessman, that clearly puts in the reader exactly where he is, while travelling on his &quot;business trip through cyberspace&quot;. I don't see how anyone with street smarts wouldn't find the book candid and funny; would make a great independent filmwork and I hope Wolff plays himself in the movie version."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Wolff points out that the Internet business, like many others is full of fast-talk business artists while recounting the facts of his experiences with touch of humor. Wolff's account of the early internet days would bother only those that don't like the man behind the curtain for one reason or another--a great lesson for those ready to step into the arena of any business-- I bet his wife would make a great officer at any Fortune 500 company!"},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"Burn Rate does for the Internet what Liar's Poker did for Wall Street in the Eighties. It strips away the sheen of self-righteous assurance that most Net entrepreneurs wrap around themselves, and shows that there are, in fact, real, living breathing human beings involved in this business, not automatons who believe they've excised the baser instincts from their souls...Like several of the other reviewers here, I too have met many of the characters in Burn Rate, and I can tell you that Wolff's portraits of everyone I know hit the bullseye squarely in the center. If you want to laugh out loud and find out what it's _really_ like inside the Net industry, read this book."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This was a very funny and almost farcical story.

Since Wolff never get's beyond Television asumptions, he overlooks some of the most interesting things that Internet has to offer in Many to Many communication: the regular guy is just as accessable as the huge corporation.

I was wrong. I felt like the entire purpose of this book was to make others look worse than the writer, and thereby raise himself up in the process. It didn't work. The internet has only just begun, yes there were early days, but it's a fast growing medium that, unlike any other medium, the masses can control. There are big players, there are major corporations in the game, but people still have control over what they do. Arrogant editors and writers &amp; VCs miss the point. The medium is about people, community, tribal aspirations, connections, ideas, concepts or the simplest truth of them all.......the internet is a campfire, pure and simple enough for even this author to somehow have understood from the earliest days of his internet struggles. I enjoyed reading AOL.COM, had high hopes this book would be in that class, it was/is not."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"The book seems to spend more time on lampooning its curious cast of characters than actually explaining the Internet economy or how startups work. If you listen to Wolff too closely, you'll end up thinking that starting a company consists mainly in begging for money. I was pretty amazed at how consistently disgusting his reasoning is. He maligns everyone he comes in contact with for being greedy and stupid, but by the end of the book you can see that he is the best example of both. Somewhat interesting for its insight into how even successful startups are often going from day to day trying to figure out how to make payroll. In the end, though, I think a lot of books provide more insight while annoying less."},{"Title":"Burn Rate : How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the Internet","review":"This is not a good book. If you want to read everything about net businesses, then go ahead, but I learned about as much on IPOs in the net world from a 10-minute Business Week article on eloan, and most of the stuff about predicting where the net is going is his thinking from a few years ago and is outdated. The book jumped around a lot, and it is hard to stay interested."},{"Title":"The Natural History Museum Book of Dinosaurs","review":"Tim Gardom with Angela Milner as Scientific Adviser have included comprehensive data that is known about dinosaurs. The pictures of real fossil skeletons, drawings, and even escavation sites are very interesting and informative. I like how he has arranged the book into categories (8 in all) and then followed up with an appendix, glossary, further reading, and a complete index of this book. He gives an in-depth history of fossil discoveries, while giving explanations from different cultural viewpoints about the bones and what kind of animals they might be. I can see how the Chinese came up with the dragon idea! Our grandchildren love all books about dinosaurs, but they really like this one. I found in my research that it is recommended by a paleontologist as a definite library selection for middle to high school budding paleontologists. If a person in the career of paleontologist likes the book, I think it is a must have! Thanks for this opportunity to review the awesome book!"},{"Title":"He Chose Twelve","review":"How strange it is that most of us, and I do include myself, can name more of Santa's reindeer than disciples of Jesus. Peter, James, and John we all know; there's the doubting Thomas; Matthew, Andrew, and Philip will come to the minds of those familiar with the New Testament; Judas Iscariot - of course - lives forever in infamy. But what of the others: Simon the Zealot; James the Less; Judas \\"the thrice-named\\" (whom Mark called Thaddaeus, Matthew called Lebbaeus Thaddaeus, and Luke called Judas of James); Bartholomew; and Matthias (who replaced Judas Iscariot)? It must of course be acknowledged that, in the case of a few of these men, the Bible tells us nothing about them apart from their names. In this study of the men chosen by Jesus to be his disciples, Clarence E. MacArtney endeavors to describe all of these men (as well as James the brother of Jesus, Paul, and John the Baptist); perhaps more importantly, though, he tries to show us valuable lessons that each of them can teach us still today.The more famous of the disciples naturally get a longer treatment in these pages. None is so well known as Peter; not only are his words and deeds told throughout the Gospels, Acts, and Peter's own letters, his nature is revealed for all to see in his behavior. MacArtney calls him the most human of the disciples, a natural leader, whose faults and inconsistencies make him the disciple that man can identify with most easily. He could be rash and impatient, but the Godly zeal that manifested itself within his heart is a model for the kind of religious ardor all of Christ's followers should feel. The story of Peter's fall and his deep repentance has, MacArtney argues, won more hearts to Christ than the scholarly, loving words of Paul.James and John, the sons of Zebedee, along with Peter, made up an inner core of Christ's followers. They, also like Peter, could be rash and lash out with religious fury - to call upon Jesus to smite the Samaritans who refused Him hospitality, for example. It was also they who asked Jesus for seats of honor in the coming kingdom, to the consternation of some of their peers. The zeal these brothers showed was misdirected at times, but such zeal is a far better thing than indifference, MacArtney states. Among the disciples, John was known as the most loved of Jesus and may have been the youngest of the group. James would become the first of the disciples to die (not counting Judas Iscariot), put to death by Herod Agrippas less than two decades after Christ's ascension.MacArtney praises Andrew, for always bringing others to Jesus, starting with his own brother Peter. The author actually makes Andrew the subject of his first chapter, stressing the fact that the church needs more Andrews in its midst. Philip merits the same sort of praise; it was he who uttered the familiar words \\"Come and see,\\" when he told Bartholomew (whom the Gospel of John identifies as Nathaniel) that he had met the Messiah. Bartholomew, for his part, is the only disciple to hesitate upon hearing Jesus' call, asking the famous question as to whether anything good could come from Nazareth. Yet Bartholomew quickly recognized Jesus as the Son of God after speaking with Him, and his name has been associated with sincerity ever since. Thomas is known as the doubter, having refused to believe that Jesus had been resurrected disciples until he could see and feel the Man and His wounds for himself. Thereafter, he became the chief defender of the reality of the Resurrection. Some consider Thomas a rationalist, but MacArtney points out that Thomas' disbelief was born strictly of sorrow at the loss of Jesus.Judas the thrice-named asked Jesus why He did not show Himself in His full glory to the world - MacArtney makes a lesson of such impatience among the followers of Christ today. James the Less, Simon the Zealot, Matthew the tax collector, and Matthias show the diverse nature of the men chosen by Jesus as His disciples. MacArtney shows how everyone can identify with someone among the Twelve and how the Kingdom of God has a place for every sort of man and woman.Judas Iscariot needs no introduction. MacArtney spends most of this section addressing Judas' crime and crushing guilt, taking the time to argue against the ideas of some that Judas was not as traitorous as many seem to think, pointing to the visible elements of greed, vindictiveness, and thirst for revenge in his nature as revealed in the Gospels.Extending his study to John the Baptist, James the brother of Jesus, and Paul, MacArtney manages to offer an enlightening look at the lives of all the most prominent servants of Christ identified in the New Testament. He points us to the different backgrounds and natures of these men, offering Christians important models to follow in their own lives. By bettering our understanding of these men, we also better our understanding of Jesus."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"vi (visual) is probably one of the most flexible editors (notice it is an editor not a word processor) that one can use. There are several ways to accomplish the same common tasks. There are so many ways in fact that most people learn just a subset of commands and string them together to do their editing instead of learning the more exotic commands.The advantage of an editor besides speed and simplicity is that you will not inadvertently place visually hidden code in the program as you can easily do with a word processor.People got so used to this editor on dos based environments. You can still use the command line editor after the colon at the foot of the screen. When you find and use the abilities of vi you will wonder what you did without it.This book is a great starting place and you may never need another.The Topics include:- Basic editing- Moving around in a hurry- Beyond the basics- Greater power with ex- Global search and replacement- Customizing vi and ex- Command shortcuts- Introduction to vi clones' extensions- The nvi, elvis, vim, and vile editors- Summary of vi and ex commands- Vi and the internetThe examples are quite clear and plentiful."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"I first got \\"introduced\\" to vi in the late 1980s and I've never wavered in my support of this sometimes-maligned text editor. However, it wasn't until I read this book, that I realized how powerful an editor it was and how many fun things you can do with it!Besides describing in much detail vi's various commands, there are also chapters on vi's companion, ex. ex has a large number of its own commands that can be used in conjunction with vi while working on text files.There are also chapters on various vi clones (vim, nvm, elvis, and vile - certainly interesting names on their own) and their features. The last part of the book features reference information on vi (commands, online resources, and a troubleshooting section) and ex.If you love vi and aren't ashamed to admit it like myself, this book is a great place to learn more."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"I bought this book hoping to find new tricks and solutions to common tasks in vi. I started with UNIX only three months ago and I have to admit that a book like this one is very important to anyone serious about the UNIX system. If you want to rely only on the X-Window system, you can forget about learning vi, but then you would be thinking in the PC-DOS user way."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"I wish I had bought this book before I attempted my first vi edit. This reference removes all the frustration from what I used to consider a cumbersome editor. Pry it from my cold, dead fingies!"},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"O'Reilly's _Learning_The_Vi_Editor_ is a very useful resource that can provide tips and tricks for Vi users of all levels.

As emacs is not available everywhere, I feel that it might be in one's best interest to learn a little about the vi editor. Under 200 pages, it is much easier to digest than most other texts, yet this book covers just about everything! It has proven to be such an excellent tutorial that I do not really use the comprehensive appendices in the back of the book. The reading/learning process went very quickly, leaving me with plenty of time to take a look at all those regular expressions..."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"This book got me through vi in such an incredibly short time, I couldn't believe it. Now I have broken free from the boundaries of pico and the bloat of emacs, thanks to Ms. Lamb. I have yet to get my hands on an O'Reilly book that wasn't excellent. This book continues that tradition!"},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"Like a lot of other systems administrators I use emacs because it's fast, easy and extensible. However emacs is not standard with many UNIX variants, vi is. This book will allow you to get the most out of vi, and will make using vi, for those times when you absolutely have to, a much less hateful and far more productive experience."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"If your operating system is down, you don't have access to the \\"fancier\\" editors available that actually have interfaces that make sense to normal people. At this moment, particularly if you are in a system administrator position, you must know vi in order to access and modify files. It is so easy to pick up vi the wrong way - usually by word of mouth from someone who has learned vi the wrong way too. This book is the best I've found that is dedicated to properly teaching you the features of the vi editor and how to use them. O'Reilly has experimented with several book formats over the last ten years. This book is what I like to call \\"classic O'Reilly\\". It is the same format that most of their other books on Unix tools are generally written in, and if you have their books on sed and awk or Unix Power Tools, you know what I'm talking about.If you have learned the wrong way, or if you are a bonified beginner, start at the beginning of part one. Don't skip anything. Even if you think you already know something, at least read through the section to make sure you know the best way of doing it. By the end of the first seven chapters you should be a pretty skilled user of vi. The book makes frequent use of practice exercises, answers common questions, and gives advice on what to do when you encounter common problems. By the time you finish you'll even be writing ex scripts and modifying C/C++ code in the vi editor without accidentally inserting all kinds of control characters that will drive programmers crazy once \\"the real editor\\" is back on line.Part two starts at chapter eight and concerns itself with all of the various extensions to vi that are available via the four most popular vi clones available when this book was published. You do get some enhancements such as multi-window editing and even GUI interfaces by using them, but the cost is an increase in the confusion factor that this book tries to clear up as much as possible. If you are not planning on using a vi clone, you may want to just file this section of the book away in case the subject ever comes up.Part 3 consists of several useful appendices. Four of the appendices are still useful, but the fifth, on vi and the Internet, is a bit dated. I highly recommend this book if the vi editor is in your future, and if you have system administrator duties, believe me it is. You might also want to invest in the very handy \\"vi Editor Pocket Reference\\" by the same author. I have mixed feelings about that one. Everything is there in a concise format, but until you get used to it, information can be hard to find."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"It made my job a lot easier!!!"},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"The 6th edition of this book is excellent! For the novice, it is very readable, and is able to bring a user up to speed quickly with simple, solid coverage of the basics.It is also an excellent resource for the more advanced users, with good informative coverage of advanced editting techniques w/vi. The section on the various clones is also well done.If you get this book, it is worth getting the little vi Editor Pocket Reference book, too, because its small size (~ 7&quot; x 4&quot; &amp; 72 pages), makes it a convenient and easy to use reference book. I keep one of these little guys by the home linux machine, and another one at the office, too."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"Vi is a powerful yet difficult editor to learn in the beginning. Although there is an abundance of references on the web, it is very difficult to learn the editor effectively without a book. Even more difficult to learn is the advanced features of the editor. The book has definitely made the learning process as painless as possible. The chapters are arranged in such a way that the reader can learn the editor incrementally without being fed too much information at once. At the end of each chapter there is a reference so the reader can refresh what he/she has learned in the chapter. (This also makes the book a very good reference.) What I like most about the book is in Part II of the book: &quot;Extensions and Clones.&quot; The book first gives a summary of all the common USEFUL features of the clonse. Then, in subsequent chapters, the author shows how to use the features in each of the clones. This has made my life much easier because I can look up what I need and then go to the particular chapter (in my case, vim) for the information in the sub-chapter."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"This book covers all the trick and traps to the Vi editor.

The power of vi is revealing in this easy to use and well structured reference and learning aid.Impress your friends with some of the little known and used features and functions. The authio Linda Lamb certainly knows her way around the editor so pay careful attention to the examples she uses to illustrate functions. Many of these can be used almost as-is in your daily work.I suppose with all the latest WYSWYG word processors vi seems a little dated, but using vi I can create, edit, copy and manipulate documents in a fraction of the time others can by clicking and drilling in a windowed application.I love vi. It's the raw power thats addicting. Yeah sometimes you can really screw the pooch with a typo but generally vi is fairly forgiving. I should know, my typing stinks but vi is generally kind to me when I mess up.I rated this book highly in spite of I would have liked a few more examples, but the examples Lamb included are very representative of what you as a user may need and actually use.This is a typical O'Reilly book - excellent and a worthy addition to any serious compter professionals library.Hey I just heard that vi is available even to Windows lamers.Try it folks, give your mouse finger a badly needed rest.

The Chevy may have better seats and A/C, but when you touch that gas pedal you'll be hooked."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"I had made a couple of attempts to learn vi before, and I just didn't get it. This book made it fairly easy, and introduced me to the power and speed of vi. It lets you get started quickly, with an extremely clean, organized presentation. After a short time using vi I'm convinced that emacs is much more difficult to use properly than vi, and that windows-like editors may be simple to use but they are crippled compared to the functionality of vi. If you use a text editor more than once or twice a week do yourself a favor and learn vi. If you use different unix / linux systems you are almost compelled to learn vi since it is the only editor that's always available. This book also covers vi variants, such as the superb vim."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"O'Reilly &amp; Associates, well-known for quality computer references, have once again done a superb job with this manual for vi. This Unix text editor can often be intimidating for those who haven't been exposed to it, but once a bit of time is spent with vi, it becomes second-nature. This book greatly helps in that endeavor.Using this book, in conjunction with making vi my default PINE editor (thereby forcing me to become fluent with it, lest my email use become rather slow and awkward,) provided a huge speed boost in learning the vi editor. Vi is very powerful, and is almost always included on every unmodified Unix install. These items, coupled with the fact that vi doesn't automatically insert line breaks (like pico does) make it one of the most-preferred text editors amongst Unix sys-admins.Not only does _Learning the vi Editor_ cover the essentials, but moves beyond basic editing functions into more powerful features, such as global searches &amp; replacements, customizing the editor, &quot;moving around in a hurry,&quot; command combinations, and other advanced vi features. For even better results in using vi, pick up a copy of O'Reilly's _sed &amp; awk_, though it's not necessary for effective vi use._Learning the vi Editor_ is written in a friendly, casual voice, and Linda Lamb provides what your input and output will look like for most commands, interspersed with comments that put the reader at ease, such as &quot;Qute forboding, isn't it?&quot; followed by reasons not to be intimidated.This book will help just about anyone conquer the mighty vi tool, and will help prove vi's superiority over any other Unix text editor. (Ahem - no offense to the emacs gurus out there.)"},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"It's often said that there are very few quality computer books in the world, but this is most definitely one of them.If you've never used the vi editor before, this book is for you and if you've been using it for years, this book is also for you.The book is organized so that the reader can start at an introductory level in the first couple of chapters and learn how to use the editor. Then as the user gets comfortable, they can go back and read the next couple of chapters and learn a great deal more. I've done this several times over several years, and my editing abilities STILL increase dramatically afterwards.The book also goes into good detail regarding the vi clones in later chapters. I personally use gvim and found the section with specifics on vim to be of great help.The bottom line? The book is extremely well organized and absolutely thorough in covering the topic. The book was written in 1998 and the information is still up to date. And given the fact that it's a computer book costing less than 30 dollars, the actual *value* of the book deserves 10 stars!"},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"vi has a well-deserved reputation as being one of the least friendly editors in the UNIX world. This book, however, makes vi relatively painless to use, even for those accustomed to GUIs. Nowadays vi tends to be used mostly for quick editing of configuration scripts and the expansive amount of detail here is not likely to be that useful to people except those who plan to use vi almost exclusively. If you follow the examples, and practive using vi while reading this book, however, you will find that it does cover all the basics well and that you will feel quite at home with this much-maligned text editor. Most of this information is available freely on the net, but it not collected in one place in such an orderly fashion as this.

Where I work, there are many different flavors of UNIX and the only common editor that is on them is vi. So I began using vi referring to the commands listed in the UNIX in a Nutshell book. I was lost. I never understood why anyone would use this editor.This book starts at the very beginning. It assumes no prior knowledge of vi or any other editor yet the beginning is very concise so you don't feel like you're wasting time which is a nice balance. You can quickly move through the chapters and you notice that not only can you work with vi, its actually very nice to never have to use the mouse or press some complicated key sequence to get what you need done. After the first few chapters, you can probably perform 90% of the tasks you need to perform. If you make it past Chapter 7, you are a vi guru. Now, I use vi whenever I can. I even have a bash shell for Windows that has vi and that is basically what I use for most editing. I would recommend this book to anyone, mainly of course those who work in the UNIX environment, that has to do text editing.

When it comes to speed, file loading is quick, saving is quick, searching is quick, scrolling is quick - everything is quick with this guy!Everything but... learning.

This could have been the situation *before* the amazing \\"Learning the vi Editor\\" by Lamb & Robbins existed - but now, when the book reaches the 6th edition, there's no excuse.As \\"Learning the vi Editor\\" nicely explains, vi is a layer on top of the ex editor. Ex is a so-called \\"line-editor\\", used to edit files in a line-oriented manner. The two modes of vi are nothing else than an expression of this duality. In the so-called 'edit mode', ex is in control. In the so-called 'command mode', vi-proper is in control while redirecting the ':' commands to the underlying ex. Simple, isn't it?The book exposes this philosophy behind vi with clarity, rigor and friendliness. Once you read this book you realize that, in fact, vi is a simple and perfectly logical editor. It has simple command sintax, simple command semantics and simple command composition rules.************************************************************All this information - and much more - can be found in the first part of \\"Learning the vi Editor\\". The second part is dedicated to various vi clones. Here the reader has the liberty to choose depending on which clone he/she feels most comfortable with.Books which remove confusion and bring light to seemingly arcane areas are rare. \\"Learning the vi Editor\\" by Lamb & Robbins is one of them."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"This book is a great intro to vi for beginners and is an excellent desktop reference for people to keep handy. I keep it handy because I cannot always remember that obscure command that will rearrange my document with little effort."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"I have used this book at my workplace for some time, and it is an excellent book. A must for any serious VI users.

The book is easy to follow and you can cover the material in a day. I do wish there were more examples of advanced pattern matching...a few examples were given, but that topic was glossed over too quickly. This book is much more thorough than the vi section of the UNIX in a Nutshell book."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"When you see someone that knows what they are doing writing with vi you will be amazed. Get a taste of it yourself and you will be hooked.vi is powerful beyond belief and honestly I had been using it for years before I got this wonderful book from O'Reilly. The power of vi is revealing in this easy to use and well structured reference and learning aid.Impress your friends with some of the little known and used features and functions. The authio Linda Lamb certainly knows her way around the editor so pay careful attention to the examples she uses to illustrate functions. Many of these can be used almost as-is in your daily work.I suppose with all the latest WYSWYG word processors vi seems a little dated, but using vi I can create, edit, copy and manipulate documents in a fraction of the time others can by clicking and drilling in a windowed application.I love vi. It's the raw power thats addicting. Yeah sometimes you can really screw the pooch with a typo but generally vi is fairly forgiving. I should know, my typing stinks but vi is generally kind to me when I mess up.I rated this book highly in spite of I would have liked a few more examples, but the examples Lamb included are very representative of what you as a user may need and actually use.This is a typical O'Reilly book - excellent and a worthy addition to any serious compter professionals library.Hey I just heard that vi is available even to Windows lamers.Try it guys. Going to vi is like getting out of Chevy Impala into an Indy car. The Chevy may have better seats and A/C, but when you touch that gas pedal you'll be hooked."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"Although this is the 6th edition of this book, while I was reading it, I still felt like I was reading the first edition, due to the clunky prose and the treatment of the material.I know the authors feel compelled to write a book that describes the features of vi that are common on all platforms, but they end up producing a manual that appeals to the lowest common denominator. If you are still editing files on an old Unix machine using minicom and a dial-up link, this book is just right for you. If you are a modern vi user, trying to edit a large Linux project and need to learn some of the more powerful features of vim, you may be better off asking the office vi guru.The community at large would be better served by a book dedicated to vim that does not have the problems of \\"Vi iMproved (VIM)\\" by Steve Oualline."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"For most people on the planet VI makes about as much sense as brain surgery, possible less!This wonderful reference book allows the beginner to jump in and start using the powerful VI editor.This book has made the process of understanding and learning VI simple with its concise and clear writing.The chapters are arrange so that you get the basic commands early and only get the more advanced commands as you move further into the book.Each chapter ends with a review of the material presented and this makes for a great reference of the commands.All in all this is a must have book for anyone that uses the VI editor."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"Inspite of &quot;user-friendly&quot; editors like pico (which is for kids), and emacs (which has useless features for most users), vi is simple and easy to use, once you learn the basics.

The language is clear and the exercises are practical."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"I have been using vi/vim for about six years, but had never gotten to the next level. This was mainly because I had kept my usage limited to a small subset of vi (which is even smaller for vim). And it's not just me - I have seen many people who use vi this way. The other reason is the fact that vi has a steep learning curve. And even when you learn something new, you have to use it often, as otherwise there is a good chance that you will forget it. I knew how powerful vi can be as a text editor, but somehow never used it to its full potential. Sometimes I used to search on the internet for vi/vim tips and stuff, and finally realized that all this learning will be much more effective if I have a book that has all the information in one place. I guess most people will think twice before buying a book on a text editor (at least, I did), whereas they won't hesitate if it was a book on a programming language. But an editor like vi, which is quite difficult to master, does need a book. Once you learn it, you will be amazed to see how powerful it is.About the book, it is perhaps the best resource for someone at the beginner/intermediate level to learn about vi. There are not many books around on the subject, but this book does a great job. It is divided into two parts. The first part teaches vi and the second part talks about a few vi clones (including vim). The book (especially the first part) is organized in a very nice way. Things are presented in a certain order. Each chapter/section builds on the previous chapter/section. The second part deals with different clones of vi, like nvi, elvis, vim and vile. Of these, I use only vim, which is basically is superset of vi. The chapter on vim does a good job of discussing the essential features of vim in some details, although its not complete by any means. With vim having such a huge number of features, it demands a separate book for itself.All in all, this is a great book. It is a worthwhile investment to make. You will end up doing things in minimum time and with just a few keystrokes. As another reviewer has said, vi is addicting. Use it and you will see for yourself!"},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"If you're going to spend a significant part of your LIFE, editing text files, wouldn't it be worthwhile to get GOOD at it & learn a powerful tool that's been carefully adapted to the job...I have only a couple points to add, about the book. Although it gets you up-to-speed quickly, you must diligently read the first half (the second half of the book details most of the common vi clones) & PRACTICE everything you learn, if you're to truly unleash the power of this well-crafted tool of our trade. vi's power comes from the ability to combine various parts of its rich command-set, to concisely and naturally describe just about any editing operation you wish to perform. For this reason, complete fluency, with the majority of the commands, is very important - and that's where this book shines."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"This book is well written and laid out. Whether or not you are a beginner or advanced user coming to vi, this is a valuable tool for getting the most out of vi.vi is by no means an easy or intuitive editor, but with a little practice, it can greatly improve your efficiency. The book does a great job of taking you through a logical progression of how to start using the product.Also, the support for the derivatives of vi is a huge plus.

The book is well laid out and well written.There are, however, two things I think would make this good book even better: (1) step-by-step examples of some of the more complex vi techniques and (2) some on-line example files available from the O'Reilly Web site. On-line example files are employed to advantage by other O'Reilly books (O'Reilly's &quot;sed &amp; awk&quot; comes immediately to mind). Providing some hands-on example files to work with would definitely help anyone using this book to learn the vi editor.Having said that, this book in its current form will teach you more than enough to use vi effectively. For those who are just starting to use vi to do real work, I'd also recommend acquiring the companion &quot;vi Editor Pocket Reference.&quot;"},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"This book is the reference for those wanting to understand the mysteries of Vi. Almost all Unix based systems typically have a variant of the Vi editor installed, even when the system is in a limited use state, therefore an understanding of this no-nonsense editor is crucial if you want to administer or recover your system. This makes the Vi the editor to know, and this book guides you through the basics to more advanced \\"tricks\\" used by the guru's.

The power and speed of VI can be hidden behind its obscure user interface, but once you understand it you will never want to use another editor. The detachable quick reference card included in the back of the book is really nice to have. The coverage of VIs features is pretty thorough, even VI experts will be able to learn a thing or two from this well written book."},{"Title":"Learning the vi Editor (6th Edition)","review":"I knew little about VI before reading this book, but I now i feel very comfortable using it. I like the layout and the fact that it has references and summaries all over the book. This is a book you will most likely use again and again.

Lopez is able to describe what I see."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Funny that a book about the Arctic would be on my &quot;Desert Island&quot; list, but this is one of the most effecting things I've read in my life. It's one thing to write a book about a region that explains it to the reader. It's quite another thing to write a book about a region that truly makes you feel as if you are there, that you understand it, that you &quot;get it&quot;. The Eskimos have something like 25 words for snow. They can draw incredibly detailed maps of coastlines, from memory. On and on, the people and places are introduced to you, like visitors to your home, and you really begin to understand what it is to live in such a cold, beautiful place. The story of one Eskimo hunter will never leave me: he was hunting, and somehow became stranded on a broken off piece of ice. It floated away, with him on it, into the mist. All he had was his knife, made of bone. His friends searched for him, to no avail, and he was given up for dead. But he came back, years later, in a kayak he'd made, fully outfitted with warm clothes he'd also made, fat and happy and completely in tune with his environment, absolutely as at home there as the polar bear. He could make everything he needed, just from what this supposedly &quot;barren&quot; wasteland provided. That may not sound like much, but put yourself in his shoes (or mukluks) and you'll begin to feel the cold and the quiet close in around you.That's what this book does for you. It puts you there."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"&quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; was recommended to me by a friend before I went on an Alaskan adventure a few years ago. This book expanded my vision of nature, and turned me on to the exquisite writing of Barry Lopez, who won the 1986 National Book Award for this classic work on the wild regions of the far north. &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; is an extraordinary celebration of Arctic life and landscape which takes the reader on a journey to places rarely visited by man. Lopez' narrative does have a dreamlike quality, not only in its descriptions of nature at its most surreal, but in the absolute beauty of the writing itself. He does indeed capture the foreign reality of Arctic life, and death, with the loving care of an artist who places each brushstroke carefully on a canvas, bent on bringing the vision before him to others.Mr. Lopez made a number of extended trips to Siberia, Greenland, and northern Canada, including Baffin Island, to observe the flora and fauna of the region - polar bears, killer whales, caribou, narwhals - as well as the spectacular Arctic landscape. He experienced eerie encounters with the aurora borealis, massive migrating icebergs, solar and lunar light, halos and coronas. And he experienced both the potential for catastrophic danger and the remarkable beauty that the Arctic land and sea offers. &quot;Spring storms can sweep hundreds of thousands of helpless infant harp seals into the sea&quot; - juxtaposed with, &quot;A tiny flower blooms in a field of snow touched by the sun's benevolent light.&quot; Through Mr. Lopez' eyes the breathtaking experience of the Arctic landscape and the people who inhabit it become palpably real. I was particularly moved by his intimate and compassionate descriptions of the indigenous people of this region, who so aptly illustrate how mankind is capable of living in harmony with his surroundings. Lopez' prose and his conclusions make the strongest argument possible to work for the ecological health of our planet, for the sake of life itself, and for the health of our imagination and sense of wonder at the magnificent.As mankind grows closer to conquering the earth's last frontiers, the issue of exploitation and encroachment becomes greater. For anyone who advocates preserving the few remaining wild areas on our planet, &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; is a welcome gift and a source of motivation. It also provides an extraordinary read, and, perhaps, an awakening to those who have shown little interest in earth's most mysterious places.This is a magical book that will enchant and awe the reader. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Bravo, Barry Lopez!JANA"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Of all the books I've read on the artcic and antarctic, this stands out for its absolute precision of description. To see a landscape with Lopez' eyes, you would have to spend a lot of time looking, and absorbing what you saw, until you knew every inch of it with your eyes shut. So it's appropriate that when he describes things, the descriptions take time to write, they are precise, and thorough, and need to be read slowly. Any less would not convey the strangeness and unfamiliarity of the place. Lopez reminded me that many times, a day's aimless wandering about, just thinking about what you see, has as great a value as a day seeing the sights.My edition has no photos, which is appropriate as the verbal description is superb. If you read this book, keep the internet handy, to use search engines to find photos of the places he and things he writes about. It's like having a limitless dictionary to hand, and with subject matter as unfamiliar as this, it helps tremendously. One could say that the book was 25 years ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This is not just a great book about the Artic, but a handbook for how to move through and observe wilderness and areas of unspoiled natural beauty. Lopez knows more about the interdependence of the human and natural worlds than any other writer I know."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"An account of the American Arctic based on the author's own travels and a survey of the biology, ecology and history of the region. There is a tree-hugging, save-the-endangered-species,motif. (Don't get me wrong -I love trees and whales and things). He is rather solemn and philosophical with a lot of fine writing about the wonders of nature lifting us above the mundane. Sometimes he falls into the traps of fine writing, such as impressive long lists of plants, birds and animals, and misuse of words such as \\"mesic\\" and \\"adumbrate\\". It is a mine of information which I suppose is mostly accurate although I hadn't heard before that Walsingham was a duke or that Vitus Bering was a Dutchman.I had mixed feelings aout his attiude towards the Eskimos. His account idealizes the nomadic hunting existence and it is sometimes unclear whether he is talking about present-day Inuit or drawing upon older accounts. He only once mentions alcohol as a problem and does not mention disputes with other native Americans, even when desribing Hearne's travels.The description is largely limited to America and the bibliography has no Russian sources. He often uses Inuit words but his review of Arctic prehistory draws only on archeological evidence and is weak on linguistics and says nothing about the Chukchi language and Asian-American language links. DNA and blood groups are not mentioned.I wouldn't make all those niggling criticisms about what got left out if the book did not set itself a high standard of comprehensiveness. It's virtually a one volume encyclopedia of the Arctic full of fascinating facts, vivid firsthand accounts, and splendid writing.By the way, one arctic question's been bugging me since I was ten years old (the teacher didn't know the answer then and Lopez doesn't have it). What time is it at the North Pole?"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"It's been some years ago now that I read Arctic Dreams. I found Lopez's writing powerful and gripping; I had to read more of his work and soon did. His use of the desert as a metaphor for the arctic brought to mind not only human desire to experience and transform landscapes, but also the sense of mystery that we attach to the environment--mystery that compels us to make known the unknown, whether through myth or exploration, and mystery that drives us to wax nostalgic when those landscapes are already comprehended and inexorably altered. Before the U.S. Civil War, some maps showed the Great Plains as the &quot;Great American Desert.&quot; Within a decade, that land and its peoples had been transfigured in popular imaginations from a mythology of mystery to one of discovery and settlement. There is much to be gained from Lopez's deeply personal engagement with the Arctic and the ways his experience informs his elucidation of others' attempts, successful and not, to imagine, discover, conquer, and finally yield to this austere geography. In doing so, Lopez manages not to lose track of the sense of wonder and myth that nearly wells up from the landscape itself."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Arctic Dreams is an extraordinary book, immediately a classic work of its genre, environmental nonfiction. Chapters focus on muskoxen, polar bears, narwhal, the migration of birds and of caribou, the otherworldly temporal states and unusual lighting and light-bending phenomenon of the northern polar regions, the mental and perceptual states of the northland's human residents and visitors, and the history of European and American/Canadian exploration, and exploitation, of the arctic. Lopez examines the artic with a careful and attentive eye, recognizing its subtleties and mysteries and not demanding that they be reduced to something that the reader will feel he has brought fully within his or her understanding. The writing is appropriate to the subject in view; alert, unhurried, and deliberate.\\"One of our long-lived cultural differences with the Eskimo has been over whether to accept the land as it is or to exert the will to change it into something else. The great task of life for the traditional Eskimo is still to achieve congruence with a reality that is already given. The given reality, the real landscape, is 'horror within magnificence, absurdity within intelligibility, suffering within joy,' in the words of Albert Schweitzer. We do not esteem as highly these lessons in paradox. We hold in higher regard the land's tractability, its alterability. We believe the conditions of the earth can be changed to ensure human happiness, to provide jobs and to create material wealth and ease. Each culture, then, finds a different sort of apotheosis, of epiphany, and comfort in the land.\\" (from the epilogue)On page 406 of my 1986 edition, Lopez writes, \\"The European culture from which the ancestors of many of us came has yet to . . . understand the wisdom, preserved in North America, that lies in the richness and sanctity of a wild landscape, what it can mean in the unfolding of human life, the staying of a troubled human spirit.\\" If there is a 'short list' of great environmental nonfiction, this book is on it."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I especially liked his account of polar bears, harp seals and whales and their intermingling relationships. His description of how he perceived his surroundings made me feel as if I was there! In fact, it made me book a 10-day trip to Alaska in order to escape the stresses of city-living for a while! I was somewhat surprised by the chapter on Eskimos and a thorough discussion of their origin since I had expected this book to be a travelogue at best. Of course, it is much more. The chapter on Ice and Light, for instance, is outstanding and has probably the best description I have read on the Northern Lights (or Aurora Borealis)!!!"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Barry Lopez probably does not think of himself as a salesman but his book, &quot;Artic Dreams: Imagination &amp; Desire in a Northern Landscape&quot; sold me on the artic.

He makes us all realize what a treasure this last frontier is, and how vital it is that we preserve it."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This is my first book by Barry Lopez, but it won't be my last. Before reading Arctic Dreams I thought I had some sort of a clue about what the Arctic was like: land of the midnight sun, aurora borealis, tundra and permafrost, long dark winters. Over 400 pages later I have a lot more information, and I now understand that I don't really have a clue. The history, archeology, cultures, ecosystems, land and ice forms are all much more complex than most are likely to imagine.Ice itself is infinitely complex. There are various kinds of sea ice, glacial ice, ice lenses in the soil, frozen soil, land ice, ice that forms shelves between land and sea. The ice changes in physical properties depending on the salt content of the water, how long it has been frozen, and many other factors that all affect the plants, animals, and people that are part of the arctic landscape. The arctic food chain actually depends on ice. Of this food chain Lopez states \\"The algae at the bottom of this food web are called \\"epontic\\" algae, the algae of the sea ice.\\" He goes on to say that, \\"It is the ice . . . that holds this life together.\\"While Lopez does not make a strong case for the effects that the arctic food chain has on the entire planet, it does not take a great leap to come to this understanding. Most animals that depend on the arctic are transitory visitors. They spend spring and summer feasting on pollen, insects, algae, or other creatures that live on these seasonal resources. They may depend on this bounty for nesting and raising young, or in other cases they may use the arctic as a feeding station for long migrations. These migrating animals tie the arctic food web to the landscapes and food chains that many of us inhabit and depend on. The nutrients that are produced by the algae living on sea ice make their way around the world in the movements of animals and ocean currents. Lopez doesn't dwell on climate change or the melting of the arctic. However, this seems to be a something we should all be concerned about.Anyone who is interested in understanding the planet, and our history as social and political creatures, will appreciate this book. I found some of the information I have been introduced to in other books strengthened and deepened with this reading. In \\"Collapse, How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" the author, Jared Diamond, discusses our ability to change and adapt as key to our survival. This is also reflected in Arctic Dreams, where Lopez discusses the failure of Arctic explorers to adapt and learn from Native people. The result of this failure to change resulted in repeated large scale tragedies--with hundreds of men lost, frostbitten, suffering from starvation, and sometimes even cannibalism.*Lopez also explores ground relating to the history of the \\"discovery\\" of the Western Hemisphere. I first read about Europeans fishing along Eastern North America's coast line before North America's \\"discovery\\" in \\"Cape Cod,\\" by Henry David Thoreau. Lopez covers this subject, and may even use the same documentation as Thoreau. However, he lingers longer and deepens our understanding. The ice crystals in the northern atmosphere, at times, create reflections of land masses that are below the horizon. During these events, land that is normally beyond our view becomes visible. Northern mariners, of all nationalities, have utilized these phenomena to find \\"new\\" land and fishing grounds. Lopez also explains that only the European elite class was considered capable of making \\"discoveries.\\" Peasant fisherman, wanderers, or early settlers were expected to get out of the way so the elite could have their way--some things just don't seem to change. **Arctic Dreams is beautiful written. The prose sings, illuminates, and educates. We are treated to first hand stories about musk ox and polar bear, as well as the results of scientific studies that look into these and other arctic creatures. The arctic is reflected back to us from indigenous inhabitants, explorers, and those who plunder resources. The collision between these forces has a huge bearing on the arctic, and perhaps, on all of us.\\"Arctic Dreams, Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape,\\" by Barry Lopez, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1986~~~~~~* When you're ready to change--both for yourself and the planet--see my book \\"Food Security & Sustainability for the Times Ahead\\".** You will find reviews of \\"Collapse\\" and \\"Cape Cod\\" in my Facebook notes as well as on Amazon.com.~~~~~Note to Native readers: Barry Lopez calls all far north indigenous people \\"Eskimos.\\" I thought this was a little odd, until I read the end notes (after I had read the rest of the text). In these notes he explains that the people do not like to be called Eskimos. I was a little horrified that he knew better, yet chose to promote this term. He knew the people--with whom he camped, ate, and hunted, and that he also called \\"friend\\"--would be offended. I do highly recommend this book, just keep in mind that the author considers himself white, and it shows.~~~~~For permission to post or publish outside Facebook or Amazon.com please contact me at: harvest95546@yahoo.com All my reviews are available--with permission--to post or publish on other sites or in print based publications."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I'm not sure just where the desire comes in here unless it's to promote or develop the reader's desire to see the Arctic for her- himself, but the imagination is the reader's. It's challenged and quickened. This book is an experience.Have you ever played the parlor game where you're supposed to tell which animal you'd prefer to be reincarnated as, and why? I'd never come up with a satisfactory animal, but I'd never thought of the Polar bear.I'd like to be a Polar bear. Their winter dens sound lovely and I can imagine cradling a cub in my arms, leaning back against an ice floe and gazing off across the Arctic Sea. I'd love wearing the translucent white fur coat. (I wouldn't want to deprive an animal of one, but I'd love to grow my own.) Swimming has always been a favorite activity of mine, too, and with the fur coat I don't suppose I'd mind the ice water!It's an amazing thing to empathize with an animal!Lopez's descriptions of the arctic ice and seasons, the people, the history and cultures, all are enchanting. It's a wonderfully magical world, so different from the lands and peoples of the rest of the world. Lopez carves that world into our imaginations as skillfully as the ice sculptor renders his tools.Summer is the perfect time to read this one; especially one of the hottest summers on record!"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This book is a lyrical reflection on the oneness of nature and mankind's troubled relationship with it. It is recommended for anyone contemplating a journey to the higher latitudes. However, as a history of arctic exploration it is sadly flawed. The two chapters on early journeys of discovery and the quest for the northwest passage are chronologically jumbled. Furthermore, the inexplicable and virtually complete neglect of Amundson - including his learning from Eskimos - leaves one wondering what other omissions may have tilted the balance of Lopez's otherwise thought-provoking writing."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Some passages in this book are beautifully written. I will agree there's not much of an arc to the whole thing and if you wanted to you could skip about the middle third and not miss much other than some encyclopedic goings on.The author also feels the need to mystify \\"Eskimos.\\" I understand he was truly impressed with some of these people, but his belief that \\"Eskimos\\" have some sort of genetic ability to estimate torsion, torque curves and whatever out of a bunch of rocks and bones is laughable at best. By devoting a couple of lines to issues of alcohol and violence in these communities the author neglects a very serious and pressing issue for these Arctic people.As well, if you're Canadian, you should be prepared for a book-long undertone of pro-American flag waving propaganda. Mr. Lopez adores Peary, but saves more than a few paragraphs for how ignorant and short sighted Canadians are, while most of the time ignoring that it could be a country at all. He finds it rather funny to illegally enter the country along the Yukon border. It was my impression such comedy was not entertained along the southern border of the authors' country.This book might better be titled \\"American Dreams of Mystical Eskimos.\\""},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams is a fascinating, poetic trip through the Arctic landscape, its people and sturdy animals. I loved reading this book from the comfort of my armchair."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I have read numerous book on the Arctic, and this one, by far, is the worst. The reviews I'd read spoke of this sparking a love for the Arctic and inspiring them to learn more about the beauty of the Artic. I'd have to say I can't imagine how they got that. I could barely keep my eyes open trying to read this. The mind-numbing detail with which Lopez describes the latitudinal changes of light and soils and such is simply overbearing and excessive. This book inspired me only to put it down and read something else."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"when i ordered arctic dreams i thought it would include the european arctic. i am going to svalbard this summer. so it doesn't meet my needs. however, i plan to eventually read it as it talks about other arctic adventures."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I would, sincerely, rather scrape linoleum tile off of a concrete slab than read any more Barry Lopez."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"is Lopez's denial (by neglect) of the work of Gontran De Poncins, the last competent observer of the Eskimo."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Very well researched, packed full of information, great descriptions of the Arctic. However, it reads like an encyclopedia, so if you are looking for action and adventure or a lazy--easy to read summer book, look elsewhere. If you want an informative and interesting account of the life of birds, whales, muskoxen, and iceburgs of the Arctic, I can't think of a better book."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"My favorite book, since I was in high school, has been Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire. I never thought any book I ever read could trump the drama and emotion of that book, but Arctic Dreams is its equal, if not its superior. I do admit I am biased. This book is like a life story of a person I have been in love with for my entire life. I've read a ton of books on the Arctic, and this is one of the best.Each chapter encompasses a different part of the Arctic: to name a few, polar bears, narwhals, muskoxen, migration patterns, ice and light, Pingkok Island...every chapter, every word, every phrase in this book sticks. You cannot read this book without imagining an intensely beautiful place. The book also contains large chunks of Arctic history, of which Lopez seems to be a huge fan. He refers to expeditions, scientists, discoveries, famous explorers and researchers of the North, and also speaks of everyday people, everyday encounters, and thoughts and feelings all people experience at one point or another. The book is written with a combination of frankness and fascination that is difficult to describe. The book's chapters also touch on many different places in the North, from Alaska to Banks Island to Baffin Island to Greenland, Svalbard, Franz Josef Land, Kendall Island, and many more. The book is a story of an enormous part of the world, combining history, philosophy, science, literature, sociology, and a great deal of personal reflection.Maybe only someone completely obsessed with the Arctic could enjoy the book so completely. Maybe not. I've read some other reviews, and people who have read the book simply to learn something new have enjoyed it just as much as avid fans of the Arctic. There are a million things that make Arctic Dreams one of the best books I've ever read in my life. There is currently a copy on Amazon for $5.10. You can't buy anything as good as this for such a small amount. It's impossible. I'll read and re-read this book over and over throughout my life, and find something new every single time.."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I hate cold weather. I love trees and sunshine. But this book destroyed me. I couldn't quit reading, and next thing I knew, I had a new love; I love the Arctic. I had never been there, or had I?

It is thouroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Based on a number of trips to the far north, this is a open-minded book filled with wonderment at the often cruel beauty of the Arctic.

Barry has a poetic way to describing nature and all that I read amazed me.Bravo. I will start checking out his other titles."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Arctic Dreams is the most extraordinary book I've ever read. Lopez not only has the insights that make the Arctic come alive, but he expresses those insights in the most elegant prose. Arctic Dreams was published 20 years ago, and while the science needs updating (an Arctic scientist recently shared with me), the rest of the book is timeless. Who knew there were so many kinds of ice? Not only does the author describe the \\"land\\", but he describes the culture of the people whose lives are intertwined with the land, as well as the influences and politics that have changed their way of life forever. He explores the language needs of the people who work to survive in their often harsh environment. Those languages are primarily verb rich as opposed to English which is noun based. It took me a long time to read the whole book because often I would stop to ponder something I had just read. I have bought at least 20 copies over the years to give to friends and relatives. I still return to the book to reread passages or favorite chapters. Anyone interested in the Arctic would love this book. I would guess that someone with patience but not interested in the Arctic would become fascinated by the challenge to experience the Arctic in ways never imagined. B. Vesper 11/07"},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"A must for the reader who appreciates the beauty of a suttle landscape and the adaptations animals and people make to be at home in such a place. Lopez displays a sort of intelligence and attention to detail in this book that challenges the reader to expand. Having visited the arctic before reading it, I had pictures in my mind that he explained. The local explanation of mountains &quot;coming up for air&quot; was breathless. Inuit comfort with that country is so astonishingly beautiful. Having worked for a local ivory sculptor in Anchorage gave me a great curiosity for this land and culture. It took a scientific explanation of the sort Lopez is so go at to feed at least some of that curiosity. If you loved this book, check out some of the works of Inuit art."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Lopez' earlier slim volumes, &quot;River Notes&quot; and &quot;Desert Notes&quot; pale in coparison to this book which centers around an excursion into the Arctic, a region vastly unexplored (and, excepting Viking, Russian and Dane enterprises, unattainable beyond the sometimes invisible margins separating terra firma from the then-mythic Ultima Thule) and has only reached prominence until relatively recently in navigational history. The book reads much like a journeyman, the personal experiences mingling with sections outlining the cultural and historic (shamanistic to Cook and Peary), species and subspecie, the flora and fauna cirques, terminal moraines, and frazil of the crystal land. In many ways it also reads like a guidebook to the unknown, a sort of latter day spin-off to the wonderous adventure sagas on travel and exploration which played a critical part in books (and National Geographic) and other series' of the earlier part of the twentieth century. At still another level it presents a narrative which manages to economically convey the historic and environmental aspects which are arranged as if for magazine specials (of note are the lists of Specific Names and Places in the appendices sect.); concise, substantive and memorable. This is an enjoyable and enduring read, especially for long hot summers."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This autobiographical exploration of the inner and outer weather, the flora and fauna, of the Northern climes is truly haunting as well as seemingly endlessly informative concerning the history and features of this extreme and eerie landscape. Lopez writes, \\"Occasionally one sees something fleeting in the land, a moment when line, color, and movement intensify and something sacred is revealed, leading one to believe that there is another realm of reality corresponding to the physical one but different.\\" It is this detailed exploration of the purely physical world combined with the liminal world of the shadows it casts on the mindscape that make the book so entrancing as well as edifying,There is quite literally something for everyone to enjoy in this book. One of the most fascinating tangents the author takes, for example, whilst contemplating the terror and wonder of an encounter with icebergs, is the comparison with cathedrals, leading to an analysis of the Luminist school of painting in late Nineteenth Century America, wending back around finally with a brief overview of Western architecture in general, concluding that, \\"The erection of the cathedrals was the last wild stride European man made before falling back into the confines of his intellect.\\" Controversial? Indeed. But boring or listless? Never.There are so many profound and lyrical passages describing so much about life - and death - in the regions of Ultima Thule, its inhabitants and explorers, past and present, its history and its rigours that I'm tempted to write a review of each chapter here, thus boring the prospective reader to no end. I'll simply conclude with one of the ensorcelling sentences from the book that kept this reader turning page after page to the last syllable of recorded arctic dream::\\"The outcry of birds, the bullet-whirr of their passing wings, the splashing of water, is, like the falling light, unending.\\"So are the rewards of losing oneself in this book."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This is a beautifully written book, which has become my favorite mid-night reader, when I can't sleep. Descriptions of everything Arctic, from Alaska, across Northern Canada, and the huge islands in the Arctic Ocean, to Greenland, covering, so easily, the weather, seasons, animal, bird and fish life, with their migration and breeding, as well as human existence, and stories of Eurpean discovery and disaster, in times gone by. There is also some very interesting comment in relation to the Global Warming debate, which might surprise - or not? You will find that this is a book to read and re-read, and keep close to hand."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"Barry Lopez's \\"Arctic Dreams\\" is a fascinating personal essay on the place of the North Pole in the human imagination. He observes that \\"it is possible to live wisely on the land, and to live well. And in behaving respectfully toward all that the land contains, it is possible to imagine a stifling ignorance falling away from us\\" (p. xxviii). He find that the Arctic is \\"rich with metaphor, with adumbration\\" (p. xxix).There are three themes at the center of his narrative: \\"the influence of the arctic landscape on the human imagination. How a desire to put a landscape to use shapes our evaluation of it. And, confronted by an unknown landscape, what happens to our sense of wealth. What does it mean to grow rich?\\" (p. 13). In the end Lopez thinks that the land is like poetry, \\"it is inexplicably coherent, it is transcendent in its meaning, and it has the power to elevate a consideration of human life\\" (p. 274).This is a wonderfully evocative set of observations about Arctic and its place in the \\"Weltanschauung\\" of Western Civilization."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"I bought this book while in the tourist center at McKinley National Park in Alaska because of the chapter on Polar Bears (someone at the desk recommended it to me). I have found this book to be amazing. This is one of the most rewarding books I've ever read. It's one of very few books that I'll read more than once.Lopez's writing creates a desire to know more, to research more, and to experience the arctic for oneself. Reading Arctic Dreams is like going on a journey to the Arctic in an airplane, equipped with a microscope, where in general you get a broad picture, but on certain topics (narwhals, polar bears, etc) you have a living speciman to study. And the writing is never mundane. It reads as a narration, as though you were sitting around a campfire while Lopez talks of the arctic. There are enough facts to educate without being a burden, and enough of Lopez's voice to carry the imagination to remote arctic islands, or on an early expedition, or simply to a prarie to watch the arctic fox. And when a question arises about something in particular, Lopez address it, answering both the scientific and the introspective questions at the same time.Arctic Dreams is a masterpiece that will educate the mind and the heart. I couldn't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape","review":"This arctic study goes under the surface of the ice to bring out the subtleties in arctic life.

Sometimes the language is a little over the top, and the authors personal ideas are interjected a little too much for my liking but the essence of the text and the beautiful scenes that are set up give a new perspective and really make the read worth it. This is a book I had a hard time putting down and picking it up again with ease, sometimes I would have to go back a few pages to remember what I read before so I could continue.

Veterans tell their stories about what happend on a quiet Sunday morning. The Americans hear roaring engines and don't know what the noise is, until it's too late. Pearl Harbor is pounded by Japanese fighter planes. The American troops are unaware and lose several thousand air planes and a few ships. Later in the war America dropped two nuclear bombs on Japan ending the war in the Pacific. In Europe America had another problem. The Nazi's of Germany were killing Jews for no reason but hatred. Working with the European troops they finally stopped the war. I enjoyed this book because it gave me more information about WWII. It's really interesting to hear the differnt stories about the American troops and how the war started and ended."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Studs Terkel review is excellent and dramatic. His memories of World War Two illustrate the Psychological trauma and effect a brutal war experience can have - in addition to alcohol.I can apreciate Studs overview of events and perhaps this is a good way (writing) to deal with his experience and memories of an unforgotten war.In addition, I respect his sensitivity and human dignity he values for life and family - although, his enemy was the Japanese, Mr.Terkel compassion and true feelings harming life, identifies with our heritage being killed. Although, he was assigned by the United States Government to fulfill his obligation, perhaps the United States should of been sensitive and assigned him to a diffrent division. From his sample illustration, it is apparent Mr. Terkel served his country as a &quot;good and faithful&quot; servant without complaining and took his medicine by accepted the hardest assignment of his life.Concluding my review, Stud's humor comes to life as he matches the prejudice of people in &quot;today's society&quot; equally as those in World War Two. Mr.Terkel's review is written in terms of simplified grammer and his manuscript sample can easily be understood. Thank you for this opportunity to express my personal views. I consider Stud Terkel's book, The Good War is an excellent memoir reflecting on both our past generation of unforgotten warriors standing beside today's &quot;freedom fighters&quot; which our nation sustaines to honor our independance to this day.Louis Stephen"},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"This is without a doubt the most important book on the subject of WWII you will ever read. I am a great admirer of Mr. Terkel, and our understanding of the world we live in is immeasureably enriched because of him. Unlike so many history writers whose &quot;populism&quot; is of the cocktail-party variety that is innately distrustful of &quot;subjective&quot; firsthand accounts, Mr. Terkel has a deep and genuine interest in and respect for so-called ordinary people. The stories in this book are almost without exception compelling, sometimes heartbreaking, occasionally even funny. Unlike the recent slew of books that engage in &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; proselytizing, &quot;The Good War&quot; shows this monumental historical event warts and all. It presents not only the human side of the war, but only-too-human side as well. One good example of this is the story of the pilot who, upon seeing one of his comrades shot down, feels not only sadness but also relief and exhilaration. &quot;It's not me!&quot; Very powerful stuff, to say the least. Even those who are not fans of military history (and I count myself among this group) will be rewarded by reading this book."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"This was a gift for my nephew.

It covers everything from the recoded of the 761st tank unit, which has a combat recoded that will likely never be eclipsed, to the stories of people at Pearl Harbor, people who lived through the nearly forgotten \\"Zoot Suit Riots\\" and more.

While I found many of the stories compelling, I felt that others were irrelevent and detracted from the book."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Have you ever sat down and wonder about the people who have died in the battles that the planet earth has faced? The battles that America has been through to be a free and the powerful nation that it is today. The book \\" The Good War\\" by Studs Terkel, is a book that talks about World War , the battles, the events, the life, it was in the war. Hearing the stories of soldiers and news reporters in the front lines. This book has different kinds of stories, stories of soldiers arriving in the battle scene to stories of the day of victory.I bet you have seen videos of battles, wars, or how about historical videos. If you have, you have an idea what this book is about. I like this book but at the same time I kind of dislike it. I like it because of the straight details that the stories have, giving you details to have an exact picture in your mind. Lowell Steward is one of his stories that I really like, maybe because he is a pilot that I am interest to do in my future life. He is one out of 405 black pilot that help too win the skies during the war. His story is interesting, earning respect during his mission of flight. In the beginning, they're were only white pilots so as you can see Lowell didn't have respect. He and some of his black pilots were called \\"lonely eagles\\" because on their mission with white pilots they flew alone having no respect with the white pilots. Well as the time move on, he and his group got their respect and were joined by the white pilots to fly every mission. Being an unstoppable group. Lowell destroyed and damages 409 enemy aircraft. Stories like this make me be awake and keep on reading. I like how he describes the skies at night, flying through the clouds, can really see nothing, then in a mile away In front of him, fireworks start lighting up in the sky, a tremendous show but all the same color, but once you fly it, it is not fire works it is life. A little rephrases that he was trying to say so that u can understand his views.Maybe you have relatives that tell stories about the war but have you herd a story from a news reporter in the front lines. Many reporters where in the front lines and many stories but putting it all together becomes a breath taking picture in your mind. Being in the line at night lying down on the floor, looking up then seeing flashes of light flying by, not knowing who is who. It will stop for a little while but as soon as the American troop order to light up the sky, the flashes happen again. You can say that these reporters were stupid, dumb, ignorant, but that is their job to let the people know what is happening in the war, without them we would not know if America would be winning or losing.What about the wife's? Well they were back home doing the mens work, earning money to support their children. Their life is in this book. Also describing the their emotion every time, the mail man came. Knowing to see if it is for them or not. As the ladies staying home, they did all what they can do to move on with their life.You have heard the exciting, fearsome little parts of some stories. But what I dislike but at the same time I understand why, is the sad part of the book. It's there to add some emotions, and feeling to the soldiers who have died to remember them of their service to the United State. Also there are stories of sadness, but not as a lot. There is a story in the book about the remembering the past, giving their views on what they saw in the battle fields, like brining back memories that don't want to talk about.Back to the wife's at home becomes a sad scene too. Mail man brining the letter to a mother of two children, receiving and knowing what it is, this is a tragic crying sad moment. The children probably one and not getting to know their father. Well this is how it was in America. Every day in everybody life there is sadness, happiness, joy, anger, fear. Now take this image and put it in a heavier emotion and u will feel the same as the wife's.Some people don't realize on the events that Planet earth has had. Some hear it but don't care. Now what would. They do if this would happen, would they care or just don't care. Yea they would care because they would be going to the war.This book change a little bit of my view on soldiers, like memorial day has past, and people left their homes to pay respect on those soldiers, this is why America is number one. I don't have a relative that I know off that was in the war but I do have friends that have a relative that died in the war, and now I know how they feel when that day comes. To my knowledge that I have learned in my life, this book is an emotional, change points of view. Knowing the past can help and change something in the future, but what I do know is that America winning the war made the U.S. the powerful nation that it is today because of the soldiers that made it to be like this, because of their service their family friends are free."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"This is a collection by noted author Studs Turkel of oral accounts given to him that relate to experiences in World War II. There are many of these vignettes, and they cover a lot of ground. Turkel has carefully gathered tales from combatants and non-combatants alike. Included in the latter category are reminiscences from Japanese-Americans who were placed in West Coast internment camps, conscientious objectors, &quot;Rosie the Riveters&quot;, senior civil servants, wives of soldiers serving overseas, and workers in the Manhattan Project. As for the warriors, Turkel draws from both the European and Pacific theaters, and from various ranks in all of the military branches, and from several of the warring nations.What I found most surprising was the significant degree of disappointment and disillusionment expressed by many of the interviewees. Far more of these people than I would have expected felt the war was unjust or unnecessary and that the U.S. should not have been involved, or, having been drawn into the conflict, that America was prosecuting the war foolishly and narrow-mindedly. A large number also state their contempt for the government in the post-WWII years and the dawn of the Cold War.It is quite striking to see the pessimism and fatalism of a good number of the people whom Terkel interviewed, so much so that I wonder if the author was deliberately skewing his samples to adhere with his own beliefs. Indeed, it's not a mistake that the book's title is in ironic quotation marks; clearly, Terkel begs to differ with those who have held WWII to be a &quot;good war&quot;. There is a distinct tone throughout that this was a war that was forced upon the American people, and that many opportunities for lasting peace in the aftermath were squandered.Terkel has succeeded in rounding up people from all walks of life for inclusion in this collection. Some of the more notable names are Milton Caniff (the cartoonist), Bill Mauldin, John Kenneth Galbraith, W. Averell Harriman, Mike Royko, Pauline Kael, John Houseman, and Maxine Andrews.While I found the significant strain of disgust and despair to be rather disquieting, this is nevertheless a book that presents a different view than the popular &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; tomes of recent years. It's certainly worth reading in these current troubled times, if only to get another point of view."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"\\"The Good War\\" has had a profound on my perspective of history. I have always been a fascinated student of World War II, but Terkel's masterpiece led me to completely re-evaluate how I viewed the Second World War.The book is somewhat deceiving because while it seems light, it is the exact opposite. Many of the accounts given by the men and women affected by the war are extremely powerful, and it is difficult to read through many of them in a row without having to stop and ponder their implications.There is no doubt Terkel wrote this book to push his support of pacifism. While he probably edited the accounts to make his message more pointed, it does not really matter. Yes, World War II was \\"good\\" in that it was necessary to stop the Nazi war machine. But it was not \\"good\\" because no war can be good. World War II is often portrayed as this great event, but Terkel reveals the War for what it really was: vital for the future of the world, but devastating to millions whose lives were transformed by it.\\"The Good War\\" is a lot of like \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" by James Bradley. It is shows the amazing heroism displayed by people during the War, but at the same time vividly illustrates the horrors sometimes forgotten when people think about World War II. Make no mistake: I agree that the heroism of our vets during the war is unparalleled in history. I just think the book gives an important perspective that should not be ignored.If you want to gain a new perspective of what many call the \\"good war\\" I highly recommend Studs Terkels' powerful book."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Studs Terkel's book was on my shelves for many years, and I've basically ignored it for all that time. But when it was time to pick a new book to read from my library, I saw it sitting there - and in light of the events of September 11, it somehow seemed that this was the perfect time to read this book, and that this was the perfect book for the time.For this book, Terkel interviewed men and women from all walks of life, and from both sides of the war, in order to paint as complete a picture of that time as possible. He has more than succeeded. Some of his interviewees were for the war; a few were against it, even when they were in the thick of it. Some told of the injustices done to Japanese-Americans, and some told of what they found when they arrived at the gates of Buchenwald.Each man and woman has their own story to tell, and Terkel lets them tell it in their own voice. The grammar, syntax, etc. varies from person to person, told exactly as Terkel recorded it. There are some accounts from famous people (John Kenneth Galbraith, Mike Royko, and Maxine Andrews, to name a few), but most of the stories are told by the so-called common people. And even those people whose names are known outside of this book don't put on any airs when they allow Terkel to record them.That single fact makes this the best book on or about any war that I've ever read - beyond even such admitted classics as &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, &quot;The 13th Valley&quot;, and &quot;Battle Cry&quot;. Those books, and many others like them, are very good - but the people in them are all larger than life.

Keep it under lock and keybecause it's so precious. If you read only one book on WorldWar II, make it this one. Unlike Band of Brothers, which is about a company in a regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, this book wasn't made into an HBO miniseries. Buy it now.

Those interviews are the stories included in his book, &quot;The Good War.&quot;If you are looking for a collection of &quot;war stories&quot; by combat veterans sharing their yarns of heroism under fire, look elsewhere; while there are some of those experiences here, the bulk of the book deals with the wider scope of the conflict - from &quot;Rosie the riveter&quot; to Japanese detainees, to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (including Americans who occupied the cities weeks after the bombings. Sadly, they share similar stories.)It is an interesting glimpse in time - of &quot;simpler times&quot; - when racism was the status quo (Terkel includes the experiences of Tuskeegee airmen and Naval ammo handlers and stevedores), when the military was segregated, when women took up jobs for the war effort, fully expecting to be fired once the war was over.Terkel's book is primarily concerned with the experiences of Americans during the war, although he interviews some on the &quot;other side&quot; - a German war bride retelling her experiences during a bombing raid (the same raid her husband happened to be on - ironically bombing her town), of a German U-boat crew, of Japanese civlians. Their perspectives provide some balance to the book.In the final analysis, it is an interesting read - not the sort of thing one could read cover-to-cover all at once; better, I think to read a few interviews and set it down, giving one the opportunity to reflect on how the seminal event of the twentieth century influenced not only those interviewed, but all of us. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Studs Terkel's The Good War is a very entertaining set of oral histories about World War II. By allowing people to tell their own stories in their own words, Terkel sweeps his readers along on a fascinating trip back in time. Even at roughly 600 pages, The Good War is difficult to put down.The Good War definitely will encourage you to think. Terkel wants his readers to ponder whether war can ever be justified. Another poignant aspect of The Good War is the fact that the vast majority of the interview subjects must be deceased by now; in fact, several died before the book's original 1984 publication. The Good War is the sort of book that will force you to reflect, even long after you have finished reading it.While I would recommend The Good War, it is possible to offer a few criticisms.As several reviewers have noted, Terkel is devoted to debunking the notion that WWII was, in any way, good. If there was a problem in those years, Terkel doesn't just cover it, he covers it at length. The fact that Terkel wants to take away our rose-colored glasses does not bother me. But I have been lucky enough to meet many World War II veterans; most of them are much less critical of WWII than are Terkel's interviewees. So, I wonder whether we hear from a disproportionate number of malcontents.Another criticism is that Terkel tries to take on too much - even for 600 pages. The book meanders onto a number of topics that (while interesting) stray a bit far from WWII. For instance, Terkel has strong interests in the Spanish Civil War and the Cold War. These sections may be too far from the \\"main\\" story for some readers' tastes.On the whole, however, The Good War is a fascinating look at a lost era. You will be entertained and you will also be left with much to think about after you finish."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Once I picked up this amazing collection of first-hand narratives, I literally could not put it down. Every story is touching; every story has a lesson to be learned. It shows WWII from many different angles: the soldier, the wife who lost everything in the present but gained a future, the daughter who promised herself to every soldier she saw; the bombed, the bomber, the black men fighting segregation. Studs Terkel did a brilliant job in allowing people to reveal their deepest secrets and hidden passions."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"I found this book to be eucational and moving as I encountered many different stories with a variety of perspectives that ranged from soilders in the Pacific to Europe and \\"every day\\" people from Hawaii to New York. The stories may be from the first day of the war to the last battle. I hung on every word as people, some who had never even shared their stories before, recounted their experiences. I laughed, I cried, and I was left with a better understanding of the war on a more personal level that moved me and may have changed my life and the way I view wars forever. I would recomend this book with the highest esteem."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Studs Terkel is one of the most interesting journalists I have ever read. I picked up this book for my college US History class and I read far more entries than the ones assigned to us. Getting a clear picture of World War II is very difficult, especially given the nature of primary sources (like film reels advocating women to go to work, or whatever) which assert that the War was indisputably the &quot;Good War.&quot; Through Terkel's book I have learned that WWII was much more complicated than a simple event of unity across the country. Making it work required a number of battles, and not every American citizen benefited from the events of the war. Terkel's striking vignettes provide a myriad fascinating perspectives from people affected by WWII in so many ways, and within each interview he finds a nugget of evidence that enhances (or sometimes redefines) history."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"This book is a bunch of short stories, 10 or less pages each, from people who had some kind of experience from World War II. What I found interesting was that, each of the stories in the book had experiences from all different angles of the war. Examples were from African Americans who showed how segregated the military was, to British, German, and Japanese civilians showed how life was in a constantly bombed community to scientist who help build the atomic bomb and what they feel about their work.I found from reading this book how much this war has effected my life. This war was my grandparents war and from this war I have grown up in a safe and fruitful economic environment. In which the US was thought of as one of the major powers of the world. I believe that if this war did not come about the US would not have came out of the depression in the extreme way it did. This, and other factors, would led to the US not being a major power of the world. In this different US I believe I would not have been given the opportunities that I have had and enjoyed.Before I though of World War II as the past, but now I think of it as what has created my present."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"When I realized this book won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-fiction in 1985 I decided to read it, since I am sort of trying to read all the Pulitzer prize winners. I had been somewhat put off by the idea of an oral history. But the minute I started on the book I found it very readable and the accounts absorbing. True, some of the interviewees said things that were disagreeable or dumb, but all were interesting to read. I find I like hearing about what experience one had in the war, and this book has such accounts of over 100 people, some quite famous, and others unknown. Some of the persons exhibited a bitter or cynical attitude, which might have been different if the interviews had been taken after the Cold War ended, but I suppose if they had been taken after Sept 11 a new note of pessimism would have been apparent. Reading this book raised to 20 the number of General Non-Fiction Pulitzer prize winners I have read, but there are 23 I have not read. I am glad this book won a Pulitzer prize, else I never would have read it."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"When in school I was never a fan of reading history, but history is very easy to absorb on an individual, anecdotal basis like this. And unlike most cinema about WWII, this book is always grounded in the real, albeit with many different perspectives. Getting an idea of the impact of the war on so many levels helped me understand it despite being too young to know what it is like to be in a war. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"This is one of those books that will stay with you. Terkel interviews Americans of many social and ethnic backgrounds about how they thought and felt during World War II, and what they think of the experience now. I can't think of any other book that does this so successfully. As other reviewers have noted, the reality that emerges here should quash the childish pop fantasy that WWII was an exciting adventure with everyone pulling together, lots of singing, and victory assured. That was just not the case.What's more, \\"The 'Good War'\\" is almost impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Studs Terkel's \\"The Good War\\" presented World War II as told by those who lived it. It appears that Terkel rounded up all the living legends that helped popularize the war effort, and have become somewhat iconiclastic heroes to American society. You've got the \\"gung ho\\" E.B. (Slegdehammer)Sledge who led the men of company K through the jungles of the Pacific, and of course, the Rosie the riveters who epitomized the working woman with their dungerees and working man boots. And ironically, Terkel also included the voices of dissent who had no sense of humanity and sided with the \\"other\\" side, that is, fascism, as a result of fear. The personal account by Erich Luth presents how war and the effects of war can have a major impact on an individual. Things can change in the process, and unfortunately, it was only through devastation that a person realized how wrong they had been to support a tyrranical form of government and leader, which existed with the Hitler regime. As Luth states: \\"You see, I belong to nation which has always been rich in military heroes, but is underdeveloped in civil courage...The young are beginning to understand\\" (433).If history teaches anything, it teaches us to understand how people experienced hardships and also successes. These individuals survived and they had the courage to tell their stories. From scientists to the boy or girl next door, these people are Americans who participated in a society that combated the enemy from the Pacific and the Atlantic.Terkel presented a variety of voices in \\"The Good War\\", and many great anecdotes and memoirs as told by these voices. It also asks the question if World War II had been romanticized as the \\"good war\\" or was it something more? All I can say is that this book is definitely worth reading in spite of the fact that much of the stories and eye-witness accounts bear much significance to yesterday, today, and tomorrow. This is a book about humanity and learning from what has been learned before."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"I liked this book because it is written as if you are asking a relative what they did during the war. No one's story is too long, unlike my relatives who go on and one. (That's the author's trimmimg.) Yet I was fastinated. There are lots of big piture histories and if you know that history, fitting in the scene from a person on the ground is really very interesting. It's the why we fought, not for your country, but rather once on the line, not to let your buddies down. The feeling of regret when you finally meet the enemy and he looks just like you.Anyway I'd read &quot;Working&quot; by S.Turkel and liked it. This books is written in the same style."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"This book helped me understand myself and my parents' generation in ways I never considered possible. Reading it was like taking a guided tour through the no-man's-land between idealism and despair. I'm no great history book fan, but I'd definitely recommend this one to readers of every age, nationality, and background. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"As a foreigner that did live and work in the US years ago, I must say that Mr. Terkel's view of his country is accurate, terse, objective, and portraits a great country with its pitfalls, drawbacks and, of course, wonders."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"I found this easy to read. The book presented many aspects of the time. Some peoples accounts of famous events like Pearl Harbour were fresh and relevant. Don't expect a balanced view of the war nor the truth. What you do get is tales as interesting for what they leave out as put in. The book opens very much in the style of Saving Private Ryan with stories of bullets, bombs and carnage. There are definite themes such as treatment of the American-Japanese community on the home front, the Afro-American troops story, Women and the war and the Atomic bomb and it's impact and effects. The book never concludes anything though there is a narrator prescence here and there in the pages. The analysis of these oral histories is for the reader. I found it showed how tough the human condition is. On the whole most participants in the war felt the A-bomb should have been dropped. Only japanese felt otherwise ! The turn around in foreign policy from Russia as an Allie to enemy No.1 was also quite noticeable. The relatively lenient treatment of the Germans involved in war crimes was also highlighted for me. It's a bit like the freeing of terrorist prisoners here and in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Peace Agreement. My main hope is that there is a good peace now 'The Troubles' are ended."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"This is an interesting volume of many, many people's personal experiences during the war. The narrative is not exactly gripping, but with patience it can be rewarding. If you're interested in little tid bits of people's memories and brief summaries of their life during the war, this book might be helpful. Though, this book did not meet my expectations based on the glowing reviews given here. I thought it would be more interesting and more in-depth.

The Good War is a national treasure containing a broad cross-cut of the generations of men and women who lived through a horrible and fascinating era. This is not a history as you've known history. This is history as a living, breathing entity. If you're skeptical of my enthusiasm, just try to get through the first chapter without wanting to read the rest of them.These interviews are guaranteed to affect you. This is the perspective that history so often overlooks: the views of the everyday man, woman, and child at ground zero--those who experience history first-hand."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Strangely, as I found out about the recent death of long time pro-working class journalist and general truth-teller \\"Studs\\" Terkel I was just beginning to read his \\"The Good War\\", about the lives and experiences of, mainly, ordinary people during World War II in America and elsewhere, for review in this space. A little comment is thus in order here before I do so. The obvious one that comes to mind is that with his passing he joins many of the icons of my youth who have now passed from the scene. Saul Bellows, Arthur Miller, Hunter Thompson, Norman Mailer, Utah Phillips to name a few. Terkel was certainly one of them, not for his rather bland old New Deal political perspective as much as a working class partisan as he might have been, but for his reportage about ordinary working people. These are my kind of people. This where I come from. He heard the particular musical cadence of their lives and wrote with some verve on the subject, especially that melody of his adopted Chicago home (Musically, Robert Johnson's \\"Sweet Home, Chicago\\" fits the bill here, right?).One thing that I noticed immediately after reading this book is that, as is true of the majority of Terkel's interview books, he is not the dominant presence but is a rather light, if intensely interested, interloper in these stories. For better or worse the interviewees get to tell their stories, unchained. In this age of 24/7 media coverage with every half-baked journalist or wannabe interjecting his or her personality into somebody else's story this was, and is, rather refreshing. Of course this journalistic virtue does not mean that Studs did not have control over who got to tell their stories and who didn't to fit his preoccupations and sense of order. I would have been surprised, for example, if the central leadership of the Allied military efforts, like General Eisenhower, got a lot of ink here but I was not surprised that, for example, the late \\"premature anti-fascist\\" Milton Wolff, the last commander of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War, got a full airing on his interesting World War II exploits.What were Stud's preoccupations in this book? Obviously from the quotation marks around the title \\"The Good War\\" there is some question in his mind and in that of at least some of his interviewees that this now storied period was all that it was cracked up to be. One, however, gets the distinct impression that, notwithstanding that assumption, those who participated in this period, called the \\"greatest generation\\" at least in America basically saw it as a necessary war to fight, whatever else happened afterward.I have my disagreements with the premise that was this was the greatest American generation (the Northern side in the Civil War gets my vote) and what one should have done in response to the Axis threat to the world and the defense of the Soviet Union but I too will defer political judgment and let the participants tell their stories.And what stories are being told here? Well, certainly this book is filled with interviews of the lives, struggles and fate of the rank and file servicemen (and a few women) that fought that war. Those include the stories of soldiers from the Axis powers and the Soviet Union as well. Of course we have the trials and tribulations of those who were left behind on the home fronts, including those \\"Rosie The Riveters\\" women who went to work in the factories of America (and were later kicked out on the return of the men).Moreover, and this marks this book as different from earlier efforts to tell the war story, we have stories of the plight and successes of blacks, including the now famous Tuskegee Airmen, in this transitional racial period that in many ways is the catalyst for the later black civil rights movement of the 1950's. It is no accident that many of the early rank and file cadres of that movement were veterans of this war. As importantly we also have stories here of the effects the internment of Japanese-Americans during the war as told by those affected.Of course, no modern account of World War II can be complete without mention of the Holocaust (Shoah), the fates of the survivors and those who didn't as well as the impact that it had on the liberators on entering the death camps. Also necessary are the interviews concerning the grizzly fates of POW on all sides. As is, additionally, the general sense that many participants sincerely thought that this war was to be something like a war to end all wars (sound familiar?), especially in light of Hiroshima.I was somewhat surprised by the overwhelming distinction that was drawn between the \\"civilized\\" nature of the European war and the \\"savagery\\" of the Pacific war by the participants. However, I was not surprised by the general support for the dropping of the atomic bomb expressed by the bulk of the interviewees questioned nor was I surprised by the little tidbits of information about events that occurred during the war that presaged the buildup to the anti-Soviet Cold War.For those of us who are sons and daughters of this generation that fought the war, and who came of political age in the 1960's, this little book provides more personal information in one spot than I ever learned from my taciturn and reticent parents or from the high school history books. That, my friends, makes this any extremely necessary book for your lists if you came from an even later generation and are personally farther removed from this period. Read this book! Kudos and adieu Studs."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"\\"The Good War\\" - Studs Turkel's 5th oral history - was published in 1984. Like most of his other books, this too was a \\"best seller\\". Turkel has put together excerpts from some 124 interviews with people who lived during the war years - ex-military officers and enlisted men, defense industry workers, atomic bomb scientists, celebrities, politicians, Jews, Japanese, Germans, Russians, men, women, blacks, native Americans, rich, poor, younger, older. I've missed some, but you get the idea.The war, notes Turkel, was good for most Americans, ergo - the title. After a long, lean depression throughout the country, there were again plenty of jobs, plenty of money, and plenty of hell-raising. Also, Americans were happy to work hard and to lend their support to the war effort - in whatever way they could - because they thought they knew why the country was at war. Maybe they did, maybe they didn't. Most active participants in the war survived the experience: there were 129 million Americans at that time, 5 million served on active military duty, 1 million of those were killed, wounded, or injured in the war. Most Americans interviewed considered the war years generally happy ones. Many of those who served in the military considered their war-time experiences the most exciting times of their lives.When people spoke to the tape recorder about their lives during the war years, they automatically came up with the most exciting, most memorable, most tragic, most funny, most whatever - because these are stories that they've been thinking about, telling and retelling for over 30 years. That's what makes this book so readable. It's definitely not boring and it's definitely informative. Many people recalled a specific moment in their lives, when they were unbelievably lucky, and because they were lucky, they survived with their life.In my view, if you are going to read just one book about WWII, this should be the book!"},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"I was at a garage sale when I saw this book and I asked how much to buy it, the answer was &quot;This book is too good to sell, if you promise to read it I will give it to you&quot;. With this recommendation I accepted the agreement and found one of the most interesting and entertaining books I have ever read. Being a &quot;baby boomer&quot; I knew of the war from school and my parents however it had no real meaning to me personally, this book filled that gap spectacularly.

Author Studs Terkel interviews several dozen U.S. veterans, many of whom were still mourning lost comrades decades later. Among the memorable interviews, we hear from a veteran that married his dead comrade's widow, a future realtor wounded in a racist massacre at a U.S. army base, and STARS AND STRIPES cartoonist Bill Mauldin. Terkel also speaks with a dying Chicago taxi driver who later was buried as requested along the Elbe River in Germany where his unit first linked up with the Russians in 1945. Several interviewees saw no combat, including civilians that describe life on the home front. I'd heard war tales from my father (Air Corps) and uncle (Army), and most of the stories in this book ring true. Many interviewees seem to agree with the author that this \\"Good\\" war was a nauseating but necessary struggle against Hitler and fascism. As with Terkel's other books, the interviewees are largely from Chicago, and, on balance, they tend to reinforce his liberal views.Some say Terkel isn't an author, but merely a good listener with a handy tape recorder.

I bought this with my bro in mind who loves World War II stuff, but when I started reading it I told him he'd have to wait. An inspiring book where you get the perspective of the people who lived through this landmark in world history. The accounts of the Japanese within the U.S. are particularly good, as they tell the hardships faced by these people as their neighbors and country turned against them. Recommended for anyone who enjoys reading period. My only gripe is that because they are transcribed from actual interviews, there are parts when the dialogue is abruptly interrupted to say when the person laughed. It disrupts the flow for me, but doesn't detract from the experience overall.Book is a must, but the publisher (Seashell Publishers) is not. Quality is fine for what I payed, but it took nearly a month for me to receive it. I was almost at the point where I was going to contact Amazon. The only excusable excuse would be if they printed and bound the book specifically for me, and even then I doubt it should have taken so long. For $4 though, I'm overlooking it just enjoying the product."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"A wonderful collection of oral interviews with men and women who participated in World War II, in all places and on both sides. The viewpoints are as varied as the interviewees, their unfiltered words providing a look into facets of the war passed over or incompletely represented by history books and documentaries. One gets a sense not only of what the war was like, but of the politics, culture, attitudes, and everyday realities of the era, a part of the picture all too often muted in war documentaries.The title of the book, I thought, had a bit of a double meaning. Many of the interviewees saw the war as a necessary struggle against tyranny, but many accounts (some of the most interesting ones, in my opinion) also cast light on the moral struggles and compromises the US faced within itself: the attitude towards blacks, the internment of Japanese civilians, the terrible carpet-bombing of Axis countries, the development of the atomic bomb, and the emerging Cold War and superpower status of the US. There are also some perspectives from people on the enemy side and on the Russian Front, which are interesting, too.Very compelling."},{"Title":"The Good War: An oral history of WWII","review":"Studs Terkel has done the country an invaluable service with his series of oral histories.

Because the reader is confronted with the words of real people, the book becomes a very personal experience. Some of the combat tales are as horrific as any from the war in Viet Nam. Likewise, the bureaucratic nonsense, the prejudice, the loss of life, the cruelty, the simple acts of heroism and sacrifice. Enormously poignant at times; often humorous, sometimes devastatingly sad, always gripping.I am not much of a history buff, and perhaps this is the best level of historical writing for me, so I would recommend this to anyone who has even the slightest interest in what Americans were doing during that war."},{"Title":"Unbabbling","review":"The third story in this books is rare genius.It is a surreal/absurd tale of a construction worker's odyssey to expose a corporate plot to build a shoddy bridge.

It reminds me of the writing of Danhil Kharms, Witold Gombrowitz, or Virgillio Pinera. This kind of surrealism is rare in English.

If you can't afford all of the convenience items in the grocery store, it is very nice to get back to basics and make your own. I, and several of my friends, make our own baking mixes, spice mixtures, and other modern staples.

There are hints on how to most effeciently wash dishes (by hand, in a sink) and statements about how every \\"girl\\" should know how to make her table look attractive, and advice on lighting a gas stove by hand. I just can't wade through this type of culinary perspective to glean the useful elements.

Suddenly, a mysterious new weapon is cutting down aircraft without warning. It is quickly discovered that the weapon is a high energy laser.COMMENTSThe first few chapters introduce at least 2 dozen characters, making them impossible to remember. Fortunately, most are never heard from again, and none are really significant to the story. Fortunately, Brown makes no attempt to flesh out these non-entities with \\"human interest\\"---which inevitably fails in novels of this kind.The basic (silly) premise is that \\"Dreamland\\"---the super secret aircraft development facility in Nevada, also has a private commando arm of its own.There is plenty of action, and endless military jargon, sure to delight any teenage boy (up to 40 years old) and bore any woman out of her skin.Fortunately, there is no plot to get in the way of the action and jargon. Pilots get shot down and rescued, and of course the laser gets destroyed. That's about it.CONCLUSIONThe opposite of a dramatic mystery where the reader has to strain to remember characters and plot details. A very entertaining read which places no demands on the reader whatsoever."},{"Title":"Razor's Edge (Dale Brown's Dreamland)","review":"This is a review of the book on tape. The plot was solid and brought with it a sense of authenticity, especially in terms of how problems arose and were solved. To a degree the details about military hardware were fascinating, but they soon overran the book and distracted from the characters. There was only one character who truly mattered, and he was a side-show for most of the novel. The rest of the book was filled with people whose only purpose seemed to be populating the chain of command or demonstrating prowess under fire. A good example of this is Dog. He is some sort of Colonel, and his only role is to talk to the Whiplash team, pace around the room, and then relay the information to some General. Then he gets back on the phone with Whiplash. For all I know this type of exchange may be a normal part of military operations, but its appearance not once but several times in this novel was baffling. Ironically the character's name was well-suited to his part. As my sarcastic girlfriend fake-narrated: \\"Dog paced around the room and p***ed on the carpet.\\"The cheesiest line of the book: \\"If the pilot was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen - and she was - then she was second.\\"C'mon."},{"Title":"Razor's Edge (Dale Brown's Dreamland)","review":"There is a certain comfort that comes from reading a series of books that are essentially well-written with a continuing cast of characters who are developed and refined throughout a variety of plot lines. RAZOR'S EDGE continues the saga of &#34;Dreamland,&#34; shifting the emphasis from the airborne characters to the ground forces who are an essential element of the Dreamland concept. I imagine this was a bit difficult for Brown as an ex-Air Force pilot (is one EVER an EX-pilot?!), though he still manages to emphasize the flight component. The plot line is well-developed and the reader is somewhat challenged to follow the twists and anticipate where the scenarios will finally settle. The tedium comes from Brown's over-emphasis on the technology, a consequence no doubt of his familiarity with flight controls and weapons' systems one should expect from a former pilot. I am not certain that degree of detail is quite necessary for a novel, even if it does impart a higher degree of fictional realism. It is too easy to get lost in the details and lose track of the plot! That said, his development of the main characters does show some evolution with each book in the series, and for those of us who enjoy a series of novels that follow the same group of participants, with occasional appearances of new additions, each novel is like revisiting old friends. The danger, of course, is that these characters and their behaviors and relationships can become stale. Not to worry. RAZOR'S EDGE does not suffer this fate. A final note: one is left shuddering at the potential real-life reality of the plot, hoping it is fictional and not reality-based."},{"Title":"Razor's Edge (Dale Brown's Dreamland)","review":"These guys know how to make out of this world high tech believable.

The frequent acronyms (often dropped in with no nearby full description) make the start a bit of a slog to get through and unfortunately never let up throughout the book. Thankfully, the future technology throughout the book is interesting and well described, the action picks up and towards the end of the book the missions become so full on it is hard to put the book down.A few extra pages in the book would have made it much more enjoyable to a wider audience (particularly those without a military background or strong interest in military aircraft):* Acronyms deciphered* Key features of the principal aircraft and anti-aircraft missile categories mentioned in the book* At least two pages describing the key characters.

To you first time readers of Dale Brown my suggestion is read his earlier books first because they are like a soap opera and it will be much easier to follow and enjoy. His books are not outstanding but they are always entertaining. In fact this book is between good and very good.This is your typical hero and heroine Dreamland book. All the usual suspects, Zen, Dog, Danny, etc. Iraq is knocking our planes out of the sky. First they have to determine what is knocking out our planes. It turns our to be a lazar which does not come up on their sophisticated radar. Now they to locate it and then they go in and bomb from the air and attack by the ground.

A guy who is not only a main character, a romantic lead, but, I think, one of the heroes of the series. Who also happens to be a Class A Schmuck.We are told Zen was an ace pilot, then a crash causes him to become wheelchair bound. Not a bad concept, could have made for some excellent twists. And indeed, in the beginning of the first book, the anguish/anger/mistrust/fear that Zen illustrated felt real. However, after reading 2/3 of the book I was getting just a tad grumpy that Zen was still piloting the pity pot plane. And his engine was in full whine mode. Well, I finished the book. Forgave the writer. Bought the 2nd Dreamland book.Guess what? Pain-in-the-ass Zen is still around - kinda like the whine of that mosquito in the middle of the night that won't let you sleep.

I started using ASL with my son at 9mo, and at 4yo we still sign! I've seen other books that use non-ASL sign language, and that seems quite silly to teach your child a language that isn't official, especially seeing that my son still uses some of the signs he's learned.This book was very easy to read and use, and is perfect for anyone who hasn't had any experience with signing. I've given this book to 4 couples as baby shower presents, and they've loved it.I firmly believe that using sign language with my son before he could speak reduced the \\"terrible twos,\\" because it gave him a way to communicate his needs and wants to us. We used signing in conjunction with speaking, and siging didn't hinder his speach development at all. In fact, I think it helped him start talking sooner.

However, after signing with our 9 month old for 2 days, she had learned three signs and now can sign for a variety of things.

I guarantee they will quickly change their mind when they see their child in action!"},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"We checked with child neurologists (we live in a medical university community) and they all emphasised the benefits of communicating (signing before they can speak) as soon as possible. By allowing a child to have the signing skills, they begin realizing that they are an individual entity that can ask another individual entity for something. The little brain neurons start firinging and producing the communication function sooner in a baby that has the tools to sign.We knew our daughter picked it up when, at around 11 months -- couldn't walk yet and couldn't speak -- Mom took our daughter out of the kitchen after dinner and they walked by me eating dinner. Our daughter started crying, and then signed \\"eat\\" (hand to mouth) \\"that\\" (pointing at my plate).

He learned very quickly and was communicating extensively in a couple of months. (For example, around 9 months old, he awoke in the middle of the night, which was unusual for him, and signed that he wanted to eat rice cereal and apples.) Signing lowered his frustration levels significantly. Plus it is so much fun for the whole family to communicate with him. His speech also developed very quickly, and at 19 months he is using sentences. I highly recommend this book. It is written in an easy to read and understand format."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"Before my son was born I began to look at different baby sign books. I picked up two books, Sign with your Baby and another. I found Sign with your Baby very easy to use. I returned the other baby sign book and bought a second copy of Mr. Garcia's book (and the video) for my mother/Tyler's caregiver. Joseph Garcia gives excellent reasoning backed up with research for you should sign with your baby, and when you should start, what signs are best to begin with, when and how to introduce new signs, and so much more without inundating you with too much information.

It's a very slim 112 pages of which some are just blank 'note' pages. Also, over half the book is just examples of suggested signs, and there are plenty of references to the video which we did not want.

They know what they are signing, but since it doesn't always resemble what the parent taught or the book illustrates, it can be as frustrating as trying to understand what a young child is verbalizing/speaking.4) It's a limited resource in that all the included signs are American Sign Language (ASL) and, therefore, more comprehensive ASL books are available. If you would like to teach your child more ASL as they grow (for use as a second language, for instance), you would be better off simply buying one of the several excellent ASL reference books available for about the same price as this one. Then select the signs you wish to use with your child, introducing them gradually, and you'll accomplish everything this book has to offer while also having further room to learn and grow."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"We began at 9 months and almost gave up.

The rest of the book is a glossary of signs. However, I have decided to read Baby Signs after all, even though we still plan to use the signs from Dr. Garcia's book.There are a couple reasons for my change of heart. I started reading Baby Minds: Brain-Building Games Your Baby Will Love, which is by the same authors of Baby Signs. I really appreciated how the authors did a great job of backing up every major point with specific research studies. In Sign with Your Baby, the emphasis is more on anecdotes from parents and Dr. Garcia's own experience.Because I was reading both books at the same time, I also found myself preferring the writing style of Baby Minds to Dr. Garcia's writing style. There's nothing wrong with it per se--I just thought the Baby Minds authors were a little more engaging and professional. (The book design might be playing into this impression too, as Sign with Your Baby doesn't exactly have a slick book design.)But what really sealed the deal for me is that in his book, Dr. Garcia actually mentions and recommends Baby Signs. So that made me realize I didn't have to go with one or the other but that I could learn from both."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"This is a fairly good introduction to the world of baby sign language.

I found this book to be very straightforward, with a helpful glossary of easy-to-understand signs in the back. Using this book on its own, however, is not NEARLY as motivating as buying the video to accompany the book (that's why I give only 4 stars -- both items together rate 5+). The video is a true inspiration - seeing toddlers who can barely speak indicate that they need medicine to help with teething pain absolutely sent my husband and I through the roof. We were dedicated to the idea of signing before seeing the video; afterward, we were TOTALLY COMMITTED. The video alone is not enough - the book is the foundation, and the video is the icing. Now my daughter is 14 months old, and signs 45 signs and SAYS over 140 words (unprompted!). I am *convinced* that opening her mind to communication so early (we started signing with her at 7 mos) helped her develop an appetite for wanting to communicate with us. Now she's unstoppable, and we LOVE IT. I recommend signing to every new family I see - I can't tell you what a gift it has been for us!!!!"},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"I've read most of the 'baby sign' type books out there before deciding to purchase this one (and the DVD, of course!). I've also had some (limited) experience with using ASL in previous jobs. This system is FANTASTIC if you are looking for a way to teach a language which can grow and grow and grow. I don't like the idea of just making up signs. . . unless you just want to use them *temporarily* as a band-aid until your child speaks. Using ASL allows this to be something your child can use far into her/his life; it is, after all, a second language you are teaching! The other thing I really liked about this book/system is that it has a LOT of faith in the intelligence of babies!My husband (who was not convinced that this was such a good idea until he actually read the book and watched the DVD) and I began signing to our daughter when she was 4 months old (yes, a bit early, but we were just so excited!)-- just \\"milk\\" and \\"eat\\". She is now 6 months old and occassionally approximates the sign back to us; she *always* understand what we are signing and gets very excited!The book is very clearly written and organized, and illustrated. The DVD is excellent for a quick 'refresher' on any signs you may not remember. We haven't began adding signs yet (as she hasn't yet mastered the first two) but we have been brushing up for when the time comes!Some reviewers have complained that babies do not often sign the precise ASL sign initially and that it can be difficult to figure out; Dr. Garcia actually does address this, VERY well. He also gives possible sign approximations your baby may use. It's like any other skill you teach your baby, it takes practice on the baby's part and patience on mommy and daddy's part.I guess it boils down to what you are looking for-- a true, proven, language or a quick fix that can be put aside when speech developes."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"After reading the other reviews, my spouse and I were very excited about buying this book and teaching our daughter to sign. However, we were disappointed with the limited content of the book, and feel that a simple ASL dictionary or a class in ASL would be more helpful. I have found it difficult to implement ASL into my daily life w/my daughter as my hands are often full, both literally and figuratively. In addition, we are blessed to have a daughter who is very expressive and responsive and have found it fairly easy to communicate w/her and to anticipate her needs. Watching her efforts to communicate in her own ididsyncratic ways has been more enjoyable than trying to incorporate the sign language into our daily lives.

My second child started to sign basic signs (more, food, milk, cat, etc.) at about 10 months after a few months of signing to him. This is just a basic book to get the basic ideas across - it is not the complete lesson in ASL. It seems that some other people reviewing this expected a magic pill or something to make everything perfect. This book will not do that but will let the little ones express themselves specifically and limit the amount of guessing on our part. They have a voice and get satisfied sooner letting go some of their frustrations. My 3rd child picked it up a little later than my 2nd but it has made such a huge difference. It should not be a chore but should be fun to do seeing them learning and growing. Kids will pick this up at their own pace so don't give up but don't be so serious!

The problem with that is the legend for the arrows was in the middle of the book, not the beginning (so you were guessing for half the book) and it only explained three of the arrows.

This helped me to learn the signs faster.The only problem that we had with the whole system was my ability to learn the signs, so I could teach them to my child. I was able to teach all of the signs presented in the video, but I did not advance beyond that.

What I soon found was that ASL (American Sign Language) which is a great tool for the deaf community is too much for me to learn (I'm college educated, but I'm a new parent who has to work for a living!) However, there are other books out there (see Baby Signs) that are much more free, more intuitive and more supported with real research than this system is. You don't NEED to learn ASL with your baby, you and your baby can create your own language. Your baby is probably already teaching you one. Do they wave &quot;bye bye&quot;? do they raise their arms when they want to be lifted? Then they are creating their own wonderful, original sign language with you that will free you from all of this books charts and lists!"},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"I found the book to be extremely well writen, and very helpful.

Unfortunately, my baby and I had lessons of frustration. This book is really too centered around ASL signs and does not account for the fact that babies will develop &quot;Baby Signs&quot;. Just like we don't expect our child to say, &quot;Bottle&quot; and happily except &quot;Ba Ba&quot; instead, I think it's important to recognize that our babies' motor skills are not always developed enough to gesture the accurate ASL sign. However, another book, which was more helpful to me, was &quot;Baby Signs&quot;. I think this is gentler approach to baby signing and is better suited to parents who just want a temporary bridge for communication until our babies can talk. BTW, it's interesting that Joseph Garcia has to quote the research of Goodwyn &amp; Acredolo (the authors of Baby Signs). Something to think about...."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"I thought this book was very helpful but I purchased it a little too late. My daughter started talking after the age of 2 and as soon as I purchased the book she started to speak. Trying to teach an infant sign language is a little difficult but if you are able to I am sure it is very helpful (especially with temper tantrums when they are trying to communicate but can't)."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"I have to disagree with Proudparent's review. I first bought the book Baby Signs and found it to be the equivalent of a long article about why teaching your baby to communicate non-verbally is a good thing with some examples of signs that parents had made up on their own. I was already convinced that signing was a good thing and so while I found the book interesting I didn't find it useful. When I ran across Garcia's Sign With Your Baby, is was much more of a &quot;How-To&quot; that helped me get started.I really like that he advocates use of American Sign Language, it took some of the pressure off us trying to think up appropriate signs. Plus it's a bonafide, beautiful language. We were even able to take out children's books at the library that had the ASL signs along with the English text. Our baby didn't have a problem with the basic signs, we did adapt some ASL signs to make it easier and on occasion made up our own signs. Like Baby Signs, the Garcia book is a bit light, I would have preferred something more comprehensive, but of the two books about signing with your baby, I found it to be the more useful. Our playgroup all taught our babies how to sign in ASL and it's made babysitting each other's children so much easier.Whichever book you use (or neither, you don't really need a book), do try signing with your baby. It's so much fun for parents, grandparents and babies. Our daughter is talking now, but still uses her signs sometimes. It opened up her world to us so much earlier than we would have thought possible."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"This book is a wonderful tool for parents wishing to teach their baby to sign. Much of the frustration of the toddler years results from a child's inability to communicate with others. I only wish that I had started earlier with my children. I began teaching my twins to sign at 16 months. Within 3 weeks, my son was signing &quot;more&quot; spontaneously. My daughter was resistant to signing at first and then finally would sign when she thought no one was looking. Now she does it openly and with a big smile since she realizes the power of communication! At 18 months now, they both sign &quot;more&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;, &quot;please&quot; and &quot;mama&quot;. We have also made up a few signs like &quot;blankie&quot; that they are learning to use. It has really reduced some of the frustration in my home, and I plan to continue to use sign with them for as long as it remains useful. I do have a background in sign (I am an audiologist), but this book is simple enough for anyone without any knowledge of sign language to use. A must for every parent of an infant or toddler."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"Amazing results. My wife and I started to sign to our daughter at 3 months, Milk, Dog, Mom, Dad, Bright Light, and sleep. At 6 months old she was asking to be nursed without crying, at 8 months old she was communicting with us for food, drink, play, naps, diaper change, dog etc.. At one year she was using over 50 signs. Now that she is two, she speaks like a 6 year old, complete sentences, coherent conversations about a single topic, and is beginning to work out written words.Stick with the signing in the book for 3-4 months and watch your child's vocabulary explode before she's one.We also believe we avoided a very frustrating time for both us and our daughter by being able to communicate with her so early and telling us her needs and wants.Invest the $15, and stick with the program, it will amaze you and your family."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"I saw the author speak and bought the book from him. My son was about 11 months when we started and his first sign was &quot;milk&quot; which we used for &quot;I want to nurse.&quot; He was learning to talk at the same time, but signing was initially much easier and quicker. It let him tell us things that we weren't always thinking about, like that he was thirsty, or saw the moon. It really added another dimension to our lives. Our son was an early verbal child, which suggests that signing may have helped him along. Signing is very fun and you don't have to learn a lot of signs. I would heartily suggest it for every parent and baby."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"Sign With Your Baby is an easy to understand and excellent resource to begin teaching your baby sign language; however, it should not be your only resource.I purchased Sign With Your Baby when my child was 3 months old -- much earlier than the author recommends. Though my child is now 5 months and still too young to make the signs himself, he is becoming increasingly familiar with the signs and does tend to focus on the increased activity of my hands.On the other hand, I feel that the signs offered are limited. Signs included in the text cover family members, pets and animals, feelings (i.e. happy, hurt, scared, etc . .. ) and food. However, they do not cover things as simple as the alphabet, colors or toys. Often, I find myself referring to the book for a sign I would like to use and am disappointed that it isn't covered in the text.I definitely recommend purchasing Sign With Your Baby; however, I would supplement it with a Dictionary of American Sign Language."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"If there was one book I would buy for a new parent, this would be it! Baby Signing is finally getting the attention it deserves and this book truly guides you through the process. It's easy to read, with lots of illustrations and helpful tips. You need to put in some effort and have patience, but I guarantee you, your child will amaze you. Best of all your home will be a better,calmer place! For every sign your child does, there's one less scream and vague pointing , and 2 less fustrated parents. Friends and family couldn't believe our son's &quot;new vocabulary&quot;. One bit of extra advice: Don't be afraid to make up your own signs for words you don't know, or are difficult to sign (My son signs Barney by &quot;hugging&quot; himself and blanket is a pat on his cheek). If you know someone expecting, this book along with the extra aids(as well as the book Good Night Moon, a great first book to sign with) would be a great shower or first day home gift!"},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"This was the first book I read about baby sign language. It is a great introduction, but doesn't go much further past \\"why to sign\\" and to sign every time you say the word. Parents are busy and yes consistency is nice, but it didn't give you many tips on how to share the signs with your baby. It gave you some ideas for what signs to introduce first and a few games to play to reinforce the signs, but did not give much info on how to easily integrate the signs into your daily activies with your child. This book has a great sign dictionary in the back though with signs commonly used by the little ones and that is part of the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. Another bonus for this book is that it lists and recommends only ASL signs. I have signed with my own children and my daycare children and ASL is not too hard for the children and has so many benefits for them. For a book full of activities and strategies for introducing signs very easily in everday interactions with your baby I would recommend Signing Smart with Babies and Toddlers which also uses ASL signs. What is handy from Sign with Your Baby though and I would recommend is their quick reference card which is great to pop into the diaper bag."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"I purchased this book for my two grandchildren when they were 6 months old.

I don't see why. The text mostly reiterates what Baby Signs says (summarizes the research done by the authors of Baby Signs, without even mentioning their names!), with the exception of 2 major points:1. Whether to use ASL only or offer developmentally appropriate signs. I have a 3 year old that still can't do many of the ASL signs I tried to teach him. For others, he started with a \\"Baby Sign\\" and had no problem transitioning to an ASL later on when his motor skills imroved.2. Whether to always sign and say the word together or do the sign only (actually Garcia only dedicates about one paragraph to this, but it is such an important issue - and I strongly disagree with his suggestion of signing only.) The WHOLE POINT of signing with hearing babies is to foster their TOTAL communication skills, especially in their primary spoken language. Therefore, to suggest that you withhold this important exposure to the verbal word while you sign is absurd to me. Whether you use ASL or not - always sign & speak together!!The only good thing I can say about this book is that the illustrations are pretty good, and it does have a few more signs in it than Baby Signs (although I did not think all of the signs were relevant to babies). If you must buy it, use it as a dictionary only (although if you want a dictionary of ASL there are more comprehensive ones available), and definatly use it in conjunction with another book on infant sign language, like Baby Signs."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"I read Mr. Garcia's book as well as Dr. Acredolo's Baby Signs book. I recommend Sign with Your Baby over Baby Signs for the following reasons listed below. Sign with Your Baby has:1. Clearer plan for teaching sign language to baby2. ASL rather than modified or invented signs3. Better illustrated sign instructionsDr. Acredolo's book is fun to read because of all the anecdotes about children using signs, and I understand the spirit of her book for using simplified or invented signs for babies. However, it was unsatisfying to be taught invented signs instead of true ASL. If learning another language, would one want to learn the baby babble version of that language? For me, the answer is clearly no.Using Sign with Your Baby in conjunction with a class or videos such as the excellent Signing Time series provides an excellent way to teach baby and parents sign language."},{"Title":"Sign With Your Baby : How to Communicate With Infants Before They Can Speak (book only)","review":"My daughter requested this as a &#34;stocking&#34; present at Christmas because some friends of hers had such a good time teaching their baby to sign.

The book teaches you real ASL signs for the types of things you are most likely to use with a baby or toddler (ex. more, milk, eat, help, where, etc). Our son was signing well by a year, and was able to ask for things before he could speak - this cuts down on sooo much frustration on both ends! When he started talking it was helpful because sometimes I couldn't understand the word he was saying, so I would ask for the sign.

The book gives some good ideas on when to do signs (when you see baby look at something they are interested, and then look at you, etc.) For the signs I chose, if they weren't in the book, sometimes I would just look them up online, and/or after baby gets the idea, they often make up their own signs of things they like.

Moi?\\". It was similar with Yiddish: the Germanic, Hebrew-Aramaic and Slavic layers each had their own connotations and could be combined to give expressive richness to a text.

However, the book could have gone more indepth with dealing with why the Rabbit was married to the Turtle, therefore resulting in an offsprings who was half rabbit and half turtle. The book does teach a &quot;don't judge a book by its cover&quot; lesson, and it's reading level should not be placed at Baby-Preschool, but placed more at Preschool-Teen. When I began to read the first page of the book to my 4-year old daughter, and it read that &quot;Zack is different.&quot; &quot;His mother is a rabbit and his father is a Turtle.&quot; She looked at the moving furniture man (in the background) and said that he should be the father; the furniture man was...a rabbit. She has already preconceived what society is telling her is to be the 'correct way', and that is why there needs to be more children books readily available that deal with inter-racial couples, marriages and bi-,multi-racial children. I think the book should have explained why the Rabbit and Turtle were married (love).

I hope now my son will not shy away from someone who is different, and rather, invite him/her into his activities and get to know him/her.

My daughter has started making observations about her skin tone being different than mine, her eyes being different than mine, etc. This book was a wonderful way for me to start talking with my child about why she is different than children who are \\"all black\\" or \\"all white\\" and that there's nothing wrong with her...that sometimes people are just unsure. I use this book to let her know that being biracial is actually pretty darn special. That she has the best of both worlds in terms of culture and ethnicity...and to teach her to embrace that and not be upset by other's ignorance. The book helped me to teach her that as long as she continues to be her beautiful, lovable, fun self, people who are worth being friends with will be honored to be her friends....for the rest of the crowd who doesn't....it's their loss.I would HIGHLY recommend this book to parents of biracial children.Holly in Philly."},{"Title":"Just a little different (Mercer Mayer's Little Critter book club)","review":"What a charming way to introduce the subject of differences among people/characters!

I saw the cover and placed the book in my cart at the store when purchasing videos. We have a collection of a Little Golden Book stories, as well as numerous books by Gina and Mercer Mayer.The book is written from the Little Critter's perspective beginning with the arrival of the new neighbor Zack and his family. Zack has rabbit ears like his Mother with a turtle shell like his Father.The two families greet one another by shaking hands on the front lawn. The girl critters have bows in their hair and the Mothers always have an apron on. Later in the day the critters have baseball practice when the subject about asking Zack to join gets shot down. The little critter speaks to his parents about how his friends made him mad by rejecting Zack. His Mother explains the good in being different.This family discussion takes place in the living room with the dog sleeping on the floor and the mouse and cat at the top of the couch. The Father has a magazine in his lap with the Mother laying a book on her lap. The expressions on their faces are very thorough showing the father thinking with his arm on his knee.Just A Little Different shows how even kids at first make judgements based on looks and similarities. This helps in showing how to reach out to others that may be different in appearance and the positive results once you get to know someone. The message is clear that persistence pays off and the family comes together to discuss how the critter feels in the beginning.The book shares the point that one person/critter can make a difference in how they perceive others. Once all the critters stopped looking at Zack and saw him for the fun person he was they got past the first impressions.There are many lessons in this short book that is easy to read and follow along with great pictures of the critters and surroundings. Each book in the Mayer's Little Critter series sends a message and offers tips for living life in various situations. Whether a new baby is arriving or time spent with a parent or a book about feelings, these are worth so much more than the small price tag placed on them."},{"Title":"The Blair Handbook","review":"This book is perfect for any student of writing, whether enrolled in a university or not.

I would recommend buying hardcover.I have always avoided writing; it never quite turns out the way I want. But this handbook, with its clear explanations and user-friendly tone, has inspired me to simply write, not letting burdens of worry slow me down. I have been encouraged to have fun exploring new ways of putting my fingers to the keyboard.

The author's thesis is this: popular films are popular because they are the dreams shared by a people at any given time. If we study films as if they were keys to the subconscious of the audience, we gain tremendous insight into the culture and mass psychology of the time. The author builds a very convincing case for his thesis that the whole build up to Hitler can be found in the fims that preceded him. I am convinced. This book is also an excellent history of German film as the author is a very good film scholar. Now, if only we had someone around who could interpret the current films of the USA so that we could find out what the future holds in store for us! I loved this book. It was stimulating and I had seen most of the films that he writes about. One advantage todays readers have is that many of these films are no! w out on video."},{"Title":"From Caligari to Hitler: A psychological history of the German film (Noonday paperbacks)","review":"This book provided the historical and theoretical frameworks for students and theater goers, it is an important addition to my bookshelf"},{"Title":"From Caligari to Hitler: A psychological history of the German film (Noonday paperbacks)","review":"This book shows how the cinema paralleled and sometimes helped form the German psyche. Yet it is more than just a documentary. This brings you from the beginning of the industry to show what Hitler inherited. However the information caries far beyond the political dimension.I use it more for information on the film industry as a whole for that time and the basis of what we inherited today. It is interesting that from the beginning people complained that the film was to long and inclusive or too short and excluded characters form history or books.Two good parallel and overlapping timeline books for the era are \\"Cagliari's Children: The Film As Tale of Terror\\" ISBN: 030680347X which is a different view on the same subject and \\"The UFA Story: A History of Germany's Greatest Film Company, 1918-1945 (Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism, 23)\\"They tried to capture the feel of the time and of the German actors' attitude toward film, in the movie \\"Shadow of the Vampire\\" (2001)The Ufa Story: A History of Germany's Greatest Film Company, 1918-1945 (Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism, 23)"},{"Title":"From Caligari to Hitler: A psychological history of the German film (Noonday paperbacks)","review":"Not that any book can be impartial, but Kracauer's generally socialist reading of films should not be viewed as definitive.With this point taken into account, this book does offer an imcomparable survey of early German film, its symbolism, and also, the early careers of such actors as Peter Lorre and Marlene Dietrich.This book is a very entertaining study of these films, and a must for any student of modern Germany, or early film. It does perhaps reflect generally on the modern German society, and WWII in particular."},{"Title":"From Caligari to Hitler: A psychological history of the German film (Noonday paperbacks)","review":"This book has a tremendous reputation and is widely regarded as a classic, but it is a flawed classic. Siegfried Kracauer claims that we can see the political and mass-psychological development of Weimar Germany in its films. It is an interesting thesis. So, what's the problem?Kracauer's political viewpoint heavily informs his analysis of German cinema during the Weimar Republic. He was a out-and-out Marxist and a Jewish exile from Nazi Germany. Needless to say, he was extremely bitter about the development of German history when he wrote this book in 1946/47 -- and with good reason. But his analysis is very politicized and snidely anti-German. Kracauer decries the lack of engagement with the social question, particularly along \\"Marxist\\" lines.* Throughout the book, Kracauer repeats quotes from and cites the opinions of the far-left-wing (quasi-communist?) film critic Harry Potamkin.Moreover, much of the book is an indictment of the German people -- not for overtly supporting Hitler, but for their passivity. He consistently depicts Germans as obedient slaves to authoritarianism. As such, they were incapable of producing any truly great films (until 1930) and were even unable to produce good detective movies, he writes. In writing about Germany during the mid-1920s, when democracy was stable and the economy flourished, he writes that the German public was actually in a psychological \\"state of paralysis. Cynicism, resignation, disillusionment.\\" Apparently, at the time, Germans should have been creating a new, anti-authoritarian, left-wing society. They should not have been making technically innovative, popularly entertaining films.Serious historians of Germany do not depict the German people as a nation of war-mongering, boot-licking toadies who need orders to follow at all times and who then slavishly, unreflectively follow those orders. Scholars no longer believe in the from-Luther-to-Hitler thesis, and many historians dispute the \\"Sonderweg\\" theory of German history. So, why do they still use this book in their courses? Because there is nothing else so encyclopedic and because this book stands like a giant standing astride the field of German cultural studies. Kracauer seems to explicate virtually every film made in this era. It is not a popular opinion to express, but perhaps it is time to move beyond \\"From Caligari to Hitler\\" and time to seek more modern, more nuanced analyses of early German film.*Kracauer prefers the term \\"Marxist\\" to \\"communist\\" or \\"socialist.\\" He also seems to share the post-1945 view common among members of the Left that the communists and socialists should have opposed Hitler in a broad-based Marxist front. He doesn't mention the fact that Stalin's \\"social fascism\\" policy precluded such an alliance. Nor does he mention that the communist-socialist party alliances of 1945-1949 led to the communist dictatorship regimes throughout eastern Europe."},{"Title":"From Caligari to Hitler: A psychological history of the German film (Noonday paperbacks)","review":"Having owned the previous edition of this flawed classic, written by Siegfried Kracauer, the brilliant Weimar era critic, during his American exile in World War II, I hesitated to buy this new edition. Now I am glad I did. The Italian film scholar Leonardo Quaresima is one of the major authorities on Weimar era cinema, but unfortunately little of his work has been translated into English. His \\"Introduction to the 2004 edition\\" is more than that--it is a major essay on Kracauer as a film critic, indispensable for anyone with more than a casual interest in the period. Abundantly footnoted, it offers a sober critical assessment of CALIGARI TO HITLER, discussing its gestation, its sources, its relationship to Kracauer's earlier film criticism, and its methodological premises, indebted to fellow German Jewish exile Erwin Panofsky's iconology."},{"Title":"Uzbekistan: Heir to the Silk Road","review":"This German collaboration does well in discussing the general history of the region from the pre-Islamic Sogdian and Bactrian kingdoms, to the khanates and the intrigues of the Great Game to the present day independant country.Uzbekistan itself, strangely enough, is largely a Soviet era creation. The present borders include the historically important towns of Samarkand and Burkhara (and much of the Fergana Valley), much to the annoyance of Tadjikistan. Thus, the work focusses on the regional definition of Uzbekistan rather than as a people. (The Uzbeks trace their name from Ozbeg, a leader of tribes of Mongol descent in the 14th Century).Vivid pictures of works of art as well as early photographs chronicle the cultural sophistication in what was once the crossroads of the greatest civillizations in antiquity. An in depth analysis of the different patterns and motifs in carpets points attest to the subtle influences in the region. The book cannot be faulted on its detail of its analysis of artifacts and works of art. Long a people with a nomadic inclination, such influences did not necessarily remain rooted for long, and these remain as probably its most reliable catalog of its past.Thus said, the book is informative to the point of being somewhat staid in its narrative. Not much is said about life after the transition from the former Uzbek SSR to an independant country. The work is obviously of some national importance as the President of the new Republic provides the forward.Recommended if you hold more than a casual interest in the region."},{"Title":"The Primates (Life Nature Library)","review":"This is one of the twelve-volume 'Life Young Readers Nature Library' series dating from the late 1960s to late 70s. As such, it is obviously dated ('mankind'should be 'humankind', etc.) and could benefit from a re-write, if anyone cared to undertake the job (unlikely). Furthermore, the page which places the skeletons of a monkey, gorilla and human along side one another leave open a possibility of misunderstanding the evolution of these three primates. Having said that, the research and information are still solid and make this book an excellent introduction to the study of primates for children and adults alike. Beautiful photographs and artwork done by hand reproduced on almost every page.Chapter 1 is a general explanation of what a primate is, while chapter 2 is a discussion of the factors that benefit life in the trees for monkeys. Chapter 3 is a similar description of life on the ground for apes. Chapters 4, 5 & 6 are very interesting explanations of life as a member of a primate group and interactions with the outside world. The focus on the Takasakiyama monkeys of Kyushu, Japan was especially useful to me. The book wraps-up in chapter 7 with a dispassionate discussion animal experimentation using apes.Considering the 'Young Reader's' designation, I was impressed at how advanced the writing actually is. By today's standards, they must be very bright 'young readers' to handle this material easily. This book is suitable for adults and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Primates (Life Nature Library)","review":"ASIN B009OALEDE - LCCCN 68-24570. Does not say where the book was made/printed/manufactured. Pictorial hardcover, 128 pages. Part of the Life; Young Readers Library set. Published by Time-Life Books in 1968. By Erven DeVore and Sarel Eimerl.This interesting and educational book includes most important currently (in 1968) known bits of information about primates. Their origins, where they live now and where fossils indicate that they used to live, their relationships to each other and to man... From the politics of the monkey world to Ham, the monkey-astronaut, this book covers a lot in just 128 pages.So... if you're one of those parents who believe in the current anti-science crusade of certain Christian branches, you just go find another book for your child to read. This one includes the word \\"evolved\\" and several variations on the word \\"science\\" right on the first page. Most disturbing of all, for you, will probably be the sentence that says, in part \\"...the cells and blood of man and other primates are also closely related.\\" Run away before something bad happens, like your child accidentally learns reality.Now, for everyone else...There are a few issues with this book (and, one assumes, the entire series). The biggest one is that it's based on science and science changes as it learns - so some of this is outdated information. This edition, in fact, has a reference to a study of macaques that led to false conclusions - because science doesn't mind being wrong and appreciates its own evolution. But you might mind being outdated.The book is laid out more like a magazine than a good reference book, with tons of \\"sidebar\\" interruptions of the text-flow. The quality of the photos and illustrations is very 1968, so there's been room for improvement, on that front, in newer books. Kids (the younger, the more this is true) will like the pictures, of course. One weird thing - one \\"sidebar\\" that is focused on the changing hair color of a baboon infant is not in color. What's the thinking there?Not a bad book, just a bit out of date.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"The Primates (Life Nature Library)","review":"As a recent student in one of Irven Devore's courses, I found him to be an astute, witty, and engaging man who cared as much for his students as his research. He has the rare and admirable quality of being able to hold a roomful of football players spellbound with anthropological theory. Although we dissected the Yanomamo culture in depth, Devore hardly glorified Chagnon's study, or referred to the Yanomamo as an &quot;inherently savage&quot; people. In fact, he tended to be critical of Chagnon's methods and such broad cultural characterizations. As an anthropology concentrator with a primary interest in primate biology, I also feel I can safely attest that his knowledge of primates is likewise solid and I recommend his writing on them without reservation."},{"Title":"Programming with JFC","review":"Good JFC entry book with lots of simple but helpful examples, and helpful especially in light of JavaSoft's stingy documentation.

Familiarity with AWT is recommended to cruise through this book though."},{"Title":"Programming with JFC","review":"Programming with JFC focuses on the Swing component of the Java programming language. Swing is a toolkit that attempts to simplify and streamline the development of the windowing components, namely the visual components (such as menus, toolbars, dialog boxes, etc.) that are used in GUI-based programs. More information about Swing can be found at the Swing Connection home page at http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/index.html. If you are short on cash, you could glean the bulk of the information provided by this book from the free resources available on-line at the Swing Connection and save yourself nearly fifty dollars.While Java itself allows programs to be written once for different platforms, Swing components can be designed in such a way that they will execute without modification on any kind of computer with the identical look and feel of the operating system.As an example, when you create a program with Swing for Windows 95, it will have the look and feel of an application written specifically for Windows 95. When you run the same program under Solaris, it runs like an application written explicitly for Solaris.Programming with JFC begins with an overview of Swing programming and Swing specific component. The authors detail the difference between what the Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) offers as opposed to the Swing-based model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. More precisely, Swing sits on top of a number of the AWT API's.The majority of the book details the features set of Swing, from its user interface classes, to its controls and implementation. The authors start with simple controls before moving onto the more detailed issues of advanced controls such as trees and tables.The book comes with a CD-ROM (naturally) that includes numerous examples, source code and a library of ready-to-use GUI components. Also, similar material is also available via Swing Connection.Overall, the book provides an excellent introduction to JFC. While it is not a definitive or comprehensive guide to Swing, it does cover most of its important aspects."},{"Title":"Programming with JFC","review":"There is a lot it barely goes into.

However, if you're looking for a complete and authoritive reference on the Swing API, this is not it."},{"Title":"Programming with JFC","review":"This book takes an fairly substantial Java graphics API and demonstrates the &quot;How do I ...?&quot; tasks a typical programmer needs to know to start using this new and expanded GUI API. The examples are targeted to the specific task at hand, but are complete running examples one can quickly expand and modify. JFC merges graphics concepts and ideas from many different opposing factions (windows, motif, IFC, Java AWT 1.1, ...) and the authors have done an excellent job explaining the motivation behind what we see in the final JFC implementation. The design sections ending most chapters also offer guidance on how to build elegant GUIs, rather than just throwing together a bunch of widgets because one &quot;can&quot;.I needed to use the online JFC documentation in conjunction with this book. That is great since I typically program using the online doc. This also helped reduce the size of the book so the text can focus on orienting and guiding me through the doc,! rather than the usual &quot;core dump&quot; many similar Java books deliver.My only complaint is that the rudimentary graphics and minor typos in the text reflect what was probably a fairly rushed production job, which is par for the course lately for modern computer programming texts. The content of this book, however, reflects alot of deep consideration for the reader, in particular consideration for what a typical reader needs to experience and understand to get started programming with the JFC.Overall, an excellent filter!"},{"Title":"Programming with JFC","review":"This book was extremely helpful getting me started with Swing.

For a few successive nights, it brought me back to the time I shared with a beloved sister as caregivers, faithful visitors, and advocates for my Dad over the course of the year it took for him to die of stomach cancer. The author hits all the right notes when he writes of caregiver behavior and coping strategies, even humor. The theme of placating and seeking favors from every functionary along the way in Malady rings ever so true. No scheme or pretense is too low when the well-being of a loved one is at stake. I recommend it for anyone about to ride shotgun on the journey through Malady."},{"Title":"In the Country of Illness : Comfort and Advice for the Journey","review":"After hearing Lipsyte on NPR and as a recent emigrant into the country of Malady myself, I couldn't not read and now recommend this book. I laughed and cried with Mr. Lipsyte as he talked about his travels to Malady (the land of sickness)because I was able to identify with most of his experiences. Like his ex-wife, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Regardless of the prognosis, I truly believe that it is impossible to remain unscathed by the diagnosis of cancer or any other chronic or terminal condition. Like all of us travelers, Mr. Lipsyte has his own souveniers of his journey and he shares them with humor and sorrow, the two sides of the coin of malady. I laughed with him as he shared stories from the tumor ward and I cried with him as breast cancer consumed Margie. This book is important for anyone who is experiencing a longterm or chronic disease him/herself but it is equally important for the caregivers to appreciate fully their role in the disease paradigm."},{"Title":"In the Country of Illness : Comfort and Advice for the Journey","review":"I couldn't put this down. He made his time, and his ex-wife's times with cancer so vivid -- the doctors, the feelings, his relations with his family, the wild dark humor.

I went through cancer treatment recently -- chemo, surgery, radiation -- so maybe that's partly why it was so fascinating for me.

Written primarily for deacons, although invaluable to any person who's a member of the Episcopal Church USA or the Anglican Church of Canada, this little book is a how-to guide that spells out in great detail the liturgical functions of deacons. Different chapters focus on deacons in rites of Christian initiation, the Eucharist, ordinations, seasonal celebrations, daily office, and various pastoral liturgies (marriages, reconciliations, burials). If you're looking for a book that explores the theology and spirituality of the diaconate, this isn't the one. But it is an excellent guide for appropriate diaconal participation in liturgy--actually, the best--and it doesn't pretend to be anything else."},{"Title":"Deacons in the Liturgy","review":"DEACONS IN THE LITURGY is written for Anglicans/Episcopalians in North America. As such, it will be of interest primarily to people of that communion. That does not stop it from having a wider appeal.What this book does so well and so simply is explain the role of the diaconate in the various liturgies of the church. It tells what to do and when to do it providing an expansion to the rubrics of the BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER. It does not delve very much into history but does bring history up to justify certain acts. It explains the diaconal functions from an ancient and ecumenical context and then makes some provision for modern practice and usage. At all stages, the relevant passages from the BCP and other US and Canadian resources are referenced. It is a great guide for Anglican deacons but it has more potential as well.Without explicitly saying so, the book describes many functions that have wider acceptance than just the Anglican Communion. Usually, these are evident by the lack of specific citations but they should be readily apparent to anyone with a passing knowledge of liturgy. This helps to differentiate denominational practice from wider practice and this book is simple enough, short enough and well written enough to be of use to others. This is especially true for United Methodists.The United Methodist Church revived the permanent diaconate in 1996. Since the most recent BOOK OF WORSHIP was published in 92, it has no knowledge of deacons in liturgical functions. They are left to founder or make things up as they go along. The institutional United Methodist Church needs to address this problem but this book would be an excellent stopgap measure for UM deacons. This is especially true since UM liturgy is inherited from the Church of England.A Must for Deacons!"},{"Title":"Deacons in the Liturgy","review":"Morehouse Press is one of the major publishers for things Episcopal, so it makes sense that Ormande Plater's book, 'Deacons in the Liturgy', would be published by them. This is a book designed to be used by those preparing to be (or who are) deacons in the Anglican/Episcopal tradition. It looks specifically at the role of deacons in the liturgical practice of the church - liturgy here defined as the order or worship; deacons do have roles (indeed, more important roles) outside of the worship-service-liturgical functions, but this book concentrates on the in-church-worship role.This book grows out of a process begun in 1980 in response to the adoption of the new Book of Common Prayer version in the Episcopal church, and an expanding view of what deacons do. This is a specialised ministry, to be sure, but it is also an important ministry that serves as a bridge in some ways - 'by working together in liturgy, deacons and others symbolise the mission of the chruch in the world.'After brief historical introduction, Plater covers many of the aspects of the diaconate - appropriate action and role in ministry of the Word and ministry of the sacrament; proper vestments and gestures, the relationship of deacons to other ministers, and the variations that take place in the different seasons, services, and occasions.For being such a short text (a mere 70 pages of actual text), it is remarkably comprehensive in scope for the kinds of 'choreography' and activity of deacons in worship services. It is not intended to be a survey of theological questions of the role of the diaconate, nor an historical overview (though some of that does introduce the text) - for these topics, the reader will need to look elsewhere. However, for the task Plater set for himself - a full and useful description of the deacons' role, this text succeeds brilliantly."},{"Title":"Deacons in the Liturgy","review":"I finally found the book i was looking for.

Well worth the cost....Thanks Donna Hearn"},{"Title":"How To: Listen to God","review":"****Charles Stanley's \\"How to Listen to God\\" is this seasoned pastor's perspective on how to listen to God, written definitely from the perspective of a Christian fundamentalist with a life based fully on the Bible. If you are interested in this point-of-view, you will certainly enjoy this book. It is simple and perfect for the ordinary Christian desiring to be closer to God. It covers topics like how God gets our attention, identifying the voice of God, obstacles to hearing God, and ways of listening.It does not consider other points-of-view, such as the New Age, or even more liberal Christian thinking. It is basic and down-to-earth, fully grounded in a literal interpretation of the scriptures. It is a short and easy read.I received the book as a gift and really enjoyed it. Although I am not a fundamentalist, I thought there was much to be gained, learned, and appreciated from reading it.Recommended.****"},{"Title":"How To: Listen to God","review":"Wow. If I could rate this book, I would give it 5 stars! It gives clear, step-by-step instructions on how to listen to God and discern His voice.

However, I do believe that Dr. Stanley is a devout, God-fearing teacher, author, and pastor who does his best to follow after God's plan for his life. Therefore, I believe this is a reliable source.

Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"How To: Listen to God","review":"This is a list of the bad reasoning in this book:1) On page 9 he says, \\"if our relationship with him is a one way trip and the Lord Jesus Christ, then there isn't much fellowship.\\" The problem with that is that only applies to non-Christians, Scripture however teaches that the Holy Spirit does communicate with our spirit and intercedes on behalf of it. Furthermore he implies that if there is no audible communication or extra-biblical communication that we aren't fellowshipping with God, however that isn't what Scripture teaches. According to the Christian Scholar and educator James Strong (author of the famous book Strong's Concordance), fellowship means:1. fellowship, association, community, communion, joint participation, intercoursea) the share which one has in anything, participationb) intercourse, fellowship, intimacy2) He said, \\"The second reason God still speaks today is that we need his definite and deliberate direction for our lives\\" yet strangely, Charles says that the Bible is direction for our lives. But is the Bible not deliberate or definite? It's NOT accidental and indistinct is it?3) He said, \\"I realized that God was trying to get my attention through my body, but I wasn't listening.\\" And what's his evidence that God was trying to say, \\"Hey Charles you feel worn out because I want you to rest and stop talking about me.\\" That's not a sentence in the book but I say it to make a point. Charles doesn't give any evidence as to how he knew. But then goes on to say, \\"after I spent several weeks fasting and seeking to know the mind of the Lord\\" does anyone see anything wrong with that? I can: You can know the mind of the Lord from Scripture, the whole book shows how God thinks and what how he wants us to live. He then says, \\"I had been rather restless in my spirit and knew God was up to something but I didn't know exactly what.\\" Again, what's his evidence that God was \\"up to something\\". That sentence also implies God ceases to have control over things, wrong, as Scripture teaches, God is always in control, he doesn't stop now and then (and the rest on the seventh day was him resting from CREATING, not controlling.)4) He then said, \\"Then one night, out of desperation, I cried out to God, asking his purpose.\\" Besides that being a badly worded sentence (God doesn't have a purpose, he always existed, no one created him, but obviously Charles meant what God's purpose for him was), he claims he doesn't know God's purpose (for Charles.) Hello? This is what God says, \\"Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.\\" - Ecclesiastes 12:13, and what commandments? Love the lord your God with all your heart, and love your neighbor as yourself, and to \\"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.\\" - 2 Timothy 4:2. There, that's our purpose in life. But Charles isn't content, no, he's shows he's full of anxiety.5) After that sentence Charles said, \\"God replied quickly and bluntly, 'I am going to move you.' I said, 'When?' In a split second the word September flashed across my mind, and immediately my burden was lifted...\\" Well it sure would be lifted if you felt you finally got what you were looking for.6) He then said, \\"God revealed Himself, not because I was seeking a vision or a dream, but because I was seeking his mind.\\" Well, so, Charles sought his mind but got a VISION of \\"Semptember\\", and so Charles contradicted himself. So the \\"mind of God\\" was on Charles moving in September, and this is what Charles was dying over and fasting? Wow, that's really deep. Does Scripture give any examples of people going nuts like this in Scripture? NOPE, just the opposite, they were given, without asking, God's word or what they asked for.7) He then said, \\"It was a vision\\" see, he admits it was a vision \\"nevertheless, it was something God used to convince me He was involved in the business at hand.\\" Once again Charles shows forgetfulness that God is always involved, always in control, already told us how to live.8) Then, on page 15 he says someone asked him how much he was willing to sell his property for, and claims that God said to him, \\"Don't answer that\\" and that he later settled on a price for it and said, \\"I feel that the outcome was the one that pleased God.\\" So, Charles, assumed \\"move\\" meant move his property to live somewhere else, not move to a hotel for a few days to preach the word. He FELT not KNEW that what happened was what God meant by move. Well that is really assuring isn't it, to be told to do what cults do, to merely rely on your heart and a guess.9) Charles also claims in this book that you can know God's will by circumstances (which is a seemingly common teaching used by many good pastors unfortunately.) The problem with that teaching is that it is only true if Scripture refers to the circumstances, for example specific signs, but if you see 10 red cars in a row, what is God saying by that, that he wants you to buy ten red cars?Does it say anything about God audibly saying anything to a person's physical body, or chatting with him? No, because that isn't what it is, and God does not say to seek to \\"hear / listen\\" to him in such a way. It amounts to fortune telling of a sort."},{"Title":"How To: Listen to God","review":"This book is another example of narrow minded Christian fundamentalism deadening the vital subject of prayer.

I always like to read up on places before I visit them and since I generally travel as independently as reasonably possible, so I like to take a map.Maps of such countries are never as detailed as one might expect in more industrialized countries, but of course, that's usually why one's going there in the first place.This map is certainly as good as the rest, if not better, and a useful addition to the travel documentation a prepared traveler would like to have with them."},{"Title":"Bhutan Map by ITMB (Travel Reference Map)","review":"I am going to Bhutan and was anxious to see a map to really see where I was going. It was just adequate. I think a map for such a mountainousregion should be more topographical with elevations shown. It would be better with valleys and mountains more clearly delineated. I guess there is not much out there for maps of Bhutan, but it could be some much better. The back of the map is absolutely blank and could be filled with either information or photos of the highlights of the country with map coordinates so you would know where to find them."},{"Title":"Bhutan Map by ITMB (Travel Reference Map)","review":"The mapmakers drew the international borders on the map to include the Indian province of Sikkim (which borders directly on Bhutan) as part of China. I'm not sure if this is a careless mistake or reflects some sort of pro-Chinese orientation by the publisher, ITM. China had laid claim to Sikkim until quite recently, but de facto control and de jure sovereignty has been British and then Indian without interruption for at least a century. Furthermore, Chinese maps submitted recently to India include Sikkim within Indian borders, despite still laying claim to parts of India's Arunachal Pradesh state. If the mistake is one of carelessness, it's a pretty major one."},{"Title":"Bhutan Map by ITMB (Travel Reference Map)","review":"OK, Bhutan is one of the best trips you're ever going to go on in your life. If you're now thinking of getting this map, obviously you've already planned your trip.And basically, you have to have this map for a general sense of the country. You paid $4,000+ for your trip. Drop another $10 on the ONLY map available (you're not giong to find another map in Bhutan... believe me).But let's not pretend this map is accurate. Even though there are only a few roads in the country, they aren't accurately (or even near accurately) represented.But isn't that the fun and charm of it!? Our guides looked at the map in disbelief many times. And I smiled. Even a few cities on the map have been re-arranged!But if you're going to Bhutan, I'm going to guess you're not the typical, boring traveller that demands perfection at every turn!In summary, don't hike by this map (because you'll probably end up arrested by Chinease boarder authorities for not having a Visa) but enjoy this map and get it framed and placed on your wall when you return!"},{"Title":"Bhutan Map by ITMB (Travel Reference Map)","review":"While I have no particular fault to find, I found this map of limited use on my trip to Bhutan, esp compared to the handout maps we got from time to time from our tour guide etc. I dont think I would recommend it to any traveler on a tour group, but perhaps it would be of some use to persons making an off-road trek tour if their leaders were not furnishing their own maps.

Most fascinating to me are the stories of social insects, such as bees swarming around a hornet and producing enough heat to &quot;fry them\\" or ants and fungus cohabitating. Also fascinating were the insects not normally thought of as social - but occurring in groups; such as 16,000 dung beetles on one elephant patty, and the communal tropical spider in groups of 165,000 in Mexico (sounds like a scene out of Harry Potter). The spiders of course aren't insects, but thrown in for good measure.There are also fascinating stories of extremes such as the Saharan silver ants that survive in 140 degree F heat. Also interesting are tales of the entomologist, Dr. Raffensperger, the consulting insect detective, or the conservation biologist who is willing to doom the &quot;Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly&quot; to extinction.

Simeons is a revolutionary conceptwhich covers eating mechanisms and the processof dispelling abnormal fat from the body.Dr.Simeons begins by explaining how pre-Neolithichumans ate only when hungry. Much of the foodwas raw and unrefined like fruits, veggies, nutsand seeds.The whole structure of the human digestive systemis very much like a rat or pig. The process of eatingis adjusted to continuous nibbling on tidbits ratherthan gorging on lavish meals and huge portionsof food. The modern way of eating burdens thedigestive system according to Dr. A.T.W. Simeons.Dr. Simeones explains that there are three kindsof fat. Structural fat is needed to cushionvital organs; otherwise, a tap to the stomachcould kill you. Normal fat reserves are localizedthroughout the body on every limb. Abnormal fatis locked away in fixed deposits. This fat is themost difficult to shed for dieters everywhere.Abnormal fat is responsible for morbid obesity.Historically, various theoretical notions havefailed in the actual execution of weight lossattempts. Thyroid modulation deals with normal fataccumulation not abnormal deposits. Dr. Simeonesfound that there is no evidence to suggest thatexcess adrenalcortical activity occurs inobese patients.Dr. Simeons explains that there are three theoriesof obesity. The first is that fat banking capacityis low at birth. This explains why siblingswho eat the same food at the table have vastlydifferent weight experiences during life. Some getfat while others do not. The second reason is thelowering of a previously normal fat banking activity.The third reason is analogous to the poor persongetting fat and rich. While poor, he can't affordto luxuriate on processed foods. A rich person tendsto eat more refined foods and larger portions.On a small daily dose of HCG( Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin), patients couldsubsist on 500 calories a day and lose a pound a dayunder strict medical supervision. Patients who needto lose 15 pounds or less require 26 days treatmentand daily injections of HCG for 23 days. HCG putsabnormal fat back into circulation-something thatmany diets fail to do. Patients with over 15 poundsto lose can take 40 HCG injections in the first round.Limiting HCG injections to 40 prevents developingan immunity to the HCG injections.Patients with one hundred or more pounds to losehave multiple administrations of HCG at 40 dosesof injections for each administration. Some exerciseduring treatment facilitates weight loss andmuscle toning. Again, strict medical supervision isrequired- especially for morbidly obese patients.The HCG injections and diet protocol may not beindicated for patients with cardiovascularor gallbladder problems. Contraindicationsexist for pregnant patients as well. That'swhy strict medical supervision is required byresponsible practitioners.Pounds and Inches-A New Approach to Obesity isa wonderful medical resource on weight managementunder the strictest medical supervision with acarefully crafted regimen of HCG injections, carefullyportioned diets and strict clinical supervision everystep of the way. Dr. Simeons is a pioneer in the studyof body metabolic systems.He discovered the use of injectable atebrin for malariafor which he was awarded a Red Cross Order of Merit,and also a new method of staining malaria parasitesnow known as \\"Simeons' stain.\\" 1)In addition, Dr. Simeones made historic contributionsin the treatment of the bubonic plague and leprosy.References:1) Hcgobesity.org by Dr. Simeones"},{"Title":"Pounds and inches;: A new approach to obesity","review":"This book involves the memoirs of the pioneering work of using a highly precise and sophisticated 500 calorie diet and the use of the HCG hormone, to shift the body into burning fat rather than abnormally storing it, which is the obsity condition and has nothing to do with how much body fat a person carries. In theory even an underweight person can have \\"obesity.\\"The book is amazingly 40 years old.

But what they failed to realize that this book is meant to be nothing more then a reference book. Perhaps if they had paid attention to the product description, they would have been prepared.A thing to keep in mind, anytime an O'Reilly book has &quot;...in a Nutshell&quot; after the title... it's a reference book. Pure and simple. Say it with me, people. R-E-F-E-R-E-N-C-E. Not to be confused with &quot;Master TCL/TK in 24 hours&quot; or what have you.So, keeping that in mind, as a reference book, it does a fantastic job as the rest have stated. Makes for a good &quot;dictionary&quot; so to speak."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"This book really needs to be updated for the latest version of Tcl/Tk, as there have been a number of important additions since it was published in 1999. For example, all the new string commands and regular expression enhancements added in 8.1, the new file operations added in 8.3, and the new list commands added in 8.4, not to mention all the new Tk widgets (e.g. spinbox, panedwindow). To learn about all the new features, I'd recommend that you get the latest version of Brent Welch's \\"Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk\\" instead. The documentation that comes with Tcl/Tk is the ultimate authority, and is basically what this Nutshell book consists of, albeit for the old 8.0 version. It's basically just a copy of the old manual pages.I think this book is just too old to be useful anymore, especailly since if you have Tcl/Tk installed then you already have all the current documentation. And there are virtually no examples given. The Chapter on The Tcl C Interface is basically the contents of the tcl.h header file. One reason I give it 2 stars instead of just 1 is that it does have some chapters on some popular Tcl/Tk extensions, like Expect, Tclx, Tix and Blt, even though they're pretty much just the manual pages for those extensions."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"this is the tcl book i keep handiest, even though it doesn't offer me much of anything beyond the manual pages. what it does offer is a compendium of tcl, tk, expect, tix, blt, itcl, itk, tclx, and the like's references.i've always been disappointed in tcl's online documentation. you can easily reproduce the lion's share of this book by just printing out the manual pages. however, having them bound and handy can be a relief. it does include some sample code (which you can typically find online), adding some value.it's a nutshell book, though, and nutshell books are typically like this. o'reilly's had this series for years and they've always been of questionable value for some people (myself included). you wont learn a language this way, you wont even improve your programming this way, you'll just have a handy printed reference manual. i haven't yet found it to be incorrect (but i didn't go looking), so that's got to say something.don't pay full price for this one."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"If you need some hand-holding and are just getting started with TCL then this book is not for you. Tcl/TK in a nutshell is exactly what the title says, a desktop quick reference.Don't expect many examples or explanations.Compared to Perl / C style languages TCL is a little weird to look at and takes some getting used to. And it's easy to get tripped up if you aren't already experienced with the language. A lot of the material in the book doesn't go any deeper than the TCL man pages. So beginners, get a different book / tutorial to learn the language.If you are proficient in TCL than this book would make a great reference, but as a beginner (to TCL, not to programming) a lot of times I had to supplement what the book gave by searching the web for examples to making things clearer. But it is definitely useful for looking up rarely used / obscure commands that you may have forgotten.Even though the book lacks a lot of examples and hand holding it is very comprehensive and covers a lot of material."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"An excellent reference for Tcl, Tk, the C interfaces, Expect, [IncrTcl/Tk], Tix, TclX, BLT, OraTcl, SybTcl, &amp; TclOdbc. Sure it doesn't cover everything that everyone will use, but that's not really possible.My only real complaint has to do with the books formatting. For most commands, the formatting is fine, but for commands with subcommands (such as string), the subcommands are unnecessarily hard to read.With that one exception, this is my favorite Tcl Book."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"The book has lots of information but one has to go through lots to loops to get to where the information should be and then it may not be there.E.g., the index has no mention of the 'wm' command--one that I often encounter.E.g., another book implies that there is a canvas command 'delete all'. After I finally got to page 61, I found the 'delete' command but NOT any hint that one can use the 'all' command to delete all the objects on the canvas.Another example, even though the book purports to cover TK--the visual side of the language--I find just one chart, .Needless to say, there are very few examples."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"As a reference goes, this is pretty good. I've noticed a certain hit or miss aspect of the O'Reilly Nutshell series. This one is more of a hit for me personally. Still, I'm already bumping into things I wish this book covered. stooop, for one thing. There isn't much here that you won't find in the online documentation, but it can be very nice to have a paper copy.Basically, this book was what I was expecting it to be. Nothing more, nothing less."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"The guys at O'Reilly have come up with a fairly decent reference for TCL/Tk. It covers a lot of info about the script (core language, various interfaces, and Expect). But, they forgot the most important interface of all: Jacl - the Java interface for TCL. I use this part of the lanuage all of the time. Java is so popular, I don't understand how they could miss such an important feature. It is still a good book, but only 3 stars this time. Maybe they will get it right in the next edition."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"I usually find O'Reilly books excellent but this one is a disppointment. You could print out the Tcl manual pages and get as much information. Examples are few and meager. There should at least be a brief primer, with examples, to get the reader accustomed to the Tcl way of doing things. There's a tips and hints chapter at the end that's good, but it's all too short."},{"Title":"Tcl/Tk in A Nutshell","review":"\\"TCL/TK in A Nutshell\\" is an excellent reference book with comprehensive detail.

You aren't left wondering about anything.Some of the elements of this story parallel her own life such as being a minister's daughter and a librarian. I felt uplifted after reading this. The heroine is so unrepentantly cheerful and, of course, there is a wonderful happily ever after.The story is about a young woman, left all alone in the world after the death of her father, who goes to work in a city library, working her way up to being in the children's section. She lives in a boarding house and works many hours so her youth is slipping away. She doesn't have time for socializing. She wishes for a husband who won't take up too much of her time and a rose garden.Because she is so cheerful, an opportunity comes her way to marry a man she has never met......I'm going to stop there because I don't want to spoil this story for anyone reading this review. Download this story. It won't take much of your time and is well worth the little bit of time it takes to read it. I liked this story so much I had to know more about the author.Margaret Widdemer wrote this story in 1915 and they actually made it into a film in 1917! She was born in 1884, married at the age of 35 in 1919 and that same year she won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry for her collection \\"The Old Road to Paradise\\". She was a fairly prolific author of both poetry and fiction, both adult and children's.In her memoir \\"Golden Years I Had\\", written in 1964, she wrote of her friendships with such literary greats as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thornton Wilder, Ezra Pound and more.I highly recommend this story and I'm just sorry it's taken me so long to discover her works. I actually like her work as much as Kate Chopin's (though it's very different. I found Chopin to be much \\"darker\\".)Best of all, you can find much more from this author here on Amazon and much of it, if not all, is FREE!Give her a try.

She is offered a different future by clients who believe she may be able to help a young man and his mother. Phyllis has just wished for a home and a rose garden, and if necessary a husband that can help her have both. God does answer prayers.....The story was charming and very sweet, problems and resolutions were handled well and the plot was also very good, the only comment, I can make is some of the descriptions of the childrens ethnic background would be viewed as politically incorrect today. If you feel that it will offend you, I would not read this."},{"Title":"THE ROSE-GARDEN HUSBAND","review":"I only wish I could give it six stars! Margaret Widdemer has an unusual and winsome writing style that won me over instantly. For example, she writes of the heroine, \\"But indeed there was something very gay and sweet and honest-minded about the girl, a something which gave people the feeling that they were very wise in liking her.\\" (Interesting, that very description suits Widdemer as well...) It makes me wonder how I graduated with an English degree without hearing of this author, who regularly rubbed shoulders with F. Scott Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot, and other such giants. Can hardly wait to get my hands on her other works.This utterly charming book (written in 1915) tells the story of a young career woman who finds herself in an unusual marriage arrangement that turns out quite differently than she planned.

Punch-outs are cardboard characters or vehicles that you &quot;punch out&quot; of the page and set up in scenes. This particular book is one of the best. It contains 14 Jedi and 2 Sith characters. Namely, Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, the entire Jedi Council (including Yoda!), Darth Maul, and Darth Sidious. they are beautifully drawn and painted. The exciting thing is this: the book includes a backdrop of the Jedi Council chamber. And Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul, and about half of the Jedi Council have their light sabers drawn! This is the scene you can create, where the Sith infiltrate the Jedi Council's Chamber! Okay, my imagination is running wild, but that is what Punch-outs are for.

In this book, he gathers a series of oral statements from divorcees, as well as from experts -- divorce lawyers, a divorce judge, a psychologist, a sociologist. His book is a portrait of modern divorce in our country through the eyes of its pained subjects, but on a deeper level is driven and informed by Feifer's personal search to understand his own experience - at least that's my sense of it. To me, this gives the book a force and trajectory missing from the more academic but also excellent book \\"Uncoupling,\\" also about the divorce experience.People who have gone through, or are considering, divorce or separation will find a lot here to which they can relate. All types are represented here, from wealthy to working class, ranging from people who were abusive or abused, to people who were sympathetic and understanding of their ex-spouse's pain to the point of tragedy, even while they made hard decisions about their personal futures. A recurrent theme in a majority of the cases is that people had a nagging feeling that something, somewhere, about the relationship wasn't quite right BEFORE they embarked on marriage.Anyone going through this painful process will find people or stories here, or parts of stories, with which they can identify."},{"Title":"The World of William Penn","review":"Genevieve Foster has the unique ability to take the reader on a journey into the world of various people, but in this work it is William Penn.

Published here are only the nine &quot;Dublin Discourses&quot; from Part I on &quot;University Teaching&quot; and but four of the ten chapters of Part II, &quot;University Subjects Discussed in Occasional Lectures and Essays.&quot; For the hundred-page displacement of Newman's essays, the editor substitutes five interpretive essays supposedly inquiring into the relevance of Newman's book for today's higher education debates. These interpretive essays have major inconsistencies and repetitions among themselves and are of mixed quality, with inaccuracies and serious misunderstandings of some of Newman's central ideas. As accurate forays of the Newmanian mind into the twentieth- and twenty-first century university, only the engaging and intellectually challenging essays by George Marsden and George Landow succeed.

My anticipation was rewarded by an interesting seven-page introduction.However, the endnotes by Svaglic are of such great value in understanding the Newman's references to then-present and past events and authors and even in translating some of his Latin that I greatly prefer that edition.

Now, with all universities being forced to rethink their own identity and mission, the values which Newman enuntiated for them over 100 years ago will return to guide their reinvention in our own day. Or, they can return, if they are given the chance. Yale University is to be commended for putting Newman's ideas on the university back on the table in such a splendid format. Every aspect of this work deserves praise, from the editor's introduction and special footnotes, to the analytical essays which merit a careful reading in their own right.

Newman is also careful to point out that the liberal arts and even theology may attempt to establish a single, inadequate framework for the discovery of truth.Newman's complex epistemology does not fall prey to the heresy that truth is not one, but reminds us that in our present state, truth present various aspects and that the tyranny of any particular branch of knowledge is the victory of ignorance."},{"Title":"The idea of a university: Defined and illustrated : I.

He wrote many influential books, such asApologia Pro Vita Sua (An Image classic),An essay in aid of a grammar of assent; (A Doubleday image book), etc.He wrote in the Preface to this 1853 book, \\"The view taken of a university in these discourses is the following: that it is a place of teaching universal knowledge... it is the diffusion and extension of knowledge rather than the advancement. If its object were scientific and philosophical discovery, I do not see why a university should have students; if religious training, I do not see how it can be the seat of literature and science. Such is a university in its essence, and independently of its relation to the Church.\\"He argues that in an institution in which \\"nothing is professed, nothing is taught about the Supreme Being... then the institution in question professes every science, and yet leaves out the foremost of them... it is very plain that a Divine Being and a university so circumstanced cannot co-exist.\\" (Pg. 65) He states his opinion that \\"the Church's true policy is not to aim at the exclusion of literature from secular schools, but at her own admission into them.

So, if you buy a book on Visual Studio, what you normally get is a single language view of the product, with an assortment of small examples in other languages thrown in for good measure.John Mueller has gotten past the single language perspective in his book. What you'll see is examples where all of the languages are used together to create a complete application. The examples are non-trivial and well designed. John also makes it clear as to why he chose a specific language for a given task. While this book didn't necessarily teach me as much as I would have liked in new programming techniques, it taught me something much more important, how to make best use of Visual Studio as a whole.There are some real plusses in this book. I found the examples all concentrate on the enterprise, rather than on the desktop. That's a real advantage because I don't write many desktop applications anymore. I also enjoyed all of the tips and especially the Web site pointers.About the only omission in this book is a lack of any FoxPro coverage. I don't consider this a very big loss because FoxPro is hardly a good choice for enterprise applications, especially new development. The author's choice of SQL Server is a good one."},{"Title":"Visual Studio 6: The Complete Reference","review":"The title of this book is completely wrong. For one thing, itsensibly rejects Visual Foxpro and uses SQL Server instead. Inaddition, the book is oriented toward team development, not the individual developer. I probably would have called this book Team Developement for Visual Studio 6 or Enterprise Development for Visual Studio 6.Once you get past the title and accept the book for its intended use, you'll find that it's a real gem. I found that I got a lot of very good team development strategies, along with good tips on what to avoid. I also loved the Web site pointers--they've really made it easier to find what I need quickly. The tips and notes were well thought out and have helped me to avoid many programming pitfalls.The example programs aren't as complex as I would have liked, but they were adequate to demonstrate how to use the various pieces of Visual Studio together in a team environment. I feel the author was trying to make this a problem solving book, but failed to convey that as clearly as he should have. The book contains outstanding troubleshooting information, but you have to dig a little too hard to find it at times.I gave this book five stars for several reasons, but the most important is that the author has provided the team development information that Microsoft failed to provide.

The chapters are fairly short and readable--this is no heavy, dry academic tome, although you'd have to be a complete bore to make this subject anything less than fascinating--at least for me. There's not much of hell at all in the Bible; most of our perceptions of hell were indeed formed by Milton and Dante and other works outside the Christian biblical canon. Turner concentrates on how images of the infernal place have changed over centuries, and how our philosophies of what is human, what is good, etc. change and adapt. She's a sharp, insightful writer, although I suspect her sometimes irreverent, agnostic tone may turn off some readers. I could be wrong though! I recommend this along with Jeffrey Burton Russell's &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (perhaps the single best book on the Devil himself, from 1988); Paul Carus' &quot;The Devil&quot;; and Lauren Paine's &quot;The Hierarchy of Hell.&quot; Together these books are a long gaze into the abyss...."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"Alice Turner's \\"History of Hell\\", while a seemingly glossy coffetable book, turns out, in fact, to be a well written introduction to the history and mythology of the Underworld as it appears throughout many cultures and religions over the past 5000 years.The book begins with the earliest recorded tradtions of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Egyptians and their ideas of the afterlife and the Underworld and how these notions greatly influenced later cultures and religions like Ancient Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christiantiy, and Islam. She relates the traditions of the Greco-Roman Underworld and all the attendant gods and goddesses and how it is with Greek and Roman literature that the Infernal regions begin to grow in prominence. It is however in Chritianity that the notion of an Infernal Underworld of pain, torture, and enternal suffering for sinners and evil-doers comes to the real forefront. Christianity is the only religion that seems to place such heavy emphasis on the existence of a place of eternal damnation, where demons torture the souls of the deceased and the Devil presides over all. Turner examines the literature of St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Dante, Milton, and others, as the myths of Hell grow and change over time to become the popular notion we still hold today of Hell as a place of fire, brimstone, and torment, as well as the effect of art in the common perceptions of Hell. It is quite an intersting fact that while we should aspire to the paradise of Heaven, it is the Inferno that continues, after all this time, to fascinate and captivate our imaginations."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"The subject matter on this book is, by nature, rather on the dark side. I had to take it in small doses because it can be depressing to focus heavily on this sort of thing. On the other hand, it was well researched, thorough, and highly-informative.Where I think Ms. Turner lost some direction is in her conclusion that Christianity teaches the doctrine of a fiery, burning hell. Yes, I know - many churches in Christendom do teach this as a doctrine - and most Bible translations translate the original language words 'hades', 'Gehenna', and 'sheol' as \\"Hell\\" or \\"Hellfire\\". but with careful (and honest) research, it becomes apparent that Bible translators (Not the bible writers)have been heavily influenced by paganism and writers such as Dante (1265 to 1321 AD).Consider, for example one of the Greek words translated as \\"Hellfire\\": 'Gehenna' This is the Greek spelling of the Hebrew, \\"ge-Hinnom\\", or the \\"Valley of Hinnom\\". This valley, located southwest of Jerusalem, takes its name from a man, whose name was Hinnom and his sons who apparently came to own this property. It was in this valley that wicked kings, Ahaz and Manasseh sacrificed their children in the fire as an offering to Baal (2 Chronicles 28:3; 33:6). Of this practice, God said, \\"To burn their sons and their daughters with fire, which I did not command, nor did it come up on My heart.\\" (Jeremiah 7:31). In this valley, these kings also practiced witchcraft, sorcery, divination, and also built up \\"high places\\" in worship of false Gods. Later, Josiah had parts of this valley polluted to render it unfit for any such practices in the future. In Jesus' day, the Valley of Hinnom was being used as a garbage dump.There is a curious anomaly however, that seems to affect many, if not most translations of the Bible. Using the King James Version as an example, in the Hebrew Old Testament, the words ge-Hinnom occur thirteen times, and each time, it is translated as the \`valley of Hinnom'. Yet, when the Hebrew words ge-Hinnom are transliterated into Greek, Gehenna, the KJV translators consistently render the word as \`Hell'. Why is this word recognized as a geographical region in the Old Testament, but, in the New Testament, as a place of fiery burning torment? Is there a valid basis for the \\"hell fire\\" rendering? To answer those questions, we need to look carefully at the Bible passages in which it occurs, the context of the time, and also at the audience to whom those words were addressed.Of the twelve New Testament passages where Gehenna is used, eleven are in the synoptic gospels - Matthew, Mark, and Luke. All of these quote Jesus' words. The other Gehenna passage is in James 3:6. Of these verses, five mention fire as an element of Gehenna. The sense of judgment, condemnation, or destruction is present in most of these verses. Probably, for this reason, translators take the passages as a metaphor or description of \`hellfire', but is it possible that there could be another explanation that better harmonizes with God's quality of love? Yes.Keep in mind that this is a Hebrew word, and, in each case, Jesus was speaking to Jews. These Jews were certainly familiar with Jerusalem and its surroundings, including the nearby Valley of Hinnom, which, as previously stated, was used as a garbage dump. Here, fires were constantly kept burning as a means of consuming the refuse and the smoke from those fires would have been an constant feature of itspresence, and visible from considerabledistance. Sulfur, or brimstone was regularly thrown into the fires to accelerate the burning. That which was not destroyed by the fire was eaten by the worms or maggots, thus Jesus' words in Mark 9:47, \\"where their worm is not dying and the fire is not being quenched.\\" must be taken as a literal description of conditions in the Valley of Hinnom. But how is that connected with the idea of punishment?The fact is that, not only trash was consumed in the fires of Gehenna, but also the carcasses of animals and the bodies of executed criminals were thrown into the fires to be burned up and forever destroyed. Never were live people thrown into Gehenna to be tortured. In Jewish belief, future life depended upon the restoration of the whole person through a resurrection. Normally, dead bodies were always buried - never cremated, to allow for this resurrection to take place. To completely destroy a person's body in Gehenna meant that he was considered unworthy of being resurrected at any time in the future. To be thrown into Gehenna would, to Jesus' Jewish listeners, signify a permanent death without any hope of future life, forever cut off from God. There could be no worse punishment than this.I could address the word hades also, but space does not permit here.The point is: Christendom's doctrine of Hellfire is based on pagan influences and tradition - but it is not a Biblical teaching.Maybe Ms. Turner should consider adding a statement in her book to the effect that Christendom adopted their hellfire beliefs from ancient non-biblical sources. On the other hand, anyone reading this book should logically come to that conclusion on their own."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This is not a new book; I dug it from my shelves just to write this review. It's not a scholarly-looking book; the oversize cover, glossy pages, and color pictures on every other page make it look more like a children's book than a theological treatise. It's not the work of a notable scholar; Ms. Turner is better known for her fiction and as an editor for Playboy. So what is this review doing on my blog today?Against all odds, this is an important book about an important topic. Is it Alice's fault that she manages to turn it into a fun read as well?The History of Hell begins at the beginning, with the earliest religious beliefs of an underworld. You'll explore the Egyptian Book of the Dead and Zoroastrianism. You'll move forward in time to the Greek understanding of Hades, the Platonic description of Hell, and the Hebrew teachings of Sheol. As these ideas merge into one, you begin to see glimpses of today's Christian version of Hell emerging.In time, Purgatory arrives. Christian ideas continue to evolve through the centuries, giving birth to artwork and stories like Dante's Inferno, as imaginations let loose. Satan, once destined to chains in a dark netherworld transforms before your eyes into an evil taskmaster. Now, trident in hand, he gleefully tortures lost souls in a lake of fire forever and ever, amen.You continue to travel through the Middle Ages, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, through the 19th century, and on into today's time, as Hell continues to evolve. Why is this journey important? Why put yourself through Hell? Because, as Christians, it's vitally important to our spiritual well-being to understand that we have made our own version of Hell. Ideas have evolved from the beginning of religion, and understanding this, knowing the \\"history of Hell,\\" can set you free from the undertow of today's spiritually-damaging teachings.And if you're going to take this frightful journey, you may as well make it an entertaining one. Pick up Alice's book."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"For someone who is looking to learn about a strange phenomenon that has interested many people including myself, then this is the book. The author gives a very complete factual account of how the different cultures have embraced the idea of the after life.

Overall, the book is great and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This is a wonderfully artistic treatment of Hell as a concept. It is clearly researched and presented just as the title says, a clearly defined historical presentation of just what the hell, Hell is supposed to look like and be like according to the available literature.It is a review of Hell with a multi-religious and cultural perspective.Most religions are clearly covered and their past and current viewpoints about what they consider to be the final resting place of the worlds evil people.It is loaded with artistic reproductions of most of the major painters' visions and interpretations of what Hell looks like.There are scenes aside from Dante and Dore to sample from.It reads well and there is always something to look at so it staves off the occasional boredom.Devils,demons,hells of all kinds as well as apocalyptic visions are here to peruse.This is a very good starting point for the study of Hell as a place,a concept,a possible reality after death.Turner does a good job. As others have mentioned,it could almost be a coffee table book because of its smooth,slick and colorfully, artsy presentation.This does not take away from its merit. Trust me it's a good book and definitely worth having.

However I still enjoyed reading this book, it made me a spiritually stronger Christian, I don't believe this was the purpose of this book that is just how I feel.

It starts out by having chapters on pre-Christ underworlds, including Eqyption and Greek. Then it moves from the beginging of Christian Hell, to our present day view of Hell, stopping to look at Dante's Hell, &quot;Paridise Lost&quot;, and much more. The pictures are excellent, and the book is stocked full of them. I was hoping for more information on pagan underworlds, but the book is entitled &quot;The History of Hell&quot; meaning basiclly the history of Christian Hell. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone that is interested in the many versions of Hell. This book is also extremely interesting for anyone interested in the darker side of classical literature; which is where the author pulls most of the examples from.The book is set up chronologically. The author cites many possible origins of hell as well as elucidating some delightful etymological roots of the word Hell. The book progresses throughout western history epoch by epoch, sometimes dedicating entire sections to authors like Dante and Goethe.The writing style, as addressed by former reviewers, is distracting only if you are looking for an academic tone, which it doesn't have. The writing style is more chummy, warm. I think it is more than appropriate considering the heavy subject matter that the author took on. The book overall is an enlightening piece of work that doubles as a wonderful reference for any history or literature students that may interested."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"All kidding aside, Turner's book really is a fine exploration of the ways in which hell--or, more properly, the underworld--has been viewed by various civilizations throughout history. Her account is scholarly enough to satisfy academics, but remains sufficiently fluid and compelling for the lay reader's tastes. Highly recommended for anyone interested in death rituals, the afterlife, or the formation of Christian doctrine."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"I was always fascinated by books about Hell, if only because it seems like such an interesting place. You just don't want to live there.History of Hell takes a look at the formation of Hell as \\"we\\" know it from ancient times to modern times. Okay, heavy on the ancient, light on the modern. But still, it's a fascinating look at how Hell evolved with the times.That said, this is not much of a history lesson. It's more a dumbed down guide to hell, with snarky side comments and pop culture references that I didn't get. Or were they historical references? Turner doesn't bother to explain -- because obviously I'm stupid (or she's smart).There are neat maps and color plates that elaborate on Hell and its denizens. The book gave some much needed objectivity to Dante's Inferno and it has a chapter dedicated exclusively to Mr. Alighieri. I was glad I read the book. It helped ground me for the work I'm doing on the Abyss D20 campaign supplement.Unfortunately, the book is falling apart. The middle pages (the color plates) have all fallen out. It's not a well-bound book.It's also not a particularly well-written book. I was shocked when I reached the end. There's no summary or conclusion, unless you count the brief, \\"lookit here, hell's in all this modern media\\" paragraphs. I expected a summary, a conclusion, a \\"So this is what we've learned about hell.\\" Instead, the book nearly stops in mid-sentence. It felt rushed.The History of Hell left me very unsatisfied. Since it's not a historical reference, I expected Turner to make a bit more of an effort.Worth reading? Definitely, especially if you were raised a Christian. But it's only an overview of the infernal -- almost as if Turner's afraid of offending somebody."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"One of the greatest and superb books that I have read dealing with mythology and religions that go into detail throughout the history of hell and the roles that it played while early, middle-age, and modern man viewed it as. Alice K. Turner must have done a lot of research in order to put this one together."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"Well I liked this unlike some of those who claimed that they did not like Ms. Turners writing style, she writes like a fellow traveler and classmate. She was an editor at Playboy! The hardcover edition is stocked with rich photos that make this a wonderful read, and the breadth of her survey is what makes this so wonderful, along with what I've said above. Yes, enter to the realm of Satan, did the other reviewer not think that I would know what that meant? Hail to the mighty Slayer..But anyways..Buy this, it makes wonderful dinner table, coffee-table discussion, and bed time sleepy time reading..Much love to Alice, keep on writing.."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"I bought this book thinking I would find buy a book packed full of information about hell, such as Dante's hell with its 8 or 10 circles. I believed it would go into detail about its torments, and such because thats what the title suggests, a history of the infernal. But I was sadly disappointed. The book mostly goes over myths, and through out the book the writer lightly sprinkles some information about hell. But you're lucky if she gets into detail about hell. I really have no idea why this book has so many high ratings. But since it has so few ratings, I guess thats a good reason. If you want a real history of hell, I am afraid that you wont find it in this book. DONT BUY IT."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This book is a witty and scholarly masterpeice"},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This book is not for everyone. The issues expressed by thisauthor's study raises on eyebrow for some, neck hairsfor others. I find this guide is great to really sift throughBible or whatever Hell-believing documents are about, and to see what it is we were raised to fear, and to see what it is that attracts us to horror books and flicks; and in short--to see beyond the pretensions! Religions are not the workings of God and the Goddess. For the most part, religious organizations move to the goals of men. We hope these men are of high ethics and moral. But hope isn't enough. People forget that none can stand between a soul and the creator. Hence there is a Hell."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"I totally forgot that I bought this book from Amazon. Then I saw it and realized, \\"oh yeah. If I bought this in an actual bookstore, my parents would find out!!!!\\" Actually, I accidentally gave this review 5 stars when I should have given it 1. There is far too much hell as history and far too little (read: none) recipes on demon-summoning. I got around this by dressing up my little brother as the devil and smearing him with pig's blood, but the effect was not the same.Only buy this if you're the nerdy kind of evil goth. I'm not."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This book is extremely confusing. She throws out so many names and religions in such a short frame that it's impossible to follow along. You basically have to already have a good knowledge of all the religions she is talking about to understand what is going on. I had no knowledge of any religions prior to reading this book and it left me very confused.I only managed to read about 60 pages before I had to completely stop. I cannot believe how many positive reviews this book has."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"Before purchasing this book I read the back cover, the table of contents, as well as the introduction and felt I had enough basic knowledge regarding the religions it covered. I concluded the Author added far too much \\"basic\\" religious background for the advanced student as well as not enough for the amateur student. It makes for a very interesting read, however, I gave it only 1 star due to the pretentious attitudes expressed in the 5 star ratings. I prefer to give another perspective from one \\"laymen\\" to another."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"I purchased this book decades ago. Ms. Turner's premise on hell is quite fascinating. She has presented documentation from the bible and other historical works. The subject of Hell is one which intrigues religionists, spiritualists, and secularists. Hell is not simply the provence of Christians, many groups have delineated its history.Pre-Christian societies, especially the ancient Egyptians, had their own definition of Hell. The ancient Jews called Hell, Sheol. Sheol was an ambiguous place where the dead, whether they were good or not, went. Hell really did not have a negative definition until early Christianity. It was Christianity who defined Hell as we all know it which a place of eternal damnation and punishment.However, it was Dante who really defined the concept of Hell in his book, THE DIVINE COMEDY. Dante was influential in making the concept of Hell quite a fearsome place to be. However, as humankind became more enlightened, the concept of Hell lost its prevalence for many of the population. Even though we are living in the postmodern era, the idea of Hell reigns in our subconsious. This book is quite an interesting read through the abyss."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"The whole western treatment of hell has eluded me. Even with the odd person suddenly freaking out about 2012. Now that Alice Turner has sort of mapquested some of the prominent features it has definition & form. The Greek myths are everywhere and whos who there and how to find the entrance and call Chiron turn up in novels, mysteries, movies, words, names, art, cartoons & music. Very prevalent part of our culture. So hades wasn't new information but I knew nothing about the history of antichrist, the harrowing, the end times & all of the different judgment time frames or who was judging who. Imagine my surprise to find Yahweh will judge the living & God judges the dead! The depictions have left & right sides to describe different events. And so on. Nice to have things cleared up instead of wondering what the terms meant. The pictures and writing style are very clear, not confusing at all and fresh & enjoyable. This is much better than an idiots guide and also I am saved from plowing through tomes of Graves & Campbell. The book doesn't pursue East Indian or Arab source material but does have well written quick few chapters to Assyrian & Zarathustra. Also if you are curious for the Eastern views of hell realms Jain, Tibetan, Nepalese, Hindi, Islamic, Shinto... look elsewhere. Aparently Nepalese & Tibetans have extensive well populated hell realms & Gods also. Amazing . Who knew? This was more than enough info & the perfect heads up for Western Hell."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"I am still reading this book. I love it so far. I have been looking for something that went deep into ancient cultures beliefs on the afterlife and how they compare to that of Christianity. She does a great job of showing how the different ancient cultures borowed and mixed their mythology and how it has affected Christianity. I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not having to look differently at their faith. There are so many similarities between these ancient &quot;myths&quot; and our Christian &quot;truths&quot;. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This is one book that I didn't read all the reviews (26) at my posting of mine. I bought the book 10 years or so ago. I pick it up and reread it from time to time. The illustrations are outstanding. The theology from a former editor of Playboy Magazine is highly commendable. When you study the graphic illustrations along with the historical information one easily grasps how hell has been so managed and abused by churches from the time it was sold as the tool of God to punish the wicked, whom he foreordained before the creation of the earth were to burn forever in its bowells, allegedly. As the author points out, it most likely is a creation of the Greeks and has nothing to do with Christian beliefs at the time of Christ, the early church, or the Apostle Paul. Hell is a \\"doctrine\\" brought into the church years post the apostolic churches. As she says on page 52: \\"The Christian doctine of hell certainly did not originate with Christianity's first theologian. Paul in three places lists those who will not be admitted to the kingdom of God: I Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph 5:5. They include unrepentant fornicators, idolators, adulterers, homosexuals, thieves, drunkards, slanders, swindlers, sorcerers, the envious, the quarrelsome, the indecent, and the greedy. Instead of condemning these wrongdoers to Hell, he taught that the 'wages of sin is death' (Romans 5:6), and that is what is meant by 'destruction'.\\"She presents all side of the topics and the history concerning an everburning hell. Very informative book with no particular bias on the part of the author other than giving a good history of the subject of hell."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"As a religion major, hell is one of my favorite subjects. I chose this book at random off the shelve & was quite happy that I did. A book about Hell for a gift idea or displaying it on your coffee table for guests might be a bit morbid for some people. However this book is more about Hell's history & its effect on our entire way of life. It's informative, up-to-date, well written & laid out, and has dozens of good points to make. The only thing I wish it included is the concept of Hell surrounding the East/Asia--this book focuses strictly on religions in the Western world."},{"Title":"The History of Hell","review":"This witty book was worth every penny.

Turner is an exquisite book detailing the numerous accounts of the &quot;evil side&quot; of the afterlife from the ancient Sumatrans belief in the underworld to the freudian account of hell is in man's mind. If for nothing else, the pictures and exquisite illustrations that accompany the pages of this book more then make up for its price. I felt as if I were looking back in time, and the comprehensive yet concise accounts of aferworldly visions and their evolutions through time was wonderful.

I'm currently using v5.0.1, and still find Hague's very book useful. If you bought v4.0 of Fusion, this book is _so_ much more helpful than the documentation that came with that version. There isn't much out there in terms of other help texts (the ...FOR DUMMIES text for FUSION is very subpar), so this seems to be one of the few alternatives to the packaged documentation. Let's hope Mr. Hague has a follow-up planned, because he writes well, and coincidentally is very helpful if you post him an e-mail asking for more insight. Even with the improvements with each successive version of the program, there is still plenty of similarity with FUSION 3, and the rest you'd probably be able to figure out on your own."},{"Title":"Fusion 3 Bible","review":"I think this book is just only a better revised version of the manual and it is (no doubt) helpful for the beginners, but when you think of Bible you need something more.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in web publishing using NetObjects Fusion."},{"Title":"Fusion 3 Bible","review":"Having worked with Fusion since 2.0 I've gathered most of the books on Fusion, to date this is the most through and best book I've seen. In addition to the explanation of basic subjects, there are hundreds of practical tips and techniques that make you more productive. The book also has detailed practical info on the NFX components and the use of Rich Media files. The layout and presentation of the book includes lots of screen shots and examples making it easy to follow in some of the technically dense areas of Fusion."},{"Title":"Fusion 3 Bible","review":"This is a good book for those wanting to learn Fusion 3.0. It completely covers navigating the menus and what each option is used for. The book does not contain anything that I would call &quot;advanced&quot;.

However I assume the that the author (David Hague) is an aethiest since he seems to attribute the terms 'inaccurate' and 'vague' to a bible.I friend of mine contracted David Hague to do some IT work for his small/medium business, and from what I've been told, this guy (David) shouldn't even be working in IT, let alone authoring a book on IT.

My copy of an earlier audio tape version proved to have been transferred at an incorrect speed, so that Martyn C Webster's original production sounded like monkeys chattering at the zoo. A second reason is that it marks the debut of playwright and broadcaster Peter Coke in the title role. Marjorie Westbury is here, of course, as Steve, a part she had already played for nine years.Frances Durbridge revised \\"The Gilbert Case\\" for a radio re-run in 1959, but this is the earlier version from 1954. His sleuth, Paul Temple, becomes involved in the Gilbert Case when a murder victim's father comes to him convinced that the man charged with the murder is innocent. It takes eight tightly scripted half-hour episodes for this belief to be tested, during which the Temples sip martinis and exchange affectionate badinage unscathed by the numerous attempts to blow them and their car to smithereens. Their escapades never take them far away from London in \\"The Gilbert Case\\".Restoration engineers have worked wonders to bring this earliest surviving Paul Temple radio series to acceptable quality. The sound is not quite as crisp as in the later radio cases. With the breaks between episodes edited out, the eight episodes have been made to fit onto 3 CDs."},{"Title":"Paul Temple and the Gilbert Case (Radio Collection)","review":"This was a lot of fun. Paul and his wife Steve remind me of Nick and Nora Charles(The Thin Man). If you like alot of twists and turns, and interesting characters, then you'll like this.

The BBC really does an excellent job with radio dramas."},{"Title":"Paul Temple and the Gilbert Case (Radio Collection)","review":"Paul and Steve work their usual magic trying to free a convicted man.

Pandora does not live up tp its predecessors at all. I found the book lacked the wit which abounds in her other novels; the chief problem in the novel is not the recovery of stolen art work, but the attempts of several characters(none of whom is very memorable) to carry on romance while avoiding incest! Many problems are left hanging, too many loose ends are not tidied up.Better luck next time!"},{"Title":"Pandora","review":"Jilly Coopers book Pandora is a very good read, set in the world of international art dealing with a mystery suspense plot woven in.

You might not know that it is from the eighties when this book first came out with some updates. The author does not cover any fluorescent lights at all which I think is crazy because these are important for young seedlings and clones. The hydroponics designs are from old nineteen seventies systems that no one uses any more and neither do I. The author says that clones degrade the more you take clones from a clone and then builds a breeding section around this mistake. The nutrient feeding techniques are sometimes untested. The author actually reprints the same mistake that marijuana book author Ed Rosenthal made for solving Mg problems. Do not use the Mg solver. It usually causes lock out and also over feeds them. Only one harvesting method is given out of a possible three or four that you could do. The problem solving plant nutrient problem pictures are interesting to look at in the book and probably the reason to get this book, but do not solve the problem just by identification using these illustrations. You would do better to pay attention to your feeding schedule and nutrient content. Mistakes can be forgiven but this update is not an improvement on the previous book. The shabby design gives the impression that it was done quickly and cheaply. The photographs are not bad but far from quality. There are frequent spelling mistakes and a lot of noise between the pages that brings down the quality of this read considerably. You would do better to make sure that you read up on other books if you decide to try this one out. It will be interesting to keep a copy of this one around just to compare it to the next update because this author needs to change quite an awful lot of the material here.

All information was at my fingertips making trouble-shooting with my garden a simple task. Also a delight to see all those full-color photos - why don't all grow books have these? They should! Thank you, Jorge, for this wonderful addition to my collection. You are, through your books, my personal grow Guru!"},{"Title":"Indoor Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor Bible","review":"This book will truly tell you what you need to know, but you'll have to hunt for it. It's packed with information but badly edited and the index is near useless. It's badly organized as well, so you might have to look in several places to find info on a single topic. It's rich in info on some topics and pretty skimpy on others. Still, if you've got the patience to sit down and read it from cover to cover you'll be well prepared to start growing. So far we're satisfied with our results and we've avoided many of the pitfalls of first-time growers. I especially liked the case studies, colour pictures and grower anecdotes. The seed bank listings and URLs are also useful."},{"Title":"Indoor Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor Bible","review":"Mr. Cervantes presentation of facts and advice is second to none. Having majored in Botany in college, I find the information contained to be the most scientifically correct of any book written, outside of text books, and there's none available on cannabis to compare with given the subject matter. The complexities of cultivation are written in a manner every person should be able to relate to and in an easy to read format with color photos included. Everything is covered in this book so concisely that it need be the only book of its kind on the shelf. I've read probably 90% of the books being marketed on the topic of cannabis and NONE can compare with the factual information contained in this book."},{"Title":"Indoor Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor Bible","review":"this book sure is one of the most relieable and complete books on how to grow cannabis. i am publisher of the hanf journal, europes biggest hemp journal, and i do know what i'm talking about. and its the only book of that kind, which has successfully done a remake, with new pictures and all important new inventions... respect - jorge!and it even helped me to get to know this plant, back in the days when i started...;-)"},{"Title":"Indoor Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor Bible","review":"This is THE definitive guide to growing marijuana indoors. Unlike most books which cover the basics, this book covers everything you can imagine, For example this book has 330 Pages, while most others have under 150.

But those are the basics, this book goes into depth with color illistrations with common missed things such as timers etc.Another good book I recommend in addition to this is:Cannabis Cultivation: A Complete Growers Guideby Mel ThomasThose 2 books will have you covered if your goal is indoor cultivation. However Closet Cultivator and the original Marijuana Question? Ask Ed! books are good companions and will offer other techniques and styles and different ways to do things.

I threw this in the garbage after the first few chapters. There is information in it that I know to be completely wrong, so how could I trust the rest of the information?The book gets basic facts wrong, things that are easily verifiable to anyone who has an Internet connection. The first part of the book, for some reason, gives you a short history on the Internet, but almost everything in that section is completely wrong.For example, the author says that the Internet was designed by the government to track your every click, and you can make yourself anonymous by getting a firewall and a hotmail account. Rediculous!Every paragraph has basic spelling and grammatical errors, making this book difficult to read. The author jumps around topics incoherently, and makes references to things that aren't fully explained.Save your money and get a better book.

That overshadows his literary achievements.He begins his account with Caesar's conquest of Britannia. The downfall of the Roman Empire plunges the colony into the Dark Ages. Britannia is not left unscathed by the waves of peoples' migrations sweeping across Europe. Germanic idioms of Saxon invaders replace Celtic dialects and coexist with the clergy's Latin. William the Conqueror casts French into the language melting-pot. England is racked by the War of the Roses until the Tudor dynasty unites and pacifies the country with iron determination. The defeat of the Spanish Armada opens the way for colonisation of the New World. Those colonies' War of Independence launches a second English-speaking nation with its own turbulent history. Britain's victory over Napoleon opens the way to world-wide Empire.Churchill makes the reader understand how the societies of the English-speaking peoples, their institutions and their language have evolved over a course of almost two thousand years. Many steps were the results of conflicts between opposing forces:King John had to appease the lords by issuing Magna Carta. His concern for stability through dy-nastic legitimacy led Henry VIII to break with Rome. Conflict between Parliament and Crown led to Civil War culminating in regicide. Frictions between mother country and colonies erupted in the American War of Independence. The issue of slavery almost tore the American Union asunder.Churchill presents each conflict in an impartial yet compassionate way. He forces the reader to understand opposing and hardly reconcilable views. That prepares the reader to understand the eventual solution. In retrospect, each conflict and its solution is seen as a step forward. Neither side was wrong - only the result is right.Churchill himself was an historic figure. That endowed him with a fine sense of history. His com-mand of the English language raises his work above the average of historical textbooks into the sphere of great literature. There are passages which one feels compelled to read aloud, only to be surprised at how their beauty at times assumes almost musical qualities. For his literary achieve-ments Churchill was rightly awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955."},{"Title":"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples (4 Volumes)","review":"As academic history, this may be pretty dated, but as English literature, Churchill's History of the English-Speaking Peoples deserves to be ranked as one of the great classics. If you enjoy intelligent popular history by someone who felt passionately about his own culture and you enjoy great oratory from someone who enjoyed stirring lofty emotions, you will cherish this incredible four-volume work. Every sentence is a carefully-crafted jewel. It is more than craftsmanship. It is art. For every important incident he pulls up the most eloquent of historical quotes to draw a word picture. If words move you, Winston Churchill will move you to tears more than once with this work.One warning: Don't loan any of the volumes out. You won't get them back."},{"Title":"A History of the English-Speaking Peoples (4 Volumes)","review":"Winston Churchill will be remembered as the most heroic figure of the 20th Century. He is also one of history's greatest historians. His decision to write the history of peoples by a particular language was brilliant, and gave a broad outline to why we think the way we do.

The power might drop her in the middle of a raging battle in the Civil War or an outhouse trying to hide and save her brother from the Union Army.The source of this magic power, that transported her through time and threatened not to bring her back, would come as a huge shock and rock her the very depths of her soul.A great read.Betty Wilson, a Freelance Writer"},{"Title":"The Gunsmith: Book 1 in the Service of the Queen (Gunsmith (Jove Books))","review":"In Spokane, Washington Boothenay Irons is a chip off the old block as like her father she is a talented modern-day gunsmith. However, sometimes when she touches an old weapon she goes back to the time of the gun residing in the body of someone from that era.Caleb Deane visits the Irons family with an 1810 blunderbuss. He and Boothenay touch the gun at the same time and the twosome is transported back to 1811. Boothenay lands inside Lady Annabelle Winthrop while Caleb becomes military Captain Ethan Delaney. Both host bodies service English Queen Charlotte at a time when the British impress Americans to work on their ships. One victim is the Queen's illegitimate grandson, Jonathan Harriman, whom she wants freed. The Queen expects her loyal twosome to rescue Jonathan and dispatch him back to the States. As the transported pair work to accomplish the Queen's bidding, Caleb has no idea that he is from the future while Boothenay knows who she and he are.THE GUNSMITH: IN THE SERVICE OF THE QUEEN is an exciting time travel thriller that hooks the audience once Caleb meets Boothenay. The story line starts more like vignettes so that the audience can learn how Boothenay's magic works. Boothenay, the glue of the novel, is a terrific person whose inner modern day feminism is brought to her host bodies. The bewildered Caleb is her ideal counterpart. However what makes the tale once the heroine arrives in 1811 are the little irritating inconveniences of no microwave, horrendous bathroom facilities, and an olfactory nightmare that will leave readers desiring more stories starring this intrepid Gunsmith.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Gunsmith: Book 1 in the Service of the Queen (Gunsmith (Jove Books))","review":"C.K.

Boothenay, an unusual woman with an unusual name, is a lady gunsmith who specializes in restoring antique firearms and has a special power that transports her into the history of the gun she is working on. She takes an assignment from a British Queen during which she encounters high adventure, intrique and romance. Crigger's storyline is fetching and her attention to the details of 1811 English culture is historically compelling."},{"Title":"The Gunsmith: Book 1 in the Service of the Queen (Gunsmith (Jove Books))","review":"Crigger has hit on a theme that intrigued me: when the gunsmith, a girl, touches an antique gun she is transported back in time and becomes the person who handled the gun. Crigger's imagination has no bounds as I went with Boothany back to Georgian England and barely couldn't stop reading until she was safely back in her gunshop. Crigger's style is almost tongue-in-cheek. The action moves quickly and I had to keep alert to keep up with the between-the-lines action of the two main characters. A good read."},{"Title":"Wireless Personal Communications: Channel Modeling and Systems Engineering (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"The field of wireless personal communications is experiencing rapid growth worldwide. Most clearly seen in the huge uptake of cellphones in Europe, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the United States and China. Plus, WiFi has taken off strongly in the developed world, with enhanced 802.11 standards being quickly solidified and adopted.This volume, as of its writing in 2000, describes much of the engineering and theoretical underpinning of this field. It does not have the 802.11 standards that came out after 2000, but much of the book is still very germane. There is no lack of research interest in this field, driven in no small part by the anticipation that nomadic computer and the rise of the pervasive Web have yet to occur. Still early days for those, we hope.The field contains tough issues, as may be seen in several papers in the book. In earlier decades, wireless communications were often to and from antennas at fixed locations, with ample power. Or, if the antennas were mobile, like on planes, usually power was not a consideration. Nor the possible maximum length of the antennas. But in modern personal mobile uses, the constraints are far tighter. Power must be minimized, and you cannot draw out a one meter antenna.Which gives great potential for researchers like yourself to invent and commercialise new applications, if you can overcome these challenges, aided perhaps by ideas in this book!"},{"Title":"Webster's Medical Speller","review":"This is an inexpensive, must have, quick glance word/speller desk reference book for medical transcriptionists.

The main flaw is the author's method of transliteration (i.e. using English letters to represent Arabic letters). The method is rather confusing and not the one that is commonly used. If one did not already have a general knowledge of the Arabic language, its sounds and even some vocabulary, one would be at a loss to make sense of the transliteration (i.e. using an &quot;z&quot; to represent the Arabic equivalent of &quot;j&quot; and other oddities). However, once you've deciphered the rather odd transliteration, the book is rather useful. Even though written in 1965, the basics of the Moroccan dialect are well represented in the text, even though it might be called a more formal Moroccan dialect than the one generally heard. My suggestion to anyone wanting to learn any dialect of the Arabic language is to first learn to read and write the Arabic script. That way you don't have to waste your time learning different methods of transliteration. As it stands now, I don't know of a major text dealing with Moroccan Arabic for English speakers that uses Arabic script, so this book seems to be the best for now. I suggest getting it if you need it, but you might need a Moroccan to help you with the transliteration at the beginning. The book mentions that cassette tapes are also available that go along with the text, so they might help also."},{"Title":"A Basic Course in Moroccan Arabic (Richard Slade Harrell Arabic Series)","review":"the format used of drills for pronunciation is boring and the subject matters of the exercises are not relevant to today's Morocco. Outdated language is used much to the hilarity of my husband's family who are educated Moroccans. Examples of sentences taught are &quot; I gave the rifles to the judge&quot; and &quot;she hit the dog&quot;. It's useful for the basics and the grammer but the choice of vocabulary taught means that whilst I know how to construct a sentence, I don't have the vocab! It has inspired me to learn Moroccan and then write a book for English speakers."},{"Title":"A Basic Course in Moroccan Arabic (Richard Slade Harrell Arabic Series)","review":"This book is very useful. Although it uses linguistic signs for pronunciation instead of Arabic signs it is still accessible. Being a teacher, I was really able to evaluate the ods used in this book. I have found the exercices easy to follow. The level of difficulty is progressive allowing you to master what you have learned previously before learning more. Being French Canadian, I would have preferred to have a Moroccan-French book. But this is the best one I have found in North America."},{"Title":"A Basic Course in Moroccan Arabic (Richard Slade Harrell Arabic Series)","review":"This \\"course\\" is simply a reprint of an old Georgetown book from the 60s. It is garbage. The text is not in Arabic script (which is ridiculous) and the \\"exercises\\" are useless, but the vocab could be a good start if some of the words were not outdated and the author had explained which were Moroccan, Standard Arabic, French, or Spanish. The recordings, although insightfully encoded into MP3 format, are of the worst quality. They are clearly copies from tapes from back in the 60s when this book was useful. It sounds like they were recorded in a bathroom by someone who had smoked three packs of Winstons a day for 25 years. It was a decent language book for its time, but this is 2005. LET'S GET SOME NEW BOOKS GEORGETOWN!!! If that institution is such a bastion of Arabic studies in America, then I challenge it to get off its ass and put something out there (besides al-Kitab). This stuff is IMPORTANT these days. We Arabic students NEED it."},{"Title":"A Basic Course in Moroccan Arabic (Richard Slade Harrell Arabic Series)","review":"This is the only complete Moroccan Arabic book (in English at least) that I have found out there. I am about half way through the book and CD's. I know I am on my way to fluency because everything that I have learned thus far I am able to both speak and understand. The other small Moroccan Arabic books out there are useless if you truly want to become fluent. I guess they may be useful if you are planning a trip to Morocco and need to learn a few phrases to find the toilets, etc. If you are in a touristy area in Morocco then you could just use French. I highly recommend the book and CDs if you are serious about learning Moroccan. I am grateful that this is available. Otherwise, I believe that learning Moroccan Arabic would be nearly impossible."},{"Title":"A Basic Course in Moroccan Arabic (Richard Slade Harrell Arabic Series)","review":"I studied this book with the MP3 audio files during my lunch breaks. The short lessons (around 5 minutes of audio, plus the reading and exercises) meant that I could do a lesson each day and feel like I was getting somewhere.This book teaches the language from an academic, grammar-based standpoint, not the situation-based lessons you will find in most language courses written for tourists. As others have mentioned, some of the vocabulary is outdated, it does not use the Arabic alphabet, and explains things in grammatical terms that I am not familiar with (I'm no linguist). However, I still found it usable since each lesson made a grammatical point, explained it, and showed several examples on the audio, so I picked it up by example.There does not appear to be any other detailed resource for learning Moroccan Arabic. There are travel phrasebooks and their audio equivalent, that's about it. That fact alone makes this course worth the 4 stars I gave it.I found it rewarding to work through this book, and check in on the phrasebooks from time to time, to see if the phrases made more sense (and they did!). Also by combining the practical vocabulary found in the phrase books with the sentence structures in this book, I can say a whole lot more than I find in either book.There is a section of conversations in the back, for which there is no audio. I wish there was audio available for those, as that would make that section more useful.If you are serious about learning Moroccan Arabic and understanding it, I recommend this book. If you want to quickly learn some conversational skills because you are planning a visit, this is not the book for you. It would be easier to learn some French, and you would be understood equally well."},{"Title":"A Basic Course in Moroccan Arabic (Richard Slade Harrell Arabic Series)","review":"This book could be an excellent introduction to Moroccan Arabic, but it suffers from a few flaws. The main flaw is the author's rather odd method of transliteration (i.e. using English letters to represent Arabic script). His method is rather confusing and differs from the one that is more commonly used when dealing with Arabic. If one does not already have a general knowledge of the Arabic language, its sounds, and even some vocabulary, one would be at a loss to make sense of the transliteration (i.e. using an \\"z\\" to represent the Arabic equivalent of \\"j\\" and other such oddities). However, once you've learned how to decipher the cryptic transliteration, the book can be rather useful.Although written in 1965, the basics of the Moroccan dialect are well represented in the text, albeit in what might be called a more formal version of the dialect than one generally hears on the streets or in daily conversations. The book introduces the basics of Moroccan Arabic, both grammar and vocabulary, in a logical and progressive manner over the course of 130 short lessons. Each lesson essentially contains a short text, which is followed up by grammatical notes, exercises and vocabulary. The second part of the book contains ninety-seven dialogues that are presented in transliteration along with their English translations. Whenever I take a look at this text, it seems I get the feeling that this could really be an excellent book if it weren't for the irksome transliteration. In my mind, that just won't go away...On that note, my heartfelt suggestion to anyone wanting to learn any dialect of the Arabic language is to first learn to read and write the Arabic script. That way you won't have to waste your time learning different methods of transliteration, which often lead to incorrect pronunciation anyway. Keep in mind that learning to read Arabic is not like learning to read Chinese or Japanese, with their thousands of characters, since the Arabic alphabet only contains twenty-eight letters. While it certainly looks rather confusing at first, especially since the letters connect to one other, with some practice and determination most people, regardless of their background, can pick it up rather quickly. Unfortunately, as it stands now, I don't know of a major text dealing specifically with Moroccan Arabic for English speakers that uses Arabic script, so the book under review seems to be about all there is for now. However, although it's rather slim and doesn't really set out to teach the language in detail, the 'Lonely Planet Moroccan Arabic Phrasebook' does use both Arabic script and transliteration, so those who can read Arabic might find it more useful, although it certainly doesn't offer the same depth of coverage as the text in question.Overall, I would suggest getting this book if you really need a text specific to Moroccan Arabic, but keep in mind that you might need a Moroccan to help you with the pronunciation and transliteration at the beginning. The book mentions that cassette tapes (and now MP3 files) are also available to go along with the text, so I'd certainly consider those in order to learn correct pronunciation...especially since the cryptic transliteration that this book used certainly isn't going to help in that regard."},{"Title":"The Dartford Loop line 1866-1966 (Locomotion papers)","review":"This is a very readable and informative booklet, and is recommended for anyone interested in British railway history. This edition is 24 pages with 4 pages of photographs, with maps, diagrams and illustrations in the text. It is No. 34 in the Oakwood Press' Locomotion Papers from 1966.\\"Probably few users of the \\"Loop Line\\" have paused to wonder why their line bears this title, when it appears on the map as only one of three equally-important lines joining London and Dartford. The answer is that when planned, it was in truth a loop line, leaving the South Eastern Railway's long established North Kent line near New Cross and proceeding by a southerly route, avoiding the built-up riverside area, to join the same line just west of Dartford. The completion of the new Main Line through Orpington in 1868 (opened as far as Chiselhurst in1865) and the much later opening of the third route to Dartford via Bexleyheath (and still later the Lewisham loops), somewhat obscured the original character of the Dartford Loop.\\"\\"Why was the Loop Line built? There were a number of reasons; it offered a slightly more convenient route to Gravesend and beyond as Greenwich and Charlton were not yet joined; the Dartford trains had to use the more circuitous route via Blackheath. It is also probable that the South eastern directors, already conscious of the growing threat from the London, Chatham and Dover Railway saw in the new line a way of filling a void which the \`Chatham' might at any moment decide to fill themselves.\\""},{"Title":"Essentials of Prayer","review":"This one is my personal favorite, of the E.

I highly recommend everything written by this Classic Prayer Author."},{"Title":"Essentials of Prayer","review":"\\"The Essentials Of Prayer\\" by E.M. Bounds focuses on the right attitudes for either individual or corporate prayer.Some of the points covered include:1. No person with a divided allegiance to God and the world can do the prayer that is needed.2. Excellent points on humility.3. Busy religious activity will not make up for an empty prayer life.4. Trouble often drives people to prayer. Trouble is neither above God or beyond His control.5. God works most effectively through holy people.6. Many Christians are aimless because they have no pattern to follow for shaping their character and conduct.7. In the lust for more church members, some churches have compromised on purity.8. No sinner is barred from the mercy seat. All are welcomed to approach the throne of grace in time of need.9. The key to missionary success is prayer.Another excellent title by Bounds to approach prayer more seriously.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Essentials of Prayer","review":"E.M.

Bringing this sordid history to light is Black, who makes the history both entertaining and powerful. In a fast-reading book, loaded with photos, political cartoons, and illustrations, Black manages to swiftly educate Americanos of all kinds about this amazing history. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: How the United States Wrote the History of Central America and the Caribbean (New Look at History)","review":"It is a crime that George Black's Good Neighbor has been out of print. Written with a wry style and a British detachment from the assumptions of U.S. culture, Black explores the history of what he regards as a neurotic United States romping though Central America from the Spanish American war onward. While I disagree with his premise that there is an irrationality to U.S. behavior in Latin America, my students love this book. Beautifully and intelligently illustrated."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: How the United States Wrote the History of Central America and the Caribbean (New Look at History)","review":"i read this book almost 8 years ago while travelling in central america. i forgot its title then but never forgot its message. i have only just tracked it down - it was worth the wait and what it has to say is every bit as important as i remembered it. perhaps now (post 11th september) it is even more poignant, illustrating the inability of the 'west' to learn from mistakes in its foreign policy, how the lives of others are affected by this and how our complicity in this debases our own humanity. with this book, i understood so much more than i could otherwise have done, the feelings of the people i met in C.Am, particularly in nicaragua. i love the people there, the lack of malice and bitterness they are entitled to, that i felt on their behalf.it is an essential read, for anyone interested in global politics, for anyone thinking of going travelling there, for anyone...well, for anyone."},{"Title":"The Good Neighbor: How the United States Wrote the History of Central America and the Caribbean (New Look at History)","review":"This book was required reading for a history course I took at university. It is one of the most memorable books I read while at university; in fact I actually re-read it cover-to-cover while in law school. The writing is entertaining and it has a very clever layout with interesting historical photos and illustrations.

When I was in school, there certainly was no technical education or exposure to computer use; even during my working career I had no chance to learn about desktops or the Internet. So now I am considered &quot;of the senior generation.&quot; The usual scenario is that you have either the opportunity or the time, not both. But lucky me, I am enjoying the time and the opportunity to take on the computer world. Guess what, I got a computer and bought a copy of this new book, Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet, and have entered a whole new experience. This is a great time to be a part of the 50+ generation. And Sandy Berger has been such help. With her easy to understand book, Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet, I have been able to find my way and my confidence in the world of AOL and the Internet. I felt like she wrote her book specifically for me! With my computer, my time, and Sandy's book, I am on my e-way."},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"I love this book. I am 66 and just bought my first computer three months ago. This book, along with America Online Simplified, is my bible. It is so easy to understand and so complete. I will continue learning from it."},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"I did not have any computer experience. I was not fortunate to be exposed to computers during my schooling. I felt like I could learn to use the computer and found this book to be the perfect tool to help me.I read the paragraph by Horrace Deets, AARP's top guy, and agree that Sandy Berger can help you get the most out of your computer experience. I feel like I am making up for no computer experience and will have plenty of computer fun in the future."},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"I found out you don't have to be described as a &quot;Grown-up&quot; to enjoy this book. My parents are enjoying it but they are o.k. with the description &quot;grown-up&quot;; I don't think it fits me. Still I found the information in Sandy Berger's Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet right on the mark for what I needed to know about computers. And I am only 27. So I guess it doesn't matter where useful information comes from as long as it is helpful."},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"I can only take one little challenge at a time. So far Sandy Berger's book has helped me with e-mail and finding and organizing things. Those two chapters are my favorite chapters. The reward for working hard to understand attachments with Sandy's help is being able to receive pictures of all four grandkids that are scattered around the country. This book opened that door for me. I look forward to tackling other chapters and learning other skills."},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"I have been one of those frantic neophytes in a Grown-up hurry to speak the language of the world -- Computorese -- and now Sandy Berger's book has given me the key, the courage, and the confidence for success. I'm well on my way to fluent communication! This is a superb book: I've ordered five more copies from Amazon to be sent poste-haste to fellow-strugglers, and I will continue to order (or, let's be sensible: recommend) a copy of this excellent Guide each time I hear that familiar wail of near despair. Now, instead of a pitiful &quot;I want my Mommy!&quot;, I say cheerfully, &quot;I need my Sandy Berger!&quot;"},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"The non-threatening basics offered in Sandy Berger's new book, Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet, are great. I have read the chapters on e-mail, chatting, and navigating AOL and the Internet and think I have developed a good understanding and foundation. But what I am so appreciative of, thanks to Sandy, are the great directional signs to treasures on AOL and the Internet. It would take me years to find such good information. My favorite chapter is Genealogy. Up until I bought a computer and found Sandy's help, I was able to document only three generations of my family tree. Genealogy and developing my ancestral history has become my favorite activity. The computer is the perfect tool with its specialized links to tackle centuries of history. So not only have I tackled and enjoyed the computer world but that accomplishment has also led me to take on genealogy as well."},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"As a caring son, I purchased a new computer and this new book, Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet, for my mom's birthday. After helping hook up the new hardware and getting Mom online, we opened Sandy Berger's book for help. The two of us poured over that book, and can you believe it? She would not let me take it home. Although the target of the book is helping seniors get acclimated to the online world, this 30-something, computer-experienced son loved the book's approach and all the easy-to-understand information it contained. You guessed it; I had to buy a second copy of Sandy Berger's book. But mission accomplished: Mom e-mails me everyday and loves all the gardening information she gets online. Both she and I reach for Sandy's guide when we need help with AOL or the Internet."},{"Title":"Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet","review":"Looking ahead, I can't wait to get involved in the travel and garding sections.

I am recommending the computer and Sandy's book to all my friends."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Despite all the kind things the other reviewers have already said about this book, I still feel that I need to add my own feelings here. I had read and thoroughly enjoyed both \\"Lost Horizon\\" and \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips\\" for the first time this past month and was astounded by Hilton's story-telling abilities and his deep humanity and civility. I began Random Harvest because it was the only other work by him in our public library. It developed slowly and I was at first inclined to feel that it was an inferior work to his more celebrated bestsellers. By the time I approached the end of Part Three, however, I was absolutely enthralled and could no longer put it down. The ending was so marvelous and so completely unexpected that I was left with the stunned sensation of disbelief that any author had the gifts to write (at least!) three works of such quality. The reviewer who finds in Charles Rainier's amnesia a metaphor for Britain's somnolent heedlessness between the Wars is quite correct. This is a superb romance novel but with a profundity of social observation and commentary. I think the fact that every single reviewer has given this book five stars is indication enough of the delight that any reader will encounter if they give themselves over to it."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I've seen Random Harvest the film (with Greer Garson) several times, and have always wanted to read the book. This edition, reprinted in the 1960s, is a little misleading in its cover, perhaps for marketing purposes. Looks like a trashy romance, but the book was written decades earlier, and takes place in post-war Britain. Hilton's style conveys the British wit and sense of humor his characters require, and pushes the story along quite nicely. My only disadvantage is already knowing the end of the story, but when I learned the book has a quite different perspective than the film, I was further encouraged in tracking down a version of the story."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I recently read this book for the second time after a 20 year or so gap. This time, I am less amazed by the mystery and romance of the book (I knew the story after all) than I am by its portrayal and commentary on life in Britain between WWI and WWII. I found the life of Charles Ranier to be especially poignant in our post-9/11 world.A lot of questions are raised about living a life with (or without) passion; the importance of worldly success and security; the notion of empires growing stale to the countries they occupy no matter how beneficent their motives; the nature of memory and how it affects our perception of the world; the nature of sacrifice; and whether chasing after destruction can lead to redemption. I could go on. There's so much pithy stuff woven into the threads of this simple mystery/romance story.We're reading this book in my book club this month as our Valentines Day treat. We're going to watch the Greer Garson movie before we get down to the discussion part of the meeting. I can't wait to hear whether anyone thinks it's a romance book at all after discussing the book's lessons.By the way, it can't be repeated often enough ... don't see the movie or even read about the movie until you've read the book. They are horses of a completely different color."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I read this book a life time ago when I was quite young. It was a brilliant novel, with just a wonderful ending. The movie made of this book will bring tears to your eyes, no matter who you are. James Hilton is really a timeless author, and can be read as easily today as when his books were first published. I loved all his novels, but this is truly my favorite, as he does a wonderful job telling a love story, a mystery and conveying a sense of England between the wars. I guess what I liked best about it was the overwhelming romantic tone the book has when you realize the sacrifices a person might make for someone they love completely and without condition."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"There is a risk in having seen the Ronald Colman film of \\"Random Harvest\\" prior to reading this author's masterpiece, but with all bets on the table you will reap a jackpot. The book is allowed to be more than just a sentimental love story. At once, it conveys the disorientation of the war-damaged Charles Rainier as well as the social and political losses throughout the isles. Hilton's treatment of the time changes within creates within the reader a vagueness, a sympathy that coincides with the confusion within Rainier which hastens the suspense. And the journey, if known from the film alone, has more twists and turns in order to flesh out the rumblings within the social fabric in England as the industrial age picks up speed. The few side-journeys introduce an eccentric cleric (Blampied)(no Hollywood stock character) who speaks for all those individuals lucky enough to be happy within rapid societal change. And this singular man inspires Rainier to bridge the gulf between his memory loss(past)and his future, convincing him of the need to keep his feet to the ground as well as an eye toward the future.It goes beyond a history lesson. There are many musings within that speak for today. Smithy (Rainier before he regains his memory) asks the reverend how he should make a living and he replies,\\"Life's more important than a living. So many people who make a living are making death, not life. Don't ever join them. They're the gravediggers of our civilization--- the safe men, the comporisers, the money-makers, the muddlers-through..... and part of their charm is that they don't know what they are, just as they don't know what we are, either.\\" Another sentiment worth note late in the story, memory-deprived but fully conscious Rainier opines,\\"...the Ranier firm gives steady employment to thousands...But I know too that the way that made Rainiers rich was the opposite of the way to make England strong.\\" I wish some of our current political leaders were fiction readers. And all the reviewers are correct on the climactic finale to this wonderful literary effort. It triumphs more than romantically."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Whenever I am asked what is my all-time favorite book, I always say Random Harvest. As many other reviewers have said, to describe too many of the plot lines would be to give away the wonderful ending. This is James Hilton's finest work; he us an intriguing story that includes a mystery, dedication, caring, and love during the years between the World Wars. It is also a very realistic portrayal of the damage a war inflicts on civilians and soldiers. It's available both in print and Kindle versions."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I dare anyone to read this book and not be changed.No one has Hilton's power of drawing a reader into the mind and heart of an ordinary bloke. I don't know how he does it; why do I care so much about his characters? He knows how to help the reader to sincerely CARE ABOUT a character, and therefore even his fellow man.The twist and twist of the plot and timeline can be challenging at times, but well worth the effort.And I thought the book was absolutely great BEFORE I read the last page!(BTW, don't confuse this great book with the mediocre chickflick movie of the same name, and I don't recommend watching the movie first, as it might spoil some of the suspense.)"},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Random Harvest is one of my favorite movies. I just bought this Kindle edition. I started to read \\"look inside\\" and liked the first paragraph. If the rest of the book is like the first paragraph, I'm going to love the book. I always wondered what the title meant, and the quote at the beginning answered my question. I will write a review when I am done reading. Gave it 4 stars since I haven't actually read it yet.What I wonder is why different Kindle editions of the same book are different prices. I had a change to buy a different edition of this book for $1.99 on sale and regular price is $9.99, but this edition is $2.99I also agree that I like this story better than \\"Good-bye Mr. Chips\\", Greer Garson starred in both movies.ttyl"},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"This book was awesome. It starts out slow, but stays interesting enough so that you never lose interest. The way the book is split into five parts is very cool and keeps it so only a little bit of information is given at a time. The ending of the book is what really made this book so good for me. It was amazing and thought provoking. The way the book ended has made me know that I will be reading this book again in the future because I will want to relive this novel. This is the second book by James Hilton that I have read after Lost Horizon. Lost horizon was awesome and thought provoking and this book is just the same while being entirely different. This book was entirely worth the read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a book that stays in your mind even far after you have finished reading it."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"In saw the movie version many years ago as a child and had no memory of the story so I think I went into this book with no expectations. I thought that the flashback portions of the story were intriguing and well written. The present day portions of the book lacked the same details and the wife's behavior and character was not fully explored and explained nor their relationship. The ending was expected and fell a bit flat. It was theoretically the drama moment but he let It fall short."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"This was a very well written and edited book. The story was griping and the ending excelent. I love how Hilton tells a story. A book I will read again."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Loved the book. It was captivating to the last sentence. The geography and time frame interesting but I do not know from where the title came."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I admit I am a sucker for old movies and classic novels. This book is somewhat formulaic. And the ending is a little trite. But, it still won my heart. If you read and have liked other books by this author, you will like this one."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I had a hard time reading this book and I'm not sure if it was because I had to read it in pieces, but I just didn't connect with the characters. I had a hard time relating to the narrator and to the main character of the book, though the book is wonderfully written and I often found myself thinking that the author had a fantastic way of painting a picture with his words, but the plot just wasn't for me. Would recommend it for those that like drama stories with minimal action."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"SPOILER ALERT!!!!!I've come to the conclusion recently that a book which is turned into a film is sort of an evolution in story telling. That one format is not inherently better than the other. Sometimes the book is better, sometime the film is better. Sometimes both are excellent. For example I recently watched the fairly recent film \\"The Painted Veil\\", and then read the novel by Somerset Maugham. I enjoyed both, immensely. The film version of this novel -- \\"Random Harvest\\" -- starring Ronald Colman and Greer Garson is one of my very favorite films...in my top 5 of all time. So, after watching the film so many times, I thought it was time that I read the novel. I assumed it would be as enchanting for me as the film.I was wrong. To me, a better title for the novel would be \\"Ramble Harvest\\", because it seems to me that Hilton rambles on and on with a great deal of story telling that has nothing to do with this story. Frankly, virtually all of part I (whatever happened to chapters?) could have been left out. Even after that, there is simply too much wandering around that never gets to the point of the novel -- how Charles gets his memory back...or even much about his memory at all. Yes, it is very clever how he surprises the reader at the very end of the book with the revelation that his secretary is his first wife from his other memory period. Very clever writing, but I doubt many people beyond the first few readers didn't learn of the ending in advance.I know that I am in the minority here. Others seem to really like this novel. So don't take my word for it, but I was decidedly disappointed in this novel."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Extraordinary. Put your thinking cap on because James Herriott weaves words in such a way that most modern writers cannot do today. And that's okay. Makes me feel less like a dummy and more like the intelligent student I was before I dummied myself down. In the book I kept feeling sorry for the poor wife back home, but it all resolved itself in the end. I will read it again.Can't tell you enough how much I adore my kindles!"},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I ordered this book for my nexus 7 but never received it. I could not find a way to contact and advise about my problem. Sounded like it could be a good book."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"L found ths novel stodgy and not at all jnteresting to read. It did not work for this 82 year old despite the prominence of the author,"},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I have watched the movie multiple times and always wondered how the book compared. After receiving the book I have been delighted to compare the two mediums. I so love 1930-1945 movies and love reading the original stories from which they were made."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Random Harvest is my all-time favorite story. It might well be called The Wonderful Story or The Beautiful Story. Who hasn't read James Hilton's Good-buy Mr. Chips or Lost Horizon? This book, in my view, is his best work. It was this work that convinced me Hilton had to be a mystic although I don't know that. I do know that on one level, the earthy one, this is the best romantic novel I've ever read. On another level, social or historical, the work is a bringer of hope- written during WWII about WWI and ending on the eve of WWII the story speaks directly to our own uncertain post 911 era. But most importantly this is a work of spiritual completion. It can be read as the story of two people, or for Jungians in particular the coniunctio (union of opposites), the reconciling of the male and female within each of us, and in another context the \\"Marriage Feast of the Lamb\\"... This is, indeed, \\"The Wonderful Story.\\""},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"History but not history as the same concepts of war and those serving are here today. But also the blessing that true love prevails."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I enjoyed the book but I liked the movie better. The book was a bit tedious in spots. Can't compete with Greer Garson and Ronald Coleman."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. The characters were well developed and I was drawn into the book, not wanting to let go. The author delivers a great supprise ending! This is a MUST READ. Even though this book was written many years ago the story is not outdated."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"This an interesting tale that pieces together the lost years of an amnesia afflicted WWI vet. Primarily told through flashback, minor characters come and go to gradually complete the puzzle of Charles Ranier's life from WWI to the onset of WWII. The editing was a little sub-par with numerous typos, but it didn't significantly impact what I thought was a very engaging plot with an excellent ending. Apparently this is the conclusion of a trilogy, but I didn't read the first two installments, so it must stand well on its own."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Excellent book well writen and holds interest all the way through. Both the historical and business aspects of this book appel to me - I have read it before but thoroghly enjoyed reaing it again."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Overall, i enjoyed the storyline of the book. There were parts that developed a minor character more than that character needed to be developed. Also, I would suggest that there be better spellcheck. I found more misspelled words that I should have expected."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"The writing lost me a few times, going off on tangents that I feel were not necessary to the tale, but the rest of the story was a good page turner. The story would make a good movie."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I had never seen the movie, but heard the movie mentioned on the Britcom \\"As Time Goes By\\" and basically heard the entire plot (including the ending) in a couple of sentences. Nevertheless, I was tempted to read the book, and boy am I glad I did! I had never read anything by James Hilton either, nor saw any of the movies based on his books, but that will change. Even suspecting the ending, the book is engrossing enough anyway. I loved reading about England between the two wars. I'm a little sorry I read this on a Kindle because there are passages I would like to re-read that I didn't know at the time I would. Once you get to the end, certain things that might have lead you to hints of that ending had not been noticed, and I'd like to go back and re-read certain scenes, but they are devilishly hard to find in a e-book unless you've bookmarked them, but since you didn't know how the book was going to end, how would you know where to bookmark? So while I love my Kindle (mainly for the option of changing the type size when I'm reading with/without glasses or in good or poor light) it just isn't as satisfying as a real book. I also love the Kindle for not having to hold the book open with both hands as I read. Wish I had known I'd like this book so much - I will probably have to buy it again in paperback."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Reading a book by James Hilton should be accompanied by curling up in your most enveloping chair and having a cup of creamy coffee or tea to sip. His writing is a style that we no longer have in literature - much like Nevil Shute. The setting is between the two World Wars in England. The main character suffers from two amnesias: after being injured in World War I, he recovers in several hospitals, but does not know his name or where he is from; then, after having a fall, he comes to on a Liverpool bench and remembers who he is and where home is, but does not remember the perod of time between his war injury and the present. The story progresses from there in a lovely, bittersweet manner and we meet various acquaintances and family members who provide some interaction that illuminates his character and sense of responsibility. There are subtle hints along the way that may enable you to figure out the surprise ending - but whether you do or not, it will be quite pleasantly satisfying. A very good book - not only for the reading, but for the feeling that it leaves with you."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Starts a little slow...but worthy to be read.

Would purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"The copy I received was overpriced for it's condition. The binding corners were damaged, pages were badly faded, it had a name written inside the cover and a penciled in price of $2. I would not order from this used book seller again."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Like so much 19th/20th century British Lit, I found it dry, long-winded, and soap opera paced. After 2/3's I'm asking When am I going to meet this chick he flipped over? On the plus side, the amnesia plot (lost two years of love) is fairly spellbinding."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Random Harvest is heralded as James Hilton's finest work. I guess people in 1941 enjoyed long books that gave excruciatingly detailed accounts of the lives of people who did nothing out of the ordinary. Imagine reading about someone watching TV, going to work, and drinking beer for 300 pages, and all the while this person has amnesia; that should give you a good idea of what Random Harvest is about. The ending is, contrary to the rest of the book, extremely fast paced and rather unexpected. This surprise ending makes up for 200 of the 300 boring pages, but not enough to merit more than three stars. I highly recommend if you're going to actually buy this book to spend a little extra for the original hardcover version (though it's harder to find). You'll still be disappointed with the story but having a first edition should give you the sense that it's special somehow."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"The book Random Harvest arrived quickly and in the condition the seller described. I would purchase from this seller again."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"The quality of the book is very good and the print was easy to read. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"This completes the trilogy of classic James Hilton novels (the other two being \\"Lost Horizon\\" and \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips\\") which were all made into movies during Hollywood's Golden Era. It is the lesser known of the three novels, although Random Harvest is his most complete work.The story is a romance, a mystery, a critque on England's class structure, and a parable. Hilton uses the lost years of Charles Rainier as a methaphor for the lost years of the 1920/1930's when England failed to prepare for the next war. Told in flashbacks and bookended by World War I and World War II, the resolution is only revealed in its final sentence that will shock you and change everything that you have just read & thought you understood. You will go back and re-read the book as your perception of all the characters are altered by the surprise ending.Two cautions: First, see the 1942 Ronald Coleman/ Greer Garson movie AFTER reading the book to see how the ending is handled. Second, the opening few pages are set in an England and of a time that will be unfamiliar to most Americans, but if one continues on, the reader will be deeply rewarded. The ability to be surprised is a rare gift and Hilton delivers."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I had first seen the wonderfully sentimental movie, which is one of my favorites.The book is not so sentimental. In reading the book, I was unprepared for how well-depicted would be the pain of the protagonist's psychological plight, how thought-provoking this book would be about society, and how much an individual could realistically be shown to be at a loss - no matter his external circumstances.This is very much about someone who senses that once his life had meaning to him, and he had happily occupied a niche in the world - and can't rediscover it. The author is so wonderful in conveying this desperation.Mr. Hilton also wonderfully conveys the highs and lows of both the well-born establishment, and the utterly displaced, of inter-war England.And amazingly, he brilliantly evokes the wonderfully dreamy feeling of being in love. The scenes in which Smitty finds the small town, climbs up to the small lake in the hills, what he sees when he awakens, and the following several days, must be among the most moving in fiction.I also love how the author shows the differences in personality between the earnest, sweet, easily alarmed, humble Smitty and the somewhat cynical, immensely able, practical-joking, self-deprecating Rainier - much of the difference seems engendered by the way they're treated and their places in life.I love how subtly the author shows Mrs. Rainier's reaction to Rainier's discoveries - it's just brilliantly done. And the book's ending could not be more satisfying.This is a more thought-provoking book than Goodbye Mr. Chips - and as much as I enjoyed that, this is a better one. I loved this as much as Hilton's So Well Remembered - which is high praise."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"An exquisite wartime romance that bears a few resemblances to The English Patient, James Hilton's time-spinning tale is the type of book that grabs you in its first paragraph and leaves you breathless with its last sentence. Just make sure you don't see the wonderful, more straightforward Ronald Colman-Greer Garson film version first. The heartstopping plot twist at the end makes everything that goes before even more magical. Random Harvest is one of those books that you'll read and re-read for many years; I know I have, three times already."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"this book is simply a great example of solid story-telling. you fall in love with the main characters, but the secondary players are fascinating as well. (i especially love the way hilton presents charles's siblings and their interactions -- as will anyone else from a large family.) i saw the movie first, but the book is still great every time i read it. anyone who is a fan of WWI-WWII era england is in for a treat with this book. if you want something wonderful to curl up with, a book you hate to see come to an end, this is the one."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"'Random Harvest' I took to read only because its author was James Hilton, whose works like 'Goodbye..' and 'Lost..' I had enjoyed no end. But 'Random Harvest' is entirely different.A wonderfully written book which aptly fits the term 'poetry in prose',it is basically a romance of the 1st world war and yet remains aloof from the activities of the war.It touches it only to establish the romance plot.It is told in the form of a conversation and the finale is brilliantly told.'John Smith' and Paula just walk into your hearts and stay there for a long time after you have finished it.Yet there is a typical laid-back Hilton-ic strain right through the book.I recommend all to read the book, if not for the plot at least the beautiful country atmosphere of the England of the 1930s and 40s it creates.I loved the book.And know that all 'softer' hearted readers will enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I am an avid reader (and work as a librarian) yet I almost never keep a novel. &quot;Random Harvest&quot; is one of five books I own and will never give away. It shows the English spirit during the 1930's and 1940's in a brilliant, well done manner. The real reason that I have kept it though is it is one of the best love stories I have ever read! I highly recommend it to anyone who is in need of a little romance"},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"A magnificently engrossing story that takes place over several years and including many twists and turns that make it difficult to write a review that does not give away too much of the plot. It starts with a war injury that brings amnesia induced loss of identity to our main character. The life that he builds from scratch is washed away when a car accident brings back his earlier memory, while losing the memory of his most recent life and identity. The two identities are quite dissimilar making it most difficult for the love of his second life to trace him once again to where he has built an entire life upon his early roots. The clash of his two identities and what he does with the women from both his lives is the crux of the book. Both his lives are truly worthwhile and if only there were a way to combine the best of both parts - but impossible to go back . . . the eventual answer is one of the most breathtakingly satisfying conclusions of all time.James Hilton's (Goodbye Mr. Chips, Lost Horizon) greatest novel. A romance for the ages. If still possible for you, this is one time the book should definitely be digested before the movie (also great but substantially different)."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"This book is fantastic. First I saw the movie with Ronald Colman and Greer Garson and enjoyed it (despite its tear-jerky nature). However, I found the book a lot more substantial and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"A book I reread over and over and still enjoy. Knowing the most important plot device ahead doesn't spoil it, but if you don't know it (and haven't seen the wonderful movie), you'll get a special delight from this great story."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"I'll start right off by mentioning that I've been a fan of the 1942 MGM film version of this novel, starring Greer Garson and Ronald Colman, for probably 20 years and have seen it close to 10 times. To my mind the film is as perfect as any Hollywood tearjerker of the era, as perfect a concentration of the love/memory theme as can be found.So you may not be surprised that I loved the novel a little bit less than most of the other writers here; it's pretty typical that when we love one version of a story and know it by heart that we come to another version - even if it is the original - with some baggage, and such was the case for me here. The film concentrates almost wholly on the romance of Smithy and Paula, and the personal life and attempts to regain the past of Charles Rainier. It greatlly shortens and simplifies all of the extra-romantic material that is a large part of the plot of the novel, in particular the Kitty subplot and the story of Charles rebuilding his family's financial empire; it eliminates the character of the parson and Smithy and Paula's time in London altogether.Thus one of the central themes of the novel - the disillusionment of much of Britain after World War I, the inability to cope with the destructiveness and hatred of the war - and the subsequent craving for peace that led to Chamberlain - is minimized in the film. I suppose that concentrated, more pure love story is what affects me, and too the novel's lack of characterization of Mrs Rainier until the very end unbalances it a bit, I think - one sees everything from Charles' perspective, but he is matched in his loss by another. I don't want to say more and spoil either the film or the novel for anybody; suffice it to say that they are different birds in many ways, the novel writ on a larger canvas and with more to say about English society, and an allegory about loss of innocence and lack of purpose in life that mirrors that of the country as a whole. If you feel that that part of the novel works a little better than I did, perhaps it will be 5-stars for you as well.But these criticisms aside, the book is clearly and plainly, though evocatively written, and Hilton's seeming ambivalence about politics and pacifism (\\"Lost Horizon\\" 8 years earlier was most definitely a more pacifistic and also optimistic book) is fascinating and generally compelling; and the ending of the novel matches that of the film in power, and perhaps even genuine surprise for the first-time reader who knows the story not at all. It's absolutely wonderful, and certainly helps elevate the work into something that should be remembered - if perhaps not quite, for me, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"Having read the reviews on this novel, I decided to give it a chance. I enjoy reading British authors. They have a way with prose! This nostalgic tale of love and loss is a bit reminiscent of 'Downton Abbey', perhaps on a smaller scale. The ending was a surprise and I won't be a spoiler. One thing discordant I can say is that the title does not seem to fit the book at all!If you enjoy stories of the WWI era, sublimely written, you might give this one a try.Random Harvest: A Novel"},{"Title":"Random Harvest","review":"This is a wonderful book!

The tale of the amnesiac veteran who came home to take over the family business when he would rather have been a scholar was believable.

I see people reading all these summer \\"beach\\" books written by ladies with three names, and just wish they would pick up (or download) something with imagination and tackle a Hilton book or W.

Before reading this book, every written account of the 'Paul Is Dead' rumor seemed the same to me...not much more than a list of the 'clues' and the Beatles' explanations. But Andre Reeves' book is not just a listing of clues...in fact, he saves that for the very end of the book. Instead he wisely gets behind the origin and evolution of the rumor, showing how a college student's tongue in cheek newspaper article snowballed into a national obsession, almost like a small fire gradually getting out of control and turning into an inferno. Reeves puts the reader right into those crazy weeks of October 1969 so that he/she can get a glimpse of a world unsure if the baby-faced Beatle was still walking the Earth, barefoot or otherwise. The accounts from the rumor's key players provide information previously unavailable in any Beatle books, and shed new light on many areas. Those who continue to profess that the Beatles concocted the whole thing really need to read this book before uttering another word about it. If you just want a fun-to-read listing of clues, there are many web sites that provide one. But if you are looking for some true stories behind the rumor that put it in a whole new perspective (in other words, if you truly wish to learn something,) 'Turn Me On Dead Man' more than satisfies."},{"Title":"Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Complete Story of the Paul McCartney Death Hoax (Rock & Roll Remembrances)","review":"Well, first of all, this book is a bit overpriced---it should be in the $24-26 range (though many of the books offered by this publisher---mostly books about rock music, television and Stephen King---are similarly priced) and the cover art is bland and prosaic (or as my wife put it, it's &quot;butt ugly&quot;).However, let me say that if I were stranded on the proverbial Desert Isle and I could take only 10 Beatles books with me, this would be among the lucky dozen (I always pack intemperately). I have accumulated quite a healthy library of Beatles books over the years (at last count, I had 194 tomes devoted to the Fab Four).&quot;Turn Me On, Dead Man&quot; is oddball fun, giving a delightfully askew glimpse of Paul McCartney and company during the band's final days at Abbey Road. As each Beatle wandered off to find personal fulfillment outside of the band during the summer of 1969, a rumor began circulating among the college kids and radio disc jockeys of the midwestern US. They all began to notice that McCartney was presented somewhat &quot;differently&quot; on the Beatles' album covers (barefoot on the obverse of *Abbey Road*; with his back turned toward the camera on the *Sgt. Pepper's* back sleeve). But it was the discovery of several backwards &quot;messages&quot; in the songs that really got this urban legend going (e.g., if the end of the song &quot;I'm So Tired&quot; is spun in reverse, a mysterious voice mumbles, &quot;Paul is a dead man---miss him, miss him&quot;). Spooky stuff!Of course, all of this was (and is) a wicked brew of nonsense, coincidence and wild speculation. But therein lies the strong sociological aspectsof this mere rumor. People need to believe in something: a hero, a martyr, a deity. People look for guidance in &quot;times of trouble&quot; (see McCartney's own composition, &quot;Let It Be&quot;). Besides Reeve's layman discussion of this factor, the author also includes a more professional essay by Barbara Suczek among the hefty collection of post-text appendices.There's even a compendium of the visual and auditory &quot;clues&quot; to McCartney's death that were discovered during the heyday of the rumor. All in all, a fun and spirited little book."},{"Title":"Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Complete Story of the Paul McCartney Death Hoax (Rock & Roll Remembrances)","review":"This book was completely overhauled and re-published in 2005 under the title TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN: The Beatles And The \\"Paul-Is-Dead\\" Hoax, and it is much improved and expanded over this older volume.

I doubt people who don't like the Beatles (horrors!) or who don't care about weird episodes in American pop culture will be interested. The narritive style may be a little too novelized to swallow but it is presented in an entertaining fashion. When does the movie come out?By the way, I know of one clue not mentioned.

There have been other situations in our history that were'nt at all what we were lead to believe.Case in point, the legendary Jesse James death hoax still rages on after over one hundred years one both sides. Was it really Charlie Bigalow or was it realy Jesse James who was killed in that house that day.They claim that J.J.'S cousin Bob Ford shot him in the back of the head n the bullit came out at the corner of his eyebrow making a small nice exit hole. AAAAAA excuse me but have you ever seen what a 44 or 45 bullit hole exit looks like? It would have exploded his face. Legend has it that they made a pact to not reveal their identitys until they all had reached the age of one hundred years of age. Of course none of them thought that they would live that long and after that date had passed, he was drawn out from those shadows and to everybodys suprise this 100 hundred year old man had the identical indentifying marks on his body that the Pinkerton detective agency had on the Jesse James of the 1870's. Not only that, but the investigater tracked down many people who were known to have known J.J. back in the day and 5 of the old James gangs members who were still alive all said that ol J. Frank Dalton was really the real Jesse james. Yet after this, the debate still goes on.Yes I know that this review is supposed to be about Paul McCartney, but what Im trying to get at is that some times these things do happen and there's always going to be no holds barred denial, skoffing skeptics ect...ect... then low and behold, after everybody involved is gone or that one person is gone, then the truth is let out.Remember several years ago when Iron Eyes Cody died at the age of 91 and only then did we find out that he did'nt have one drop of Indian blood in him but was in all reality 100% Italian? Yet he passed him self off as a Cherokee Indian all these years and nobody was the wiser. To top it off, the Indian Nation knew it all along and never said a word until MR. Cody passed away.What would everybody think if after the man that we know as Paul McCartney passed on and two weeks later, information is released that proves without question that this man really did take the place of MR McCartney so many years ago and had to forget who he really was and played out this roll for all these years without anybody being the wiser, all for the fans.

In those days Rock stars fell like flies but few had as many fortunes riding on them, he would have been replaced. In other words I think the &quot;Paul is Dead&quot; story is as likely to have happened as not. What is of greater interest is how far Beatles fans will go to disprove it. The very idea of the PID thingy seems to rock them to the foundation of their soul. To me -- that psychological phenomenon, swearing it a &quot;hoax&quot; and the like is more interesting. Who really cares if it is true Paul died and was replaced? We still got good music!

Amongst a backdrop of a cosmopolitan melting pot like New York, Dr. Mukhi accurately portrays the identity challenges many Indians face: they are caught in between cultures. If you are an Indian like myself, you will find many parallels within your own life. It is a poignant book &amp; I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Doing the Desi Thing: Performing Indianness in New York City (Studies in Asian Americans)","review":"Mukhi provides a good amount of research and understanding into the South Asian Diasporia in the northeast. There is a growing sense of how these people identify themselves in America. Different factors such as caste, ethnicity and religion come into play. The 'desi'- those of South Asian ancestory or immigrated at a young age are trying to identify themslves in the larger society. They are trying to find out what's like to be an Indian so far away. One of the more public displays of this is that of parades such as the India day parade or performance such as during deepavali festivals which are the focus of Mukhi's research. She's a desi being born in the Phillipeans and then immigrating in to the U.S. These public displays provide an opportunity to be in a large group to celebrate people's ethnicity, they can wear traditional indian clothing and eat Indian food. Indian movies also come into play because of India's role as the world's larges film producing nation and its imports to the Indian diaspoira. These movies provide an opporunity for desis to see movies made by those of their heritage."},{"Title":"Doing the Desi Thing: Performing Indianness in New York City (Studies in Asian Americans)","review":"This is indeed a one-of-a-kind book that everyone interested in performance practice should read. It exposes us to the south asian american (desi) community in the NYC area... Don't let the price scare u off -- it's really worth every penny. I've seen the writer, Sunita, perform around the NYC area and she is a true artist to the core. Her one-woman-shows are creative pieces of genius and her acting ability on par with folks like Eve Ensler, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Sarah Jones, Danny Hoch, and other amazing talents. be sure 2 check it out! Peace..."},{"Title":"The right to be lazy,: And other studies,","review":"This pamphlet bears a humerous name, but is a serious arguement for the eight hour day and the 40 hour work week. It was written in 1883 while the author was in prison and at a time when business leaders around the world were absolutely opposed to any shortening of the work week or the working day.It is a short and easy read and adds much to the readers understanding of the late nineteenth century."},{"Title":"THE ART OF CUISINE.","review":"The book is well done, enjoyable, funny in places, and will bring you back to the time of Henri De Toulouse-Lautrec and right into his kitchen! You will find out a bit more about his personality and quirks. It is peppered with his sketches and artwork and is a real gem. Highly recommended. All that and recipes too!"},{"Title":"Celebrated Crimes: Mary Stuart Vol. 3 (Celebrated Crimes)","review":"'Mary Stuart' is the second of the 'Celebrated Crimes' of Alexandre Dumas that I have read.Much like Harold Lamb, Dumas had a flair for storytelling, even when taking a foray into 'biography'. The story of Mary, Queen of Scots, proves no less as intriguing, well written, and engaging as any of Dumas' 'fictional' tales. Taking a factual account of the life, loves, and imprisonment and execution of Mary Stuart, more familiarly known as Mary, Queen of Scots, Dumas has once again triumphed in creating an engrossing, engaging narrative...albeit this time with a factual subject to write about.Mary, the doomed Queen of Scotland, marries for duty, more than for love. When the treachery of her husband, and his death, are uncovered, Mary's own complicity in his misdeeds, and his murder, are called into question. Finding herself at the mercy of her 'sister' Elizabeth, then Queen of England, Mary is imprisoned for many years for her 'crimes' before she is tried and eventually condemned to death.Throughout this work, Dumas paints Mary Stuart as a sympathetic heroine, put upon by the jealousy and wrath of her 'kinswoman' Elizabeth, and unfairly tried and executed as a co-conspirator against the crown of England.An entertaining read, Dumas' 'Mary Stuart' will entice and engage a reader eager for more knowledge of this tragic tale."},{"Title":"The best of Robert Heinlein;","review":"This is a collection of 8 stort stories written by Heinlein between 1939 and 1959. The stories are: Lifeline, The Roads Must Roll, And He Built a Crooked House, The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag, The Green Hills of Earth, The long Watch, The Man Who Sold the Moon, and All You Zombies. Good stuff! But calling it the &quot;best&quot; might be a streach. Doesn't have as much of the humour as some of his later works, like Friday and The Cat who Walks Through Walls. It is interesting to see how he imagined future events, some which have now transpired. A fun read."},{"Title":"The best of Robert Heinlein;","review":"While I did not purchase this collection, I have read all the stories, and all are classics. There is a better collection of heinlein work though, if you're willing to look. There is a collection titled &quot;The Past Through Tomorrow&quot;. It is a collection that includes a Heinlein timeline and such great stories as &quot;the Man who sold the moon&quot; and &quot;All You Zombies&quot;. I found mine at a local second hand store. If you're a diehard Heinlein fan, I highly recommend it, as it is well put together."},{"Title":"The best of Robert Heinlein;","review":"I would like to know exactly what this title is!

Tucked away in the back is this colorful gem with its fun cover and not-so-serious demeanor.I have written my share of code, most of which was in JCL and REXX on mainframes, so how hard can a mark-up language be, right? Not hard when you have the right book, and this book is it. I was able to quickly pick up the basics in a few hours, and learned a lot of tricks and cool things along the way. I could have probably gained the same knowledge with a more technical book, but I do not think it would have been enjoyable. I am fairly positive that if I did not have an extensive background in computers I would not have bothered to learn HTML from another book.Among the things I like about this book are: (1) It makes HTML accessible to anyone because it is presented in a highly visual manner. The design of this book is important because it makes learning easy, even for non-technical users who just want to get a web page up. (2) It goes well beyond the basics. You can have a simple, but attractive, page up very quickly, then refine it to include frames, multimedia pizzaz such as sound, animation and the such as you become more proficient. (3) It goes beyond the geek stuff to explain how to make a page eye-catching. This is really the hardest part of getting a web page up - anyone can create a web page, but it takes some real planning to create one that is not an eye sore. It stands to reason that authors who create visually appealing, well thoughtout books will pay attention to web page design, which is exactly what these authors did.This book is so well written that I found the time in my busy schedule to read it and create some pages on my PC (hint: you can make pages with your favorite editor and preview them from your hard disk using your browser before you upload them to your web site). Now all I have to do is find the time to refine and test my pages and upload them to my own site, which is in dire need of a facelift.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is fun to read, contains a wealth of information and makes learning HTML both fun and easy. Don't let the pretty cover fool you - the book also has some advanced techniques that are presented in a clear, friendly manner. If you want to put up a web page and thought it was too hard or technical buy this book. You will impress yourself and your friends."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This invaluable instruction manual breaks down web page design to its simplest form, and teaches how to harness the power and versatility of HTML to generate attractive looking web pages. The impression of having a private \`tutor' guiding you each step of the way is created through the step-by-step visual approach, seeing that you can emulate the exact procedures outlined without any apprehension, and then view the final result in a browser to measure your progress.Each procedure is conveyed in a logical sequence beginning with the basic concepts and proceeding to more advanced themes, so that learning HTML becomes effortless. This method of visually imparting knowledge eliminates the problem of having to leaf through several pages to find the screen shot that relates to the instructions, along with the frustration of having to re-read the same paragraph many times in order to grasp the main point.There is a detachable page at the beginning of the book containing a hexadecimal value colour chart with sample colours that can be applied to enhance the appearance of a page, and for easy reference, a comprehensive summary of all the HTML tags used in the course and their functions are given at the end of the book. In addition to the basic HTML tags, this impressive book also covers such areas as resizing images, creating tables, frames, adding sound and video, image maps, java applets and many more features that will allow you to easily create and publish professional looking web pages.This pictorial, self-teaching \`tutor' is just what any beginner or advanced student needs to benefit from the exciting domain of web page design."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"If you're *just* starting out learning HTML, you cannot do better than this book. It explains in very simple (and color-illustrated) terms how basic HTML works. Images, text, forms, sound and video, publishing and frames are covered. Everything you need. The two aspects I found most helpful were the color chart of hexidecimal codes and the section on cascading style sheets. The information in this book I keep finding over and over in 'higher-level' books, which often explain it much more poorly.If you are just starting out creating your web pages and like your information clearly explained, this book is what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This was an incredibly easy book to understand. Minimal words, lots of colorful pictures and fun graphics which show you (instead of describing to you) how to perform a function. I had another HTML book that I just got bored with after about 50 pages. This book was so engaging that I pretty much finished the book in a day and am able to start coding in HTML. This is a very good &quot;how-to&quot; book in the technical aspect of HTML. The only down side is that it promotes poor web page design (but this book is not about learning design so I'm still giving it 5 stars). For the design aspect of web pages, I would recommend picking up a copy of Robin William's &quot;Design for Non-Designers&quot; or &quot;Web Design for Non-Designers.&quot;A must for the beginner!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This book is a great way to learn the nuts and bolts of HTML coding. Its visual style is especially suited to HTML because HTML ultimately produces visual results. On the same page, the book presents a given command, the code, and what the visual results will be once the page is viewed. An extremely effective way of teaching HTML........................................... However, the book is not so strong on the design element, and thus is docked one star. For design, look no further than Steve Krug's &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; for invaluable design techniques to make your webpage more useable, and thus more effective."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"A truly amazing book that I keep coming back to. Unparalleled clarity of instructions, without being dry or assuming too much existing knowledge. A colorful, visual feast that makes learning about and coding HTML a near-effortless pleasure.If only all computing books were so well laid out and presented."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"Using this book is as simple as flipping through its pages to find a picture of the effect you want and then following the script below the picture while adding your own personal information in the blanks. It is very complete and very helpful, especially for a beginner who needs to do a web page, but will not do a lot of web pages day in and day out."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn HTML... especially beginners. It's completely visual (GREAT for a visual learner like myself)... and in COLOR! Each description is well organized, and it's a very simple book to navigate around. They show the actual computer screen to explain what you will be doing. It makes it so easy! It covers everything from basic HTML tags, changing the appearance of your website and publishing a webpage. I would have loved to have this book a few years ago when I first started working with HTML! If you want to get into programming but have no experience, try HTML -- you might like it! :) This was the first book I bought in this &quot;Teach Yourself Visually&quot; series, but after reading and using this book all the time, I plan on buying one for ALL the different computer related topics. This book definitely deserves an A+."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This book not only tells you how to design web pages, it SHOWS you, and with excellent color pictures as well. The instructions accompanied by the illustrations are very easy to follow. An excellent book for those who are new to web page design."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"Although I consider myself fairly computer savvy, I know absolutely nothing about webpage development. Until now. With this book, I was able to create professional looking webpages in literally, minutes. This is my first and only book I've purchased about creating webpages. I can't say that other books aren't as useful, but I can say, that this step-by-step approach, is fool-proof. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in creating webpages, with little or no prior knowledge of webpage development."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This books is excellent for the beginner. Very simple in text and the examples are great. This book follows the Visual style."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"I have been muddling my way through writing in HTML for a couple of years now and have figured out some of the quirks and wiggles on my own. I sure wish I would have owned this book from the get-go. Now that I do have it, I am able to better design my HTML tasks. The samples and examples are very crisp and clear, presented in color and are perfect for the visual learner. I use FrontPage 2000 to design my four web sites, probably not the first choice for those Super-Duper Web designers who wanna make a zillion bucks (ya, right...wake up in the New Millennium!!), but FrontPage 2000 has done all right by me. \\"Teach Yourself Visually HTML\\" is just the ticket to enhance and simplify my Web Designing adventure and seems perfect for the homebody web page designer in all of us."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This book is Terrific! It gets right to the point and doesn't waste time or words. It makes learning fun &amp; easy. If you have never written a web page or are just beginning HTML, this book is JUST RIGHT for you.Now I can't wait to get all of Ruth Maran's other books. School was never this fun. Thanks, Ruth for creating a book series that REALLY DOES THE JOB! A+++"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"I jumped to this book after finding HTML 4 FOR DUMMIES didn't cut it. This book, by the same publisher, does what DUMMIES should, include excellent examples within the text instead of an associated CD.

I use it in my classes, and the students all love it."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This book is so great - I bought this a long time ago, back when I was first learning HTML. I can't tell you what a great resource it was for me. I learned so much, so fast from this book. It really is a simple, straightforward guide to HTML and it actually teaches you a lot about what you are doing so that you can learn and apply these concepts to your own projects. It's a guide that beginners should definitely turn to, but is great for people who aren't just beginners as well because it has tons of cool stuff that you can learn even if you do know a bit about HTML. Plus it would be a great reference guide while building a website for yourself or for someone else. And another great highlight of this book is that its not skimpy or condescending like some of those 'for dummies' books."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"This is a great book for the computer-challenged individual. If you need to see what to do as well as be told what to do, this book will fill your requirement. It is quite basic. Instructions are simple and clear. I bought this book so that I could learn to build a website (which my high-tech teen age son promised to teach me one year ago but for which he never found the time). Before I could even begin to get proficient with my HTML coding using this book, my 13-year-old daughter snatched up the book and taught herself how to do a web site. Now she's miles ahead of me!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Visually HTML","review":"Following the advice of the others on this page I duly purchased this book. I can now safely say it will be my LAST time following the general concensus! What is WITH you people?A photographer/grafik designer by trade, specialising in print-based media I have never done web-based work (other than actually designing pages and buttons in Illustrator - and then having someone else doing the converting, assembly etc.) so I decided to buy a book and have a go. To get straight to the point this book is a piece of crap for the following reasons:i) (despite professing otherwise) It is totally incoherent, and follows a very illogical progression pattern.ii) The grafiks are so sadly outdated and amateur-ish I cringed every time I opened the book.iii) It fails to empower the reader to move freely and thus visualise their own ideas.iv) It is VERY incomprehensive.v) It is very hard to navigate, has no real index, no thumb tags etc.It is like a 'Big Mac' - it looks yummy and filling and when you take a bite it SEEMS to fill you up, but soon you are hungry for more REAL FOOD. My advice? Go for a less disturbingly 'visual' format that provides you with the building blocks to build your own house."},{"Title":"Petroleum Refinery Process Economics","review":"When I read the abstract for this book I thougth I would pick up some information or process description that would help pick out the most economical scheme to process a given feedstock. Instead what I got was mostly a rehash of what I can get from Hydrocarbon processing without any hard numbers or equations to use. The author spends most of the time describing databases of process inoformation he has collected and how he went about correlating the results, but without ever bothering to print the correlations that were developed. Instead you get tables comparing the authors correlations to other correlations which also are not published. This does nothing to help you know how to predict the performance of a unit."},{"Title":"Petroleum Refinery Process Economics","review":"Just echoing Dale's review.Very brief descriptions on refining products and processes and then a whole bunch of not really useful Excel-from-the-ninties looking like tables and the graphs developed from these tables.

(690 required to pass, on a scale of 1000). I have four years experience with cisco routers.I found this book very useful for learning several protocols that I have not used in the past. HOWEVER, this was complicated by the fact that there are large number of errors in the book. Most of the errors are in the figures and examples. It is so bad that I finally stopped looking at the examples and did my own example in a test lab. DONT EXPECT TO PASS THIS EXAM WITH ONLY THIS BOOK AS YOUR GUIDE.That having been said, the authors still manage to get their point across in a fairly short period of time."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"This book has so many technical errors it is essentially useless for its intended purpose, as a study aid for the BSCN test. Not only are there many technical errors, but the authors basic sentence structure is sometimes incoherent. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I will be sending it back for a refund!"},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"Want to know how many errors I have found in this book? Let's just choose Chapter 9. (keep in mind I took the course.) I never took the test so I bought the book to brush up on BGP. The author hasn't ever used BGP, otherwise he would have known that the &quot;set communities&quot; command is used in the Router(config-route-map)# command mode and let you know how to configure it. One of the most important objectives 'Route maps' is scattered in other sections requiring it, but there is no chapter or section on how to create them?!? There is two lines of code on creating them. There are over 30 commands used in route maps that you have to know for the exam! Where are they? Both the &quot;match&quot; and &quot;set&quot; commands, there are over 30 of them. The &quot;show ip bgp neighbors&quot; output was copied from the original 1.0 of the Cisco student guide. How do I know this? There where errors in the output that werent fixed yet from the original Cisco student guide and missing two variables. They are the same two missing in the book. The configurations for the labs, if you apply them on a router, the syntaxes are backwords and won't work for a few of the commands. Not only that, there is 140 messages received and sent on the output. With the neighbors configured, the received messages would have been much higher than the sent. The output isn't real! This was a rush job on a book and the most important part is BGP. Someone who knew BGP should have wrote the chapter that covers 50 percent of the exam. I just looked at one chapter and realized all the mistakes. Not only that the commands don't show the syntaxes which you need to know for the exam."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"I was excited to finally receive this book since it just came out and I wanted some material specifically focused on the BSCN, but now I'm disappointed. It was clearly rushed from the publisher as it contains typographical errors, wrong answers to review questions, and just plain incorrect information. If you have the book, check out section 3.3.1 where the author mentions that without using 0 and 255 as addresses, there are 253 available hosts. Hellloooo. My advice is to get ahold of the Cisco Press ACRC book (from CCNP v1.0) and use that in conjunction with this if you must. Hopefully, the publisher will come out with an errata soon (it will be lengthy) so people don't learn wrong information. The bottom line is this: if you have other materials, even if they are older, use those until better books come out. Follow Cisco's exam outline and use public documents and specifications. Follows newsgroups (alt.certification.cisco, comp.dcom.sys.cisco).My one good comment about this book is that the FAQs at the end of chapters are intelligently crafted with some good thoughts and information."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"Well it is obvious that I have the newest printing (purchased December 00) Mt. Thomas has obviously taken reader comments to heart and fixed every problem in their errata so the printing I have is excellent. I think that this book is excellent and I look forward to passing my test next month."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"Holy lack of proofreading Batman!! I've used dozens of other books to complete the MCSE, CCNA, and a few Solaris certifications. This one is definitely a contender for the most confusing and erroneous. A novice like me should not catch 100+(still on page 268) errors in a book written by a CCIE. This book might well have been proofread by an intelligent monkey. Imagine trying to learn complex topics while coping with misinformation, obvious contradictions, mislabeled diagrams, diagrams that don't pertain to the referring text, incorrect commands, incorrect syntax, etc, etc !! I don't even know what I think I learned is true! It's too bad nobody took the time to read it over before it went to the press. They often do a good job distilling key concepts. I, too, plan to ask for a refund and for part-time job proofreading future works. The errors I've found after only 10 hours of reading easily cost them a few stars. I think the positive reviews here are from folks already fairly knowledgeable with Cisco routing. True, computer and networking books tend to be fraught with errors, due to the greed of publishers trying to be first to press. This one though is definitely a standout."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"Good study tool for those with prior knowledge of routing, BGP, and the Cisco IOS.

The errors are unbelievable, the flow is choppy, and the illustrations are difficult to follow - just look at page 469. Quality was definately sacrificed for speed. I can't believe a CCIE put his name on this book. I hope the money was worth the discredit...Although the book did cover everything on the exam, the mistakes lead to lots of re-reading and frustration."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"I was excited to get this book, because it was the first (that I knew of) on the new BSCN exam. However, I very quickly found that its errors were too many and too egregious to be borne. It's as if the publisher never ran it past any editor at all. The book has some limited utility for a person who already knows the material pretty well, and can spot its awful flubs, but for someone learning from scratch - never! It is definitely not worth its steep price."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"This book and the Boson practice tests were the only things I used to prepare for the BSCN test and I passed with an 850. I did see some things on the test that I dont remember seeing in this book but not enough to matter. If you are looking for a book that shows you the test before you take it, then this is not the book for you. This book makes you read and comprehend - sorry. There were some errors but I have seen errors in every tech book I've ever read - even Cisco Press books. Get this book along with some practice test and you will be OK. By the time the so-called better books are published, you will have your CCNP."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"If you are planning to take the BCSN, or even if you're not but you're a network engineer, go pick this book up. It is full of valuable information for the test and for real world application."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"I only gave this book 4 stars because of the numerous typos. Bottom line is, it's an easy read--a much easier read than the Sybex book or the Cisco Press. If your goal is to pass the BSCN, and if you want a book that's straight forward, with the authors not trying to impress you with unnecessary technical mumbo jumbo, then this is your book. With this book, and the study questions from cheet-sheets.com, you're sure to pass. I passed with an 816 only reading this book once, reading two chapters a week. Just remember, you only need 690 to pass. Good luck."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"I found the book extremely helpful in terms of clearly explaining the overview of the concepts to be studied. But it was lacking in down &amp; dirty detail and as many people have pointed out was filled with typos and other errors. Using it together with the Cisco Press book really worked for me. If the typos are fixed, great, but I still wouldn't count on it as the only book to study from."},{"Title":"BCSN: Building Scalable Cisco Networks (Book/CD-ROM package)","review":"Bottom line, folks.

When I studied for the BCMSN exam, I was glad to have a copy of the McGraw-Hill book, but this one seems to be nothing but a quick shot, published before the others do. Very rarely, I read a book containing such a huge amount of errors. Fortunately, many of them are such obvious that you have to notice them at once; and not all of them can be presumed to be errata (or at least, they shouldn't be). For example, a multicast address of 2214.0.0.10 (!) was stated, and you will be presented a chaotic mixing of hyphenated and non-hyphenated commands which you will surely be asked to keep apart in the exam.Some chapters as those covering (I'd better say: not covering) EIGRP or BGP are much too short because many topics - as route maps - are almost completely omitted.

Everything you need to know for the BSCN exam is in the book, and it is presented in a very clear and understandable manner. It seems that the European touch that Mr. Aelmans and Mr. Houniet gave the book kept it clear from any confusing and totally unnecessary filling that I tend to find in so many certification related computerbooks. It makes me wonder what Cisco Press have found extra to fill their substanstially thicker book (no offense, but having experienced this exellent book, it makes me wonder). I agree that there are some errors in this book, but they are mainly typo's. So yes, I guess the editors failed their job somewhat. But the errata on CCPREP.COM are updated frequently and I guess this was the price to pay for being the first out with a BSCN book. I don't find it annoying.

I was immediately drawn into the worlds of these writers and artists and ultimately learned about incredible characters like Sylvia Beach, who was the first person to publish James Joyce's Ulysses, and Margaret Anderson, publisher of the modernist The Little Review.As a feminist scholar, Benstock analyzes the places these women occupied in the Paris scene as well as in a world in transition. She admirably examines the literary works of the writers, but the book never feels solely like a book of criticism. Biographical information abounds and gives each chapter something of a story arc.For readers who enjoy biographies of literary personalities but often miss the lack of detailed discussion of a writer's works, this book will not disappoint. And if you are at all interested Paris in the early part of the last century, modernism, or any of the many women discussed in the book (Edith Wharton, Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein &amp; Alice Toklas, HD, Mina Loy, etc.) this book will be an invaluable source of information."},{"Title":"Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900-1940","review":"Not really a biography, tho it is very biographic. Not really a study of Feminism, tho most of the women were early pioneers. Not really a study of Lesbians, tho most of the women were, at least, bisexual. What this book does, and it does it extremely well, is illustrate how these women struggled to 'define' themselves, as artists, as authors, as sexual beings, as individuals at a time when women were generally perceived as little better then simple minded children factories. From Gertrude Stein to Djuna Barnes to Natalie Barney (Rene Vivian...'a life spent looking for death')such different people but sharing a common thread of struggle (and cost). I've read a lot about this period and these women, and no book has given me a better understanding of them and emotional empathy with them, then this book."},{"Title":"Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900-1940","review":"This is a great book on the women who made huge contributions to that legendary period of culture: Left Bank Paris between the wars. Impeccably researched and beautifully written, it reveals, through multiple layers of history, biography and social commentary, the enormous and subtle influence of an extraordinary group of talented women whose remarkable gifts and achievements were usually overshadowed and often at the service of the male figures of the left bank scene. A completely absorbing book, I couldn't put it down from the moment I started reading it. One of those books you want to share with everyone, (and everyone I have shared it with shares my enthusiasm for it). An absolute favourite; I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900-1940","review":"I couldn't even get through the beginning of this biography; it was so dull. Now, I'm a feeler-type person, (an INFJ), so perhaps it's the style in which it's written that puts me off. It is very well-written, but, Women of the Left Bank is singularly mental; ironic since much of this time period was about the passions of the senses in oneself and towards each other.I far preferred Paris Was a Woman: Portraits of the Left Bank, by Andrea Weiss; Wild Girls: Paris, Sappho, and Art: The Lives and Loves of Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks (a delicious account of the intense and magnetic passion between these two artists), by Diana Souhami; Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation, by Noel Riley Fitch; Found Meals of a Lost Generation by Suzanne Rodgriguez-Hunter (more a cookbook than an examination of the history), and Forbidden Fires by Margaret C. Anderson (who really was there!). In fact, Paris Was a Woman goes remarkably well with Forbidden Fires (which starts with a biography and moves into a semi-autobiographical story). With the exception of Benstock's book, all of the above books create a sensual path of France's expatriate movement in the 1920's."},{"Title":"Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900-1940","review":"Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes, Jean Rhys as well as Sylvia Beach, Adrienne Monnier, Janet Flanner, Kay Boyle, Natalie Barney, H.D. and Bryer were the subjects of this relentless tome on literary women of the Thirties in Paris. The chapter on Gertrude Stein was the most interesting and stimulating. The sad life of Sylvia Beach and Adrienne Monnier came as a surprise to me. Djuna Barnes's last 40 years of life spent in isolation came as a shock to me. Natalie Barney proved to be a subject of interest only so long as she lived. Her writings and the consequences of her life have no present value or interest. H.D.'s writings prove to have no value, and I'm glad I never read her poetry. I am glad to know I don't deserve to feel regret for having skipped over her. Nancy Cunard's work I might read as a result of reading this tome, but only the \\"Negro\\" anthology. I haven't read Jean Rhys depressing novels, but I am motivated to do so as a result of reading Benstock's paragraphs about her.I can't say I really enjoyed reading this book.

This was not an easy task. It has been hotly debated whether Scholem actually cared about Kabbalah and the Kabbalists or whether he merely treated is as an objective area of scholarly interest. Either way, he made it his life's work and was eminently successful in his endeavors. Scholem knew the great psychologist/psychiatrist Carl Jung (though strangely Jung has very little reference to Kabbalah in his voluminous works). But, Scholem, at least to some degree, seems to have absorbed some of Jungian psychology. My favorite quotation from this volume is: \\"For the Kabbalists, symbols are not arbitrary or subjective, but have an essential inner connection with what they symbolize. Symbols are therefore the residue of divine names in human language. The great faith the Kabbalists had in language was a result of their belief in symbols as the bridge between human and divine language. In the modern, technological world...the disappearance of public symbols has become, according to Scholem, a 'great crisis of language'\\" on page 125. I think this is right on the money. I think it useful (as a Knowledge Manager) to get some context or background before trying to transform mere information into actionable knowledge. A book like this can help."},{"Title":"The Continental Philosophy Reader","review":"If one is interested in getting to know some of the trends in 20th century continental philosophy, I know of no better place to start than with this reader. Richard Kearney and Mara Rainwater break the book down into three sections: From Phenomenology to Hermeneutics, From Marxism to Critical Theory and From Structuralism to Deconstruction. Within each section, works are presented in chronological order from major thinkers within these broadly defined movements; this enables the reader to see both continuities and differences between the authors in each section.It is also helpful that Kearney and Rainwater note that many of the authors could have easily fit into multiple sections; 20th century continental philosophy then becomes something of a large dialogue between people from different decades and in different places. Anyone even remotely familiar with the topic will agree that continental philosophy is thick; it is to Kearney and Rainwater's credit that, in editing this reader, it loses none of its thickness but serves, instead, to draw the reader into the discussion/s that it contains.The introductions to each thinker are wonderful, detailing historical context and mentors, major trends and changes in the whole of their work. It would have been nice, however, if these introductions to said a bit about why a particular piece was chosen and how it fits into the history of one of the three sections. All of the pieces included are obviously not ground breaking in and of themselves, but some of them are and bristle with a level of intellectual rigour and moral clarity that the vast majority of philosophers would do well to remember - the selection from Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment is one such piece, and Walter Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History is another.Any knowledge of the history of 20th century Europe will help to put some of these pieces in a greater context; one can oftentimes feel the horrific weight of WWII and Nazism, for example, in the background of some of the pieces. If this volume is any indication, the companion volume, which is a history of 20th century continental thought, will also be well worth checking out. All in all, this is an excellent reader that I highly recommend to any and all interested in the area of 20th century continental philosophy."},{"Title":"The Continental Philosophy Reader","review":"As a student of Dr.Kearney, I can say with confidence that this work is a very excellent and informative survey of the world's modern western continental philosophers. For anyone interested in studying philosophy, this is an great place to find where your interests lie and where a possible concentration might possible develop. For those who seek specifics, this work is divided into a section of phenomenology and hermeneutics, then a section on critcal thinking and theory and finishes off with a study of structuralism. Definitely a worthwhile read for anyone interested in western philosophy."},{"Title":"The Continental Philosophy Reader","review":"If you do not have enough time to sift through all the important continental philosophers, but want to get a detailed summary idea of their thoughts, this book is an excellent primer. Kearney has done an excellent job of anthologizing selections of text that best represent each philosopher's thoughts. Treacherous waters of phenomenology, hermaneutics, deconstruction, and such can be navigated through these selections of writings, and there are excellent introductions to the philosophers and their work in the beginning of each text. Especially now that we are in the 21st century, these thoughts of the 20th century must be appreciated to know our own history - cultural, philosophical, and historical. This book is an excellent start."},{"Title":"Unfaded Pageant: Edwin Austin Abbey's Shakespearean Subjects","review":"Considering that this seems to be the only book in print on Abbey and his works, I'd have to say it is certainly the best of it's kind. I am a fan of Abbey's work, especially his Shakespearean subjects. Unfortunatly, I have been unable to learn much more about him with the expection of this book. It seems, in his day, he was considered an illustrator more than an artist and suffers from the classification in much the way that Norman Rockwell has. It is a shame, because much of his work is very beautiful and yet seems lost, even in this age of information super highway. This book is not so much a biography, as it is a simple chronical of his works relating to Shakespeare. It makes an interesting connection between his work and and the general notions in late 19th century Theatre about how a Shakepearean production should look. Unfortunately it reads very much like a University essay which has tackled a very narrow bit of subject matter. This and a lack of many full color images of Abbey's work is dissapointing, but when it seems to be the only source available, I will be thankful that it, at least, exists."},{"Title":"Unfaded Pageant: Edwin Austin Abbey's Shakespearean Subjects","review":"Disappointed.

He argues that the past regularities of nature are best explained by the existence of natural laws, and that these are in turn best understood as regularities causally imposed by God. The existence of such laws allows for rational inductive inferences.Foster's development of the theistic hypothesis (his preference for a single omnipotent, omniscient and perfectly good God) seems to borrow from Swinburne, but there are differences.I worry that there is no non-circular justification for the criteria for hypothesis choice that Foster relies on; Hume's problem of induction may re-emerge for inference to the best explanation. But perhaps it is no problem that inference to the best explanation is a fundamental form of correct reasoning which cannot be justified in a non-circular way (along with deduction), and the problem may be that induction faces an additional problem such that it is not a fundamental form of correct reasoning. (This has been suggested to me by a couple of people, and note Foster at Lecture 2, V).Foster covers some of the most interesting and important topics in philosophy, including the problem of induction, laws of nature and the existence of God. Very few people compare to Foster in clarity and grace of writing.This book may (or may not) be difficult for beginners, but it is strongly recommended for anyone seriously interested in induction theory, laws of nature and philosophy of religion."},{"Title":"The Divine Lawmaker: Lectures on Induction, Laws of Nature, and the Existence of God","review":"The Divine Lawmaker: Lectures on Induction, Laws of Nature, and the Existence of God by John Foster (Oxford University Press) presents a clear and powerful discussion of a range of topics relating to our understanding of the universe: induction, laws of nature, and the existence of God. He begins by developing a solution to the problem of induction-a solution whose key idea is that the regularities in the workings of nature that have held in our experience hitherto are to he explained by appeal to the controlling influence of laws, as forms of natural necessity. His second line of argument focuses on the issue of what we should take such necessitational laws to be, and whether we can even make sense of them at all. Having considered and rejected various alternatives, Foster puts forward his own proposal: the obtaining of a law consists in the causal imposing of a regularity on the universe as a regularity. With this causal account of laws in place, he is now equipped to offer an argument for theism. His claim is that natural regularities call for explanation, and that, whatever explanatory role we may initially assign to laws, the only plausible ultimate explanation is in terms of the agency of God. Finally, he argues that, once we accept the existence of God, we need to think of him as creating the universe by a method which imposes regularities on it in the relevant law-yielding way. In this new perspective, the original nomological-explanatory solution to the problem of induction becomes a theological-explanatory solution.The Divine Lawmaker is bold and original in its approach, and rich in argument. The issues on which it focuses are among the most important in the whole epistemological and metaphysical spectrum.The Divine Lawmaker is a slightly revised version of a series of lectures that Foster gave at the University of Oxford under the title of \`Induction, Laws of Nature, and the Existence of God'-a title that explicitly indicates the topics that form their subject matter.Foster covers quite a lot of philosophical and theological ground. And, on the face of it, diverse ground. But there is a connection between the different topics. One of his main aims is to provide an argument for the existence of God-a personal God of a broadly Jewish Christian type. Foster develops his arguments in four stages that include the topics of induction and laws of nature.Foster begins by looking at the familiar problem of induction, claiming that certain ways of attempting to solve it do not work. The idea of induction occupies the first two lectures. Next-at stage two- Foster introduces and defends what he asserts is, in its core, the right solution to the problem of induction. It is a solution that the Australian philosopher David Armstrong has also proposed independently at virtually the same time-Armstrong presenting it in his 1983 book What is a Law of Nature?, Foster in his 1983 paper to the Aristotelian Society entitled \`Induction, Explanation, and Natural Necessity'. Armstrong and Foster are at opposite ends of the metaphysical spectrum. Armstrong is the foremost modern champion of total materialism. Foster is one of the few modern defenders of a Cartesian conception of the mind; and, more exotically, Foster combines this mind-body dualism with an idealist view of the physical world (though claim is not developed in the context of this book). Both Armstrong and Foster find it amusing, and in a sense reassuring, that, with such contrasting metaphysical outlooks, they manage to converge on the same view in this understanding of induction and natural law.Now this proposed solution to the problem of induction involves accepting the existence of laws of nature, and it involves recognizing these laws not justas regularities in the behavior of things (consistencies in how the world works in different places and times), but as forms of natural necessity-as laws whose obtaining ensures that things behave and interact in certain regular ways. It is this that brings the discussion to its third stage in Foster's argument. Foster demonstrates that accepting the existence of laws of this kind, though facilitating a solution to the problem of induction, creates its own problem. The problem it creates is simply that, given the kind of necessity these laws involve, it is hard to see how to make sense of such laws-how the relevant notion of a law can be considered coherent.It is in relation to this new problem that, in the fourth and final phase of the discussion, Foster constructs an argument for the existence of God. For he argues that, given the problem of unintelligibility or lack of coherence, one can only achieve a satisfactory account of the of the coherence of laws if we entertain that there is a God of the relevant (broadly Jewish and Christian) type, and that it is God who is the creator of the natural world and the source of its laws. With the argument for theism in place, Foster concludes the discussion by looking again at the issue of induction, and showing how his earlier proposal needs to be reworked, in certain key respects, in response to the theistic necessity of holding moral and natural law. Foster's arguments, if one is able to follow them, may bolster faith and might seems irrelevant to those with nonthestic neutrality."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Soccer","review":"A review by a referee would have caught several mistakes in certain &quot;legalities&quot;...She says &quot;The end lines are also sometimes referred to as goal lines...&quot; The actual name of that line is the goal line.

This book was perfect! It provided a tremendous amount of information without getting too detailed in any specific area. The book begins with the basics and then takes you through the rules, formations, and strategies. It then provides wonderful information for coaches and parents by discussing training, drills, and ways to run a successful practice. As an athlete, I have read many books on the teaching of sports and this is one of the best. The author injects humor and quick fun facts throughout to keep it very interesting.

Oh yeah, and this one costs twice as much as the other one!"},{"Title":"Restless Wave: My Life in Two Worlds","review":"I picked this book up on a recommendation from a friend interested in anything Japanese and I'm quite happy I did. If you're sick and tired of reading about geisha, or if you like geisha but are interested in expanding your horizons and reading about the lives and struggles of other Japanese women who haven't been given a story, you owe it to yourself to read this book.Ayako Ishigaki gives voice in her memoir to post war Japanese women, fighting against the stereotypes and mixed messages sent to them via eastern vs western ideals. What's most intriguing about this is that I can still see this struggle played out today in the way female characters are portrayed in certain manga and anime; it gives a lot of context to modern day stories, and shows just how far Japanese women still have to go to be portrayed as humans and not mere objects of desire/ fetish.Lest you think this story sounds too high brow, never fear: its easy to understand and read on the subway or after a hard day of work. The writing is simple, clean, and flows well. If nothing else, the tidbits of Japanese culture and traditions (post and pre war) and the personal ancedotes of the author interjected in the story will stay with you long after the last page.Enjoy *(^_^)*"},{"Title":"Restless Wave: My Life in Two Worlds","review":"Ayako Ishigaki's wonderful fictionalized memoir is revealing for it's sometimes subtle, sometimes angry, and sometimes tender treatment of the both the culture she was born into and the culture she experienced in the U.S. It's also a remarkable historical document that presents views of Japanese women that may startle the reader. The writing is fluid and engaging. You can read it easily in a day or two."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"This is an informative book and starts out well. It tells you more than you could possibly want to know about IO but as the days ween into weeks, you find yourself wondering, &quot;Couldn't we just get to the point of it all?&quot; The &quot;book&quot; project tends to get a little cumbersome after about chapter 7. Who really needs a file viewing program that badly? But it is possible to skip those portions and still get the important stuff. It's very detailed and the examples seem to be short and well written, except for that d--n File Viewer! At any rate, if you buy it, you won't buy another because you'll be sick of Streams!"},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"It covers a lot of topics but I did find it particularly helpful in any way. The idea of gathering all the information about I/O into one book to use as a single resource is nice, but this book doesn't do a good job. Not that much help in explaining things and no help at all as far as practical examples went. You will learn much more from general Java books and Google searches."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"I picked up this book to cover multilingual charset issues, which are missing in all the standard Java resources but neatly listed in this title's contents/index. Great, I thought, something for those of us who speak English but sell software to the other 93% of the world.After I had laid my [money] down at the bookstore, I found out the sordid truth- the author is a newbie in regards to the multilingual issues but didn't let it stop him from writing down some shockers. To be nice, he probably got a little enthusiastic about Java's genuinely wide multilingual capabilities and tried to promote it, but some parts of this book are anti-education, end of story..."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"I got this book in the hopes of getting some more detailed information on java i/o than you can get from more broadly scoped books. Unfortunately, I found hardly anything in this book that is not discussed more clearly and concisely in the Java API docs. Six pages on reading and writing Integers? Fascinating! Save your money, get the API docs and search the discussion forums."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"A book that is written for any serious java programmer. It introduces a lot of new features in the jdk 1.2"},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"This book covers everything about the Java I/O library however the examples are so bad.... The author used a generic class for all the samples!! This is a good example of reusability however it doesn't help people who want to learn or copy those examples..... Frankly I don't recommend this book. If you're looking for good examples check out &quot;Java Examples in a Nutshell&quot; from the same editor...."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"This book does a fair job of covering the topic. I found it semi-useful. I would not recommend it however. Other books give you more value for the money. I would recommend the Java Tutorial series or; Just Java 2 by Peter Van der Linden, those are great learning books. They give you real value for your money. They do a great job of helping you learn what you need to, to get your programming assignments done at work. The Sun Java website has also been very helpful to me. There, you can find anything you need to without wasting 50 bucks for a book that does not help you that much."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"You'd probably do better following the tutorials on the Sun site."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"[Review of 2nd edition]Getting data into and out of files in your Java program can be painstaking when you consider all the variations... network resources as files, compressed files, text vs. binary data in the file, etc. Java has significant power in this area, but there's a lot to know and understand. Elliotte Rusty Harold has made the task of learning it all a little easier with the book Java I/O (2nd edition).Contents:Part 1 - Basic I/O: Introducing I/O; Output Streams; Input StreamsPart 2 - Data Sources: File Streams; Network StreamsPart 3 - Filter Streams: Filter Streams; Print Streams; Data Streams; Streams in Memory; Compressing Streams; JAR Archives; Cryptographic Streams; Object SerializationPart 4 - New I/O: Buffers; Channels; Nonblocking I/OPart 5 - The File System: Working with Files; File Dialogs and ChoosersPart 6 - Text: Character Sets and Unicode; Readers and Writers; Formatted I/O with java.textPart 7 - Devices: The Java Communications API; USB; The J2ME Generic Connection Framework; BluetoothPart 8 - Appendix: Appendix; IndexThe first edition of this book was written back in 1999, and that's an eternity in computer years. Not only has the java.nio classes come into play since then, but you now have devices that were either bleeding edge or concept-only in 1999, like Bluetooth gadgets. Harold has improved the basic material to bring it up to date with the current state of Java development, and added the additional information for I/O classes through Java 6. I appreciated the large amount of coding samples that he uses to illustrate his points, as it makes it easy to adapt your learning to your own particular situation. The examples are also very focused, so you don't end up trying to filter out extraneous code to find the applicable concept you need.There's another way to use this book that makes it even more valuable than just a reference manual. If you've been coding for awhile, it's possible that you've developed some ingrained approaches to file I/O that are outdated. By simply scanning the information here, you could easily find new ways to build your applications using newer methods. Or, you might find there are language features you didn't know existed, like the ability to write your files in a compressed format without having to go through a separate utility. Two or three personal revelations like that, and the book has quickly earned its place on the shelf.While you may not use this book for every Java application you build, you'll definitely want it whenever you're working with I/O logic..."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"The book is good, complete and shows you the details of I/O for Java (you should be at least an intermediate programmer); however, there are some errata that you must check in the web page of O'Reilly.You can download the code of examples from the web page, and this code is corrected (it compiles and run), but some examples in the book are not: If you write down the code directly from the book you'll realize the problems.I bought it in in mid 2001, but the corrections were not yet included in the edition I got, so supose you'll have to include them. Nevertheless, after doing it, you'll have a good book to study and use the I/O capabilities of Java."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"For anyone who knows Java's core language and wants to know more about the many ways to perform I/O in Java, then look no further. This is the best book available on the subject hands-down. It covers all aspects of I/O, including encryption, zipping, and networking as well as big discussions on the basics such as console and file I/O. This book is very readable as well in that the author saves the book from being as boring as a book covering I/O can be. All in all, it's worth every penny."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"discuss from all the sides, all what someone needs to write codes handling various multilingual Character sets. With this good style written book, I could finally understand the differences between the I/O classes, and how to use them. For its price, I really recommand it."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"Actually, I did not give a rating to the book. The book is plague with typos and errors, some of them required to rewrite a whole code example. I bought the second printing and was disappointed.My suggestion is to wait for later printings when all the errors have been fixed."},{"Title":"Java I/O (O'Reilly Java)","review":"This book is well written and informative. My favorite books are those that are written in such a fashion that the words flow from the page straight to my mind, do not past go, do not collect $200. This is such a book. There are a few typos, but the author mentions that corrections are available on his web site. Some reviewers failed to read the introduction to know this.If you're an experienced OO programmer of a different programming language currently building your Java knowledge foundation, get this book!"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function q(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const L=d(H,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-1f2a0cf6"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/27.md","filePath":"library/27.md"}'),R={name:"library/27.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(L)]))}});export{E as __pageData,P as default};
