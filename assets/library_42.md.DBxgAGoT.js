The notion that our persecution of animals expedited our persecution of each other is a disturbing argument. Furthermore, Patterson's conclusion that Hitler's worldview, the concept that the strong should dominate the weak, continues to exist today is troubling. Yet, he finds faith in the growing number of animal rights advocates who reject the slaughterhouse. Patterson is to be commended for his research and courage. I am not a vegetarian but Eternal Treblinka has prompted personal introspection.

Charles Patterson, author of \\"Anti-Semitism: The Road to the Holocaust and Beyond,\\" elaborates in \\"Eternal Treblinka\\" how American slaughterhouses became a model for the gas chambers of Nazi Germany and submits that the killing of animals for food, sport and research is no less an atrocity, a view that is sure to offend some.The book takes its title from the Isaac Bashevis Singer story, \\"The Letter Writer,\\" in which a Holocaust survivor speaks a poignant eulogy for a mouse he had befriended. \\"In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals it is an eternal Treblinka.\\"At its best, the book painstakingly reveals how the mindset that some humans are animals justified slavery, the subjugation of women, the annihilation of the Native American population, the eugenics movement and finally the Holocaust itself.By \\"domesticating\\" animals and assuming \\"dominion\\" over them, Patterson says, we desensitized ourselves to their suffering because they are \\"just animals.\\" It was then an easy progression to regard some human beings as more valuable than others. \\"Thus, with animals already defined as \`lower life' fated for exploitation and slaughter, the designation of \`lesser' humans as animals paved the way for their subjugation and destruction.\\"The book is filled with sordid revelations about well-known icons. L. Frank Baum, who delighted the world with \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" was a staunch advocate for the extermination of Native Americans, as was William Dean Howells and Harvard professor Oliver Wendell Holmes (father of the Supreme Court justice).Henry Ford was a virulent anti-Semite whose \\"The International Jew\\" sold 500,000 copies in the United States and was reprinted six times in Germany. Hitler kept a life-size portrait of Ford in his office, praised him in \\"Mein Kampf\\" and was quoted in the Detroit News as saying: \\"I regard Henry Ford as my inspiration.\\" Patterson points out that Ford modeled his assembly line after the American slaughterhouses, a concept not lost on his admirer, Hitler.In a chapter chillingly titled \\"Improving the Herd, From Animal Breeding to Genocide,\\" Patterson traces the American eugenics movement, which applied the principles of animal husbandry -- \\"breeding the most desirable, and castrating and killing the rest\\" -- to the sterilization of criminals, the \\"feeble\\" and mentally ill, a handy paradigm for the \\"racial cleansing\\" of the emerging Third Reich. \\"The progression from sterilization to extermination has been a logical one for the Nazis.\\"Patterson notes that long before Hitler came to power, Jews had been vilified as animals. \\"Calling people animals is always an ominous sign because it sets them up for humiliation, exploitation and murder.\\" Like animals, Jews were \\"herded\\" into crowded cattle cars, transported long distances without food or water, tattooed and \\"selected\\" for extermination and led through tubes to the \\"killing floor.\\"If Jews are rats, one need feel no guilt in degrading and exterminating them. If Jews are pigs, then the crematoria were mere \\"processing plants.\\" Patterson quotes the artist Judy Chicago, who wonders \\"about the ethical distinction between processing pigs and doing the same thing to people defined as pigs.\\"Many would argue that to compare Nazi genocide to the slaughterhouse is to trivialize the Holocaust. I, for one, was appalled. To buttress his case, Patterson provides numerous \\"testimonials\\" from Holocaust survivors and their families as well as from Germans who became animal activists because of their experience, not in spite of it. While the stories are compelling, here Patterson is preaching to the choir.The events of Sept. 11 and the continuing suicide bombings in Israel demonstrate that there are individuals today who do not value the sanctity of even their own lives, much less that of other humans. Patterson may experience difficulty, therefore, in convincing a nation of mindless hamburger eaters, now focused on survival, to turn its energies to the plight of the cow.And yet, perhaps an extreme view must be taken to get attention.In the book, animal activist Christa Blanke, a former Lutheran pastor, notes that \\"130 years ago, the church remained silent about the slave trade because they were only black people. Fifty years ago, the church remained silent because they were only Jews. Today, the church remains silent because they are only animals.\\""},{"Title":"Monologion and Proslogion With the Replies of Gaunilo and Anselm","review":"Saint Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109) was a medieval philosopher, theologian, prior of Bec, and Archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1109. This volume includes the Monologion, the Proslogion, Gaunilo's reply to the ontological argument, and Anselm's reply to Gaunilo's reply. Anselm is known by the motto \\"faith seeking understanding.\\" However, it should be noted that Anselm is not \\"hoping to replace faith with understanding\\" (xiii) but rather the better that you come to know God \\"the more you will see that he is worthy of all your love\\" (xiv). The Monologion proceeds on these themes, exploring God's Divine attributes and provides a few arguments for the existence of God. The reader will be immediately struck by Anselm's obsession with semantics - Anselm argues that \\"systematic reflection on the language of Christian doctrine is... always in the service of a better understanding of God\\" (xv). Anselm also discusses the question of Biblical metaphor, Trinitarian theology, and the rational soul.The Proslogion contains the famous ontological argument. Anselm's ontological argument is as follows. Premise I: God is by definition that than which no greater can exist meaning that God is the most perfect object, the most perfect being that can be thought about. Secondly, it is understood that it is greater to exist in reality and the mind than to exist only in the mind. If you tell the fool who does not believe in God to think about the concept of that than which no greater can exist, that concept exists in his mind. Even the fool cannot doubt that the concept exists in his mind since he had heard it and understood it and \\"whatever is understood is in the mind\\" (pg 150). Premise II: Anselm states that that which exists in both the mind and in reality is greater than that which exists only in thought. God by definition is that than which no greater can exist and if it does not exist in reality it contradicts itself. Conclusion: God exists. The rest of the Proslogion applies this \\"proof\\" to other attributes of God.Gaunilo's primary objection to Anselm's ontological argument takes the form of an island. Premise I: Imagine the perfect island, the island that no greater than be thought. Premise II: The Island of that than which no greater can be thought plus existence is greater than the island in the mind. Conclusion: Thus, the perfect island of that which no greater can be thought exists in reality. But we know that that island surely cannot exist in reality. Then Gaunilo shows that one can prove every highest form of any kind using his argument. Thus, man can think of the perfectly evil being in the mind and prove its existence.Anselm replies that Gaunilo application of the island is a type of form, and the perfectly evil is a type of being. While in his ontological argument he was arguing for the greatest extent of being possible, not just a form of perfection, but ultimate perfection itself. In response to the argument that the mind cannot hold truth from \\"the verbal formula\\" (pg 150) Anselm states then the mind is not actually thinking of that than which no greater cannot be thought. And if the concept of than which no greater cannot be thought can be thought to exist then it must exist \\"of necessity\\" (pg 156).Sadly, the Introduction to this work is almost to brief to be of much use besides explaining Anselm's Proslogion and Monologion. Gaunilo's reply is practically ignored and the ramifications of Anselm's ontological argument are not even touched on. Anselm's proof has long reaching Philosophical implications and influence and this volume apply lays out for the diligent reader the necessary primary sources. A must buy for the those interested in Medieval History and Medieval Philosophy (and hopefully other philosophy buffs)!"},{"Title":"The Texas Rangers and the Mexican Revolution: The Bloodiest Decade, 1910-1920","review":"During the decade of 1910-20, tensions between Mexico and the United States over incidents relating to Pancho Villa's threat to Mexico's president Venustiano Carranza and U. S. incursions into Mexico led by General John Pershing had become so tense that the \\"situation was not dissimilar to that of Jewish settlers in the West Bank\\"; with the small number of white Texans along the border being compared to the Jewish settlers surrounded by a much greater number of resentful Palestinians. In this situation, the Texas governors of this decade--Colquitt, Ferguson, and Hobby--used the Texas Rangers to protect Texas citizens and combat the tactics of Mexicans directed by Carranza and in some cases acting as vigilantes. The unique and in ways controversial activities of the Texas Rangers in this complex, volatile, and fluid situation is the subject the authors hone in on. Harris and Sadler, both former professors at New Mexico State U., bring to light little-known dimensions of the historical events, which continue to affect relationships and feelings between the white Texans and Hispanics in the area. There was much lawlessness on both sides. Mexican Army troops dressed as civilians crossed the border to raid Texas communities. After Texas Rangers executed two Mexican agitators after taking them by force from the F.B.I., the U. S. Attorney General issued an order that all prisoners henceforth be held by the U. S. Army. The situation was especially complicated not only because of points of opposition between Texas and the U. S. Federal Government, but also because of Mexican president Carranza's desire for recognition by the U. S. while trying at the same time to stand up to it. While concentrating on the unique role of the Rangers in this complex historical situation, Harris and Sadler also construct the context in which their activities took place."},{"Title":"The Texas Rangers and the Mexican Revolution: The Bloodiest Decade, 1910-1920","review":"The Mexican Revolution was at its most bloody point during this decade and spilled over to the United States on some occasions. This book analyzes the role of the Texas Rangers, Untied States Military and other groups during the time of the revolution. Mostly it is a policing action to keep violence from spilling over into El Paso but occasionally they are attacking cattle rustlers who cross the border including Pancho Villa. The Texas Rangers were essential in defending the frontier during this timer period and performed many valuable services. While there are several books that exist on the Texas Rangers this is the only one that I have run across that really explains their role within Texas as a whole. Both authors do an excellent job of bringing their knowledge about the revolution and weaving it within the context of Texas History. Their discussion of the Plan de San Diego which was an attempted revolt by Mexicans across the border was truly terrifying and they do an excellent job of giving the governments response to it. This book is excellent for anyone who wants a knowledge about how state forces responded to a crisis during the early 1900's. For those who love the Texas Rangers this is a must have to their library."},{"Title":"The Texas Rangers and the Mexican Revolution: The Bloodiest Decade, 1910-1920","review":"There has much been written on this period for and against the Rangers in this part of Texas.

Blood on the Border: The United States Army and the Mexican IrregularsIn any case they had to furnish their own mounts, and even badges. The whole organization was riddled with politics. Rangers served at the pleasure of the governor under the Adjutant General, who also oversaw the organized militia (later National Guard)Though termed companies, they seldom were larger than a modrn day infantry squad; there were usually Ranger captains and once in a while a sergeant, but the rest were privates. Som rangers were good leaders but because of the constant turmoil in the ranks, back and forth between private business, the Customs Mounted Inspectors, and local law enforcement, there were some brutes in the ranks who resortd to the ley de fugo, and killed both innocent and guilty alike.The Carranzistas controlled the Mexican side, and cynically fired on Army patrols on the US side.

Walker's purpose is to \\"describe and explain the American century through the lives and careers of a handful of individual Americans.\\" He discusses 26, each whom he views as representative of a specific component within the evolution of American civilization. For example, Teddy Roosevelt (Ambition), Emma Goldman (Dissidence), Woodrow Wilson (Idealism), William Boeing (Air Transportation), Lucky Luciano (Crime), Katherine Hepburn (Stardom), and Alan Greenspan (Banking).One of my favorites of the 22 essays is that which discusses Walt Disney (representative of American Entertainment). Walker first quotes Joseph Nye: \\"Soft power occurs when one country gets other countries to want what it wants, in contrast with the \`hard' or coercive power of ordering others to do what it wants.\\" In response, he suggests that \\"the essence of America's new global hegemony was that the United States was not only the unique military superpower but also the dominant soft superpower, which [because of Disney's films] invented the world's dreams and defined its aspirations....The Disney Corporation has become the heartland of soft culture's colonial realm. It is unmatched in pillaging there cultures of others to repackage them in Disney's universal vocabulary....[Disney] aimed for what he once described as \`that deathless, ageless, absolutely primitive remnant of something in every world-wracked human being which makes us play with children's toys and laugh without self-consciousness at silly things....You know, the Mickey in us'.\\" These brief excerpts correctly indicate Walker's highly subjective and yet circumspect perspective on 22 quite unique Americans. I have already mentioned eight. The others are \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing, Henry Ford, Babe Ruth, Duke Ellington, Winston Churchill, Frank Lloyd Wright, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Walter Reuther, John Steinbeck, Albert Einstein, George Marshall, William F. Buckley, Jr., Richard Bissell, Billy Graham, Richard Nixon, Martin Luther King, Jr., Betty Friedan, and Bill Clinton.

History is not about great sweeping flows and the tidal forces of social and economic change but about people, about individuals, and what they made of the world they encountered. This book explores the American century through a thoughtfully-chosen group of individuals: the film stars and criminals, the spies and generals, the preachers and bankers, the dreamers and the dissidents. And the author takes us from the particular to the general, putting those deeper social forces into the background where they belong. I never knew that modern US aviation depended on William Boeing not only for his airplanes, but because he also founded United Airlines. I never knew that evangelist Billy Graham was such an intense political animal, or that John Steinbeck was suspected of communist subversion by the FBI, or that Richard Nixon was by most counts a liberal politician, or that Emma Goldman tried to raise funds for the revolutionary cause as a prostitute. I had also never thought about Bill Clinton in such historical terms before, nor realised that the real revolution for American women was economic rather than erotic.

Though not aspiring to do any such thing, journalist Martin Walker has come very close to it by encapsulating the essential and enduring features that define the American character.\\"I suspect that this book began unconsciously as a love letter to America from a foreigner who sees it both as a second home and as an inspiration.\\" Thus Mr. Walker begins \\"America Reborn,\\" and what follows is a chronicle of the twentieth century as marked by the lasting footprints of twenty-six larger-than-life Americans.Beginning with Theodore Roosevelt's ambition and ending with Bill Clinton's new America, \\"America Reborn\\" is a sweeping narrative that couples people with their impacts on American life-Roosevelt with ambition, Woodrow Wilson with idealism, William Pershing with the army, and so on. But Mr. Walker knows that there is more to America than politics: his book includes such diverse personalities as Babe Ruth, Duke Ellington, John Steinbeck, Walt Disney, Lucky Luciano, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Katherine Hepburn.In the end, the book does feel like a \\"love letter to America.\\" But it is not the kind of love which would blind the author; perhaps, it resembles that of Emma Goldman, one of Mr. Walker's heroes: \\"the kind of patriotism we represent is the kind which loves America with open eyes. Our relation to America is the same as the relation of a man who loves a woman, who is enchanted by her beauty and yet who cannot be blind to her defects.\\" It this simultaneous love and concern which makes the book both candid and remarkably enjoying."},{"Title":"America Reborn: A Twentieth-Century Narrative in Twenty-six Lives","review":"I was given this book as a July 4 present, took it on vacation, and when I'd finished a stack of my usual mysteries, picked it up and began to read.

I'd vaguely heard of Emma Goldman, but to read about her trying prostitution to get the money to buy guns was a revelation, and so was the way Billy Graham heard the Lord's call on a golf course. It's a book about a really fascinating bunch of Americans, brilliantly told. It even made me feel better about voting (twice) for Bill Clinton.

The author makes no pretense to objectivity or balance in his reporting of events.Nixon is roundly (and righlty) criticized for contributing to the economic debacle that afflicted this country after he left office. However, Johnson and Carter -- equally culpable -- shoulder little blame.The author is rightly critical of the excesses of McCarthyism. But he fails to address at all legitimate (documented) instances of subversion. Ethel and Julius Rosenberg merit not even a mention. We learn only that Alger Hiss was &quot;persecuted&quot; by Nixon, but hear nothing about his nefarious activities.The CIA is portrayed as modern day Keystone Cops, bumblers whose every success is the result of fortuity or happenstance. Somehow, President Kennedy skirts any blame for the Bay of Pigs fiasco.Bill Buckley's Conservative Revolution is basically cast as a failure, despite the fact that most of its main precepts have been co-opted by Clinton and a Conservative majority governs the Congress at Century's end for the first time since the 1920s.The Sixties counter culture is lauded, with nary a mention of any unintended consequences (rampant drug use, unwanted pregnancies, demise of authority) that it unleashed.The encomium to President Clinton is almost laughable."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Love","review":"A remarkably well-written book - a MUST for everyone's library.

The book has details that make you wonder if some of these incidents could really happen....and some of the incidents could have been taken directly from the headlines."},{"Title":"Capitol Scandal","review":"\\"Capitol Scandal\\" is not in the genre that normally interests me, but I picked up a copy in one of the twenty-five-cent bins at a local yardsale and I'm not sorry that I did.Sarah Gregory is a very good writer and a fine story teller. I didn't find this to be the legal thriller that is promised on the cover, but it is a very engrossing story. It centers on the murder of a young intern at the nation's capitol by the name of Courtney Lee and the subsequent charges against a Texas congressman, Will John Benedict. A Texas criminal attorney, Sharon Hays is pressured to defend Benedict against her will. As the story unfolds Hays's history with the Benedict family is gradually revealed. There is very little of the courtroom drama that I had expected when I picked it up. This is a well paced story, but the villain is quickly established and is a constant throughout. In the end the murderer is no surprise, but there are a lot of plot twists along the way. The reader feels compelled to continue with the story to see what the next page will reveal and there are a number of surprises toward the end.The story is quite good, but it is overshadowed by the strong personality of the main character Sharon Hays. Sarah Gregory has brought Hays to life in 3-D. She is not only a beautiful, strong willed and courageous career woman who leaves no stone unturned in her quest for true justice, but she is also a compassionate and loving mother to her teenage daughter. Her tragic past is brought to life and her unrelenting push to incriminate the man whom she hates most and knows to be guilty of heinous crimes makes for a riveting read.Overall this is and outstanding fiction work and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Capitol Scandal","review":"I found that Capital Scandal kept me reading long into the night. No matter how I thought this book would end I was surprised at the end to find something that I never thought would happen. I can not wait to read Ms. Gregory's other books."},{"Title":"Capitol Scandal","review":"Courtroom and Washington politics collide in this thriller. I thoroughly enjoyed the main character, Sharon Hayes and Gregory's style of portraying this woman conflicted with her past, her job, her mentor/boss, and most importantly, her child. I whipped right through this and could easily picture the characters who would play them in the movies. I'm off and running to buy more books with Sharon Hayes."},{"Title":"Capitol Scandal","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I have read all of Ms. Gregory's books and they have not disappointed me yet. This is a good one."},{"Title":"Capitol Scandal","review":"not particularly legal,nor thrilling. tone is decidedly lowbrow. main character is portrayed as a feisty,confident, modern woman; but she comes off as crude,contrived, immature and brazenly disbarable. vulgar titillation even by d.c. gossip standards. well below average."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"A first for me from this author. I was really impressed with the writing and depth. Its hard to find such depth and emotion, true emotion in a romantic suspense, but this had it. I loved the way the writer Ms George touched on a very sensitive subject in this and made us wonder in the end how it would turn out. There was no 'I knew it' or 'so typical' in this one.Written in more true and realistic form, it impressed me at her use of several touchy subject matter that I found refreshing in a romance novel. One being the heroine wasn't perfect nor was she flawless. She was flawed and real and I loved her.A different spin on the good twin bad twin storyline.Abby St. James finds herself suddenly at the mercy of a company her father has built and her twin has run without a safety net. Her sister is none other than the 'Black Widow,' or also known as Michaela St. James, three-time widow to old men...old rich men that is.Abby is nothing like her conniving and deceitful sister who loves money and men and designer everything. Abby is shy and reserved and every bit the 'country mouse.'Taking over her sister's designer shoes for a while in the trendy magazine called 'Bastian,' she comes face to face with Michaela's adversary and the very man her sister detests. Also the very man she has dreamt about for nealy ten years, Stephan Massari.Stephan mistakes Abby for her evil twin and soon Abby feels stretched beyond her limits. Despite his adverse taste for the hateful woman, he seems oddly attracted to the 'new' Michalea. And soon he feels she is playing a deadly game with him.Abby soon realizes impersonating her twin is not only dangerous with Stephan, for the man seems like he is about to snap, but another deadly game has begun...someone else seems determined on ending her sister's life and doesn't know who she is.Can Abby get through this alive? Is her sister's hide worth this trouble? How had she made so many enemies? A list a mile long is forming and the more the killer contacts her, the more she must trust to reason with Stephan, the only person who may be able to save her.Creepy and enthralling. I Loved it! A true delight.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"Astute fans of Melanie George will find that her last effort The Art of Seduction albeit of a historical timeframe bears an uncanny resemblance to her newest contemporary romance To Die For. Both features twins of polarized nature and switches identity to mislead their love-interest.However To Die For is distinctly darker and more sexually oriented materials with its theme on voyeurism and S/M normally eschewed by romances. Abby St. James embarks on a stint stipulated by her deceased father in a codicil and takes the helm from the domineering, wilful Micky to supervise Bastion, a leading Magazine pioneered by their father. She meets sexy Italian hunk Stefan Messari and finds herself attracted as both shares their dark secrets. Abby decides to abandon all for a night of passion with Stefan, knowing that her days are numbered with an illness. Yet the greater danger lies in a sadistic and deranged psychopath threatening Abby's sanity when he assumes Abby is Michaela....Even with its taboo topics and intermittent suspense, To Die For is actually a melodramatic tearjerker that will have you emptying out Kleenex - and unabashedly drives our cynicism aside with the saintly noble Abby forfeiting her chance of love because of her illness and sterility while the brooding Stefan is her knight in shining armour. Can't stand the mush? Then why in the first place are you doing here in romance genre? Ms. George again delights us with a read of sheer escapism and gooey-eyed, melting romance with searing passion. It's one hard-core addicts of romance would die for but pragmatists would gladly avoid."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"This book has it all-romance, hot love scenes, mystery, suspense, and real life issues. The book is about Abby St. James, a woman who has overcome alot of tragidy in her life. While her twin sister is away, Abby takes her place at the magazine that they own. There, she gets involved with her childhood crush Stephan Massari. Issues from her past threaten her new relatioship and it doesn't help that a killer is after her, thinking that she is really her sister.If I gave anymore away, I'd ruin the book for you.

From sexy Italian publisher Stefan to the secretaries, everyone mistakes Abby for Micky, and Abby decides it might be easier to accomplish her task if she lets everyone believe she is Micky. Except that everyone hates Micky, some enough to want to see her dead.Abby starts falling for Stefan, and vice versa. As Abby continues the deception of being Micky, the ensuing revenge against Micky escalates. So does the passion between Abby and Stefan, whose heart is definitely in the right place. Add a past history of sexual abuse, a life threatening illness and its culmination, this story line will keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the end. I found this is a somewhat emotional story for a suspense novel, but lends to the strength of the characters becoming who they are and giving them more depth.This us my first read by Melanie George, but definitely not my last. I immediately picked up &#147;The Mating Game&#148; and laughed through this whole entertaining book. Her heroes are to die for (no pun intended), and I look forward to reading the &#147;Devil&#148; series"},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"Melanie George delivers a riveting and enticing novel with \\"To Die For.\\" Rarely have I read such a heart stopping depiction of a contemporary romance hero. Although this story occurs in a corporate setting of a successful magazine publisher, the main characters definitely carry the majority of the story. Often, it seems, in a romance novelist's efforts to set the environment of the novel, the reader is deluged with facts and figures and sometimes dragged down in too many details. Most readers, I would presume, read a romance novel for the romance and we want it to be in a believable, accurate setting. But we are not reading the book, as in this case, to learn more about publishing. We are reading about the lives of the people who manage the publishing. This author has created an interesting publishing arena for her story that frames a remarkable romance.Abby St. James has just inherited her father's business, Bastion, a highly successful gentleman's magazine. Abby has never been involved in her father's business and lives in Idaho. Abby has not lived with her father since her parents' divorce when she was a child. She has lived with her mother, caring for her until her recent death. Abby's twin, Michaela, has both lived with her father since the divorce and has worked for his magazine.Michaela has a bad reputation with men. She has cruelly used men and actually married several older men, all who have died. Her reputation also reaches to the magazine publishing business where she is known to be vindictive, autocratic, and impulsive to a fault. Through her actions at work, she has alientated the publisher, Stefan Massari, and he hates working with her and distrusts her is all matters. When Abby inherits all of the magazine company, Michaela goes to Europe for an extended vacation and Abby begins working at Bastion. Upon her arrival at work her first day, she is blasted by the magazine's publisher, Stefan, for Michaela's actions prior to her trip to Europe. Abby has no intention of deceiving any one about her identity, but just as Stefan has mistaken Abby for her twin, others within the company do so as well. Almost immediately, Abby decided to keep her true identity a secret to give her time to assess the possible damage her twin has done within the company. Needless to say, no one likes Michaela and Abby contends with her enemies within the company as well as in her personal life.Stefan is appalled to find he is consistently drawn to Michaela when he has never before. He cannot figure out what she is up to because she is no longer the hostile, demanding, and selfish woman he remembers. Abby is a gentle spirit and as opposite her twin as possible. She is inexperienced with men and basically a very shy person. This is the person that Stefan is drawn to and Abby is definitely fighting a strong attraction to Stefan.This book is not a light read. It covers a lot of heavy issues such as rape, suicide, illness, sexual perversion, and murder. It is not your typical romance novel. I usually read several novels concurrently. It helps me savor each story if I do not allow myself to rush through a book to see how it ends. This, however, is one book I could not read while reading other books at the same time. It demanded all of my attention. I did not want to quit reading it and did read it non-stop with only one or two breaks.The hero, Stefan, is certainly dreamy. He is not so much the forceful dominant male we see so often in romances but yet he does dominate any scene he is in because of his immense self-confidence. He is also not your typical rake - he is choosy about who he dates and does not play around just for the sex. He has a very mature personality and carries the role of publisher of this very classy magazine easily. He seeks to understand the motives of a person's behavior and is a well-liked and accepted manager.Abby is a saint compared to her twin, Michaela. She works hard, treats her co-workers with respect, and offers smart, sensible suggestions. She is thoughtful and conservative and is the type of woman Stefan has always wanted. He has the desire and need to have as his future wife a person he can take care of. Michaela could never fit that role but this new Michaela he sees - does. Yes, he is one confused man.The romance between Abby and Stefan is bittersweet until Stefan discovers her true identity. The two don't communicate through fighting and misunderstanding. The growth in their relationship is truly touching. The chemistry between the two is rich and tangible. On a scale of one to five, the sensual scenes are a solid four (see \\"more about me\\" for sensual rating guidelines) and occur several times.Any time in the book that Abby and Stefan are on the same page, you have got some great interaction going - even if it is a disagreement. You truly feel their emotions when in each other's company. The story is moving and heart wrenching. Stefan is one of my favorite contemporary heroes. I will definitely keep this book to read again at another time. I could read it again right now. This is the first book I have read by this author and am now looking forward to reading her other novels. Although this book has been referred to as melodramatic, it is still a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"This was a dark, fast paced read that I found to be very entertaining but was let down by the lack of suspense. I felt that although the chemistry between the two main characters was great there was a decided lack of suspense to be found.This was a first time read for me by this author and so I am not sure of her ability to pen a great suspense. Although there was plenty potential for the suspense to be more intense I feel that the author concentrated more on the relationship between the characters instead.Still in all a good way to pass a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"This book - to put it politely - is not very good, which is quite a shame since all of the other books by the author are quite fabulous, especially the Devil series. It's as though the author decides one day to write a book on some dark issues, and went about writing it without wondering how she would go about it. Add divorce, rape, murder, drugs and sadism and stir it all together and voila - To Die For. She added a pair of twins, got them to switch identities without explaining really why they had to do that, made the twin who lived in the city incredibly bitchy and the other who lived in the country incredibly sweet, added a guy who hated one twin and fell for the other, and add a stalker who hated both. **SPOILER** And to end it off, have someone almost die of a deadly illness and get a self-centered person save the dying character. A tearjerker? Not at all. If you want to read a romantic suspense thriller, also with many dark issues, there's always J.D. Robb and Julie Garwood is pretty good in her foray into romantic suspense. Give To Die For a wide berth, but read Melanie George's other books."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"It's hard to believe that the same writer wrote this book and all the great Devil books. Devil May Care, Handsome Devil, The Devil's Due...all great reads. Like No Other and The Art of Seduction. Great reads. Her two contemporary books (this one and The Mating Game which I could even finish) lack the writing style, the witty dialogue, the great characters. In To Die For, the heroine is a dull, lifeless, boring person and you have to wonder what does this amazing man see in her? This is not true in her good books. I'd say stay away from her contemporary books and read all the others. Like night and day."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"TO DIE FOR by Melanie George, A perfect \\"10\\"... This is a suspense/romance book that takes place in ..., Manhattan, New York (how cool!). It is about a set of twins (Mickey & Abby) that trades places and the good twin, Abby, will try to take her place in running a magazine empire along side the yummy hero, Stefan. Stefan hates Mickey & therefore fights his attraction to Abby (not knowing they had traded places) but in the end loses, on top of that he has to protect the woman he loves from a crazed stalker. The author has admittedly said that this book is written dark and not in her normal light hearted style. As many authors often say, the characters had called to her to write it this way and so it must be. I think the author did an awesome job, I'm going to look for all her backlist stuff.Let me WARN you first, this book deals with the subject of rape and there is a near rape scene. However, it is also a story of survival, healing, sacrifice, hope and love. The story flowed beautifully, the sex was sizzling and tender and the emotions ran high. Get some Kleenex for the ending, cause it will tug at your heart strings, ...I highly recommend this book, it is a definite KEEPER!"},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"I just finished TO DIE FOR and LOVED it. It's a contemporary, with a virginal heroine who is afraid of men do to an attempted rape in college. The hero Stefan is a total Italian alpha male hunk who mistakes innocent Abby for her not so innocent sister Micky. The sex scenes are sizzling, and I balled my eves out towards the end. It's a bit grittier than most novels, the language is more crued, but I think that made the book more realistic. She didn't tiptoe around anything. You won't be able to put this book down!"},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"Conservative & simple heroine gets involved in magazine business she inherited from her now-deceased & estranged father who her sophisticated & ruthless twin sister lived with. She surprises the magazine employees with her more-helpful personality since she doesn't dispel their mistaken notion that she's her troublemaking twin sister. She is especially confusing to publisher Hero who she's carried a torch for since she was young. Although he's had no problems resisting her twin sister's repeated sexual advances, he is unexplicably attracted to heroine and cares for her welfare esp with her trouble with a stalker.My 1st George book & I could NOT put it down! It captured my emotions with its gripping romance & action-suspense. Romance was not undermined by the action-suspense stuff. The book was tightly-woven & fast-paced. Sensuality was hot yet captured the sensitive emotional-sexual issues of Hero & heroine. Good character development.Undoubtedly recommended."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"This is my first book from this author. I didn't think I would like it because of the overused plot of mistaken identity twin swapping device.I only vaguely understood why Abby chose to pretend to be her party girl twin, but there was no real reason for her to impersonate Micky, her twin, since she technically was the owner of the magazine and had promised that she would work there 6 months.I did enjoy the romance between Stephan and Abby, and the mystery of Abby's stalker in the beginning. However, about the last third of the book changed in tone and direction and not in a real good way. Abby's whole purpose in going to NY in the first place was supposedly to break free from her old life before her illness progressed too much. But much of the time, Abby is still locked in her mental hang-ups of fear of men and the stalker. From beginning to end she doesn't really grow a backbone and reach out for what she wants or stand up to what she believes in. She's a helpless victim and is resigned to being a martyr.Like I wrote above, I liked the book until the last third. Abby got a little irritating at that point. After Abby walks in on a murder, she stays holed up in Stephan's spare bedroom aboard his yacht for 2 weeks in a self pity party. Why all of a sudden she wakes up and decides to give up her virginity, and why Stefan loves her is kind of a mystery since she's so emotionally distant from him. And her martyr act of refusing to be w/ Stefan during and after her surgery kind of grated on my nerves as well. Her reasoning just didn't make sense in that she didn't want to be w/ him because she couldn't have children. I don't know why she didn't ever consider the option of adoption or surrogacy.The heroine's downhill personality at the end book dropped the book's rating for me to 3 stars. Despite the heroine's personality, I did like the writing, so I'll be keeping an eye on Melanie George's other books."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"It was a good story line, but the leding lady was just weak. She just couldn't make up her mind, yes she was sick but why did she not want him there for her. I just disliked her alot. I was happy to put the book down."},{"Title":"To Die For","review":"This was a decent book, not the best i have read but not the worst. There was just enough suspence and romance to keep you turning the pages. Loved the tearjerking ending.

I would say that 75-85% of my textbook was included in this book. What was included in the book was extremely helpful as a last minute test review which reflected on my test scores."},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Precalculus","review":"The author of this book truly understands what layman's terms means because it breaks down all the unnecessary nonsense the writer of my precal textbook put in it to try to seem more intelligent than they actually are."},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Precalculus","review":"I bought this to familiarize myself with Calculus in preparation for my Masters Degree. It did help but as a math novice I didn't get as much out of it as I could have if I had more training.If you have had pre-calculus and are looking to review, this would be a good choice."},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Precalculus","review":"This book is good because I'm not exceptional at math and I've always had trouble the more I foray into math.Calculus has always been a monstrosity in my opinion and this book helps ease my learning of it because it gives a steady pace with which to learn and helps reinforce some things one may have forgotten in years of negligence."},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Precalculus","review":"As long as you have the motivation to study, I think this book will be very helpful to you. It's perfect for the student who can't understand their teacher's explanations and need to use another source to learn. It can also be good for independent study, as that was my reason for using it.The book begins with math concepts one should know before beginning pre-calculus, and each chapter builds up information to make the student ready for the subsequent chapter. If you're studying the subject on your own, then you'll have to go in order of the chapters. But if you're taking a real class on pre-calculus already, and you just want to review a certain topic, it's easy to find what you're looking for either through the table of contents or the detailed index. After you've completed this book, and understood all its contents, you'd be ready for tackling calculus.The book is great because the lessons are pretty straightforward. After the topic has been explained well enough, there are one or two practice problems the student can do to see if they understand. It's a shame that this book doesn't contain more practice problems, but I suppose it's okay as long as you have another textbook with problems you can try out. Overall, I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"CliffsQuickReview Precalculus","review":"Length:: 0:36 Mins21 September 2012Stefan Domokos, Buzau, RomaniaThis book and the book from reference [2] was and is helping me to make calculus necessary in physics [3]Understanding Physics. This book is containing the properties of arithmetic operations, of the exponential numbers and of the trigonometric functions. The methodes to make these arithmetic operation are not contained here and is considered that you can study these operation from other books. One of these is the reference [2] where I find the methode of making the addition, the multiplication of the numbers made from the number 1 followed by zeros and the subtraction. First I studied the numbers from the reference [2], where I find the signs used by the people from Mesopotania and Sumer who discovered the numbers at least 5,000 years ago and introduced signs for the numbers from 1, 10 and 60 and used two signs corresponding to the number 1 to write the number 2, and from this book. Also I find in the refernce [2] that the addition was made with abacus at least 2,000 years ago. Then I studied the arithmetic operations from the reference [2] and from this book. In this book I find that the division with the same number of all the terms of one equality is giving an equality. Also in this book I seen that the cross product of the terms of an equality of ratios is giving also an equality. Because the multiplication of the both sides of the equality with the same number is giving an equality as we can see in this book is resulting from the cross product of one equality of rations that the inverse operation of division of the left term of one equality by the right term of the equality is giving also an equality with 1. Is resulting that the nominator and the denominator of a ratio can be divided by the same number and the ratio is equal with the same number. We will use this property in this review later. Also I find in this book the method of solving the first degree equation by addition, subtraction of the same number from the both left and right sides of one equality of division of the both sides by the same number. We suppose that solving the firs degree equation appeared long time ago when the mother of two children find two apples at one child but shee was giving only one. So the problem was to find how many apples received the child. We suppose that the apples were receive from one brother or from his father. Also when two mans were fruit picking they know how many fruits or vesels with fruits have each. When one of them seen more vesels of fruits at the other, who was alone or with other man for fruit picking, he put the problem how many plus vesels of fruits was bringing the other man when he was alone. Also at hunting when they were togeter they hunted a number of animals which they divided in two or other parts. Then when the other nam was alone he was bringing a plus number of hunted animals. When the first seen this he put the question how many animals were added to the initial number. Even these problems were not written always the equation in the modern algebra is using the unknown quatity x and is written asx+a=bwhere a is the inital number of fruits and b the final number of fruits. This is a beautiful problem where is solved the first degree equation.Whith the phenomenons and laws of physics studied from the referenece [3] I understand that the magnetic flux inside one turn of the secondary is equal with the magnetic flux inside one turn of the primary because they have the same iron core [3]. So the variation of the magnetic flux inside one turn of the secondary is equal with the variation of the magnetic flux inside one turn of the primary [3]. The law of Faraday is giving the value of the emf produced by the electromagnetic induction which is equal with the rate of change of the magnetic flux and the equation of the induced emf produced is in which the emf is equal with the derivative [3,4] of the magnetic fulx is [3,4]E=|d/dt|The magnetic flux through one circuit is proportional with the the curret I and is given by the equation [3]=(constant)IIs resulting that when the current I is increasing in the primary then the magnetic flux is increasing in the primary and the magnetic flux is increasing in the secondary and is produced the emf by the electromagnetic induction [3].I made a transformer with iron nail core from SC DUCTIL SA Buzau and metalic wire [3,5] 3X15 m made in China to demonstrate the law of electromagnetic induction of Faraday [3]. For the measuremet of the potential difference, the emf, we used the digital multimeter DT 830 B and of the electric current we used the digital multimeter 838 [3]. This experiment is presented in the attached video in which can be seen the maximum of the emf of 1.3 mV produced by electromagnetic induction in the secondary of the transformer when to the primary is connected one battery of approximately 3 V. This emf is produced by the increase of the magnetic flux in the iron core of the secondary from zero to the maximum value when the battery is connected or the decrease of the magnetic flux from the maximum value to zero when the battery is no more connected.The magnetic flux density in the core of one coil is proportional with the number of turns per unit length noted by n and with the current I and is given by [3]B=nuIwhere u is the magnetic permeability of the core of the coil [3].The magnetic flux in one turm is [3]=SBwhere S is the area of the surface of the turn [3].If the number of turns per unit lenght is greater as in the present experiment compared with the experiment from the review of the reference [3] then the produced emf is greater. This can be seen in these two videos.The current in a circuit which has the resistance R to which is connected the battery with the electromotive force Eb which has the internal resistance r is [3]I=Eb/(R+r)When we connect one batteries in series the current is [3]I=Eb/(R+r)and when we connect 2 batteries in series the current is [3]I=2Eb/(R+2r)In the two experiments presented in this review we can see that the measurements are giving a bigger current when the battery connected to the circuit has 3 V from 2 TOSHIBA cells of 1.5 V connected in series then the current when we connected a battery of 1.5 V from one TOSHIBA cells of 1.5 V and are verified the above presented 3 equations. Because we suppose that the variation of the magnetic flux in the core is made in the same time interval when we connected the battery of 3 V and the battery of 1.5 V thenE/E'=|m/t|/|'m/t|=(constant)I/(constant)I'=I/I'The conclusion is that the emf produced by electromagnetic induction is bigger when the emf of the connected battery is bigger.The phenomenons about the electric charges are presented in the reference [3,6].The music from the two videos is the proof of the date and time when were made the experiments when this music was emitted at one Romanian Radio station.The systems of equations of the second order were analyzed by Fibonaci before 1230 [7].Is resulting that the system of two or more variable linear equations were analyzed before this date [7].The system of two-variable linear equations is [1]Ax+By=CDx+Ey=FSolving this system of equations can be made using the following method [1]The first equation is multiplyed by D and the secong by -A [1].Then the two equations are added [1].The x variable is eliminated [1].Is computed the y variable [1].The the value of the y variable is replaced in one of the two equations [1].Then is computed the x variable [1].In the theories of physics presented in the reference [3] almost every time is used this system of two-variable linear equations and the solving of this system of equation.This methode is usefull for the study of the physics in the primary school and the secondary school.References[1] W.

He writes: \\"This book seeks to define the problem, sketch a biblical framework, outline a comprehensive holistic vision and then develop ....................\\" (p. 23) Accordingly, I will structure my critique and reflection of his book in reference to this phrase.Definition of the Problem: Who the poor are is well described by Sider, including age groups, family-types, education-level of poor and the relation between poverty and race. He sketches well the major factors that cause poverty. I fully agree with him, that structural reasons, as well as behavioral ones, as well as sudden catastrophes all contribute to widespread poverty. Even though structural reasons play a major influence in facilitating wrong moral choices, the latter should yet be ascertained as a cause for poverty. All negation of this point of view tends to take away responsibility from poor people and thus disqualifies them as whole persons. I also appreciated Sider's good assessment that it is basically the wealthy who contribute to political campaigns, which as a result brings people into positions who represent the interests of those few wealthy, rather than the masses'.Biblical Framework: I fully agree with Sider's analysis and presentation of the biblical material and believe it is compelling in its call to do justice. Love without justice is simply unbiblical, because the Bible is clear that those who follow God are called to live justly and love mercy.Comprehensive holistic vision: Sider is consistent with the biblical material and with sociology when he brings the role of civic society into the discussion. It confirms the \\"biblical anthropology\\" that humans are not mere autonomous individuals, but are interrelated beings. In the same way it acknowledges a holistic view of people, who are neither solely directed by bureaucratic decisions, nor by individual moral choices. Hence, civic society plays a detrimental role in solving the pressing problems, because it is in civic society that people learn the values that make this very society function in a healthy way. Inner moral and spiritual renewal cannot be mandated but is nevertheless crucial if family renewal, for instance, is to come about. Sider displays a balanced view with regards to the role of government and civic institutions and their interaction as well as contribution to each other, which I deem to be the only way in which long-term solutions can be reached. However, Sider presents too few concrete examples of realistic ways, in which civic societies (like inner city churches) can be strengthened, who in turn would raise local leadership and thus strengthen the political power of the poor from within.Social Analysis: His explanation for the low work-effort of poor people, for instance, as well as his interpretation of how the inability of low-skilled men to earn enough to support a family, feeds into the disintegration of the family as an institution, are convincing. Moreover, he makes clear how family unfriendly government policy (tax-exemptions, etc...) encourages single-parent families. Sider's analysis with respect to the educational system is also compelling. He argues that a good educational system is absolutely necessary in the fight against poverty. In fact, high school dropouts produce high costs in the long run, which, in any case are carried by the taxpayer. Additionally he builds a strong case for the necessity of healthy two-parent families. Most of his bias toward this form of family-life derives, as he says, from Judeo-Christian roots, as well as the statistics who demonstrate, that children from two-parent families are less likely to experience poverty.Concrete Agenda: In most of the chapters 4-8 Sider develops quite concrete and seemingly good proposals, which could help alleviate poverty. Even though I won't go into details at this point, this is the bulk of the book that needs to be discussed in student circles, among policymakers, in civic societies etc... Yet, throughout Sider's social analysis and enlisting of concrete ideas for implementation, one great question remains: How can partnerships between governmental and faith based programs be established? How could more clergy-government coalitions come to life? How are inner city churches helped to seek the holistic wellbeing of their neighbors, if they themselves lack personnel resources and struggle hard to survive? Sider offers little concrete steps in this respect. He gives some examples, but these seem to be the exception.Sider makes clear that the political as well as the theological climate has changed, which makes it more favorable for Christians today to getting involved to fighting poverty. And this they must, if they call themselves followers of Jesus Christ. Overall I believe the book has the potential to reach a great number of people, because it presents, deals well with and offers, to some degree at least, practicable solutions to a highly problematic theme of our time. Will it accomplish what Sider has in mind, namely reaching millions of Christians, who in response, will get practically involved in addressing the issues at hand? We hope. We pray."},{"Title":"Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America","review":"I agree with the review by Jean-Luc for the most part, but I also wanted to add a few of my own thoughts.As Sider says early in the book, he's not a policy wonk, so that is his weakest point. Trust him on that one. As a more policy oriented person, I agree that some of those things would be great, if implemented, but that's the hard part of all policy - getting it passed and implemented. Some of his suggestions are not politically feasible (yet).Some of his other policy ideas are, IMHO, just questionable. Not just politically difficult, but I'm not convinced that all the ideas are that great.His Biblical framework is wonderful. I enjoyed reading his perspective on that, as he exegetes quite well. I also was biased to begin with, in that I had already done some thinking on my own about this issue, and was finding myself just saying &quot;Wow, that's kinda what I was thinking.&quot;yeah. so good book. read it. don't take the policy stuff to seriously. but take the Biblical stuff seriously. He does a good job there. and the principles of the more holistic view of things, too. Those are good."},{"Title":"Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America","review":"The debate over how best to help the poor seems to be polarized around the logical conclusions of two seemingly opposed assumptions. The conservative assumption is that most people are poor because of the personal choices they make. The liberal assumption is that people are poor because of bad environments and injustice.The conservative point of view leads to public policies that reward personal initiative while allowing families to suffer the consequences of their bad decisions as a means of discipline.The liberal point of view initiates policies that redistribute the wealth through entitlements and public projects while attempting to change the environment through the force of law.The weakness of the liberal position is that it tends to enable poverty rather than eradicate it. The weakness of the conservative position is that it tends to ignore injustices and do nothing to remove the very real barriers to the upward mobility of the poor.Ronald Sider in his book Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America argues that these are not competing assumptions but complimentary ones. \\"I have lived and worshiped with he poor far too long to side either with the liberal who quickly dismisses the way personal choices contribute to poverty or with the conservative who ignores the way complicated structural barriers make it difficult for many hardworking people to escape poverty\\" (p. 35).Sider's \\"Twelve Principles of a Just Society\\" is the foundation for his policy suggestions that make up over half of the book. While one may quibble with the details of the suggestions, on the whole they are a way out of the political rancor that characterizes the current debate.I highly recommend this book to all. It educates. It makes reasonable suggestions to open the discussion on how best to address these problems. Most of all it is irenic and offered in the spirit of brotherly love as opposed to the power politics that have come to characterize our political discourse."},{"Title":"Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America","review":"Ron Sider for years has been in tune with the outcries of the impoverished in the world. He has been using his gifts from God to write great books like these which brings to light the issues of poverty to believers and non believers. The idea of social justice is the dominant theme in this book, social justice being that every person is given the tools to succeed in our society.Sider see's education as the biggest area to focus on when fixing the problems with social justice. He lays out the statistics that show impoverished students are more likely to drop out before graduating high school, the lack of general success in higher education and the effects of these depressing statistics. Lower education, maybe even more so today with the lack of unskilled jobs, is a life-sentence to a difficult life.To go along with the challenge to improve our education system, Sider heralds the benefits of Inter-Faith agencies (non government agencies that receive support from the government). These groups enjoy the benefits of being run like small time companies with a defined goal, the people who are on the same page and a heart for the people they are serving. The government doesn't run nearly as smoothly. By using these agencies, Sider believes that the greatest good can be done to put a dent into the levels of impoverished in America.Overall, this book is baby steps in the right direction to fixing poverty. It is such a big undertaking that it will not happen over night, but Sider really does a great job of putting us on the right path to tackle such a big problem. By reading this book you will be more in tune with your brothers and sisters in economic despair."},{"Title":"Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America","review":"In 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the United States was $19,806. 37 million people in the US live at or below this level. Ron Sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth. In Just Generosity, Sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in America. And it is a compelling vision.Sider's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals. Both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty.Drawing upon biblical study, Sider presents the goal of an economy of justice: \\"Every person or family has access to productive resources (land, money, knowledge) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community\\" (81). Sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare, minimum wage, tax credits, health care, and education reform, showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work, empower the poor, and strengthen families.Sider ends with this troubling question: Do enough Christians really care? This book should be required reading for any that do."},{"Title":"Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America","review":"Ronald J. Sider's, Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America, is a book about solutions. The solutions to overcoming poverty that Sider offers are both broad-ranging as well as full of depth. They are not band-aid solutions that only deal with surface-level symptoms. Instead, Sider targets understanding and overcoming the causes of poverty in America.The breadth of his approach to overcoming poverty is seen in the number and variety of organizations he suggests mobilizing together for the sake of the poor. Sider envisions faith-based organizations doing all that they do best in the battle against poverty. Likewise, businesses will bring what they have to offer; the media will do its part; while the government (though not expected to carry the full weight of the problems or the solutions) will also be expected to work towards empowering the poor of the society. Together, these forces comprise a \\"holistic, comprehensive approach\\" (137) to overcoming poverty.The depth of his approach can be seen in the various levels of positive-change that he suggests these organizations work together to offer. Sider enlists the creative energies and resources of these varied organizations for the purposes of not only removing barriers that keep members of society from making a reasonable living, but also for such purposes as \\"character formation, spiritual renewal, and caring communities\\" (185). It is at this point that I find Sider's work most compelling. He, in other words, cares equally about providing for the very real and pressing needs of individuals and communities (hunger, safe housing and streets, etc.) as well as longer-range needs (such as quality education for all: education that includes the character as well as the mind - that is, spiritual development as well as mental development) that, as they are met with equal excellence, will work steadily to eradicate poverty in the coming days and generations.Sider's books are thorough. Just Generosity is no exception. At times, in fact, it is easy to get lost in the details. Yet the details concerning poverty are what many of us are lacking. We know there is a problem. We even recognize that the problem is multi-faceted. Yet without the aid of someone like Sider who brings together \\"sophisticated socioeconomic analysis with normative biblical principles of justice\\" (14), we are left with our limited awareness of the issues (mixed, possibly, with a measure of guilt and a heap of good intentions) that often lead to us do very little to actually work towards effecting solutions to the problem of poverty in our own neighborhoods - much less all over America."},{"Title":"Just Generosity: A New Vision for Overcoming Poverty in America","review":"Just GenerosityRon SiderRon Sider is a writer committed to several agendas. He is a strong advocate for the word of God, an unconditional submission to Jesus Christ, and a deep desire to see poverty in America eliminated. Sider begins chapter four with a question that seems to drive his passion for the subject this book addresses. \\"If a person works fulltime all year, can that person earn enough so that his or her family can escape poverty? For millions of Americans today, the answer is no.\\"The closing chapter offers the hope for America's poor. Sider says we can end the scandal. He offers what he call a Generous Christian Pledge. He proposes that all believers adhere to the pledge. He says, Generous Christians and other people of good will can transform our country. We can end the scandal of widespread poverty in the richest nation in history."},{"Title":"Children of the Night","review":"Most of the stories in this book are very boring. Even what'smeant to be interesting such as the story about a lesbian vampirebrothel-owner (i kid you not!)is so overdone that it's positively farcical. I don't have the book to hand at the moment but I remember another story that tried a stream-of-consciousness approach that failed miserably. I felt like I was wading through the stories. Of course there are some good stories from a book boasting contributions from Baldwin and Morrison, but the vast majority are nothing special. Credit must go to the editors who arranged the stories in pertinent sections. Pity they didn't have better material to work with."},{"Title":"Thunder in the Wind (Signet)","review":"This is book number 5 out of 8 in an amazing series by author, June Lund Shiplett. This saga (starting with book 1) follows one woman and her descendants. This particular book interweaves two stories -- the forbidden romance of cousins Cole and Heather, and the love triangle of Lizette and Bain and (Bains' brother) Stuart. Shiplett makes these characters so real -- they have flaws, bad hair days, gain weight and make mistakes. Not your average blonde haired, blue eyed wimpy heroine who gets saves by the big handsome, over-bulked stupid guy. These women think for themselves and can take care of themselves, thank you very much.I'm really not a big reader of romances in general, but I love this series of books. I think I pull them out about once a year and reread them all the way through. It's truly amazing how Shiplett manages to weave history, family, action and romance thru this series.This is a can't miss series and you will only wish that Ms. Shiplett had written more."},{"Title":"Business Process Redesign in Travel Management in an SAP R/3 Upgrade Project","review":"Total garbage.

I found Judith Wright's message about soft addictions to be simple and easy to understand, and at the same time very deep and meaningful. Unlike most other \\"self help\\" books, she actually tells you how to help yourself and change your life in ways anybody can do. She doesn't just talk about how to have a life with more love and meaning, she shows you how. You also get the sense that this is a woman who walks her talk. She gives personal examples about herself and many others who have made impressive changes in their lives. By giving this book to people and talking about its message, it helps me do exactly what Judith talks about. It gives me a way to get into deeper, more meaningful conversations and make an everyday meeting more satisfying and fulfilling.

I started out very resistant to the thought of what I had to &quot;give up&quot;, but it quickly shifted to what I wanted. I am getting about another hour of work done per day, another hour with my family and another hour of sleep on average. By being more honest about the things that I use to distract me I can now consciously choose: 'do I want to distract myself or be with my wife?' Sometimes I choose the crossword puzzle, however I now can start asking myself 'what am I avoiding' and that question makes it so much more availble. Sometimes the 'it' is a hug, sometimes I just need to talk, sometimes I want to babble. That part becomes easy once I can name it. In the end my wife are having more intimacy and play. In addition, my days are more exciting, I expect to have more satisfaction. I bounce out of bed usually before the alarm looking forward to my to-do list(never thought that was even possible). Lastly, I have a different sense of spirit. I do not know how to relate except to say that I notice more things are organicly beautiful. I don't know exactly where another 2-3 hours came from, but I seem to be quicker, more generative, on tasks faster and in general more present to myself during the day.

You'll get much more from reading books like Addictive Thinking and the Addictive Personality by Craig Nakken, et al or Healing Your Self Esteen: Recovery from Addictive Thinking by Bryan E.

These time filling disillusioned ruts like watching TV or surfing the Internet typically leave a person unfulfilled. Ms. Wright offers a program to eliminate or at least reduce the \\"soft addictions\\" in order to gain a more harmonic lifestyle shared with loved ones. The author espouses live everyday with the expressed purpose of achieving your goals and stepping closer to attaining one's vision rather than hide within the socially acceptable rut.This self-help book is well written and easy to follow once the reader understands the underlying hypothesis fostered by Ms. Wright, who makes a strong anecdotal case defending her belief. The difficult part remains disciplining one's self because these \\"soft addictions\\" are so hypnotic even when one is left feeling empty afterward, but Ms. Wright offers small steps as a plan to achieve a more satiated life shared with loved ones.

This book re-connected with the truth - that I want more in life and that I want my life to matter. With compassion, humor and grace, Judith helped me unveil the soft addictions that I choose to take me away from my purpose. Her book helps me acknowledge the potency of awareness and choice. Will I stop eating sugar forever? Not the point. Rather the question I can ask is will I add more things that fulfill my soul and propel me towards living the life that I want? Regardless of which choice I make, by asking the question I am more likely to use awareness rather than mindless routine to guide my life.

Some of the examples Judith uses will apply to every reader - internet surfing, shopping, eating, overworking, gossiping, etc. I was also struck by the idea of mood addictions, the way people may use excitement or depression or other attitudes to keep from feeling their feelings.

As an author and director of The School of Spiritual Psychology, I know the rigors of making genuine change in one's life. Judith leads us to making the major decision needed to take this leap.

Ms Wright's approach is practical andworkable. I realized quickly what situations triggeredmy soft addictions, like checking my email every minute orso. The book provided techniques for being aware of whatsituations trigger the zone out mode that characterizessoft addictions. Instead of drifting unconsciously intofiddling around on email, checking discussion boards orbids on ebay, I can step back and ask myself \\"What are youavoiding by doing this?\\" The technique has definitely cutmy time wasting.Lisa N"},{"Title":"There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions","review":"If you feel adrift and dissatisfied in life, Judith Wright's \\"There Must Be More than This\\" may be just what you need. Ms. Wright is co-founder of the Wright Institute for Lifelong Learning where people learn to fulfill their potential in all areas of their lives -- work, relationships, self and spirit. She offers you new ways of thinking about life and new ways to behave. These could make a world of a difference. The core of this approach is that you are thoroughly coached on how to make \\"the One Decision.\\" The process is one of soul-searching and commitment in which you discover what you really hunger for in life and begin reorienting your thinking, feeling and behaviour. The One Decision becomes your rudder in the stormy seas of life. By giving you a firm \\"heading\\" your commitment becomes the foundation for a new, conscious, purposeful life. Once you make your One Decision, then you can begin studying your life and eliminating your \\"soft addictions.\\" Soft addictions, simply, are patterns of feeling, thinking or behaving that keep you from experiencing what you really hunger for in life. Examples are excessive TV watching, Internet, video games, compulsive reading, over-exercising and indulging in moods that distract you from the beauty of life that lies around us. None of these is necessarily a \\"soft addiction.\\" The test is what effect they have on your search for what you hunger for in life. By helping you to find a purpose for your life and to redefine thinking that does not work for you, this book can help you to make a breakthrough by building a new, more complete life. Its usefulness is enhanced because it contains the stories of many people who have successfully used this approach to build a far richer life. Just by reading these stories carefully, you can begin to understand the power of this method and can gain increased commitment to fulfilling your One Decision. There seems to me to be follow-up work that you may also do after reading this book. Ms. Wright hints at it, but has not yet helped you to go deeper. Several times, Ms. Wright hints that her clients have decided to meditate. That is, of course, a time-honoured way to find purpose in life by accepting sheer being, without any need to \\"do\\" anything. In my life, meditation provided a direct experience of what can only weakly be described as the God within. Meditation led me to experiences that go beyond words. It also produced visions and insights that sprung from the depths of my being and have provided an anchor that does not require that I create a verbal definition. I hope Ms. Wright will fill this gap by producing a follow-up book on self-discovery through meditation."},{"Title":"There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions","review":"There are some interesting ideas presented here. However it isn't a book for everyone: it is written from a devout Christian point of view.If the authors were more clear about that on the cover and in the description, then that would be fine. But there weren't any clues until I started reading the text.Here's an example from page 139: \\"We are meant to be addicted to God, but we develop secondary addictions that temporarily appear to fix our problem.\\"Search for \\"God\\" and you get 26 hits. Again, I just think the cover should have been more transparent about that because it is a core frame for the book. This isn't \\"a book written by someone who happens to be Christian,\\" it's more like a Christian book.As an alternative, I'd suggest an awareness practice; there are several out there. They tend to be based on the same core material, and can work hand-in-hand with any set of spiritual beliefs."},{"Title":"There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions","review":"Who'd have thought I could be &quot;addicted&quot; to my gloomy moods? This book helped me understand something I always knew but couldn't articulate: I want more out of life, and don't know how to get it. Or at least I didn't know how before I read the book. With everyone around me seeming to be chronically cynical or lazy or despairing about how anything could be different, who was I to be wanting more? Judith Wright's book identifies that yearning as a &quot;spiritual hunger&quot; and explains it in a way that helps me feed that hunger and feel more fulfilled. I have practicied the &quot;seemingly harmless habits&quot; of soft addictions like daydreaming through stacks of catalogs or eating to feel better or going over and over in my head about what I should have done. And now I see those habits for what they are: distractions from feelings. Through anecdotes and exercises, this book will shift your thinking, and put you on a path toward making bettter choices about how you spend your time. It will help you stop wasting time on things that are unfulfilling, and start living a life filled with what really matters."},{"Title":"There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions","review":"I have read my share of self-help books.

Certainly, the concepts (and realities) of \\"soft addictions\\" and \\"stinking thinking\\" may at first seem to be both too obvious and too overwhelming to even begin to consider conquering them. But, I found Wright's approach to offer an amazingly simple process for me to stay conscious, aware, and responsible of my choices and the effect that they have on my world and how I experience it. While the section on the costs of remaining unconscious to our soft addictions was maybe the most eye-opening and valuable, my favorite chapter was \\"Fulfilling Your Spiritual Hungers.\\" Simple and profound at the same time, it left me sold on Judith Wright's message and wondering what life would have been like if my \`true' hungers had been what counted all along; and then, the thought \\"what if they counted now?\\" Now that I have finished reading this book, it's seems crazy to want life to be any other way."},{"Title":"There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions","review":"This book makes such big changes seem natural and easy.

And it is the human condition - not just hard drugs or alcohol are addictions.

This book talks about \\"soft addictions,\\" the idea of which at first seemed a little fuzzy to me until I learned what they are and started seeing how prevalent they are in both my workplace and my own life. Eating junk food, drinking 10 cans of diet soda, working late just because it's easier to stay than to leave, and totally zoning out on the internet. These things waste time - which I think most people would agree with - but they also keep people from dealing with their feelings - like eating something out of the vending machine instead of dealing with a problem. As a manager I am seeing more of that kind of pattern at work after reading this book. Especially the concept that people can be addicted to moods, like being angry or grumpy all the time - this describes some people at work to a tee and I really didn't have an angle to explain this until now (and it also makes me way more tuned in to when I'm being grumpy for no good reason or avoiding dealing with what made me grumpy to begin with). So as a manager I think this book is valuable for learning more about myself and also more about patterns at the workplace. And as an engineer I was surprised that the book has some pretty bottom-line information, techniques, and exercises in it (not just the \\"touchy feely\\" stuff I expected) about how to replace time-wasting things with better activities. One definite thing I learned from this book is that after I do something like procrastinate or eat too much, if I feel down and kind of empty afterwards, it probably means I was doing a soft addiction."},{"Title":"There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions","review":"Wow!

None of these things appeared to be too big to handle, but they were never resolved, and they persisted in my life and take up energy. As I unraveled the web, I'm finding more love for myself and time for the things I really love, like my favorite hobbies and recreation. I even cancelled my cable TV and find that I get enough news to keep current, but I read more, write more, listen to more music, and feel more rested when it's bedtime. The more I noticed these soft addictions, the more I felt the power to change for the positive, and I am on my way. Oh, did I mention Starbucks? A few years ago, I tracked my coffee expenses and discovered I spent $1200 per year on coffee drinks! Time, money, emotional waste, all the cost of soft addictions.

She has chosen the subject of what she calls \\"soft addictions\\" as a way to illustrate how we all long for something more in our daily lives, and how that longing is a beautiful part of what makes us human and what makes us desire meaningful contact, intimacy and playful interaction. I found Wright's style to be refreshing and personal, her stories compelling and the way she weaves in her deeper message captivating."},{"Title":"There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions","review":"When I picked this book up at the library, I was reminded of the Peggy Lee song, 'Is That All There Is to Love?' I enjoyed the quotes interspersed by Mark Twain, Margaret Mead, Albert Schweitzer, Clarence Darrow and especially liked \\"The proper function of a man is to live, not to (merely) exist\\" by Jack London.Soft addictions are described as unhealthy habits, unlike hard addictions (certain foods, alcohol, medications, cigarettes, bad thoughts, game playing), but they serve to drain our energies and sense of fulfillment. We use them as time wasters to provide a sense of activity to feel that we are achieving something -- but actually we are using these traps to avoid real problems. What we are doing appear \\"normal\\" (shopping, t.v. for company, computer games) but we are left with a feeling of emptiness and being unsatisfied.The author, Judith Wright, confessed: \\"Only after I faced the unhappiness of my first marriage did I start on the path of personal growth.\\" A man you trusted and loved in the beginning can inflict real damage to your whole being with his criticism and harshness. A man does not have to act tough to be a man (nor does he have to wear cowboy boots), but he shouldn't talk like a woman, either. It seems we have a need for elocution teachers again to show a young adult male how to lower his voice and not just act like a man but sound like one as well.Being the mother of three sons, growing up with a brother three years older than I with only a father at home, I can honestly say I've been around men most of my life, and accepted each as an individual. Guess I was lucky that none were effeminent in any way. Returning to East Tennessee to 'retire' the first thing which bothered me was the way the men here talk in the higher register, and I commented that their wives had deeper voices than they. I don't (never did) sound like a man, but I have a definite Southern drawl unlike the Knoxville harshness -- which I developed while I was away. We talk like the people around us, everybody knows that. I look Knoxville (short, dark eyes, a natural wave in my natural hair, a fighting spirit for doing \\"what's right\\"), but I don't sound Knoxville, and the twain shall never meet.Ms Wright lists various activities she says when overdone become soft addictions such as media, buying/shopping, sexual, risk taking, card games, crossword puzzles when done alone. Moods, self-pity, chameleon-like behavior, sarcasm, crankiness, evading and escaping social interrraction, oversleeping, isolation AND things (edible & consumable) like fast foods, coffee, snack foods, cigarettes, and brand-name merchandise: all can turn into addictions.This book is interesting in the fact of learning these facts.

Our heroine quickly discovers that it is much more satisfying to help her suffering family (they lost their money, parents are in poor health, younger siblings need her to caretake) than to pursue the elevated social life into which she has been invited, thanks to a wealthy college friend. Enter our struggling hero, who as good as becomes one of the family. The hero and family members are appealing, and one wants to see them succeed. The heroine is beautiful, tired, and works all the time at home and the office--not much warmth or dimension. It's rather exhausting to read about her. A persistent, wealthy suiter, who provides some lightness in her life, leaves the heroine on the fence for awhile. One part of the plot is somewhat racy for GLH and the time in which it was written. Both main characters come to know God in the course of the story. So, this is a good family story, with romance, humor, suspense, spiritual content, and a plot twist. In the end, the moral is that by giving up selfish pursuits in place of duty, one in fact gains everything. It's also a love story that takes its time, with the hero and heroine getting to know each other as good friends long before there is any romance between them."},{"Title":"Happiness Hill","review":"This was my favorite book through my teen years. I know, it's outdated and a little corny, but when you consider it was written in the 30's, you have to give Grace Livingston Hill credit. I was exposed to modern Christian romance novels as a teen, but I always came back to this one as my favorite because it was so well written and I loved the plot. I give Grace Livingston Hill all the credit for my love of English and History, and she probably deserves some credit for my happy marriage as well - because she instilled (deep in my subconscious mind) the importance of family and friendship, and not just romance.

From its start in 1838 (with 24 miles of track) it grew to over 6,500 miles. Alas, in 1999 it passed into the hands of the Canadial National.This is a colorful history of the Illinois Central from its early day through its acquisition. It is profusely illustrated,with a lot of color pictures. The text that accompanies the pictures gives an accurate telling of the story of the line and its operation down through the years.The IC grew by acquiring other lines as well as by expanding its own tract into new areas. It remained, however a north-wouth line with its solid anchors in Chicago and New Orleans. It grew west to meet with the Union Pacific in Omaha. It grew to the south east, eventually connecting to Birmingham and eventually Miami.Only in the last couple of pages in the book is the Canadian National merger. It has become a major railroad, from the original IC trackage from Chicago to New Orleans and CN all across Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But alas, it's under the CN name, not the IC."},{"Title":"Illinois Central Railroad (MBI Railroad Color History)","review":"I bought the Kindle version of the book since the paper version was outrageously expensive.

Having grown up in Chicago and attending the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana in the 1960s I got to be quite familiar with the passenger trains that connected those two cities. I think on balance the author was fair in his attention to the various geographic regions that this line served. Were he have gone into a lot more depth this book could easily have been 4 to 10 times as long. But then it wouldn't have been the easy read that it was.

Amazon doubtless won't let me list the carriers but if you Google the title you'll find much cheaper copies with only mild (predictable and unavoidable) shelf wear.Second, ignore the cover. This is not a Mod or Pop novel of the sixties. Yes, it takes place in the sixties, but the author was born in the twenties, the protagonists are in their thirties, and much of the lingo and references are from the forties and fifties.But this is a drunken word-salad of a book, a post-Joycean self-indulgent frolic in that regard, not only in the Lothario's, Maynard's, goofy but plausibly seductive patter but in the narrator's wild divagations on society, capitalism, the boroughs of Manhattan and every other whimsy you can imagine. Many of the references are undeniably dated (e.g., Ma Bell, bookies) but so are other writers' of the forties and fifties who weren't stiltedly or self-consciously Literary. This novel doesn't take itself too seriously, all the more arguably written by a wordsmith of serious caliber who loves to mix polysyllables with ain'ts and other ethnic phraseology. Full of loosey-goosey fun and puns, even while you are drawn into the story of this particular seducer and his two lovers.The author was an important art dealer on the Manhattan scene known for his fast-talking persona. He was, nevertheless, very much a writer and the fact that he didn't persist is a puzzlement until you realize how insane was/is the New York publishing world. If John Kennedy Toole (comparable to Karp in some stylistic ways) had a gallery to fall back on, perhaps he wouldn't have ended it the way he did.

Everyone always focuses on the developmental side of education. This book examines the value of a child's social competance as well allowing a child to learn and grow to become the best adult he/she can be."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"There's a truism coined by someone in years past that you will best appreciate a novel when you are at approximately the same age that the author was when he wrote it. Now that I've begun my second half-century, I suppose I'm pretty close to the age Samuel Butler was when he began to write his masterpiece, which probably explains why I was better able to appreciate the supreme intelligence and common sense that fills this book from start to finish. (Although it does turns out that Butler continued to work on The Way of All Flesh for more than a decade and left it unpublished before he died, so it certainly contains the accumulated wisdom of an entire life, not just that of a middle-aged man knocking on the door of his golden years.)That said, I am quite certain I would never have been able to finish this book if I had tried to read it in my twenties or even my thirties. This is certainly not a fast-paced action novel, but rather the collected musings on human nature of an older man, organized loosely into the form of a faux biography for a rather foolish young protagonist named Ernest Pontifex, as told by his elderly godfather, Mr. Overton. Butler actually begins the tale several generations back to establish some background for Ernest's eventual appearance, and the plotline of the story moves along slowly and steadily, with numerous pauses as Overton/Butler ruminates on different aspects of human nature and human culture. Some of this, admittedly, goes on overly long, but those rough patches are more than made up for by some supremely well developed sequences in the lives of the primary characters, with intelligent, often witty analysis and reflection then provided by Mr. Overton.There is one passage that I personally consider one of the most brilliant sequences I have ever come across in literature. Young Ernest, fresh from college, unworldly and foolish and pure as the driven snow, newly ordained as a man of the cloth, has decided to take rooms in a boarding house inhabited by numerous working class people, including, literally, a pair of \\"working girls.\\" He decides to convert the working class free-thinker who lives on the first floor, unaware that this man, though relatively poor, is still literate and actually rather well-read. The sequence where the avowed atheist, who has long outgrown any fire in his belly to harangue others who disagree with his world view, but instead is happy to live and let live, gently and kindly disabuses the nearly clueless but well-meaning Ernest of the idea that people are so easily swayed, is one of the more remarkable passages I have ever read. The book is full of wonderful moments like this - where we learn almost everything we need to know about incidental characters in just a few short but deftly written paragraphs.In short, virtually every personality type and every moral and philosophical situation one will ever come across in life is tackled with humor and intelligence in this book. If you are looking for action and mayhem, this is not the book for you, and I'm sure there's plenty of Robert Ludlum type novels out there that would better hold your interest instead. But if your goal is to sit beside the fire with your wise old grandfather for a few evenings and really learn about life, this would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"i guess anybody who reads this book should personaly identify with the main character.I myself loved Ernest in his struggle to find himself and leave the path forced upon him by his parents,religon and comunity. the result is an enchanting some what funny novel that is hard to put down when read and even harder to forget when finished reading it."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"According to my edition (Penguin), a large part of the credit for this book is due to Eliza Savage, Butler's close friend and unofficial editor, who died before she could improve the conclusion. I think I can spot the moment where her influence ends.Up until then the book is great. The hero is Ernest Pontifex, but Butler begins *three* generations (along the male line) before Ernest, spending considerably more time on each succeeding generation. This works wonders. For one thing, it enables us to feel alternate loathing *and* sympathy for the book's ogre, Theodore Pontifex - often simultaneous loathing and sympathy. Every single generation shows a kind of promise which is nipped in the bud, in a different way each time. Also we get a good feeling that the story is the story of the nineteenth century as a whole.Once Ernest is born the author begins to slow down, dawdle, digress and meander, never in a boring way, until a several perfectly believable crisis points follow each other in rapid succession, after which ...... after which Eliza Savage dies, or something of the kind happens, and the book collapses. It's a pity. I was certain Butler was on to something great, but he doesn't really know how to end it all. We get the kind of unsatisfactory solution that H.G. Wells, at his laziest, would come up with. Ernest even begins to behave like one of Wells's supermen.There *had* been one flaw before the collapse. Butler would often make keen observations, and then use them to launch into philosophy. Although Butler was am intelligent man he had all the philosophical ability of a taxi driver, and a taxi driver's willingness to share his thoughts. We can easily forgive him as long as the narrative is still strong and he prefaces the philosophical twaddle with intelligent remarks; but not otherwise.There's also the feeling that Butler is reigning in his horses at the end, unwilling to get stuck into Christianity and the Anglican Church as they really deserve to be stuck into. We tend to forget how much power these institutions had, and how much they abused it. Once we are reminded, Butler's willingness to allow the abuse to continue is puzzling. (Butler's remarks on Christianity are not nearly as disturbing as his remarks on art. That the official doctrine about the resurrection of Christ is absurd, is old news, and was old even when Butler wrote. The claim that Beethoven and Shakespeare were pretentious humbugs is much more shocking.)A pity about the ending - the book could have been great. Read it all the same."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I really had to keep making sure that this book was actually written in the late nineteenth century because aspects of it reflected such a modern type of dissatisfaction with one's upbringing. In other words, I might anachronistically say that the author was snarky! But whenever I was confused about the time period the book was written in, I had to think that the peculiar brand of Victorian hypocrisy displayed by the narrator's parents was, indeed, well grounded in the time period, though updated versions of this certainly persist today. Seriously, this book is hilarious on so many levels, but it's also insightful, moving, and nearly a self-help book for anyone living today: how to survive an utterly dreadful upbringing and the kind of disillusionment inevitable in young adulthood with your sense of humor and self, along with your joy for living, intact. There's just no way to describe this book, how entertaining and perceptive about human nature it is; you have to read it to believe it."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I have been working my way through the classics on my commute and I picked up this audio book because of the good reviews and I have always enjoyed satire. It turns out that I was very pleased with both the content of the novel and the reader of the audio book.The audio book was narrated by Frederick Davidson, who has done many classic novels and always does a good job. He has a British accent that has the perfect tinge of sarcasm for a novel like this. He did an excellent job with having a different voice for each character and this helped me follow the novel and distinguish easily who was talking. The voice he used for the father was especially good and sounded like the uptight, unfeeling minister that he was.I feel that the novel deserves to be on the many lists of classics that it is on. It truly is a great satirical work of fiction and it effectively pokes at many of the institutions in Victorian England. I also liked how he pointed out many truths while he was poking fun. I found myself agreeing with many of the points he brought up and sometimes I noted flaws in his characters that I have myself.This novel taught me about human nature and interaction as a great novel should. I highly recommend this book and audio book."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I'll share all the book details momentarily but here's the core of the story first:Over the course of a century three generations of the Pontifex men transpired from solid and esteemed, to religiously fanatical and noxious, to nave and repressed. Their respective spouses pretty much mirrored the husbands in both their outlook and their temperament.The ultimate protagonist, (it takes a few chapters for him to clearly emerge as the human object of this compelling yarn), Ernest Pontifex, was the eldest son of an odious Church of England clergyman, Theobald Pontifex. Whatever amount of respect Ernest had fostered for his grandfather was notably exceeded in dimension by his contempt for his own sire. Theobald constrained even Ernest's most insignificant activities throughout the lad's youth and during his subsequent college years where this young unfortunate was compelled to study, (of course), theological subjects. Ernest's self-indulgent father also derived a perverse brand of joy from the Draconian disciplinarian acts that he perpetrated without cessation against his wretched son, ergo: \\"...spare the rod, spoil the child.\\"[But I must insert here that this is definitely not a gloomy Dickensian-type novel so don't quit reading quite yet!]Ernest's most remarkable teen experience occurred on the day when an attractive, young household domestic was hastily driven from the home when it was revealed that she was soon to become a mother and the father was yet unknown to any but herself and her paramour. Ernest felt so bad for the girl that he chased after her carriage and gave the poor lass his watch and what little money that he possessed. This altruistic act, perceived as outright rebelliousness by Theobald and his nasty shrew of a wife, was rewarded with even further tyranny and psychological domination.During his years away at a small but prestigious private school under the tutelage of one Dr. Skinner, an old profligate who ranked on a scale of malevolence only slightly less prominently than Theobald himself, Ernest's blameless nose was kept firmly applied to the collegiate grindstone although his marginal grades never reflected any marked fruits of such devoted toil. Only a singular figure within Ernest's extended family gave rise to hope towards any promise of future happiness: he had an aunt, (Theobald's sister), who in addition to being kind and motherly, was wealthy as well. She was also quite close to our narrator, Mr. Overton, a man of equal understanding and tolerance, tenoned with the highest of ethical standards.And so it goes... Ernest works his way through college, into the clergy, (where he was as inept as he was miserable), and thence down numerous of life's pathways, chiefly as a consequence of events. Think of Ernest Pontifex as a Victorian version of Holden Caulfield, (the youthful and puerile protagonist of J.D. Salinger'sThe Catcher in the Rye.)My copy of this remarkable novel is the Classics Club (Walter J. Black, New York) hardcover edition (no copyright date but pretty old), with a helpful Note by R.A. Streatfeild prefacing the work, the man who saw Samuel Butler's manuscript through to its initial publication (all with Butler's deathbed permission) in 1902. Butler actually completed the book in 1884 but Streatfeild had to re-write the fourth and fifth chapters following Butler's death from the original working notes as that small segment of manuscript had been lost. Streatfeild did a fine job with this brief but enigmatic task and I could detect no inconsistency whatever in this transitory text. There are eighty-six chapters in all, spread out over 389 pages.This fictional account is conveyed in First Person, (all from Overton's perspective), and the prose and dialogues flow as does warm honey. The story is bulging with a subtle brand of typically British wit, all nicely mingled with a notably robust account of period English culture, with a marked emphasis on (fictional) prominent figures associated with the Church of England. One unique caveat of Butler's writing style was his clever literary handling of the principals: the protagonist is not the narrator as we traditionally encounter in First Person novels.I'm pretty well read in this particular era of European fiction and Butler's work much parallel's many of the positive features which we encounter in Thomas Hardy'sThe Return of the Native (Modern Library Classics); Anatole France'sPenguin Island, and; Ivan Turgenev'sFathers and Sons (Penguin Classics). This is first-rate literature -- during his lifetime Samuel Butler (born, 1835) also penned the well-known Utopian satireErewhon.In summary, this book is one of those little treasures which devotees of classic literature have to occasionally pry out of historical obscurity. It's nice that this superlative work has now seen various reprintings. I cannot recommend it highly enough for those who, like me, foster an unbridled appreciation for outstanding literature of this compelling era."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"It has been frequently observed that those who write history define it, and so it is with this wonderful novel which is, in large part, Butler's autobiography. Reviewers speak of it as having blown the lid off Victorian society; in fact, it is timeless, ruthlessly dissecting the behavior of several generations of an abusive family where the only rule is \\"Every man for himself.\\" Those who grew up in that kind of family will find it truthful and insightful, those who grew up in happy families will be perplexed.As some of the other reviews indicate, this is a book that is likely to offend conventional, especially fundamentalist, Christians. Butler's father was an ordained Anglican priest and he himself came close to being one (opting instead to run a sheep station in New Zealand for five years, an experience upon which he based \\"Erewhon\\"). Butler excoriates the hypocrisy and cant of that profession while questioning the Church's key doctrines.If you can, purchase an edition with Theodore Dreiser's introduction.Make no mistake, this is a great book.

The story is sad and painful as much as it is funny.It also has a dickensian tuch (which is always good),but it sounds more like a biography than a victorian novel.I strongly recommend it to anyone that wants to learn somthing and enjoy at the same time."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Samuel Butler wrote the main content of The Way of All Flesh by 1867, although it was not published until 1902, in order to avoid conflicts with the prevailing societal norms, institutions and individuals. It tells the story of Ernest Pontifex's personal growth through age 28 in Victorian England, as the son of Theobald Pontifex, a Christian minister who represents the social institutions of his time. The story is narrated by Ernest's godfather, Edward Overton, who plays the role of the modern, well-informed critic.Butler highlights the momentum, conservatism, self-interest, cruelty and lack of self-awareness of the core institutions of family, church, education, marriage, class and gentlemen. Centuries after the enlightenment, in the midst of the industrial revolution, but before Darwin, Freud and Marx, the children of the privileged classes know that the old institutions and solutions no longer work, but struggle to find new answers. Ironically, Chinua Achebe's 1958 novel Things Fall Apart, documenting the disruption of classic Nigerian societies in the face of western missionaries, addresses the same strain on institutions and individuals.Butler wrote for the enlightened audience of Victorian England, taunting the Church, professors, financiers, society, mothers and gentlemen. The novelist prefers the honest common sense of the working class, farmers, carpenters and sailors to the theory of academics and clergy or the speculative results of the emerging business class.Yet, he provides realistic portraits of the characters. They are human, striving and failing, educated but short-sighted, secure but concerned, generous but protective, innovative but sensitive, aware but limited, idealistic but practical. Ernest is the hero, but he is not lovable. His father Theobald is the villain, but it is difficult to demonize his shortcomings, for he is incapable of modern self-awareness. The narrator provides insights and commentary, but no real solutions. Even Ernest's mother and supportive aunt are tragically limited by their roles and social conventions.Butler's picture of the constraining role of social institutions is eye-opening for anyone who came of age after 1970 in the West. The Church is incredibly focused on sin and perfection. Parents are focused on obedience. Educators are focused on personal advancement and student compliance. The upper classes keep the lower classes in their place. Men keep women in their place. Children are burdens to be managed. Butler anticipated the post-modernist view that power preserves power by 100 years.Butler chronicles the growing conflict between faith and reason. He documents the tendency of religious institutions to take absolutist views in the face of scientific and practical evidence to the contrary. He outlines new attempts to regenerate more effective religious views which inevitably fail.This novel resonates because it portrays the essential modern conflict between a youth who desperately, deeply, intuitively desires to understand and change the world and a world which cannot simply be reduced to a formula or a faith. Butler anticipates the existentialist dilemma that requires individuals to make choices in spite of the lack of compelling evidence in one direction or the other.Read this book to reflect on the last 150 years when enlightened individuals have struggled with existential choices that are not resolved by simple religious or secular solutions. Think about the tea party and the Islamist responses which desire a return to the simpler world of certainty. In spite of the lack of certainty, what do we do?"},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"A great book. This is a piece that is deserving of its #12 rating on Modern Library's list of 100 Best Novels. And I would readily recommend this book to a friend.The prose was very easy, though at 736 pages it is not a fast read. Basically, this book takes a good hard look at all that is wrong with society, the church, and the role parents play in their children's lives and in the lives of future generations.The main theme is the way in which parents control and manipulate their offspring, how easy it is to be brainwashed by your parents, how difficult to break free from that grip and the way in which it all repeats itself in the next generation.Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book, some comic, some insightful:*** 'My boy,' returned my father, \`you must not judge by the work, but by the work in connection with the surroundings.*** We must judge men not so much by what they do, as by what they make us feel that they have it in them to do.***Now, look here, my lad,' he continued, \`some boys are born stupid, and thou art one of them; some achieve stupidity--that's thee again, Jim--thou wast both born stupid and hast greatly increased thy birthright--and some'(and here came a climax during which the boy's head and ear were swayed from side to side)\`have stupidity thrust upon them...'***the greatest nuisance to mankind is man'***Mr Pontifex never lacked anything he much cared about. True, he might have been happier than he was if he had cared about things which he did not care for, but the gist of this lies in the \`if he had cared.' We have all sinned and come short of the glory of making ourselves as comfortable as we easily might have done, but in this particular case Mr Pontifex did not care, and would not have gained much by getting what he did not want.***Earnest on his first day out of prison:It pleased me to see the delight he took in all about him; the fireplace with a fire in it; the easy chairs, the Times, my cat, the red geraniums in the window, to say nothing of coffee, bread and butter, sausages, marmalade, etc Everything was pregnant with the most exquisite pleasure to him. The plane trees were full of leaf still; he kept rising from the breakfast table to admire them; never till now, he said, had he known what the enjoyment of these things really was. He ate, looked, laughed and cried by turns, with an emotion which I can neither forgetnor describe...... This is the type of book this is. It shares with the reader some valuable insights the author had found out for himself and I feel it is a must read for people wanting to improve their minds."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Very interesting character study of an abused boy in a dysfunctional family and how that played out in his life. A little tedious writing but worth staying with it."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Somehow, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" doesn't make it on to many lists of \\"the world's greatest novels.\\" I'm not sure why.There is a specific edition of this book which I love, and which can be found easily among used-book dealers. This edition was issued by The Heritage Press, and contains a remarkable introduction by Theodore Dreiser. The introduction is something which I have re-read many times. As a beginning, Dreiser recounts his interaction with an intelligent American engineer, aged about 40, who was looking for a book \\"with some meat to it.\\" After long hesitation, and after compiling a list of some dozen books, Dreiser finally decided to recommend \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\"Six months later, he met the engineer by chance while strolling along a street in San Francisco, and the engineer immediately started praising the novel. \\"Now there is a book which is honest! I can't think of another book from its time which contains more honesty, and more direct dealing!\\"And indeed, this may be the main thing working in favor of \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\" Samuel Butler read Darwin, and became a believer in the theory of evolution. He was a penetrating observer of the cruelties of Victorian society, and of its hypocrisies. Few people will read this book without being able to remember this startlingly honest portrayal of a man who has just lost his wife, whom he did not love in the slightest:\\"Theobald buried his face in his hands to conceal his want of emotion.\\"Oh, touche!But other themes are extremely interesting: the idea of taking up a Christian vocation and going into the slums to dedicate your life to serving the poor -- it might work, but it might be a dreadful idea if you don't know what you're doing.And how about the narrator's bald statement:\\"I know of no better thing for a young man than an independent income.\\" (!!) That sentiment is not going to sit well with the people who believe that only a lifetime of wage-slavery is worth living! But Samuel Butler spoke from experience: when he was in his twenties, he escaped to New Zealand and took up sheep-farming, of all things. But... he did WELL as a sheep-farmer, sold out five years later at a very nice profit, and cleared eight thousand pounds. He invested it at ten percent and therefore had an independent income of eight hundred pounds per year. He returned to London, rented an apartment, and devoted the rest of his life to his intellectual life: writing, painting, and music. He is well-known as the author of \\"Erewhon,\\" as well as \\"The Way of All Flesh.\\"You should really take a look at this book. In some ways, it has shaped my life, in ways that sometimes surprise me. There's a lot of good, honest meat in this book -- and that's probably why it has been continuously in print for over a century, despite the fact that the academics pass over it in silence.Extremely high recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"This book tells the story of three generations of men in the Pontifex family. Theobold is unable to resist the domination of his father and acquiesces to following the ministry, as his father desires. Theobold's son Ernest, the novel's main character, is not exceptionally bright, motivated or gifted. Yet he succeeds in throwing off the religious and moral mantle he inherited. By doing so, he rejects the values of the age.This book is most interesting read in it's historical context. The discursions and lengthy sentences make it a slow read. But if you are in the mood for a classic, this one is enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I've now read this book at least ten times, and every time I do it seems to get better. Butler is a bridge between the Victorian and 20th century novelist--although the book has some of the heavily stylized writing of the 19th century, the thinking is pure 20th. I read it first as a teenager, and was pleased to see that the hero's parents were depicted as well-meaning but foolish, and ultimately harmful, people. (This was in the late 1960s, and I thought, \\"Wow, just like mine!\\") Likewise, other 1960s thinking peered out from behind its Victorian curtains: organized religion is scorned, as is too much conformity and too little curiosity.Yet when I read it again last year, it seemed like the perfect antidote the Bush years, with its high degree of common sense and empathy--just as it seemed like a warning to the excesses of the 1980 Reagan years. Like most classics, this book works for every era, and for every reader.It's also funny, smart, and psychologically years ahead of its time. If I had only one book to take to a desert island, this would be it. You can read it over and over and always enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Flesh is what governs the soul. Much of the book contains a scathing, satirical appraisal and condemnation of church, clergy, christianity, and the hypocrisy, dogma and deliberate self-delusion of religion. Pretty outrageous for 1884.\\"the story that Christ died, came to life again and was carried from earth through clouds into the heavens could not be accepted ... He (Ernest) would probably have seen it years ago if he had not been hoodwinked by people who were paid for hoodwinking him.\\" p.293\\".. he had been humbugged and the greater part of the ills which afflicted him were due to ... the influence of Christian teaching..\\" p. 298Of Ernest's clergy parents: \\"They had tried to keep their ignorance of the world from themselves by calling it the pursuit or heavenly things and then shutting their eyes to anything that might give them trouble.\\" p.288It matters little what a man professes \\"provided only that he follows it out with charitable inconsistency\\" ... p.314 I love this profound observation - that principle can be an ugly thing without charitable inconsistency.The book is about a slow witted bumpkin who, because of his genteel birth, must be saved from poverty by a secret inheritance. Ernest, the hero, learns at a painfully slow pace that his beliefs are mere witless prejudices devoid of truth.The author has Ernest find salvation later in the idea that expediency of belief trumps veracity - that accepting christianity is expedient, its truth is not relevant. I'm sure Butler, the author, would exempt his personal finances from that principle - that expediency trumps veracity.Unfortunately, those not endowed with a class birthright - like Ellen, Ernest's false wife - are not worth saving.Writes Butler: \\"We set good breeding as the corner-stone.. That a man should have been bred well and breed others well ... so that no one can look at him without seeing that he has come of good stock .. this is the desiderandum.\\"The class divide is as unbridgable to Butler as is the theological divide to his Theobald Pontifex character. Thus the book itself ends up being a monumental hypocrisy. Exactly the kind of unthinking narrow prejudices that his anti-hero Theobald Pontifex has about religion, the author, Samuel Butler, has about class. He has Ernest cured of his idiotic stupidity by having money thrust upon him. He has poor lower class Ellen condemned to be incurable from drink. To be in poverty is to be uncivilized. Ernest, upon getting money, gets back to civilization. (Butler's phrase)"},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Butler's stodgily paced and, at times, slow moving novel is perhaps less compelling now that it once was; yet still presents an interesting picture of the paradoxes and hypocrises of Victorian society. Butler does not, as once reviewer claims, employ the &quot;straw man&quot; to defame Christianity. What the author does (and sadly that reviewer seems to have missed it) is demonstrate Christianity's place in justifying elite conceptions of their own purity and morality. Ernest Pontifex's quasi-puritan parents believe themselves to be the very picture of piety - when in actuality they are emotionally cruel and questionably Christian-like towards their own kin. Really, these characters, who are so imbued by their own sense of righteousness to ably examine their own lives, are a metaphor for all of Victorian society. Perhaps this metaphoric critique, no doubt very biting in its time, has lost its edge in a time of less subtle criticism. Still, worth the time to read if you're interested in the changes in both English society (and self-image) and modern literature at the turn of the century. Usually classified as a &quot;modern&quot; novel, it more aptly lies somewhere in between."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"A slow, difficult read yet not without merit. At times scathing at others jocular yet always insightful.The tale is of one Ernest Pontifex and 4 generations of his family beginning with his great-grandfather told by a family friend, Overton.The reader is exposed to the hypocrisy of Victorian values inevitably consequential in the development of our protagonist and his overbearing bible thumping father.Butler describes the twisted growth of the Pontifex family tree; one limb overshadowing the next letting it shrivel in darkness. One wonders whether the tree was planted outside the Munster residence.At times I couldn't help but hate Ernest's father and reel in disbelief in Ernests' naivety. These conflicting emotions make the book enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"THE WAY OF ALL FLESH is full of insightful generaliztions abou the human race embellished in a character which is so well-developed that the reader can feel pity for him for the situations which he is eveloped in are ones that we can be trapped in everyday. I used this book for an independent novel study (Grade 11) and would like to reccomend it to all students who are to be doing such a project, especially if the subject has to do with irony."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Samuel Butler is a man braver than most. His insight almost made me want to sob at times, because my own life had strong similarities to that of Ernest with his parents. I felt through Samuel Butler's words that somehow I had been healed. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"The Way of All Flesh I am sure it is a great book.... but I personally did not think it a good &#34;read&#34;I REGRET BUYING IT..."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"A very important novel of the 19th Century. How it is included in the best novels of the 20th Century by the New York Times is beyond me. The book was begun more than 30 years before 1900. Although completed in 1872, it lay unpublished for nearly 30 years; presumably until such time as some of its anti-Victorian ideals would be more palatable to the British public.The story principally centers around the life of Ernest Pontifex, an impreesionable and naive young man who is reared by devout Anglican parents. Their well meaning cruelty shelter Ernest and cause him to make bad decisions and derail his ambitions. As a result of the consequences of these bad decisions, Ernest learns to manage his own life and becomes a success despite his early failures.Although important in its time, the novel is brutally slow."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Ernest Pontifex/The Way of All Flesh is a fabulous book. It's almost sickeningly personal, and therefore ahead of its own time and so influential as to be trite or &quot;boring&quot; in ours. Understand, though. This makes it no less of an achievement. It is the memoir to end all memoirs, yet it preceded all memoirs."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Recommended as a classic, I found this book to be dry and uneventful as a book could be. I was only mildly captivated by the character of Ernest and the rest of his self-rightious family. This book is more of a psychology work than a novel."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"The last page of this book was as tediously painful to read as the first. Butler's pompous writing is by far a worse sin than any committed by his vapid characters."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"&quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; seems to be best known as the Victorian novel that thumbed its nose at Victorian novels. For this reason, it's frequently mentioned in talks of literary history, but I don't ever hear of anyone praising Samuel Butler's novel from an artistic perspective. Actually, I find the book more interesting for its story than for its place in the development of 19th and 20th century literature.I tried to read this novel once and only got through the first 100 pages or so. I found it remarkably dull and dry, and the tone of the first-person narrator (Mr. Overton), who stops the action every 10 pages or so to offer personal asides that reveal more about him than about the characters he's writing about, I thought to be snide and irritating.But I hate not finishing a book, so I picked it up again, this time understanding that it would be a dry read and prepared to appreciate it for its historical context. To my surprise, I found myself caught up in the story and thought the whole thing very funny. I can't believe I missed all the humour the first time through.I hesitate to give this novel too much credit for deflating the pompous bubble of Victorian morality, because other authors writing at the same time as Butler were doing the same thing (Dickens for one can be incredibly caustic). But there is a maturity to Butler's writing that is not present in other Victorian writers. This novel feels much more modern than anything else written pre-1900, and even feels more modern than some books written after. Unlike Dickens, whose characters are either all good or all bad and have about as much depth as the characters you'd find in a comic book (this isn't a criticism--I like Dickens), Butler's characters (at least Ernest, his protagonist) seem very much alive and flawed. Ernest is easily influenced by everyone around him and makes decisions based on how he thinks he should act rather than how he wants to act. He doesn't know what he wants out of life, he's a screw up, he's got lousy luck. All of these things make him quite endearing because they make him so human. The scathing criticism of religious hypocrisy and moral bombast exhibited by the majority of people in Ernest's life can be funny, especially if you agree with it (as I do), but the story itself is much more interesting than the social commentary.I would definitely recommend this book. It's not necessarily a page turner, but it consistently held my interest. Just remember that it's supposed to be funny. Think of Butler as a 19th century Evelyn Waugh, and you should do just fine."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"The Way of All Flesh covers six generations of strife in the Pontifex family, and spans a period from 1750 to 1880. However, the bulk of the story concerns the life of Ernest Pontifex, from about age 5 up to age 28, and describes his unsatisfactory relations with his parents, his school, his church, his wife, and his friends. Sometimes we feel sorry for Ernest, because many of his problems are caused by unbelievably cruel or thoughtless people, and sometimes we're furious with him, because he himself is the author of at least half of his troubles, but either way his misfortunes make him stronger and move him steadily along the path to maturity. Throughout, the book remains an easy read, although the writing is very witty and often rewards close examination.Even today, 100 years after the book's publication, a reader finds many things to identify with. Anyone who felt unjustly treated by his or her parents or teachers will find much to sympathize with here. Anyone who has wrestled with the conflict between Reason and Faith will find much to think about here. Given how much change the last century has seen, it's surprising how many of the issues still seem fresh and relevant, and the book definitely makes you think about them. It is easy to see how many people have described reading The Way of All Flesh as a turning point in their lives.A point worth keeping in mind: the characters are all described from Ernest's point of view. Several clues tell us that Ernest exaggerates the cruelty of various characters - some of whom seem evil beyond belief, and I think it's quite clear that, at these points, we're supposed to smile at Ernest - not shake our heads at the author. This is most obvious with Ernest's schoolmaster, Dr. Skinner, whom Ernest consistently sees as a pompous fool, but who we also know is very popular with the best students, and who shows other signs of being a much better man than Ernest believes him to be.The footnotes in my edition (Penguin Classics 1986) are very skimpy, focusing on comparing elements from Ernest's fictional life to Samuel Butler's real one. The failure of the notes to translate passages in French or Latin, or to explain very contemporary references, is inexcusable. (E.g. but for the recent controversy over his Beatification, we'd have no clue that \\"Pio Nono\\" was Pope Pius IX.) Hoggart's introduction (1966) is decent but a bit dated, not having weathered as well as the book itself!"},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I read this book after reading all the reviews on Amazon not knowing what to expect: Incredibly boring or amazing insightful? I have read many books written in that same time period. I believe this to be the most mature work to come out of England in the late 19th Century(although it was published later). I enjoy Dickens, Hardy, and Eliot very much, but Butler makes their works look like grocery store fiction. I can see how many people might be bored if they were expecting a great story. While the story is excellent, it is more a book about ideas. Butler uses his hero to voice his commentary on Victorian ideals. Most of it is still very relevant today, though. I think it will be most relevant for people that have been exposed to the religious right wing who still hold many Victorian values. I enjoyed the characters and the story was compelling. There are many beautiful passages. It was very funny at times and somewhat sarcastic. The narrator reminded me of Hemmingway born 50 years earlier in England. What impressed me the most was Butler's modern style of writing. Much less wordy than Dickens. Dickens would have taken 800 pages to express the same thoughts. I also felt a real kindred to the main character Ernest. This is ultimately a coming of age book which most people will be able to relate to in one way or another (unless you haven't grown up yet). I would recommend it to all serious readers."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"This is a book written ostensibly by a godfather, chronicling the family history and the unusual life of Earnest Pontifex, the only son of a very upright and religiously correct Christian minister. It is reportedly an almost autobiographical account of the author's own life and reflects his own lifetime revelations with regard to society, religion and morality. It goes extensively into the lives of his parents and their parents, allowing the reader to fully appreciate the inevitable life into which Ernest is born. The Way Of All Flesh explores the difficult struggles of a naiive young man coming to terms with his parents' and society's expectations of him while he endeavors to find his place in the world. His life begins as an avalanche of yesteryear--Victorian and Christian values are laid out, explored, tried, tested, examined and rejected as Earnest muddles his way to true happiness and a life worth living. If it were published during Samuel Butler's life, it would surely have resulted in some kind of social or legal censure as a shocking indictment of the establishment of the day. In many respects, it is still as revealing, shocking and valid as it was when it was written."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"A rich, intelligent, historically informative masterpiece that tells the modern reader about the concerns, delusions, pretensions and prejudices of Englishmen of the 1700s and 1800s.Much more than just a novel, this work offers Butler's opinions upon philosophy, child-rearing and religion. The events of the novel serve to illustrate and reinforce the points made. It is a hybrid, a novel/essay, and rare at that. More essayists should spice up their arguments by dressing them with vivid characters and a decent plot, as Butler has.Rich in wit, satire, sarcasm, humor, insight, and not without flashes of bitterness and anger.If you read only a hundred books in your lifetime, this would not be such a bad choice for the eightieth or eighty-first. Towers above most novels that cover this long period in history (some hundred years or so, spanning four or more generations)."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"This book did cause quite a stir when it was published. Samuel Butler wrote in a \\"no-holds-barred\\" style that attacked the Victorian era at its core. He shows the family as a tormented assembly bound together by illusion and make-believe, or even by hatred, fear and hypocrisy. As shocking as this was at the time, Mr. Butler was actually revealing secrets from his own family. He doesn't stop at the family. He put holes in the marital institution, the Church and at educational facilities. I know this sounds like a toxic book, but it is really not. Only true genius can write a book like this one. It is a book where the author's temperament comes shining through its pages. If nothing else, it's an honest a picture that you'll get anywhere of Victorian life."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I won't pretend that this book is a quick page-turner, full of sparkle and a romp. In fact it gets bogged down rather too often in discussions about how ironically we conduct our lives and what would be the intelligent alternative. But it is a fine achievement nonetheless and a good cautionary tale about people taking themselves and their lives way too seriously. The depiction of family life reminded me of Satykov-Schedrin's \\"The Family Golovlyov,\\" that savage recounting of the ultimate dysfunctional family: Some of Butler's exposing of each family member's real agenda is a supreme hoot, and very perceptive indeed. Please know too that \\"The Way of All Flesh,\\" published in 1903, is an acknowledged precursor to much of our greatest Twentieth Century literature. George Bernard Shaw has admitted his debt, but I also wonder how James Joyce must have been affected, and many, many others. But for us, as we begin the Twenty-First Century, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" is at least a delicious book to savor and to open our eyes."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"There is nothing remarkable about the literary style of Butler's book; it reads like a million and a half other 19th century British novels. What distinguishes \\"The Way of All Flesh\\", however, is its honest and at times funny portrayal of Victorian society. With great wit, Butler's narrator, Overton, and main character, Ernest, expose the stuffy, staid, hypermannered, insipid Victorian middle-class mindset.What is especially nice is that Butler doesn't take too many cheap shots. The characters here are very well-drawn. Ernest's father, Theobald, though clearly representing all that Butler seeks to skewer, is enough of a three-dimensional foil that I could feel some sympathy for the poor old man. (He's not evil incarnate, just a sorry product of his time.) The same goes for the rest of the supporting cast. I like the narrator's voice; it's distinctive and wry enough to be unique, but not so intrusive as to distract from the plot.Parts of the novel are funny; parts seem to drag. I don't know that I liked the end of the novel--everything seems tied together a little too perfectly; but an explanation may be found in the fact that Butler did not edit this portion of the novel before his death.This is a solid book. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about this book after just reading it. I feel that Butler was able to capture the complexity of familial relationships tainted with puritanical religious beliefs. I think he really does a good job of showing the hypocrisy of certain religious beliefs. I think he challenges one not to blindly accept things without questioning them. The only problem I had with the book is that it is filled with Victorian and religious allusions that I did not understand. Also, there is a fair amount of Latin phrases that I could not translate myself. Those parts of the book will forever remain a mystery to me."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"It's a hoot to read the clipped, sullen dismissals of this book by readers from Topeka to Boston. They obviously hate Butler's novel, and for good reason: the mealymouthed, Christian, moneygrubbing Victorian family on which he spits with such accuracy moved west in the course of the twentieth century. It is now only rarely to be found in England; its true home is...Topeka...and Boston...and a thousand other American whited sepulchres. One reviewer whines that this is the &quot;irrelevant&quot; story of &quot;an average middle-class man from an average middle-class family.&quot; What an interesting form of &quot;irrelevance&quot;!In fact, the novel is brilliant and has endured surprisingly well. To see its relevance, all you need do is move its setting 3.000 miles to the West."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"The main character, Ernest Pontifex,is a pathetic weakling, variously oppressed and exploited by his parents and acquaintances. He fails at everything and relies on others to get him out of difficulties. The other primary character, Ernest's godfather (another &quot;voice&quot; for the author) spends his time despising Ernest's parents and saving Ernest. Yet, since this is an autobiographical novel, the author would have you believe that Ernest is actually a brilliant iconoclast whose writings disturb Victorian society. Humbug! Butler demonizes his parents so heavyhandedly (all the characters are cardboard, etched with bile) and is so smug about it, that he, not they, comes across as the Monster. Of Human Bondage, by H. S. Maugham, touches on some similar themes and is a vastly superior work. Anything by George Eliot would also be a vastly better read from 19th C. English literature."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"An autobiographical novel about a Victorian boyhood and early manhood, The Way of All Flesh centers around the question of how to act when everyone loves your parents except you:&quot;There are orphanages,&quot; he exclaimed to himself, &quot;for children who have lost their parents--oh! why, why, why, are there no harbours of refuge for grown men who have not yet lost them?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"it's a grower. it took me a long time to summon the patience to read further than the 50th page or so. it took far too long to get on with the story. when it did though, i begun to really enjoy the book. the characters are excellently portrayed, especially ernests parents. in my humble opinion, it is very well written. my only criticizm is the tendency of the narrator to go off on tangents, mainly at the beginning of the book"},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Written in the 1870's and 1880's, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" is a semi-autobiographical account of Samuel Butler's life as the son of a clergyman and his attempts to abandon the religious influence of his parents. The protagonist, Ernest Pontifex, is the oldest of three children of the rector of a small English town. His father, Theobald, beats and browbeats his children into learning their hymns while his mother, Christina, solemnly and unsympathetically condones the excessive discipline.Ernest is not much of a scholar and shows a predilection for music (nothing more modern than Handel, though), which his father deems a decadent waste of time. For lack of a better calling, he chooses to become a clergyman like his father and is ordained a deacon after completing Cambridge. As a young man, he runs into some misfortune: He gets suckered into giving much of his money to a smooth-talking charlatan named Pryer, a fellow theologian, to invest, and a turbulent encounter with a prostitute lands him a few months in jail. It is here that he decides a religious path is not for him, which is just as well since he is more of a pragmatist than a dogmatist. He becomes a tailor, but his business fails; he gets married, but his wife turns out to be a lush and a bigamist. If this indeed bears any resemblance to Butler's own life, I shake my head in pity.The narrator is not Ernest himself but his godfather Edward Overton, a close friend of the Pontifex family. Butler probably thought such third-party commentary would provide a more valuable perspective, but it doesn't ring true for Overton to be privy to every single detail of Ernest's life which would not be so easily discovered or revealed. However, Butler is a good writer who peppers his prose with sly sarcasm and humorous observations to counteract its Victorian-style stodginess.For a novel that has a reputation of deconstructing and satirizing the piety of Victorian society, \\"The Way of All Flesh\\" feels innocuous and tame; what could have been a fiery tirade against religious hypocrisy comes off more as a gentle prodding. For a satire to be successful, the target must be odious and obvious; the book's tone is too dull and soft to inspire the reader to hate the Pontifex family and the religious furor they represent. I respect Butler's motivation for writing this book and I wanted to symphathize with him, but I got nothing more out of it than a recounting of the irrelevant misadventures of an average man from an average middle class family."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"I found myself alternately loving and hating this book. I loved it when Butler was busy telling the story of Ernest, a boy brought up in a Victorian household by overbearing parents, who feels stifled by them, the Church of England, and academia. I rooted for Ernest every step of the way, wanting him to find the love of a woman and work suitable to his talents.I hated the book when it delved deeply into philosophy and the vocabulary, rich in Victorian rhetoric, went over my head too frequently.I absolutely loved it when Ernest could thumb his nose at his pompous, overbearing, nasty father and live his life on his own terms. I could understand his hatred of church life and university life but wished that he could have kept a child-like Christian faith for himself although he certainly upheld Christian values. I was proud of him when he visited his mother as she lay dying.I would have given this book four or five stars if I could have had Ernest's story with only about a third of the philosophical discussions written in modern language.As it was, I found myself very frustrated and very anxious to get back to Ernest's story every time Butler erupted with verbal diarrhea. Ernest, although sometimes exasperating, is such a loveable character--I could have taken a lot more Ernest and a lot less discussion."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Butler finished this book in 1884, but then like Isaac Newton, left it in a drawer for twenty years and it was only published posthumously. It tells the tale of the unhappy upbringing of Ernest Pontifex; unhappy because his parents aren't nice to him & his father insists on a strict theology. The critics, Shaw, Pritchett, etc., hail it as the novel which destroyed the Victorian facade of the happy family. I guess noone had read Dickens or Trollope.I honestly don't get it. I know that the elites loathed Victorian England, but it's intellectually dishonest to pretend that contemporary authors, like Dickens and Trollope, didn't question the pretensions and conventions of their day. They act as if there was a huge conspiracy of silence and everyone believed life was perfect, until books like this one exploded onto the scene. This is patently untrue.Butler seems more important as a key figure on the road to the interior or psychological novel. It's easy to see the debt that authors like Joyce owe to him. Pretty much nothing happens and the whole book turns on Ernest having (...) parents.Tom Wolfe is giving hundreds of interviews right now decrying the psychological novel and begging authors to go out into the world and observe the life and energy of the country. We can only hope someone's listening.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Though beautifully written, The Way of All Flesh is pathetically lacking in aesthetic appeal. The plot is only mildly interesting at its peak moments, and usually not even that. What is worse though, is the lack of sympathetic characters. The closest thing Butler manages is the kindly wealthy spinster aunt - who appears but briefly, and then for the sole purpose of providing the necessary &quot;inheritance&quot; which will later set Ernest Pontifex (our &quot;hero&quot;)free from his poverty. This good fortune is presented as a great injustice finally being righted... as if Ernest was somehow entitled to explore his own naive, narrow-minded, reclusive habits at leisure.The highlight of Ernest's life is when he begins to succeed in business on his own merit - but Butler clearly does not see that. Butler is lauded as a &quot;radical&quot; social critic, but apparently clung to the belief that working as a merchant could bring joy to commoners but not to the &quot;gentle born.&quot; Am I mis-reading this text?I must believe that the book's high critical acclaim comes from its historical position as one of the first novels to present an apparently &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;rational&quot; position of secular humanism. Butler seems to be saying: &quot;If we get free of all this religious nonsense we might have a chance at a little happiness in life.&quot; How naive. How reactionary. Worse, how utterly boring.P.S. I was delighted to see that other Amazon reviewers did not feel compelled to praise this useless historical curiousity."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"This book just didn't stand up for me. The problem with social satires is that once the culture changes its hooks and barbs lose much of their rhetorical force. As accute as it must have been a hundred years ago, Butler's critique of 19th century English culture just isn't as relevant today as it was when it was first written, and so for me the book was a disappointment.Nonetheless, Butler's insights and (often) insults on the nature of the parent-child relationship make the book eminently readable, and occasionally quite illuminating. And the glimpse into the struggle that went into making a man during that time of industrualization was similarly fascinating. The juxtaposition of the economic realities which faced a young man then versus now was, for me, the most interesting aspect of the novel."},{"Title":"The Way of All Flesh","review":"Book is what my husband wanted.

Family dysfunction, perversion and warped sexuality, lost faith."},{"Title":"Celtic Women: Women in Celtic Society & Literature","review":"While Ellis' &quot;Celtic Women&quot; is the best book I have yet read on the subject, it suffers from peculiar inconsistencies, as well as the author's tendency to disregard or dismiss evidence which contradicts his thesis. This work is definitely preferable to Jean Markale's book of the same title, as Ellis seems to be more of a scholar and less of a mystic. Ellis focuses on material from the Classical authors, native Celtic law texts, and vernacular works of literature and history in painting a vivid picture of the many roles of Celtic women and Celtic female divinities. This work is not without flaws, however, for one must ask, would a book about Celtic men include an overview of Celtic male gods? Female divinities are also prominent in Greek mythology, but I find the argument that the stature of goddesses reflects the status of women in the culture which worships them to be, at best, highly speculative. While there is definitely evidence that women could attain high social positions in Cletic societies, Mr. Ellis seems to gloss over the fact that ruling queens and influential female Brehons (judges) were notable exceptions to the rule. In addition, while there is much material introduced from native law regarding women's rights to property and divorce, nothing is said concerning women's rights to child custody. The reader is left to wonder whether nothing is said in these law texts about such an important and revealing point as a woman's right to her own children, or if the author considered it to be of no importance. As a woman, I would love to look to the Celts as an example of the &quot;original egalitarian model&quot; that the book's jacket claims, but as a scholar I feel that Mr. Ellis overstates his case, a failing of many of his otherwise fine works. Perhaps more disturbing, there are sections of the book that strike a strangely discordant note in view of the overall theme. For instance, Mr. Ellis devotes an entire chapter (out of 10) to the subject of personal adornment. In this chapter, he discusses not only the costume and adornments of women, but of men as well. Does this suggest a view on the part of the author that the whole subject of dress is a concern specific to women, or is this material introduced solely by way of comparison? While I would recommend this book as being the best available on the subject, I believe that a truly 5 star book on Celtic women has not yet been written."},{"Title":"Celtic Women: Women in Celtic Society & Literature","review":"Peter Berresford Ellis reveals the important role Celtic women played in their society in his book, \\"Celtic Women: Women in Celtic Society & Literature.\\" Using historical documents, Ellis offers evidence that women in Celtic society had rights that were protected by law to own property, to choose who and when they wanted to marry, to divorce if they wanted and to take with them the property they owned prior to marriage, as well as half of the property held with their husband (after a certain period of time). The women of the Ancient Celts fought in battles, and trained young warriors. They could be rulers, priests, doctors and lawyers. Ellis reveals how all of these rights granted to Celtic women gradually changed after the introduction of Christianity by the Roman priests. Well written and documented, Ellis makes the history of the Ancient Celts, particularly women, very interesting reading."},{"Title":"Celtic Women: Women in Celtic Society & Literature","review":"Ellis makes interesting points, but seems very uncritical in his use of mythology in a way that's been debunked in Celtic studies for decades. If you want a much more compelling analysis of the real roles of Celtic women at least in early Irish society, I'd suggest *Isle of Women* by Lisa Bitel."},{"Title":"Celtic Women: Women in Celtic Society & Literature","review":"In this book, as in many of his other works, Ellis seeks to portray an \\"image\\" of a people and a nation, reflecting a view of the Celts deeply tinged by a romantic view of a long-lost, mystical people. What emerges is sort of an odd duck, an ostensibly scholarly work rehashing old chestnuts about the supposed rights and freedoms of Celtic women even as most scholarship of Irish history has long forsaken them for more in-depth and objective analysis. I have personally not read the entire book - although I have seen numerous excerpts from it - but I have gotten a good sense of what it contains, what Ellis's basic arguments are, and how he sets out to prove these arguments. I will discuss my issues with this book as well as point out some of the more recent scholarship and the ways in which it differs from Ellis's claims.Ellis has long been known by his followers (and he has a considerable body of followers) as a \\"Celtic scholar\\": to many, he is the foremost authority on Irish and Welsh history. Certainly, he has a natural ability to entertain. His most famous works are the \\"Sister Fidelma\\" mystery series, which he publishes under the pseudonym of \\"Peter Tremayne.\\" No matter what one's opinion of Ellis's academic rigor might be, one can't help but be enthralled by these works. Peter Tremayne's fan base has become so huge that a Sister Fidelma society has organized in South Carolina. Many of Ellis's faithful followers were people who were introduced to him through his Sister Fidelma series.However, leaving aside his imaginative and inventive popular novels, his scope as a scholarly and serious historian is somewhat more limited. For one thing, his sources are often highly questionable. Although, as one reviewer correctly pointed out, Ellis's work is free of some of the New Agey mysticism that characterizes other popular work in this field (which makes it more readable in my opinion), nevertheless he frequently uses Celtic spiritualist and neo-druidic authors as sources, probably more often than he ought. In general, his work appeals to the same generation of readers who clung to popular novels like \\"Mists of Avalon\\" during the 1980s. His work is profoundly bound up in the theory that Celtic society was by nature matriarchal and matrilineal, but that over time Christianity, and later, English/Norman influence, eroded the status of women, until in the 20th century there was nothing but a dim memory of this glorious past. To prove this, he uses the sagas and narratives of the Mythological, Ulster, and Fenian Cycles and the Brehon Laws, conveniently passing over anything contained in these sources that does not fit his worldview (or else attributing it to the negative effects of Christianity). However, most mainstream scholars no longer view the sagas as evidence of a pre-Christian survival into modern times, but rather as basically constructs of a later era, much as the Arthurian legends could not be said to actually date to the time of the legendary King Arthur. Ellis attempts to prove that Celtic women enjoyed great sexual freedom by referring to the many promiscuous women in Irish literature like Medb, but has little to say about women in the literature who were prized for their modesty and virginity. When he gets into talking about Brehon law, the line between reality and fantasy becomes especially blurred. We hear only one side of the story. Irish women could hold property on their own (much like women in other northern European societies), demand divorce (again, like women in other northern European societies), and hold free citizenship and public office (whoa...where in the Brehon laws do they talk about that?). If there is anywhere in the laws where women seem to be disadvantaged (and trust me, people, there are plenty of instances), it must be the fault of evil Christian patriarchy. How about the dire-text's insistence that a woman cannot make a contract without the approval of her male superior? Christian infiltration. The statement in Bretha Crolige that a man is not liable for abusing a promiscuous woman? Christian prudery. The laws of tanistery which bar a woman from participating in political assemblies? Errr...some evil Christian thing. This is the way the book is written. If the author likes something, he attributes it to the mystical, ethereal Celtic race; if he dosen't, it's Christianized, Romanized, and wholly anti-Celtic.For those who are looking for actual scholarship in this field, I would recommend several works. The Land of Women, by Lisa Bitel, probably the best work in the field of Irish women's history; A Guide to Early Irish Law, by Fergus Kelly (curiously, Ellis refers in some of his work to Kelly's book, although the two fundamentally disagree on important issues); Cattle Lords and Clansmen, by Nerys Patterson, which looks at the status of women in regard to farming and agrarian social structure; A Woman's Words, by Joanne Findon, which reassesses the way scholars view female literary characters from the Ulster cycle; Women in a Celtic Church, by Christina Harrington, which compares the Irish status of nuns and abbesses with their continental counterparts; and Slaves and Warriors in Medieval Britain and Ireland, by David R. Wyatt, which includes lengthy discussion on the role of women in regard to slavery, not only in Ireland, but in Wales, Scotland, and England as well. All of these are very useful and informative, much more so than Ellis's restatement of previously debunked cliches."},{"Title":"Celtic Women: Women in Celtic Society & Literature","review":"There are many non-fiction books written on the Celts, butonly a few on the subject of Celtic Women.

Prep is an insignificant addition to a giant genre of literature, but it isn't nearly as good as any of the great coming of age books. The book contains a story about a privileged, teenage girl going to a boarding school with a bunch of other privileged teens. The book is about the things that happen to her and how she deals with them. Well, at least that's what the author tried to do.Sounds great, right? The problem is that nothing interesting happens. Yes, this book is sort of realistic, but who cares about boring people living boring lives doing nothing? I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound like a good book to me. The main character does not grow over the course of the book and does not seem to have any interests or passions (except for one boy she has a crush on throughout the whole book). She sets herself up as an outcast and then wonders why no one likes her. This book was boring, boring, and boring. Oh, and did I say boring?The author does not seem to understand what a normal teenager goes through and feels while living through the teenage years. When reading the book it occurred to me that Curtis Sittenfeld was a man, since she did not quite grasp how a teenage girl feels and reacts to certain situations in her life. I did not like how the author wrote as if the focus of a teenage girl's life is sex, rather than friends, family, and other events/issues. The book felt unplanned and disorganized. When reading it, it sounded like the author was making stuff up on the spot. I thought this book was a waste of time, not just for the reader but for the author too."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Amazing book.If you did NOT go to boarding school, drop this book. Trust me.

Both of my brothers attended Wayland Academy (private prep school in WI) and both went to Harvard.. YES, South Bend does produce smart children from wealthy families. Ever hear of Studebaker, Curtis? Also, the writing is average. Try again."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This was a pretty good book, but I just kept waiting for something to happen. The main character is sad, depressing and not very likeable."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I normally do not feel compelled to write a review on Amazon once I have read a book, but this book causes me to change my mind. The protaganist of the book, Lee, is generally very unlikeable. She is whiney and often rude, and completely unmotovated to do anything. Half of the book she barely even has friends. She is surrounded by characters who are shallow and very two dimentional to make things even better.Besides the characters, the basis for the book bothered me a lot as well. The fact that people might think this is an acurate portrayal of a prestigious boarding school is horrifying to think about. Sittenfeld does not include a single believable character in the story and clearly draws on some bad experience she had in her life. Her characters are uninteresting and her idea of boarding school life is completely off. I would never recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm amazed at the number of highly rated reviews for this book. It was poorly written, repetitive, and boring. The protagonist was an extremely unlikeable character - snobbish to the extreme. She never grew or became more self-aware as the book progressed. There was no resolution; the book just ended. Check it out from the library if you must; don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Well if people who did not go to boarding school and hence have a slew of stereotypes about boarding school in their heads didn't have enough ammunition before, they certainly do now. As someone who attended an elite boarding school I thought the details of everyday school life were on target- but the characters (even down to the choice of names) were straight out of an after school TV special. Surprise, surprise- every social \\"outcast\\" was a minority with the exception of the protagonist. While she was not a racial or religious minority like the rest, she was from an average town/family rather than the country club set. While I'll admit that it is a difficult task for anyone to write ANYTHING about highschool-ers without sounding trite (because teenagers are inherently trite and slip more easily into stereotypes than any other group), Sittenfeld could have found a much more insightful and clever way of dividing the \\"in-crowd\\" from the rest. I was very disappointed and am stupefied at the overwhelming response this book has gotten from reviewers."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. It was the most useless, horrible story ever. It highlights the worst in teenagers, makes the main character nothing but a one dimensional stereotype, and makes all the other characters one dimensional sterotypes. There is no depth to anything, there is no resolution, there is no attachment to any characters. I did not emphatize with the main character, I wanted to smack her! Don't waste your time!!!!!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was listening to the audio version of this book, and I had to turn it off about halfway through because I realized that I hated the main character. I found her simpering, annoying, whiny, and--worst of all--stupid. I hoped that she would become more likeable, but it just got worse and worse as the narration inched along. (I actually found myself rooting against Lee Fiore.)Awful, truly awful.(Sadly, this is only one of two books that I can truly say I dislike; the other is \\"The Golden Bowl\\" by Henry James...however, I read that through to the bitter end, which gives it a leg up on Curtis Sittenfeld's novel.)"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was a white girl on full scholarship for four years at a boarding school in CT in the late 70's early 80's and this book is absolutely NOTHING like what I experienced. The only things that even remotely rung true were the daily school meetings and the funny little traditions that these schools have. I bought the book because I thought it would bring back some great memories and I found I couldn't relate at all."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I couldn't connect with Lee Fiora on any level- she would have been sympathetic if she had any likable characteristics what-so-ever. She never had any moments of growth and all her personal reflection (ad naseum) did nothing but contribute to her lack of self-esteem. While the book was extremely readable, I never found myself rooting for her, it was more like I was extremely embarrassed for her. It was kind of like looking through someone's dirty laundry hamper."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Let's make this short, shall we? Plenty of reviews already up for Prep.I wanted to like this book, didn't.- too unremarkable. Why read about an unremarkable, self-absorbed teenager unremarkably attending a school that, while somewhat noteworthy in the prep school rankings, seemed to be cast as one of the fifty fancy boarding schools in the country that churn out thousands of graduates who love it there, and go on to do mediocrely at excellent colleges? Sittenfeld doesn't give us a reason to care about her protagonist, or to like her.- too unwritten. If you're gonna give us an unlikable heroine untransformed by her school, at least bring the prose fireworks. Except for the occasional apercu and witty rejoinder, Prep is written unstylishly, unornately. That would be fine - but only if the characters were interesting or there was a plot.- three stars only because I read the whole thing, increasingly appalled by how mopey and unfriendly our heroine was. Something must have gotten its hooks in me. I don't know what, unless it was the fact that I was reflecting on how easy it must be to give women a really hard time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep held my interest for all 400 pages, but I found myself wondering why. The novel's strength lies in reporting details rather than plot or character. Nothing much happens. Even scenes that have potential to wrench our emotions are defused so quickly we barely notice them.For example, there's a scene involving a newspaper reporter that seems intended as some sort of pivotal point. Yet it's ultimately banal because Lee was just naive and the school threw her to the wolves.There's a poignant scene where Lee's parents misunderstand Lee's request to drive a classmate to a nearby hotel. And sadly we can't help wondering if the classmate hadn't been using Lee in some way.Some reviewers say Lee has become a snob, but I would say it's sometimes hard to distinguish Lee as a boarding school student from Lee as a typical teenager. Lee's father has no way to compare Lee with the teenaged girls back home, so he interprets her teenage defiance as boarding school snobbery.And while Lee remains a detached observer, a classic loner, it's hard to understand why. She has a popular roommate. She's accepted by her peers. She gets along with her teachers . She goes through a phase of cutting everybody's hair. And even though her love affair has a disappointing ending, she appreciates the experience. Subtly she feels more at home at Ault.Yet while she's such a careful observer of so much of her environment, she doesn't seem to understand and recognize her own growth. Ault helps her grow but ultimately leaves her in a place of ambiguity, like someone who has moved from one city but never feels at home anywhere else.In the end, I wanted to nudge the heroine and say, \\"Get over it.\\""},{"Title":"Prep","review":"People are giving the book low reviews for it being \\"racist\\", using cliches...well guess what, that's the way it is. I attend a boarding school, ISL but I wont name names, and the casual way of referring to those stereotypes does exist, and minorities at schools like these often seem to fall into line - the amazing black guy everyone is impressed by but are actually more impressed with being impressed by a black guy, the latino girls here are loud and stick with themselves (dont jump all over me, I'm not saying all are), and the korean students I know, and this is saying nothing against them, do keep unfamiliar food in their room that often has a pungent odor. The racist generalizations are treated so lightly in the book because thats the way they are treated at school.And I'm not saying its good, what she describes, but I've never seen a truer picture painted then prep. I could see everything they said in the fine old institution I attend. There are observations and feelings in there that I think, also having been to public school, it would be impossible for others to conjure up. when she realizes that \\"outside Ault, people were fat, or wore brown ties, or seemed grouchy\\" is something i myself have thought when i leave campus and wander into a walmart - it is the perfect depiction of that bubble of a world, where money is everything but never spoken of, and where the guidebook to the school is just infuriating, because those khakied boys on the lawn arent the WASP-y angels they seem - they DO get smashed and go skinny dipping in the hotels on parents weekend, or slip into anothers dorm for completely hallow sex...it happens all the time.It does not exaggerate, it does not sentimentalize, except for when it depicts the same baseless nostalgia i feel now, approaching my graduation. so its not a literary classic, but if you want to see what that fabled world of tradition and wealth and wasted privelege is like...read it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"She hits the nail on the head -- that is if you are interested in this partcular nail -- and the world of this novel is not something universally relatable to. That said, it's a book that reflects a lot of work, great style and a formidable glimpse into the world of super wealthy schools and the families they attract: from the outsider's point of view, too (much to it's credit!) Good job. And we should know. We are:Manhattan Private School Advisorwww.manhattanprivateschooladvisors.com"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I've honestly never related to a character more than Lee Fiora. Her high school experience might be different than most, but the writing and depth of the characters makes it feel like a universal experience. The writing in this book is stunning. The story is enjoyable. I enjoy how it's divided by seasons and school years. Overall, this is my favorite book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Very well-written, very insightful and depressing. I had a great time reading it and I'm glad it's over, because (A) the events in the last section are just squalid and (B) the narrator realizes her character flaws (laziness, low self-esteem) but doesn't have the gumption to do anything about them. She allows herself to be appallingly exploited and doesn't even learn any lessons from the experience. The setting of the book didn't seem important to me compared to the description of the narrator's character."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"After reading \\"American Wife\\" and finding it a heavily manipulative piece of faux fiction, I should have given up on Sittenfeld. However, I thought her writing had merit and she had just gone awry in \\"American Wife\\" because she let her politics overcome her integrity and good judgement as a writer, so I picked up \\"Prep\\". I was wrong. If this writer can be said to have a talent, it is a talent for creating characters that start out somewhat appealing and then, after sucking the reader in for a couple of hundred pages, become completely detestable, dragging the hapless reader through episode after episode of selfish, nasty, shallow and ridiculous behavior. At that point, one begins to feel a genuine antipathy for Sittenfeld and a deep sense of being ill used indeed. I can't think of another author with the same affect upon me (thankfully!).I can think of no reason that anyone should pick up \\"Prep\\" or any other book by this author, other than pure masochism and a need to feel manipulated. Do yourself a favor and choose ANY other book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Title: PrepAuthors: Curtis SittenfeldPublisher: Random HouseReading Level: Young AdultReleased: November 2005Rating: 4/5Summary:Lee Fiora is an intelligent, observant fourteen-year-old when her father drops her off in front of her dorm at the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts. She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school's glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristine mowed athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapelAs Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of-and, ultimately, a participant in-their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she's a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered.Ultimately, Lee's experiences-complicated relationships with teachers; intense friendships with other girls; an all-consuming preoccupation with a classmate who is less than a boyfriend and more than a crush; conflicts with her parents, from whom Lee feels increasingly distant, coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.Review:I've heard this book was one of those books where you either love it or hate it. Me? I was closer to loving it then hating it. Actually I pretty much LOVED it, except for a few things that bothered me, but I'll get to those later.When I first started Prep, I really didn't know what to expect. So I was kind of surprised by what happened in the novel, and not necessarily in a bad way. Lee was one of those girls who always felt left out, who thought she wasn't ugly nor pretty, smart nor dumb. So when she came to boarding school, I, well, I pitied Lee as a character. She was always so negative and didn't know how lucky she were. She was, shall I say, clueless. It was a bit annoying, but when I thought about, I think that it was necessary for Lee to be annoying in her character to fit the part in this novel. If that makes sense.Throughout Lee's time at Ault, she grew. She grew so much, it was crazy. Every time a new chapter started, which was not a lot of times considering there were eight chapters and 400 pages in the book, Lee had grown up immensely. And I loved to see Lee grow up, actually I loved to see any character grow up, like through a long period time, in any book. Which is probably why I love the Jessica Darling Series so much. Anyway, back to Prep.Sittenfeld's writing was close to impeccable. I really enjoyed her style of writing. Her writing made me think and it made me curious. I had no idea what would happen next. Something that bothered me was the ending, I was hoping for a little more, Lee was telling us what happened since she left Ault about everybody she ran into, but I really didn't know what happened to her. Also there were times in the novel when I got so frustrated with Lee were I just wanted to rip out the pages. but nonetheless, this was an excellent read that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep-a story of Lee Fiora a 14 year old from Indiana pursues and then attends a prestigious prep school. The story entertains with an insiders view of the microcosim of prep school, while Lee plows her way through class, gender, friendship, sex, and family issues. At times the angst in the book was stressful to me as the reader. When I finished I almost felt as if I come through a second adolesence. It jarrs your memory as to what you work through to become and adult."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is the story of a girl, Lee, on her journey through high school at a prep school, Ault.At first, I thought this book was great. Lee seemed funny and not a part of the crowd; I even related to her.However, as I devoured into the \\"story\\" more, these feelings faded. I realized Lee was self-centered yet self-hating, unintelligent, and most importantly, boring. She is the definition of a static character. If the author was trying to achieve this, well done. Lee makes a confusing revelation the last two lines of the book, which doesn't make up for the other 399 pages of learning absolutely nothing about herself. At first, I didn't even know it was the end of the book. I thought the next pages was an epilogue; no, the Sittenfeld's acknowledgments.During the first few chapters, I thought Lee was fresh out of high school, telling what she just experienced. Later she mentions college, so then I thought she was an undergrad. She then says she graduated and now has a job. By the end, I didn't know whether she was 30 or 60. Lee gives vague details about the time period, both when the story is taking place, and what age she's at now. Maybe the author left specifics out for interpretation, but to me, it just made reading the book more irritating. I didn't really care that Lee saw her brother's name tag when she was visiting home. I didn't care her roommate was the second boy who kissed and slept with her. I didn't care so-and-so got a nose job and is now a lawyer.The sex scenes in this book were horrifying. They weren't tasteful at all, and left nothing to the imagination. Some authors have the ability to make a love scene beautiful to read. Sittenfeld isn't one of them. The fact that Lee and Cross were even together baffles me. He never gave an explanation for wanting to be with her, and, as far as I can tell, there is none. Lee is so bland I wouldn't want to have a conversation with her, let alone have sex with her.Some reviewers are saying this book didn't have a plot. Now that I'm thinking about it, they're right. This book is Lee's memories of her four years at Ault. Why she would want to share them, I don't know. As I said before, she learns nothing about herself. She says at some point in the book that this was before she became \\"likable\\", and that she didn't become so until later in life. Why couldn't this be the story about how she became \\"likable\\"? Secondly, Lee doesn't even wrap everything up, and when she did, I was left unsatisfied. The last few pages provided explanations of what happened to Lee and everyone she dealt with. I wanted more than a paragraph description of how everyone looks, where they went to college and their occupation.This may just annoy me, but I hated when Lee said something to the effect of, \\"Want to know what happened to everyone else?\\" That really made me want to close this book and throw it out the window. This is a novel, not a commercial.Yes, there were a few moments of actual enjoyment, and parts where I thought Lee was going to have an epiphany about herself and the world she lives in. That never happened, however, but that's the second star.Overall, the title says it all: not worth it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I really don't understand how this book became so popular. I found it tedious, boring, predictable. The supposed \\"insights\\" that other reviewers have referred to I just didn't find interesting. It was unnecessarily long and made use of cringe-inducing cliches about being a teenager not to mention racist stereotypes (the poor, inarticulate black kid with hair like pubic hair; the person whose unattractiveness was explained as being due to the fact that they were Jewish with a big nose) that served no useful purpose (such as to point out the racism in such schools or subvert these stereotypes). The dialogue was far from clever as others have said. It was hackneyed and superficial. The characters had no depth or complexity. Yawn. Depressing that this is what you have to write to be a successful writer.I have given this review two stars rather than one star for the sheer stamina that the writer has shown in not only staying awake to write such a boring book but for being able to write such a long book in the bargain."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Walking through the typical young adult section of a bookstore, there are usually five, maybe even ten, books about a teenage girl, perhaps from a small town, who transfers from that wee little town to a prep school.Typically, this prep school is in Connecticut, or Massachusetts. Typically, the girl starts out struggling, tries to fit in with the popular crowd, misses her hometown, faces many moral problems, and meets a handsome, promising young prep school boy who shows her the ways of love. Seeing the plot of Curtis Sittenfeld's PREP for the first time, a normal reader would write it off as being another clich&eacute; prep school book.There's where they'd be wrong.PREP is a searing, creative look at the life of one small-town girl, Lee Fiora, who comes from her home in South Bend, Indiana, to Ault, a prep school in Massachusetts. Exposed to many new kinds of ideas and people, Lee stands on the thin line between misery and naivety as she explores all that her new life has to offer.Sittenfeld writes about teen angst in a way that doesn't try to make it seem petty or unimportant; she embraces it, and fully understands it. This is what sets the book apart from many other titles. Wallowing in loneliness and heartbreak, the reader feels as if Lee is actually a part of them, and that they are experiencing all of the awkward and horrible events that are occurring in the story.Lee acts as an opposite-gender Holden Caulfield, the main male character in J.D. Salinger's classic novelThe Catcher in the Rye. She takes everything with a grain of salt and a little bit of dry humor while making wise observations well beyond her years. PREP is bound to become a classic, for its brutally honest interpretation of a time that plagues all of us: high school.Reviewed by: Amanda Dissinger"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book takes you into the world of prep schools, unlike any other book.Lee Fiora is a young girl from the Midwest, and through a scholarship she is able to enter Ault a very fancy prep school in New England. As she battles her way through academics, sports and a social life. Always feeling likes she's on the outside looking in, Lee makes it through Ault, with a litle grace and dignity and with memories of a heartbreaking four years in a world only the select few understand.From someone who attends a prep school, this book was like looking in at my own life. There were many similarites between Ault and my school and gave me a view of prep schols that was differnt then my own."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Siitenfeld has captured so many of the nuances of high school life: the insecurity, the self-doubt, the struggle to find others one feels comfortable with, the perpetual embarrassment, the conflicts with parents, the academic difficulties, and of course, the failed relationships. This book was different from other coming-of-age novels in that it was actually a page-turner filled with unexpected twists and turns. There were parts that I found somewhat cheesy, but overall, I really identified and understood this often-flawed protagonist Lee Fiora. I was rooting for her, even when she made the wrong decisions and said the wrong things. I should warn some readers, though: This book definitely takes a turn in the last 130 pages or so, and becomes pretty explicit and inappropriate for young readers. Parents should preview this book before recommending it for high school age girls, because without some guidance, I think the last part of the book -- which does have some valuable lessons to teach girls in particular -- could be misunderstood by young readers as something that people SHOULD do rather, rather than something which they should not. Adolescence is complicated, and unfortunately, we often learn lessons after we've made mistakes. Sittenfeld articulates this quite well, and I commend her efforts on this one. Although flawed at times, this novel does prove to be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I love this book. First of all, it's amazingly smooth and accessible, without the stain of pulp fiction or trash. This is not a throwaway book or a summer, pool side guilty pleasure. It's a dense, thought-provoking work.The story is told from the perspective of Lee Fiora, who is narrating this coming-of-age book with remarkable clarity and honesty from her safe perch in adulthood. It begins with Lee as a 14-year-old Indiana girl who has gone behind her back to get accepted with financial aid into a Massachusetts boarding school. Her parents reluctantly drop her off, and her life will never be the same.This is a painful and awkward tale, and Lee is an astute observer if an unremarkable member of the student body. At Ault School, students fit in if they are wealthy and beautiful. Lee is neither, and she spends her time at school as an outsider.Outsiders, however, make the best narrators because they really see the intricacies of the others around them. Lee describes the popular girl, Aspeth, and her roommate's intense obsession with her. She witnesses the dynamics between the popular and rich boys, the rich Mexican girls versus the scholarship Mexican girls, the sexuality of her peers, the confidence that some students exude and others seek to find.Lee herself is awkward. Since starting boarding school, she seems to be unable to cope with her classwork. She has trouble making friends. She is so matter-of-fact that she is exasperating to everyone: her teachers, her roommates, her parents.The book covers her four years at school and has a fairly linear plot line that works well, because Lee is such a fascinating character with such honest and specific memories. The only aspect of the story that failed for me was reaction to a New York Times interview that Lee gave her senior year. This exact story line made up a very compelling episode of Beverly Hills, 90210, and it seemed derivative and beneath the author to repeat it here.I read this book quickly, and it often gave me that painful feeling you get when seeing someone embarrass themselves on TV or on stage. I identified so strongly with Lee when she was making her mistakes, and this is truly a book of an adolescent's mistakes.The nostalgia of this novel had an interesting additional twist for me. When I was the age of Lee in this book, I just adored books with prep school characters. A Separate Peace, Catcher in the Rye, some other girls' book where the main character obsessed about Katherine Hepburn. This book felt like stepping into a time warp for me on multiple levels.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is willing to face their own awkward youth, who likes a great and easy read, and who is interested in social themes like adolescent sexuality, class privilege and the development and breakdown of relationships."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is amazing in its insight and sensitivity to this odd little private boarding school world. A lot of heart, and dead-on in its characterizations, this is a fun read with a reflective side."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The official title of this book is called: 'Prep: A Novel'. She can't be serious can she?First of, this book is hardly a story. It has no plot line, before anybody gets on my back about how this is contemporary novel, blah de dah, I'm just saying what I feel. This book, to me, is like a diary that has been stolen from a depressed girl that has to make up fantasies to cheer herself up.After reading this book twice (to make sure I've actually read the book correctly) I'm still wondering if the book was a fake. I wondered if someone had taken out the actual book contents and then replaced it with their own, badly written version instead.I actually hated the writer after I read this book, because I felt that she had wasted my time and money. What was the point of this book, can anybody tell me? Now I know why this book was stuffed in the smallest corner of the bookstore."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is entertaining and certainly struck some chords of emotional memory in me as I read it, but overall it left me wondering whatever prompted the New York Times to name this one of the 5 best fiction books of 2005. True, author Curtis Sittenfeld is often dead-on with her characterizations of adolescent angst. For instance, take this hilarious line from a scene where the heroine, Lee, is talking with her prep school guidance counselor: \\"Don't worry,\\" [Mrs. Stanchak] said. \\"Don't worry about me. What I want you to think about is you.\\" It occurred to me to tell her that I did little else.And that one line sums up both the assets and the liabilities of this book. The entire plot focuses on the private insecurities of Lee and the continuing thoughts of inadequacy that obsess her. While I might recognize that sort of preoccupation from my own adolescent past, I did not find reading about it for 400+ pages all that rewarding.As the above quotation illustrates, at times Lee seems to have appreciated the humor of her situation, but these moments occur far too rarely. Beyond that, Lee never seems to actually learn any lessons from her experiences at the Ault School, much less apply them to her life going forward. The overall effect of this is just depressing, with no deeper meaning that can be derived from the gloom and doom of Lee's life. Call me traditional, but if I am going to read one of the \\"five best novels of the year,\\" I expect to come away with something to think about afterwards.Perhaps my real complaint is with the NY Times and if Prep had not been so glorified I might have given it another star here on Amazon. It is entertaining and it is a quick read, if not quite a page-turner. But if you are looking for a novel with genuine substance, this isn't it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm not quite sure how I feel about this book. First of all, I really don't understand why it garnered so much attention. The story itself seemed rather pedestrian and overall predictable. The characters, including or perhaps especially, its narrator were not endearing or even likable. It felt like reading an edited version of someone's high school diary, and considering the diary I kept in high school, I just don't think this qualifies it as an accomplishment worthy of all its high reviews.I will say that it is meticulously detailed. With the 1980s time period, nothing stood out as particularly anachronistic either. The book gave these details a lot of space, and added to the long chapters and constant internalization, all in all felt bogged down and downright boring at times. There were, however, a few scenes that did stand out in a positive light and without those few glimpses of something that actually felt real, I would not have been able to finish it.In the end, however, I never cared about any of the characters. I couldn't connect to any of them - and since I used to be a teenage girl, this was particularly surprising. Perhaps my dislike has to do with questions of audience, but if that's the case, then I really don't know who this book is supposed to appeal to.Part of my disappointment from this book does come from the fact that it was so highly recommended to me. And after finishing it, I am almost scared to start the discussion about just what it was that they found so appealing. Opening a book with high expectations can be a dangerous thing, and maybe I would have liked it more if I hadn't been so excited to read it. But, really, I don't think I would have finished it otherwise."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This was a great story, until the end, and that is simply an expression of what I like in a story. I picked this book up at a book kiosk in the Newark airport and read straight through until I landed back home on left (west) coast, and then I wanted to sit in the parking garage and read it until I was done. I was right there with Lee Fiora the whole way, I liked her, I felt for her, I was rooting for her. But. . .there is always a but, . . . as the book moved toward the end I knew there would be no real triumph, that the author was going to leave us with regret and unrequited longings.Sittenfeld writes very well and the story moves along well. I met her at a book signing in Oct 2006 and asked what, if anything, was left 'on the cutting room floor'. She indicated that her editor asked her to cut quite a bit, the figures elude me but it might have been on the order of 30 to 50 manuscript pages. I mention this only because it would NOT have changed the end. Lee was going to wander off into the future with baggage.I recommend this book, but not if you are looking for an uplifting story, not if you are looking for personal triumph. It is a good look at a small slice of the human condition, but happy endings it doesn't have. Sittenfeld has addressed this in numerous interviews. Personally I would love to see Lee in another story . . . I'd love to see her encounter the main character from my book ('The Poison Pen of Aberdeen Prep', see below), I think they would get along.The Poison Pen of Aberdeen Prep: A small rebellion against law and good will."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"What makes this book special is the author's ability to bring readers back to that insecurity, angst, and melodrama that ruled our emotions in high school. Yes, Lee Fiora was whiny and self-absorbed, but these emotions are authentic for someone of her age -- and particularly authentic for a teenage girl who finds herself in a prep school where she feels conspicuously out of place and having to study, eat, sleep, and even go to chapel with these students with whom she feels little connection.The mistakes Lee makes along the way are painful to read. So many times I wished she'd been wiser and chose another direction, but again, these are typical of mistakes teenagers make, and even Lee acknowledges this in hindsight.This book won't change society, and readers looking for another \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" may need to look elsewhere. However, Lee's insight and self-absorption do echo those of Holden Caulfield from time to time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The character had so much depth and I loved being on the inside of her world through the writers never ending descritpion of Lee's thoughts. It captured the highschool years-all the fears, insecurities and ridiculous situations-very poingnantly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Being a boarding school child myself, I was amazed at how accurate her portrayal of the experience was. I picked up the book thinking, \\"No one really knows what boarding school is like,\\" but she did a great job of picking up on the feelings that occur while going through such a unique experience. I felt like at times she jumped inside my head and wrote the book from my experience! You are right, this is not much like private school, but boarding school... it is right on. Good book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"For me, I went to a privite school my whole life and this year '06 my friend decided to go to boarding school so she picked up this book and read it in a day (she is not a very fast or aved reader)and recommened it. Only this summer did I read it. I thought it was an AMAZING book. This book I think tells the truth about the high school life and is not just another book where the author is trying to figure out what the teenager is like. This book tells of the confusion of cruchs and high school and being an outcast. I think this book is one of my favorites yet."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While I picked up this book not sure if it would live up to Tom Wolfe's massive \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\", after only a few pages I could tell that this novel would meet, if not exceed, my love of Wolfe's college chronical.Sittenfeld's characters were recognizable to me (who is a 21 year old female college student), but not too predictable. While many (older, I presume) readers have found \\"Prep\\" to be too full of stereotypical teenagers, I found the novel to ring true to life.Curtis Sittenfeld managaes a to pull off a great stunt, that of entering a whiny, moody, teenage girl's mind and making her a believable and interesting protagonist.As a coming of age story, this novel ranks high on my list. To adults who disliked the characters, all I can say is that people like those in this book certainly exist and maybe this book can give you some insight into the next generation."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is the story of Lee Fiora, a middle-class girl from South Bend, Indiana, whose father sells mattresses and whose mother is a bookkeeper. Lee looks at glossy leaflets of boarding schools and decides to apply and seek out an adventure rather than attend her local publlic high school. When she gets a 75% tuition scholarship to Ault, a prestigious prep school outside of Boston, she convinves her parents to let her go. However, the decision may not have been the wisest choice, and she forms a bit of a love/hate relationship with her new school.The book follows Lee's four years at school, where she realizes that she is an outsider at Ault, and does nothing to change that status. Her parents are not rich, nor is she remarkable among the scholarship students (most are althletes, minorities or both). She makes few friends but still has many interesting interactions with others on campus. Her Freshman year is highlighted with Lee's attemps at adjustment- trying to figure out who to align herself with, making and losing the friendship of an oil baron's daughter, and developing her first crushes (male and female). Her sophomore year, Lee becomes a bit of a celebrity on campus, as she realizes she is talented at cutting hair, and cuts students' hair for them in an attempt to be liked. She also clashes with a rookie English teacher desparate to get Lee involved. Her junior year, Lee deals with almost failing math, a friend's attempted suicide as well as her \\"coming out,\\" and forms a frienship with a \\"townie\\" that makes her ashamed. There is also a heart-breaking parents' weekend experience where Lee is caught between love for her family and embaressment they they are not rich. Her senior year, Lee deals with graduation and college looming, her first casual sex with the boy she has loved for 4 years. Then at the very end, her continued attemps not to be noticed backfire, and she becomes rather infamous on campus.The prose in this book will hit most people close to home. I felt like Sittenfeld was inside my own head when I was a high-school, her descriptions of a teenager's though process are THAT dead-on. Sittenfeld is a very gifted writer, shifting back and forth between Lee's reflections later in her life with her present-sense impressions of her days at Ault. It is true that Lee is a bit judgmental of others, considering she is an outsider, and sometimes her worrying and obsessing get tiresome, but then again, that is just part of being a self-conscious teenager. I highly recommend this book as a read or a listen, it is a fun debut from a talented author (who lived the experience). I look forward to her next book!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This novel reads like a memoir - an extremely detailed memoir. I would venture to say I've never read a book quite like Prep. Sittenfeld did a terrific job bringing even minor characters to life. Although I didn't really bond with Lee, I could relate to her feeling as an outsider at my LMC high school (I'd never heard that phrase abbreviated and used like that before this book). And while Lee was a snob of the worst order (and not in an every-teenager-is-a-snob way), I wouldn't put myself in that category, not even when I was that age, so there was that also which prevented me from really relating to the character.I probably felt the most sympathy toward her parents. The realization that their daughter was someone who was embarassed and ashamed of her family to her core would be something very difficult to come to grips with. This quality in Lee, which she seemed to have no apologies for, showed a shallowness and vanity that would be hard to swallow. Her parents, especially her dad, weren't perfect, but they supported her and honored the wishes of a very young girl. Not sure exactly what she offered back to them, if anything, except for overt disdainment.About halfway through the book, the minutae became slightly tedious, and by 3/4 through, I was ready to be done with it. Lee was getting on my nerves. Quite frankly I am not sure how she didn't get on her OWN nerves - a more exhausting character I have not met.This book is a 4 star novel despite my criticisms, because it was highly readable, even during the tedious moments, and Sittenfeld is clearly a gifted writer."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"i really liked this book. i couldnt put it down and over a period of a few days finished it. It is intriguing, and there has always been a part of me that has enjoyed reading about boarding schools (back from my own child hood days) but the different emotions Lee, the main charcter goes through, is a great read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" is a young woman's journey through the world of high society. Her fears of being mid-western and middle class are soon gone when she realizes that she is no different from her classmates who are rich. But I felt that the separation from her family made her not only independent but in some ways rude and disrespectful towards her parents. Prep describes in detail life in boarding school like early morning chapel, afternoon sporting matches, formal dinners and curfew. After Prep you will still wonder whether or not the main character truly enjoyed her time at Ault."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, even though some of the chapters were a little too long. I really liked how readers are shown a bit of the future, which helps to satisfy that, \\"What happens next?\\" obsession that at least I have.Overall, the book was entertaining and a quick read. While it didn't address the ideas of race, etc as described on the jacket and the climax comes rather late in the story, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is not a great novel that will leave its readers searching for meanings and understanding more about life than they did before reading it. That said, it is a stroll back into the teen years when all of us experienced - some more than others - the complexitiies, insecurities and awkwardness of high school. Shallowness and self-absorption are the constant companions of both males and females at this age.I think that Curtis Sittenfeld did a great job of portraying this age group. Am I the only one who remembers being embarassed by my parents and siblings, judging everyone by the clothes they wore and hoping to be noticed by that one special person of the opposite sex? There is both poignancy and disbelief when I look back, but I don't think I would be the person I like today when I look in the mirror if I hadn't paid my dues as a teenager.I credit Curtis Sittenfeld with knowing her subject matter - prep school adds one more layer to the teenage angst. I enjoyed reading it and cringed a bit when I recalled myself at that age."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora is bright, lonely and frustrated. She has the idea that boarding school offers something better than the usual, and will raise her life above the mundane. Ault School looks good in the brochure, so off she goes with scholarship in hand. Once there, though the academics are more challenging the social intercourse is, well it's still high school and petty rules the day. In one scene Lee describes a student fascination with saying, \\"Therein lies the paradox.\\" It became a kind of catchphrase they began using a lot. Lee says: \\"But the expression was so common that I pretty much stopped noticing, and once - not at Ault but at home over the summer, when my mother asked me how I planned to finish making the chocolate chip cookie dough when it turned out we were out of eggs - I even heard myself say it. Of course, that really hadn't been much of a paradox at all; I'd solved it by walking two houses down to borrow from the Orschmidts.).\\" Another scene tells of students passing around a rating form for scoring the way someone looks, the way they're dressed, in this case a teacher. When Lee gets the form, \\". . . I let the piece of paper sit untouched on my lap, like a napkin. But the truth was, I felt cornered by it. Yes, there were things I didn't like about Ms. Moray, but they had little to do with her clothes.\\" But then she succumbs: \\". . . I set my pen against the piece of paper and, over the three empty boxes that awaited my ratings, wrote, \`All overshadowed by the pin - a real dazzler!' Before I could think more about it, I passedthe paper back to Dede.\\"At Ault Lee is not only lonely and frustrated, but also disappointed and feeling trapped. None of these feelings are unique to adolescence but they are often new to an adolescent and Lee is a person who feels deeply. She begins to slip into a precarious funk. It's a terrible catch - a paradox: She is bright enough to know when things are stupid and wrong but not educated enough to know how to express it. Neither her more savant roommate Martha, nor her zealous teacher Ms. Moray can shake it out of her. Lee is becoming an increasingly shallow person and beginning to hate herself. Lee continues to fall when a popular boy, Cross Sugarman, takes a sexual interest in her. Lee is thrilled. Her grades start to improve. Lee has found a kind of equilibrium. But the relationship is clandestine and they agree to keep it that way. She craves for everyone to know but she can't be the one who tells or her fragile sense of distinction is ruined: Another paradox.Sittenfeld weaves paradox after paradox with great insight this portrait of naivete. She is a subtle writer and this is a very smart book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is probably the saddest book I have ever read. It was beautifully written, and I loved the unpredictability of it. Mousy, self-conscious heroine does not morph into pretty and popular by sheer force of will.High school is one of those parts of life that can still sting decades later. Lee starts out as a cipher and remains one. We never know what color her eyes or hair are, is she tall, short, thin, fat? We never even know what she turned out to be when she grew up."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld has written an impressive first novel. She has taken what could have been an ordinary coming-of-age novel and turned it into an introspective look at a not-so-typical adolescence.Yet while I enjoyed the book immensely, I was disappointed at how depressing it was. This girl, Lee, was living the life she thought she wanted, yet she was miserable. She could have left the school and moved home, where she might have felt less out-of-place; she could have made more of an effort where she was. But instead, she chose to dwell in misery.Yes, there are teens who are depressed, who have issues. But couldn't Lee have tried a little harder? She had one true friend, and I suspect she could have had others -- yes, some of the girls were not worth her time, but they weren't all such snobs. And she didn't need to completely demoralize herself with her phony \\"relationship\\" with her crush.Yet, for all these issues, this is why I found the book so compelling. The story and the way it is told give a real glmpse into a different sort of teen angst. The world of prep schools and the wealthy in a way you've never seen it before; the book is worth a peek."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"In any society, there are outsiders, people who do not fit in. The protagonist is an outsider who very much wants to fit in to her prep school, to an extent which is self defeating. As a consequence, she leads a dull life. She is observant, but not especially insightful. From such unpromising material, Sittenfeld fashions a novel which is almost a page turner, thanks to the quality of the writing. Sittenfeld manages to make simple events compelling.One interesting technical point is that while the novel begins with the protagonist/narrator in the present tense, as the book progresses the narrator sometimes become the protagonist as an adult reflecting back. This is done seamlessly, and provides the reader with a direct experience of the younger personality, while also providing more perspective and hints at the adult she becomes.A loose end: the journalist distorted to some extent what Lee said (I reread to check). Certainly, I would expect Lee to point this out."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"When I read this book, I was about two and a half years out of prep school myself. I was hesitant about reading it precisely because of its title. I was skeptical about what kind of light Sittenfeld would shed upon my own experience in boarding school... but when I started reading the book, I simply couldn't put it down. There were of course aspects of boarding school life that were all too familiar, but also much more.She touches upon a very critical time in life that is high school. You either loved it or you hated it, and even if you are somewhere in between, you're probably still intrigued by it. The experiences that Lee Fiora has are unquestionably not entirely fictive, and Sittenfeld does a very effective job of relaying her own experiences with painful honesty through Lee. There was a lot of pain and drama as there was for all of us, and the quirky people that Lee comes across throughout her time at prep school make the book come alive in quite a brilliant, unusual way.I absolutely recommend this book to people of all ages and whether or not familiar or completely foreign to boarding school life. This coming of age story is one to remember."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was hard to read because I never developed a liking for the characters. The main character was as awkward when she graduated as when she was a freshman. The story read like one humiliating and uncomfortable scene after another, with no real closure or progress."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As I started reading this book, it felt as if the author had been in my head while I was going through high school (not a prep school, but private and prestigious nonetheless). I couldn't believe how every second guess, every self-conscious thought, and every indecisive moment Lee experienced was identical to my own. And as I continued reading, so continued the anxious anticipation of Lee, as if she were waiting for some outside force to intervene and magically make her everything she wasn't. Again, so similar to the inner turmoil I went through in high school. The farther along I got in the book, the more I hoped and wished that Lee would do what I hadn't been able to do at the time: come to some self-realizations and grow and change. But she didn't.I invested my time in Lee for 400 pages and from the first page to the last, there was nil to show for it. No character development, no plot points uncovered or resolved, no fulfillment. I'd already lived through it once; this time I wanted a happier ending (it didn't need to be sunshine and puppies, but I would have liked some character growth). But instead, the ending seemed disjointed and almost rebelliously thrown in, as if the author wished to thumb her nose at convention. Instead of growth or even simple stagnation, there was an out-of-character regression. Lee became self-destructive where she had been apathetic and uncertain; the story had turned into a tragedy where it had once been just drama. The quick and cataclysmic annihilation of Lee's life at Ault made me feel a little bitter for sticking it out the whole book.Lee's voice is an unparalleled representation of teenage angst and the book, based solely on hearing this oft-ignored perspective, achieves that fantastically. But as a story, I never got the point of why it was bothering to be told if nothing ended up happening and nothing changed.In the book, Lee mentions something along the lines of how if she had finished Ault a week earlier, she would have finished with pleasant nostalgia. My suggestion for readers is to take Lee's advice and stop reading about 3/4ths of the way through because the only \\"growth\\" that occurred (positive or otherwise) happened in the last 50 pages or so and it was unsubstantiated by the previous 350 pages of setup."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This novel was fantastic! In fact, it turned me into a pretty unproductive person for about a week. For anyone who didn't love high school, this will bring you back in time. Even if you loved high school, the characters/issues addressed are so powerful and vivid that you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"My 10 year high school reunion is quickly approaching, and although I didn't attend a prep school like \\"Prep's\\" Lee Fiora, I was definitely one of the poorest kids amongst my friends who's parents were doctors, lawyers and professors. I can definitely relate to the shame of not having enough. Although I've mostly grown out of it, most kids don't---just look at our nation's credit card debt. We are victims of \\"keeping up with the Jones'\\" syndrome.First off the quality of the writing is excellent. Very dense and detailed--but detailed in all the right places. It's obviously a book about teenagers for adults. Although there isn't much for plot and Lee Fiora, the main character, isn't too likeable as a character, she's selfish (like all teens, yes ALL) and makes some BAD decisions based on serious insecurities. She has her good moments--her experiences resonate with my own as a teen.I don't know how this book sits with teens-they may be too close to the source to really get it. But as an adult approaching a 10 year reunion in June--I thought it was excellent."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Although I am an avid reader, I rarely write book reviews. After reading the book, Prep, I feel obliged to share my opinion. This book is excellent. As the other reviewers wrote, Prep is an honest look at the tumultuous teenage years. At times I laughed out loud, whereas other times I cried. Throughout, I was totally engaged in this page-turner. Although most readers will not be able to relate to Lee's experience at a prep school, everyone will be able to relate to some aspect relating to her emotions, her confusions, her insecurities, her joys, her obsessions, and her pain. Be warned, as I was reading Prep, I found myself remembering events from my adolescence that I had forgotten-this was not always pleasant. Sittenfeld accomplished what many of the best authors strive for: she created a character that is fully human, painfully honest, and easily recognizable."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"What would you do if you were a girl from Indiana who attends a boarding school in Massachusetts filled with teenagers that you don't get along with? At Ault School, Lee Fiora struggles to keep up her grades, make friends and get a boyfriend. Curtis Sittenfeld is able to make you feel exactly what Lee feels throughout this present-day novel. Lee goes through four years at Ault with her best friend, Martha, and attempts to get others to like her. She figures out a lot about the Ault students by the time she is a senior and is more confident. I think the novel shows that people shouldn't care about what others think of them, but they should try to do the best that they can do. I think that this fictional novel was entertaining and easy to read. It mostly appeals to girls in high school because it talks about what people think a boarding school would be like. I felt sorry for Lee because she always tried to fit in but never could. Overall I think that Prep was an excellent novel that high school girls can relate to in some way."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is a coming-of-age story about a girl named Lee and her four years at Ault, an elite boarding school that she's attending through scholarship. In other words, it's chick-lit. Chick-lit books tend to be light, engrossing, fast reads, which Prep certainly is. This book doesn't have any type of message (or at least I didn't catch one); the protagonist doesn't have a grand epiphany and in fact hardly changes from start to finish.What makes this book more superior than most chick-lit books is that the author writes very stylistically. She's clean and quick and provides tons of details with humor and honesty. With that honesty, the author accurately captures teenage angst, melodrama, and shallowness. Still, Catcher in the Rye does the same thing only much more deeply. Catcher is a book that can be read over and over again with new things, new ideas, new meanings jumping out each time; Prep is a book that you can read once during an airplane flight and never feel the need to pick up ever again. But who says that being a teenager necessarily needs to be a deep experience?"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"If you take the time to read this book, and get yourself past the \\"this is a high school story\\" mindset, you will realize that \\"Prep\\" is actually a very thought provoking and intriguing novel, not just about a young girl's experience at a rather isolated boarding school. Prep induces a sense of truth into all of us. I seriously doubt that anyone has ever NOT been left out at some point in their life, and if not actually left out, feeling left out. Let's face it- I bet if Lee delved into the mind of Aspeth or another \\"popular\\" girl, she would realize not just the cliche \\"no one is perfect\\" but that everyone is at some point out of place and insecure and uncomfortable..some people are just better at hiding it than others...Lee's problem throughout this whole book is that she's overly conscious of herself and she allows that self-consciousness beat her before she gives herself a chance to win.It's frustrating in the end, that Lee never takes control of the situation which is sort of ironic and unexpected given that she took control in order to put herself at Ault (at 13 for that matter), so the go getter is in her, but I just didn't understand why that characteristic fails to reappear through the novel. It's unfortunate if anything, I wanted her to finally unapologetically own what's hers.Lastly, the ease with which Lee comments on the subtleties of the world she lives in is astonishing. If for nothing else, this book is good for articulating what we might think, but don't say-- what I mean here is how she defines situations like \\"my mother was so awkward!\\" and how Lee observes social situations and nuances like how one girl had a plastic lighter for her ciggys and somehow it wasn't \\"tacky\\". And how Aspeth was a girl \\"rock songs were written about\\". It's all so clever.So, 3.5 stars for creativity and great articulation, but it left me rather uninspired. It's like you're cheering for Lee the whole time, she loses and it's not a down to the wire thing...it's a prolonged 8 chapter loss...so you feel like you lost for a long time. And it took me 3 months to read this because I read a few books at once...so now i feel like I lost for 3 months..goshdarn that makes me a huge loser haha."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm thinking that maybe I'm just not the intended audience for this book. Then again, as a coming-of-age book, I figured hey, I've come of age, maybe I'll identify. Hmmmm....no.First of all, I find the premise unbelievable. A thirteen year old girl decides - ON HER OWN - to apply to boarding schools all around the country, without the suggestion or even much support from her parents. I get that she wants to leave her awkward family and hometown of South Bend, Indiana, but I don't know any thirteen year old kids who would initiate a nation-wide search for boarding schools, go through the application process, then miraculously get awarded a scholarship to pay for 75% of the $20,000/yr tuition. Most young teenagers I know who want distance from their family and boring hometown would just whine and act sullen and plug back into their iPod.And then when Lee (the main character) gets to the boarding school, where's all the pluck she exhibited in deciding to move from Indiana to Massachusettes in the first place? None of it carries over? She explains that she is overwhelmed by the reality of the school - she tells about seeing the actual students she had seen in the school's brochures and feeling star-struck. She notes the absolute difference between Midwestern and East Coast life. She recognizes the gulf of differences between her own family/economic background, and those of the students who aren't \\"on scholarship.\\" Still, I kept waiting for her to snap out of it. Suck it up. And she does, in some brief scenes - but mostly she seems to be so full of angst and melancholy that I could hardly stand it. You chose this sister, now deal with it!One other unbelievable aspect of the book - Lee suddenly, without anyone ever showing her how, in her mid-teens - learns to cut hair expertly. Everyone on campus comes to her for their \`dos. It's amazing. The author uses this newfound skill as a plot device for Lee to become close (but with no fear of rejection) to the people she can't ordinarily even talk to on campus. It's sort of an interesting idea, but again - unbelievable - and it goes nowhere fast.I found the other characters in the book very one-dimensional. They all had their roles to play, and they stuck pretty close to their assignments. I felt like I was watching an episode of Dawson's Creek, which I didn't even watch when it was on the air. I didn't care about these kids. You know how I can tell? I don't even remember most of their names, and I just read this book last night. And I have never much cared for reading about teens having sex. And there's a LOT of that in the last quarter of the book, so steer very clear if you're like me in that respect.Judging by the advance praise on the back jacket of this book, I think I'm outside the norm in my review of this book. People are just gushing about this debut novel! Comparing the main character to Holden Caulfield, the writer to Joan Didion. The prose apparently rings like a \\"brilliant documentary\\" of teenage life. I am dumbfounded, but then again, I suppose I'm back to my original hypothesis - I'm just not the kind of audience this book seems to be looking for."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thought this book would detail Lee's growth through from an insecure freshman to a self-confident and self-respecting young woman by the time she graduates. Unfortunately, the main character remains a shallow, insipid shell of a human being to the very last page. There is no personal growth nor a resolution to her maddening self-confidence issues, and the book drags to a conclusion. It is wrought with stereotypes without containing any meaningful commentary; the reader is simply supposed to accept that the one black girl in the story steals, and that the main character would have been afraid to talk to a certain beautiful (Hispanic) classmate \\"if she had been white\\". Reading the interactions between the main character and a boy she's involved with are nothing short of painful, as the sex scenes are degrading to the point of being revolting. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and regret the time I took to read it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book made me want to scream. I simply can not fathom why it has won so many accolades from such prestigious sources. Not only are all the characters one-dimensional and underdeveloped, Lee, the protagonist, is a whiney, self-centered, self-pitying brat. Further, the book perpetuates all the bad stereotypes of prep school (they're filled with snotty beautiful rich kids who don't have anything to do with scholarship students, except possibly use them for their own purposes). All minority students are also stereotyped and/or portrayed in a negative light. I went to boarding school at one of the most prestigious schools in the country, and did not find this to be the case at all. Sure, there were a lot of wealthy students, but they didn't ostracize those on scholarship or financial aid (of whom there were many). Perhaps I was not the most popular girl in the class (although full-tuition!), but I easily found my own group of close friends (to whom I remain close, thirteen years after graduation), and we had our own fun. I find it hard to believe that Lee could not do the same if she stopped her navel-gazing. Perhaps if she stopped feeling sorry for herself, she might have found some kindred spirits other than Martha (who was so bland, she was almost as annoying as Lee). I also was left with the question of why didn't she transfer if she was so miserable? If the novel is a roman a clef, as most first novels are, I can't imagine that Groton, the author's alma mater, was as horrible as the light in which she portrays it - I know several Groton graduates, and none are horrible people. I only finished the book in the hopes that it would somehow turn around and improve. No such luck. For a more realistic (not to mention more engaging) look at life inside a boarding school, read Tobias Wolff's \\"Old School.\\""},{"Title":"Prep","review":"At first I loved this novel, expecting the main character to really develop and blossom and to learn more about what is actually happening in her life rather than the inane thoughts that run through her head. The story was rather boring and I found myself wanting to learn more about the other characters than about her, I wish the writer had done this book from the perspective of anyone else but the person she actually chose. This girl made herself awkward and brought herself down more than any other character. I also agree with the person who pointed out how the author attempted to promote every given stereotype, the Jewish girl who has to get a nose job, the token black that does the Uncle Tom skit, the Asian girl with the \\"weird\\" food and the Hispanic girls with bad makeup and clothes. A true waste of potential."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Let me just say right off the bat that I go an elite - perhaps the most elite, depending on who you ask - boarding school, and I'm middle class, non-white, and not particularly tall, thin or gorgeous. Yet, I have friends! While certainly not the most popular girl in my grade, I get along with everyone and enjoy school immensely.Yet, according to Prep, someone of my status and stature should be an outcast, a loner, a social pariah. Someone like Lee Fiora, the book's utterly charmless \\"heroine.\\" She is somehow incapable of being friendly when other people greet her, and spends all of her time lusting after a boy for four - count 'em, four - years, all of which culminates into several visually disturbing, unnecessarily graphic sex scenes. I don't know if the author was trying to be hip or what, but seeing something like that spring up on you after pages and pages of slogging through muck is a little frustrating. Oh, and guess what Lee discovers at the end; the boy is Jewish! Which leads me up to my next point: how racist this book is.It was stated once that \\"racism doesn't exist [at Ault, her school]\\", yet the author contradicts herself repeatedly. There's the Asian girl who can never seem to get the hang of English, even after four years at an institution like Ault. Funny, isn't it? There are the lone black people who get there on sports scholarships, one from the Bronx and another who gets expelled for stealing, of all things. And apparently, only the really geeky boys ever go out with girls of color. That alone just makes me want to vomit.Morever, Prep is simply boring. The writing itself is quite well-done, but instead of being treated to a thoughtful, insightful novel on teenage angstiness, we get Lee's insipid comments on the world shoved down our throats. It's as if Sittenfield is trying to tell us something, but that grain of wisdom has been lost in this sad attempt at literature."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora, an outstanding grammar school student in South Bend, Indiana, receives a scholarship to attend the prominent Ault School, a boarding school in Massachusetts. For the majority of students at Ault money is not an issue. As Lee learns, it is an issue that is simply not discussed among her fellow students. Lee is unsettled by the fact that she is no longer the outstanding student she was in Indiana. Prep is written in such an intimate style that you feel what Lee feels during her four years at Ault. Chapters are semester length so you get an in-depth view of Lee, her friends, and boarding school culture. Lee's struggles never end in trying to become comfortable at Ault, finding friends, maintaining her grades and seeking a boyfriend. Lee does give you a glimpse of their lives into the future. This novel gives us all something to relate to, the people and feelings we have known throughout our lives"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is undeniably well-written. But a novel also needs interesting characters and intriguing plot development. I found that \\"Prep\\" lacked both. There are literally places in the book where you can skip several pages and not miss a single important story point. Above in one of the editorial reviews it is noted that the narrator, Lee, \\"sees herself as 'one of the mild, boring, peripheral girls' among her privileged classmates.\\" She is indeed that. I don't read novels to read about mild, boring, peripheral characters. With all the undeserved comparisons to Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" being made, I'd suggest reading that instead."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfield is inarguably a talented writer -- she is no hack. But I find it hard to believe that not once during the process of writing this book did she ever think that maybe her lead character, Lee, was too one-dimesnional. I echo other reviewers when I say that Lee is boring and spiritless and fails to have one insightful revelation or make one positive change in her four year stint at Ault. But moreover, the girl is so painfully morbid it borderlines insitutional (and not in the \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" or \\"Bell Jar\\" kind of way!). Guilt, anxiety, paranoia, self-hate, petulence, apathy...more apathy... and did I mention apathy? UGH! It's like that annoying, depressed, needy friend, who always calls you with the same sob story. After a while, you just stop answering the phone. I wish I would have had the fortitude to put the book down, to hang-up on Lee's whiny ramblings as it were, but I honestly had the false hope that she would grow up a little and find some redeeming qualities. I was painfully disappointed to find out she never did. Don't waste your time. Even the sex scenes don't articulate the kind of elation one feels when being seduced for the first time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm surprised to read so much ambivalence or criticism about this book. I thought it captured the inner life of those teenage years EXACTLY right. Those times are well behind me and I had forgotten how it felt until reading this book...it was honest in a way that I never could be at the time. I think I was expecting a more superficial or trite, entertaining read and instead it was honest, deep, funny and wise. I liked the character Lee very much and I think she taught me to forgive myself a little. It (life, growing up, etc.)is hard for everyone...that's a good thing to remember."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I really loved Lee Fiora. So many people seemed to hate her, and that's fine, but I feel like Lee was so complex, in a way that many characters aren't. You just couldn't pin her down. The author somehow managed to convey this really beautiful neurosis, that was so beautiful because it was so un-extraordinary. Lee herself was so unextraordinary--she wasn't the neurotic freak, or the miserably asocial nerd, or the popular girl, or the intellectual. She wasn't a type, and yet she was so easy for me to relate to. The way she overthought every little gesture and word and emotion and behavior--yes, it was self-absorbed but not in an irritating way. In a human way. In a way that we all are when we're teenagers, and still are to some extent as adults. Lee was so disappointed by her inability to find what she wanted, and the thing is, she didn't even really want that much, she didn't want anything that grand, and yet she still couldn't find it in reality. It was heartbreaking and it felt so true.So, I loved this book. And I loved Lee. And I didn't think it should be compared to Catcher In the Rye. Catcher is a masculine story, about what it's like to be a boy coming of age. This was about girls, and the ways they put boys at the center of their universes and how crushingly dissapointing that can be. It was just so good, if ya ask me."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was really good, though more than once i had to look back at a previous chapter to figure out what was going on. there are some mature topics in here, but overall a good read!!!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I loved this book. It was so honest and accurate in displaying the insecure actions and feelings of the main character -- especially her attitude toward sex and love. I really admired the way the writer would dig for the deepest, scariest, weirdest feelings of the heroine instead of simply choosing the most amusing ones.Sittenfeld managed the storytelling in such an efficient, consistent manner that you never felt that the prose was excessive or that you were hearing too much of the author's voice. I can't wait to share my copy of this book with friends."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am -completely- in love with this book.Lee Fiora, leaves South Bend, Indian and begins her time at Ault School, a boarding school in Massachusetts, feeling lonely, and out of place. She is plagued by the idea that some one will find out just how awkward she is, and how much she stares and studies her fellow classmates. She loves to look through old year books, study the student directory, and observe. Her life intertwines with the popular, the dorky, and other students who are on the fridges of Ault life. She is plagued by work, crushes, social hierarchy, and dealing with her family and the person she has become and wants to be. Through the novel we watch, and become attached to Lee as some of her relationships grow, and some crumble. We observe others as she does, and befriend them. There are tales of her roommates, classmates, professors and tutors. This novel flows through her years and the institution, capping in a flood of emotions as everything comes to a peak. Although this moment provided a climax, I was some what disappointed. Not due to the story, or writing, but just because of what happened. I wished for something better, wished for the ending of the perfect fairy tale, but as a reader honestly satisfied more by things did end. This book captures the voice, of an adolescence, of Lee in a honest, fresh, unbelievable way so one may become amerced in her world. Ending this book comes with a sense of sadness, for one is uncertain just where her life ended up, and one cannot reach her, a dear friend, again. We grew with her, so where is she now?This book speaks of the issues of being a teenager, of boarding school, hierarchy, class systems, of the breaking point and what's beyond. It is a fabulous read. I was desperate not to rush through it, to enjoy the story, the amazing occasional one liners, and the tale of Lee Fiora. The second I was finished I was tempted to pick it up again and start it all over, but didn't for fear it'd be too soon, and I didn't want to lose that \\"man that was a good book\\" kind of feeling."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Every year, as the season changes to summer, I switch from non-fiction to novels. This year's summer sleeper does not disappoint. \\"Prep\\" is a beautifully written account of the life of a middle-class scholarship student from South Bend, Indiana at \\"Ault,\\" a New England prep school remarkably similar to Groton. Lee Fiora, in perhaps her last act of ambition, applied to various boarding schools and convinced her mattress-salesman father and bookkeeper mother to allow her to head East. Lee goes from being an outstanding student at South Bend public schools to a mediocre student at Ault. Embarrassed by her background (and by her family itself, particularly in a memorable section on \\"Parents Weekend\\"), Lee's insecurity hampers her from truly being a part of Ault. Lee secretly pines for one of the class stars, but doubts that she is the sort whom he would ever want to marry.Sittenfeld asks us to question whether schools like Ault, while clearly providing an excellent education, are really the best place for teenagers. The insularity of these schools, coupled with the wealth of most of the students, leads to a narrowness of outlook. I came away believing that Lee Fiora would probably have been better served by the fictitious \\"Marvin Thompson High School,\\" where she would have been a star student and involved in school activities -- and would have undoubtedly wound up at the very same university she ultimately attended.Before picking up \\"Prep,\\" I wondered if it would resonate with one who attended (30 years ago) an overcrowded New York City public high school. The truth is that you need not have been a prep school student to understand or relate to this book. Every high school is its own miniature web of intrigue, with tangled relationships, ins and outs, the cool and the nerds, and a hierarchy of status which vanishes after the graduates go their separate ways. Boarding school no doubt exaggerates the hothouse atmosphere, but even prep school graduates are likely to agree with Lee Fiora that \\"as more and more years passed . . . the time I had known any of my classmates, would feel decreasingly significant; eventually, it would be only a backdrop to our real lives.\\"Curtis Sittenfeld's debut novel is engaging and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The first half of this book was so good, that I was dismayed when I finished the other half. The author established Lee as a typical unsure-of-herself teenager settling in at a posh boarding school on the East Coast. She was afraid of being, as a scholarship student, shunned. I found myself relating to many of the things that Lee had to deal with, at least for the most part. However, as the novel progressed, I began to lose empathy for Lee. She turned shallow and seemed to have an anti-social disorder. Towards the very end, certain acts of hers led me to see her as a complete pushover. The author may have been trying to portray Lee as a typical teenager. I as a teenager, seemed utterly confused by Lee's bizarre behaviors. She never wanted to get involved with anything, and she wanted to be miserable all the time; yet, she still expected people to like her. In addition to this, all the characters and teachers at the school seemed so superficial, like they all had personality disorders. If this is what expensive boarding schools are really like, then thank goodness for public education."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I have to say that I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be a fun, fluffy, and dramatic read about a teenager's life at an All American Boarding High School, but it turned out to be a boring book about a girl with low self-esteem, who is always on the outside looking in. You may think that Lee Flora might sound interesting based on reading what I had to say so far, but stay tunned.She is down on herself and only sees the negative in life. She never tries to make her life better or more interesting.I do not know any actual real person who acts the way she does. Not even my shyest friend acts like her. My shyest friend knows how to have a good time and takes her life by the wheel.I get that she doesn't have her driver's ID, but many people do not have driver IDs and they live life just fine and no one critsizes anyone for it. I mean, come on!This book was purely pathetic and all the sexual, errotic parts are described like sex is supposed to be embarrassing and ackward. I'm sorry, but I don't think sex is either of those two things, even if you are a teenager. Sex is normal and intimate and this author is making it out to be an ackward, unrewarding affair. If sex was like this, no one would do it.I get that Lee is ackward and weird and everything, but come on! I'm weird! Its a good, glorious thing to be different and unique.I did not like this book and the whole 400 pages was a total waste of my time. You could put down the whole book to 100 pgs to read all the important readable parts. Its sad that the good readable parts are mostly sexual in context, but hey! The author did not put much effort into this book except at those tims and even then, she didn't do it very well.All I have to say is WORST BOOK EVER 1ST PRIZE! Seriously though, I so hate myself for reading this. Reading this made me embarrassed and ackward about how the author thinks she's so great and all those people who wrote those good reviews.I don't even know what year the book takes place, but it has to be in the 90s or something, because there is no way that in the 21st century were teenage girls still wearing shin length skirts, peter pan collars, and long sweaters. I mean come on! Totally out of the fashion loop.Yes, I found many problems with this book, the whole book is a problem to me, but don't let me deter you. Read it yourself and I will look forward to reading your bad review thats positive to warn others about it.The only good thing. I am one more book closer to my reading goal!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I wanted to read this on my Kindle but why would I pay $11.99 to read it on my Kindle when I can buy the book on Prime for $9.73/Paperback and $3.50/hardcover + free shipping?

I am required to write 12 more words, so this is twelve."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thought this book offered an interesting and certainly thought provoking insight into the human mind and the way we see the world and perceive our own roles in society. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"You know why Charlie Brown works?Wait, no - you KNOW why Charlie Brown works. He's anxious and nervous and a frequent failure, but the little guy just doesn't quit. It doesn't matter how many footballs he misses or baseball games he loses or kites he sacrifices to the kite-eating tree - he's always got another try in him.Lee Fiora fits about half that bill. She's anxious and nervous and a frequent failure, but the great majority of this book is about her trying to work up the nerve to go for the football even once. 400 pages is a long time to spend with a person like that.Still, this isn't an easy book to give 3 stars for. For one thing, Ms. Sittenfeld has a judo-grip on her prose, and I am sincerely, profoundly jealous of her laser-sharp observations on human nature. For another, this is another of those books where you don't have to read the bio flap to be scintillatingly certain that the author is writing from a place of crystal-lucid, painful personal experience. Her credentials stand out on every page.I was also powerfully interested in the way she structured the book. At first, you crack it open and are more than a little surprised to find that a 400-page novel has only eight chapters. It gets less surprising when you discover that each chapter is essentially a semi-independent short story: \\"here's the time I almost got kicked out of school for failing math,\\" or \\"here's the time I had epic drama when my parents came to visit.\\" There's not really a central plot driving the story forward; it's mostly just a Series of Unflattering Events, stretched out over four years. To me, that's a brave and intriguing approach; what made it fall flat was that Lee seemed to change at a positively glacial pace over those four years. It was hard going around the middle of the book, when the pattern had been established and it became monstrously difficult not to roll my eyes and think, \\"ah, what will prompt the paroxysm of awkwardness THIS time?\\" (I might just be old and jaded, though - I remember feeling that chest-gripping fear that Ms. Sittenfeld describes so astutely, but for me it always centered around the idea that maybe my parents had just died in a horrific accident and I was even now living my last moments of unsuspecting happiness before the phone rang and shattered me completely. I do not recall ever getting worked up over a dance, a game, or a boy.)What I can't get over, though, and what ultimately tore my suspension of disbelief, is that Lee has all the constantly overclocked inner-life of a truly anxious person... but none of the passion that goes along with it. There's no talent or hobby or ambition she escapes to, no bigger goal in her solitude than reading magazines, eating crackers, or sometimes reading magazines while eating crackers. This is the one part of the book that I can't believe is autobiographical: any person who won Seventeen's fiction contest at the age of 16 (as the back flap informs me that Ms. Sittenfeld did) must have a powerful knack for writing, a whole boatload of practice, and enough enthusiasm to literally win her the blue-ribbon prize. In depriving her fictional avatar of some equivalent focus, it seems like she's scooped out a huge portion of Lee's character that would have helped to sustain her (and us!) through all her trials and failures.With that said, this is a first novel, with all the winding, meandering, years-long rewriting that that entails. And I have every hope that Ms. Sittenfeld's future books will fill in that one missing piece - Charlie Brown's kite, his dog, his pencil-pal, his baseball team, anything worth braving failure - so that she can wrap her five-star prose around an equally stellar person."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'll be the first to admit that for about the first half of this book I struggled to keep reading. Lee's lack of self-esteem was so frustrating to read about over and over again - couldn't she just do ONE thing where she wasn't wondering about what people thought of her? Then I realized that the old saying was true: \\"The things that annoy you about other people are the things that annoy you about yourself.\\" The more I read, the more I realized that Lee's thoughts and actions closely resembled mine from my first 2 1/2 years away at college. Like Lee, I was a well-adjusted teen before leaving home, but what I perceived to be the scrutiny of those at my small college in large part stilled my spirit. I struggled to make friends, I worried about saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way. I wouldn't even eat in the cafeteria by myself until my senior year! Lee's encounters with Cross were even harder for me to read, as I allowed more than one guy to string me along and use me. Lee's final scene with Cross, and the final words she speaks to him, resonated with me - I read that paragraph more than a few times, and wished I could have hugged Lee for finally sticking up for herself.Luckily, I had my epiphany my junior year - the epiphany that another reviewer rightly says is missing for Lee - and it allowed me to have a wonderful senior year with some amazing friends. But the wounds will always be a bit raw, especially when reading something like this that makes it all so fresh again. Sittenfeld is SPOT ON with her description of teen angst, and while perhaps it can seem a little overpowering in the novel, given that it's constant, I remember exactly how constant that angst can actually be. With age and hindsight you sadly realize that nearly all of it was in your head, and it could have been so different... The redemption in the book is that Lee, at 25, realized this, but also realized it was what it was and couldn't be changed.I finished this book 4 days ago and keep thinking about it, wanting to talk to somebody about it, re-reading parts of it. I borrowed it from a friend, but feel I'll have to go buy my own copy, as it needs a place on the shelf next to other books that have touched me so profoundly.This was a difficult book for me to read, emotionally. But well worth it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I found Curtis Sittenfeld's debut novel, Prep a tremendously compelling read. I actually read the whole novel in a 24 hour period, and couldn't put it down.Lee Fiora was a fascinating main character, full of flaws and totally relatable as a teenage girl. By choosing to go to prep school, rather than remaining in her public high school where she would have been a very big fish, Lee radically changed her life and spent the next four years trying to catch up with her decision, trying to become the girl that she dreamed she could be. Lee struggles with self-esteem, snobbery (her own and others), idealized notions of romance and sex, and the realization that the world is bigger than herself and her family. She is not always the nicest girl, but her story is fascinating.For me, Prep was more than a novel - it was almost a time machine, as well. Lee's escapades took me back to my own college experience, which was at a very small school very similar to Ault. I could relate to so many of the things that Lee went through. The author has really captured the angst and ambivalence, as well as the growing sense of identity and self, that define so many teenage girls."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"For all of those saying the protagonist was a \\"snob\\"... Welcome to boarding school. This was one of the most realistic portrayals of my high school (prep school) experience that I have ever read. Lee wasn't a \\"snob\\", she was a product of her environment and a teenager trying desperately to fit in.I am a Midwestern girl from an affluent town who decided to go \\"Out East\\" to a world I had only read about. Visits can not give you the truth of New England. How could they? New Englanders don't share that much with their own family, none to less perfect strangers or tourists. While some of our readers are having trouble getting past the names of towns (those of you from South Bend, you know the demographics of your town and you know they are diverse... Diversification does not exist in the world of prep school. The only diversification that is artificial.), I found all of the analogies and stories true to form and accurate from my experiences.I would not say that everybody is going to understand the way that dorm funk smells, or the shepherd's pie tasted (always on Thursday, as it was an amalgamation of left-overs from the week smothered in gravy and covered in mashed potatoes), or remember the tears streaming down your face walking to the infirmary for a \\"sick\\" day because you just couldn't take it anymore. Not everybody will understand the extreme emotions of a 14 year old living away from their parents and in a vacuum of adolescents without the unconditional kindness to lean on. But, for those who are willing to listen and learn this book is it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Yes, the protagonist was unlikeable. But aren't most teenagers? Aren't most teenagers eager to be popular, attractive and sucessful? Aren't most teenagers lazy with a sense of entitlement? Aren't most teenagers unexceptional?Lee wants to be special, but she's not. She's not pretty, not brilliant, not a good athlete, not rich. So she's pretty much O for four in her version of the world. For some reason she's put herself in an environment where she's even less special (relatively) and she's stuck dealing with the consequences. Most of her whining is internal, so I can't fault her too much for that. There are a few references to her being \\"special\\" and occasionally she seems witty. I suspect the author relates strongly to her and maybe forgot to include some concrete examples of Lee's spark because she's either still exceptionally insecure or she didn't want to seem like she was bragging? Also - since the character of Lee narrates the book, maybe it would be out of character for insecure Lee to toot her own horn?It was very entertaining, but I agree with the reviews that comment on Lee's lack of appeal."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"PREP, the debut novel by Curtis Sittenfeld, chronicles the life of Lee Fiora, native of South Bend, Indiana, during the four years she spends at Ault, a prestigious boarding school in Boston, on the East Coast. Because Lee is a scholarship student--a fact which is obvious to her classmates--she doesn't quite fit in with the children of oil tycoons and senators. During her four years at Ault, Lee experiences things that are typical of most high school girls: a crush on the most popular boy in school, friendships made and broken, problems with teachers and grades, feelings of inferiority and displaced anger, a separation from parents...in a nutshell, Lee comes of age (and most of us know how difficult that is). Lee has no characteristics that distinguish her from her classmates; she sees herself as boring and periphery. Her emotions are heightened; small words and actions become heightened, too, so Lee is prone to overanalyzing everything: \\"I felt strongly about everything--not just my interactions with people, their posture or their inflections, but also the physical world, the smell of the wind, the overhead lights in the math wing, the precise volume of the radio in the bathroom if it was playing while I brushed my teeth. Everything in the world I liked or disliked, wanted more or less of, wanted to end or continue.\\" PREP, written from a first-person point-of-view, chronicles Lee's long, difficult journey to self-discovery.So, did I like the book? I've put off writing this review for two days, trying to answer that question. Although some reviewers here seem to have found Lee shallow, self-absorbed, and monotonously whiny, I'm not sure how inaccurate Sittenfeld's portrayal of teenage girls is. I found Lee to be a very real character, someone I alternately rooted for and swore at. Her trials, yes, seem petty--but I remember being a teenager, thinking that my life would be over if my crush didn't look at me in geometry. I remember feelings of inadequacy; I recall being embarrassed by something my parents said or did in front of my friends. These, I think--correct me if I'm wrong--are universal feelings, and Sittenfeld does a brilliant job of honing in on life in a teenage girl's skin. So, if this is the measure by which I should judge the book--I liked it.But, on the other hand, these same praises of the novel are also its faults. PREP is what it is--a coming of age story--and not much else. The plot meanders, often skipping back and forth in time junctures that confused me. Nothing really HAPPENS to Lee in the book, other than that she grows up, and maybe learns a little bit about herself along the way. There is no climax; there is no real POINT to the book. Yes, maybe more sensitive readers could see it as a social commentary on class differences--but I just saw it as a testimony to adolescent angst. Lee would have experienced the things she did anywhere, in a run-down public school or in an expensive boarding academy--it's just part of growing up.What kept me reading--besides a mild curiosity to know how Lee was going to turn out--was Sittenfeld's absolutely stunning narrative voice. The prose in this book is truly special, and some of Sittenfeld's observations are so simply written but yet are so profound. The writing was seamless. I'll be curious to see what she writes next--hopefully something with a little more plot and a little less teen drama."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I love the concept of a middle class girl attending a high-priced boarding school so I probably would have been pleased with any novel that explored this topic. However, Curtis Sittenfeld's portrayal of a slightly awkward teenage girl is incredibly adept and well done. She captures all the mixed emotions that come with teenage girls while exploring the school's complicated social hierarchy. Ms. Sittenfeld's differing perspectives on each year of Lee's high school experience vary and allow the reader to see how Lee matures through high school yet still holds on to her expectations and self consciousness. This is real literature."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I went to a prep school and in many respects this story is the story of my life. But there are a lot of themes running through this book that students from public schools can relate to as well. Being a teen-ager is a very awkward time in ones life and this comes through in this book. Wanting to fit in and be part of \\"THE\\" crowd is stressed in this book. Not fitting in is howw I felt but probably everyone can relate."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was difficult to read for a few reasons. At times, the narrator, Lee, makes observations about her prep school surroundings, or describes an uncomfortable situation, that we can all painfully relate to. She reminded me of a part of myself that I would rather not be reminded of. At other times, she is just downright pathetic. Her insecurity borders on the pathological, she has no real personality, and she is introverted to such an extreme that after a while you, as the reader, completely lose touch with her. There were moments when I wanted to slap her on the head and tell her to \\"snap out of it!\\" I think she is trying to paint herself as the poor, misunderstood misfit. But in this case, still waters most definitely do not run deep.I didn't find this book slow or boring, it was actually fairly easy to get through. I just realized throughout the course of the book that I really disliked the narrator. Some of her traits were just inexcusable, and others reflected the darker side of all of us, but virtually none of her traits were positive or redeeming in any way."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Everything you think you know about prep schools is right. And everything you think you know about prep schools is wrong. Lee Fiora from South Bend, Indiana, is a scholarship student at Ault School in Massachusetts, having made the choice and written the application by herself at age thirteen. The story begins with her arrival and ends with the post-graduation parties four years later, and it's apparent that during all that time, she really hasn't changed much. For most of her time at Ault, she's acutely anxious and slightly unhappy, completely unsure of herself, appallingly naive about most things (especially boys), and totally lacking in self-esteem. She doesn't make many friends, though she isn't really the absolute outsider she believes herself to be -- as becomes clear when she has to interact with non-Ault people. She never attends a dance, never gets elected to anything, but she's a very shrewd observer and we see the preppy life through her eyes. I really don't understand why so many of the major review media trashed this book. It's not going to win awards, but it's a far cry from the chirpy, optimistic feel-good froth the title would suggest -- but it's also a long way from the drugged-out, promiscuous expos&eacute; it could have been. In a sad way -- recognizable to all those who didn't fit in in high school, public or private -- it's a very true book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I won't describe the plot here, look to other reviews for the general outlines. I will just say I'm a little confused by the reviews that judge the book solely on the basis of their agreement or disagreement with the main character's moral choices in life. That's not how you approach literature.As a boarding school graduate, I can confirm that this book is highly accurate- one of the most realistic books I've ever read, reminiscent, as another reviewer put it, of Tom Perrotta.Finally, there is a female coming of age book, which also raises interesting questions of class and gender in America. I think some of the reviewers' problems with Prep stem from the fact that they don't understand how boarding school works- the hair-cutting thing, for example, was completely believable-in addition, it could have been anything- it's a metaphor for something, which obviously sailed over those people's heads.If the book focused only on the contrast between Indiana and New England attitudes (as some suggested it should have), it would have had the tone of a dry, sociological tome. Those issues are touched on impressionistically, which is much truer to the way they would be perceived as part of the life of a teenager.Also, the book's not completely autobiographical. For example, Sittenfeld comes from a wealthy family, and attended private school for elementary and middle school, as did her three siblings. Her father is an investment banker.I am just grateful that the long overdue, truly masterful female coming-of-age novel has finally appeared. And yes, of course the novel is not necessarily plot-driven. It's not a murder mystery. The plot is much more subtle- it cover's a girl's coming of age. Apparently that's not interesting enough for some readers.I was completely engrossed in this book, as was my husband. Probably the best book I've read in the past 5 years, and I'm a voracious reader."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Let me first admit that \\"Prep\\" was far from perfect. I'm not sure I could argue against many of the bad reviews. At times, I longed for the novel to hurry along. The foreshadowing was clunky. Occasionally I was so bored I wasn't sure I could get through the entire novel.And then (heavy sigh), Sittenfeld did what I hadn't imagined anyone could do. She made me relive the most painful experiences of high school with such honesty that it was hard to believe that she wrote the book as an adult. I was astonished that she was able to remember exactly how many of these situations felt with such vividness and sincerity. Suddenly, with crushing intensity, I remembered how maddeningly frustrated I would become with my parents, how ill at ease I would feel in the presence of a beautiful, popular girl, or how devastated I was over bad crush. The magic of \\"Prep\\" is that none of this ever becomes a clich&eacute;. Sittenfeld doesn't reduce the experiences or simplify them, the way most shows, novels, and movies about high school do. She doesn't take the abilities and desires of an adult and try to stuff them into teenage bodies. Sittenfeld is able to portray that inconsequential events have the weight of lead during adolescence. And, most amazingly, Sittenfeld does this without trying to make everything better--to make the protagonist more self-aware or to balm over her misery.Rating the book with five stars is not a recommendation. The book made me feel awful. I cringed in discomfort, I felt humiliated over events I hadn't thought of in years, I had nightmares about high school boyfriends.But my heart raced when Lee felt a victory, and my stomach dropped when she experienced a defeat. How often, as a reader, can one truly say that they understood exactly how something felt?I feel embarrassed even saying this, but I felt that I had to give \\"Prep\\" five stars because, to not do so, I would be denying that it affected me in a meaningful way."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I identified with the main character in this book so much. Her awkwardness and her insecurities felt so familiar. I've been out of high school for almost 15 years but so many of my high school memories came flooding back - good and bad. It also made me realize that I needed to reconnect with some of my high school friends and make amends. After finishing this book, I've been recommending it to everyone. A woman that I work with said, \\"I could have been friends with Lee.\\" I completely feel the same way. I also recommended it to another co-worker's daughter and she loved it, so now she's coming to me for book recommendations.Curtis Sittenfeld really blew me away with her first novel, so much so that I immediately started searching for information on her second novel. I was so happy to find that \\"The Man of My Dreams\\" had been published three weeks prior and I immediately checked it out from the library. It's equally as good. If you like coming-of-age stories, \\"Prep\\" is a great one. When you finish it give yourself some time before you start \\"The Man of My Dreams\\" because you may be expecting it to be \\"Prep\\" which it's not, it is its own book and should be treated as such."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This novel has attracted a tremendous degree of attention in its hardback form, and should continue to do so in this paperback version. I became interested in it for several reasons, including the fact that the author was teaching here at St. Albans in Washington, one of the toniest male prep schools in the East, and I thought some insights into the world of prep schools might emerge. The story involves Lee, from middle class South Bend, Indiana, who manages to end up at an exclusive eastern prep school for her secondary education. The novel involves her initiation into the world of this elite institution, as she proceeds through adolescence. Lee faces many teenage crises along the way as her four years pass by. The question is, why would any of us who are not teenies want to spend our time reading about Lee's experiences? The answer is that Ms. Sittenfeld is truly a remarkable writer who rewards the reader constantly. Whether the scene is poignant, explosive (such as one breathtaking exchange between Lee and her father during her first \\"parents' weekend), mundane or whatever, the author is more than equal to the challenge. If anybody would have told me a 400 page book about a high school student coming of age would hold my attention throughout, I would have laughed at them. Yet it all seems to work thanks to the author's remarkable writing talent. To be sure, there are points when I had to ask myself \\"why am I reading this?\\", but I was soon engrossed once again. We can only await with the greatest expectation the author's next novel, a brief excerpt of which is included, to further enjoy this extraordinary talent."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Disguised as an update of the classic Owen Johnson prep school novel, this book makes more sense as a story of endurance. It has an ending, but not a happy ending. The protagonist lives through the novel, but she isn't really in a psychological state to learn much from what happens to her. She has courage that earns our respect. Think of this as a Russian prison novel where, after many years, the prisoner is released."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Let me start off by saying that I really enjoyed this book. It was worth every moment of my time. If any of you were ever young and in high school, or even middle school, once (I hope that is all of you) then you can somehow relate to this book in one way or another.Even though the book is about a teen girl, it certainly isn't written by one. And I mean that in a good way. Curtis Sittenfeld manages to capture the intimate thoughts and feelings of young Lee Fiora while sounding intelligent herself. You never feel that anything was dumbed down, the book was meant to be read by people of all ages.You get to explore a teen girl's thoughts on boys, friends, feeling left out, and so on. Curtis Sittenfeld is blunt, honest, and doesn't sugarcoat. She tells it how it is. Like I said, if you've been there, you know. O yes, high school can be brutal. (And just imagine if you had to live there 24/7)."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"My favorite part about this book was its ability to not have an 'epiphany' and to be painfully honest. We love the protagonist, we hate the protagonist but we always empathize with her. It's light yet painfully realistic so if you're looking for a happy ending or resolution, much like life, Curtis doesn't provide much of one. I thought it was brilliant. I was hooked and I'm someone who attention wanders very quickly."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Like the movie Napoleon Dynamite, Curtis Sittenfield's debute novel, Prep, can be a pleasant surprise. This is not to say that Prep is uproariously funny, but what might initially appear to be aimed toward a fairly shallow, teenage audience actually has edge, depth and a much broader appeal. You certainly do not have to have attended an elite prep school (which I didn't) or even to have lived on the East Coast (which I did) to appreciate the genuine angst, passion and poignancy of the story. Also, like Napoleon Dynamite, Prep both uses and disables stereotypes to enhance a story. Yes, there are moments of quasi-triteness (a scene, for instance, in which Aspeth, a wealthy, beautiful junior, attempts to use her influence on the protagonist to win an election), but for the most part, the characters are painted with a uniquely workable blend of realism and nostalgia.That is also not to say that Prep is precisely nostalgic. The fact that Curtis allows her protagonist to narrate the story from some point in the not-overly-distant future (perhaps her mid to late twenties) gives the story some depth and adds realism. Lee is neither entirely nostalgic (as say a narrator gazing back at her prep school days while safely ensconced in her autumn years might have been) nor overwhelmed by her present angst and anxiety (as a narrator in real-time might have been). Instead, Lee is allowed to examine her life at boarding school from the comparatively safe distance of her post college years - a time in which brutal self-examination of high school is both likely and honest. In that honesty, we come to trust her as a narrator. Lee displays her own shallowness, her tendencies toward snobbishness and her foolish, blatant worship of those she perceives as the being the school's elite. She is class conscious in the way that only high schoolers can be yet she speaks from a slight distance. Her tone suggests a dual reality: yes, this is truly the way things were but, no, she no longer harbors these feelings of angst and anxiety. Lee has grown past all of that and is not afraid to present the readers with her true self. And for that we like her.We may even relate to her. Be it the time period (the mid to late eighties, perhaps), her alienation (both real and self-imposed), her middle-class background, her awkwardness, attitude or something even more abstract, there is something very \\"real\\" about Lee Fiora. I could certainly relate to her and I rather imagine (whether they will admit it or not) that most readers will. Prep is not a perfect book, but it is a good, honest, well-written story that may come as a surprise to many readers."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"There are so many people who won't appreciate this book because it has no catchy plot to hook you (like Devil Wears Prada), and it's not a tattle-tale tell-all (Nanny Diaries) about an exclusive niche of people. It's merely an account of a young woman's adolescence and her observations. It's the sort of book only thoughtful and observant people will appreciate. Some of Sittenfeld's observations, while written simply, are absolutely stunning in their succinct appraisals of everyday situations. She puts into words thoughts that have crossed my mind so many times in my life, but I never would have thought to put into writing, let alone a novel. Sure, Lee, as a protagonist, is a bit irritating at times with her excessive insecurity, but if an average person were to write an honest account of all the the thoughts that ran through his or her head, anyone's self-absorption and paranoia would be comparable to Lee's. It's unfortunate that most American readers can't appreciate a book without a flashy hook."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Although Sittenfeld writes beautifully and does provide a convincing and somewhat poignant description of the highs and lows of high school, her book fell short of my expectations. Sittenfeld's debut novel contains no plotline and instead focuses on character development. I felt as though Sittenfeld aspired to convey some kind of deeper meaning in her work. Her work is not didactic, but rather, is annoyingly esoteric.The central protagonist - Lee, is a small-town girl from Indiana. Lee applies to and is accepted at an exclusive Eastern boarding school. Lee struggles to fit in - her four years at high school are torture. Sittenfeld sets up what should have been an interesting, although somewhat predicable scenario. Instead, Sittenfeld does not employ the usual conventions of teen fiction (there is no happy ending).'Prep' left me bored and unsatisfied. Where was the scandal? Where was the intrigue? Lee is cantakerous, disagreeable and anti-social, as a character she is pitiable. She whines and moans about her 'hopeless' situation for over four hundred pages. Only if you enjoy reading self-piting, woeful lamentations will you appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am truly surprised by some the reviews here. Of course we are all entitled to our own opinions but my experience of reading this book seems to have been completely different from those that put it down. The truth is that I barreled through this book--I couldn't put it down. I found it intensely sad and poignant and yet simple and truthful. I never attended boarding school but I did attend a private school in Manhattan and then went on to what was at times a very snobby college. If there is one thing I take exception to, it is when reviewers put down a book because the protagonist is not likeable or too whiny or judgemental or does immoral things. That's life! Lee Fiora completely lived and breathed for me in the pages of PREP. I can relate to that angst, to that not-fitting-in yet still-being-judgemental mentality. That's high school for you. We've all seen movies that portray high-school in this exaggerated, over-the-top way. PREP doesn't do that. Kids are cruel in high-school though, without a doubt and Ms. Sittenfeld draws a completely accurate picture of this. For me, Lee was never unlikeable. She mistreats her family and then feels horribly guilty, lusts after a boy who doesn't treat her right and yet she continues to want him, she says all the wrong things, she loses friends, gains a best friend and somewhere in all of that, she actually grows up a little. It is a subtle but noticeable change. I found this book to be heartbreaking in its honesty and also exhilirating and compelling. Ms. Sittenfeld is truly a talented writer."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book reminds me of \\"Joe College\\" by Tom Perrotta and \\"Old School\\" by Tobias Wolff with the same formula of working class outsider attends an elite school and learns life lessons en route to graduation. Unlike the protagonists in those books, however, \\"Prep's\\" Lee Fiora, manages to make more than just temporary connections with her classmates, and it is that which distinguishes the book from others with male protagonists.Much has been made by reviewers of the fact that the protagonist is a snob. So what. Many teenagers are judgmental and materialistic, regardless of class, and most are, at some point, intensely embarrassed by their parents. It's part of growing up. What a cop out it would be if Lee were the kind of Hollywood teen who in the end always does the right thing. It's refreshing to see an author create a first novel protagonist who clearly isn't some idealized version of herself.I just wish the author had prefaced each section with a date - it took me a needlessly long time to figure out when it was set. Characters used today's lingo (hook-up, etc.), but there were also elements specific to both the 80's and 90's. This was a bit jarring."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This was definitely one of the most engrossing novels I've read so far this year. PREP is the story of Lee, an insightful and eloquent (yet insecure) teen from Indiana. Remembering words her middle class father spoke years before (\\"these are the kinds of houses where they send their sons to boarding school\\"), she has made it her goal to attend an elite boarding school. And she achieves it-- with a scholarship. The story commences as Lee begins her first year at Ault (think Andover) and concludes as she graduates four years later.This was an Amazon recommendation since I read Tom Brown's Schooldays. And, it's similar-- a bit. Like Schooldays, History Boys, even Harry Potter, etc., the book follows the lives of several teens during their formative years. I'm not sure everyone would like it-- I'm not sure I'd recommend it to my husband, for instance, but it was indeed excellent. The author, Curtis Sittenfeld , really has the voice of a young insecure teen growing into a more confident, but never completely secure, young woman. Initiallly, I thought the author was a man and was completely taken aback-- how could a man actually know this girl so thoroughly? However, Curtis Sittenfeld is indeed a woman. And, the protagonist and her friends and classmates lives were exactly as I remembered my own life and those of my friends and classmates during high school. Truly, the authenticity the author brought to this book-- the dialogue, the events, the crushes, the friendships-- was uncanny.I've read the negative reviews here, but disagree with some of the reasoning. One reviewer, for instance, writes about how boring the sex scenes were. With all due respect, that reviewer missed the point-- of course the sex was boring and empty and that was the very purpose of writing about it. So much the narrator believed or hoped to be important was or turned out to be empty and insignificant (even while remaining a pivotal event in her own life).If you're female and if your own memories of high school are less than ideal, I completely recommend this book but also warn you to read this with caution. For me, this brought back memories I haven't even thought about in years. And, worse, it made some of those memories absolutely new-- as if they happened yesterday. Obsessions over insignificant events become magnified . . . analyzing and over-analyzing every response and comment from every person within your social circle. . . reading between the lines when the lines themselves are perfectly clear. . . accepting much less than you deserve. . . giving less to others than they deserve (or maybe worse-- giving more to others than warranted). . . Prep will make all these memories new again."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I have NEVER, EVER read a book where I related more to the main character than I did to Lee Fiora. A lot of critics say she doesn't properly reflect the high school experience--well, that's understandable, since there is no universal high school experience that everyone in the world can relate to. If you are someone with an introverted, self-conscious, overly-analytical, fearful, shy personality (like myself), then you will identify with Lee's experience. If not, then you probably won't understand why she acts the way she does.Like myself, Lee has a lot of severe social anxieties, and I'm sure it would only be compounded being one of the few \\"middle class\\" students at an elite prep school. I think her behavior is completely justified and absolutely realistic. Of course, there were scenes here and there where I thought I would have reacted differently than she did, but overall, there were so many occasions where I just thought to myself, \\"Oh my God, I can't believe there is someone else who thinks this way.\\" Just her little everyday observations and worries, and how almost all of her decisions are driven by the effect they will have on how others perceive her - all of those things are things I felt in high school, and still feel every day. I feel like Sittenfeld got inside my mind. Even the littlest moments in the book struck a chord with me: in one scene, Lee is in a dorm room with another girl (I think it's Sin-Jun, but I can't remember at the moment), and is enduring an awkward silence. She likes the girl's skirt, and wants to compliment her, but she just can't bring herself to say anything. She thinks to herself, \\"Sometimes speaking is just so hard.\\" I know exactly what she means.Even her obsession with Cross is totally spot-on. Who in high school doesn't pine for the hot, popular guy from afar? And then, when her crush is actually realized, she becomes even more obsessed - he's all she can think about. Again, what high school girl could deny having behaved the exact same way with the first guy who expressed interest in her?What I also liked about Lee is that she had a high school experience that wasn't all hearts and flowers. In fact, looking back on it, she doesn't necessarily feel that fondly towards it. I feel the same way - although it had a few great moments, high school wasn't that amazing for me. I wasn't one of the popular kids. I wasn't a complete outcast, but I was more like Lee - one of the peripheral, uninteresting girls. In fact, my 10-year reunion is coming up, and I don't think I even want to go.I could not get enough of this book - I devoured it. I was so sad to see it end. I felt sad and nostalgic and bittersweet when it was over. I would love to hear about more of Lee's experiences. She is the closest I've ever come to feeling like I was reading a book about myself.If you are nothing like Lee and think that a character like her would annoy you, maybe this book isn't for you. But if you feel that you possess any of her timid, insecure qualities--or are curious to get inside the brain of someone who does--then it's your duty to read this book NOW."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Much of your enjoyment of this novel depends on your tolerance level for the meticulous details of boarding school life and the obsessive expression of insecurities that accompanies the narrator at her age. Of course, the story of Lee's stay at a boarding school is recounted at a later stage of her life, which led me to wonder: &quot;How does she remember precisely how she felt in that exact moment, so many years ago?&quot;Whatever. This is a story of &quot;trying to fit&quot; or the search for acceptance, not only at the school, but with herself. Lee is a bundle of insecurities and often her self-loathing spirals into self-pity. This is all like real life, except that in fiction a reader may expect something less &quot;familiar&quot; or drab.The overall prose is excellent. You can't say the author writes badly, yet after so many hundred pages, I found myself growing tired of the main character and this is a bad thing. The main character in a book is like a friend; and I found Lee to be a little draining, after a while. I would still recommend this book, along with another novel often mentioned by reviewers, The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez. Ultimately, it's all a matter of taste, of liking a character, of tolerance levels regarding the subject matter, etc. However, I would still personally recommend reading either book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This coming-of-age story is told from the perspective of Lee Fiora, an Indiana resident who is awarded a scholarship at the prestigious Ault School, an East coast boarding institution. \\"Prep\\" chronicles Lee's four years at Ault and details the numerous experiences and heartaches that help shape her life.Author Curtis Sittenfeld has succeeded in writing a very adult book about something that nearly all readers will be able to relate to: high school. Being a teenager is not an easy experience for anyone, and all of us have our fair share of high school horror stories to go around. In Lee's case, the high school experience is even more challenging because she is thrown into a world where she is unbelievably out of place. Lee feels like an outcast at Ault: she's one of the few kids who are there on scholarship, and the other students come from very wealthy families. The money issue is one of several reasons why Lee is unable to fit in with her peers and really make her mark at Ault. She withdraws from her classmates and has a difficult time making friends. As Lee struggles to succeed at her new school, she finally forms a solid friendship with one girl, Martha, and has a huge crush on a fellow student, Cross Sugarman, who is a member of the \\"popular\\" crowd. Throughout her four years at Ault, Lee manages to learn a lot about relationships with other people and also a lot about the relationship she has with herself.Critics of this book complain that Lee is an annoying character because she's incredibly insecure and obsesses about everything all the time. Personally, those qualities just make her more endearing to me. The teenage years are rough, high school is brutal, and experiencing all of that in a strange environment where you have no contact with your family must be a thousand times worse than what the average kid has to deal with. Yes, Lee can be hurtful, selfish, and downright stupid at times...but she's a teenager, and most teenagers go through a phase when they're extremely moody and self-centered. That being the case, I don't think there's anything unusual about Lee. I think her best quality is her honesty. Lee recognizes positive traits and tragic flaws in every person she meets, including herself. It's very refreshing.I think the best thing about this book is that although the story is narrated by Lee and she is detailing her high school experiences, she is reflecting back on her time at Ault ten years after she graduated. \\"Prep\\" isn't a sappy story of teenage angst that belongs in the young adult section: it's a summary of Lee's boarding school experiences being told to the reader by Lee when she's in her late 20s. This isn't a book for teenagers; it's a story that was written for adults. I think most adults will be able to relate to Lee's experiences on many different levels, which is why I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I first read something by Curtis Sittenfeld in December when she wrote a hilarious article in the New York Times called, \\"you can't get a man with a pen.\\" I sent it around to my friends. I hate using the word fresh for writing, but there is something about her character in Prep that feels new. The character, like Sittenfeld's writing, is honest -- about insecurities, about powerful crushes, and about high-school life in general. This kind of honesty, when reporting the inane existence that is high school, is at turns exhilarating, excruciating, and just plain funny."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"...simply because I could relate to the character of \\"Lee\\" perfectly. She is so very much me. I have never read a book where the teenage girl characters acted or felt anything even close to what I felt in high school. This is actually what many of us do feel.Those of you who say she acts unrealistically and couldn't relate are obviously more like the \\"Aspeth\\" or \\"Martha\\" characters. Well adjusted teens who made their way through high school normally.\\"Lee\\" was always uncomfortable, always observing from afar and then living in her own head. There are many details in this book which have brought back painful memories for me. I had forgotten so many things. I remember being shocked to hear the most popular girl in school say dorky or nerdy things one day at lunch. I didn't think it was possible. I couldn't understand how people went out with each other and what they said to one another. I felt envy and wonder at people who always seemed to know what to say and do and \\"how to act\\".I never knew myself.I totally love this book, and I get it. If you don't, you don't. Maybe not getting this book is a good thing, it means you can't relate to being a shallow, self absorbed, judgemental lonely and scared human being like Lee, and like me. Life is probably a lot easier for you too.Anyway, it depressed me a lot because I too wasted all of my life not connecting with people. It really made me think and feel sad for myself, and for her.She did learn at the end though. Lee remarks that she never noticed how funny Dede was until she was older. Something like this is tragic and true. When you are living in that kind of crazy head space you fail to notice things like the very basics about other people's personalities, even your roomates. She knew she missed out on life.I really got into this book. Like I said it's the first teenage girl book I could 100% relate to in every way."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"My first impression of this book was that it was trite, formulaic, predictable, unintelligent, and unoriginal. And to be honest, much of the first 200 pages were just that. It read like a work of \\"young adult\\" fiction, the kind of book that would appeal to 14 year old girls but not to adults. I really felt betrayed by the reviews of the book that touted it's \\"eccentric wisdom\\" and compared it to Catcher in the Rye. Because to be honest, the first half of this book was really mediocre.But then something happened - it got, well, good. The characters became fuller, more complex, more human, and more original. And the world of this prep school started to get interesting in a smart and meaningful way. And that's when I realized that the first half of the book was trite and predictable on purpose, because that was the author's point - that a lot of the stereotypes about life at an elite east-coast boarding school are true. And when that message finally sunk in, the book started to get really good. The drama became heartfelt, the characters' dilemmas became sympathetic, and the story started to feel real. And by the end I have to admit that I was really loving this book. It still has its flaws, as any first novel does, but it's definitely an impressive debut performance. Sittenfeld has really captured an authentic portrait of a socio-economic as well as geographic clash. Her main character is a true outsider, and she dives deep into the psyche of a young, scared yet courageous girl struggling to find her place where she knows she does not fit in. It's about as honest and genuine as any reader could hope for."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is as if Curtis Sittenfeld held up a microscope to her high school experience and committed it all to sometimes horrifying memory. Parts of the book are so poignant that I had to stop and let them settle in before continuing. One of the most powerful aspects of the book is the central character, Lee. It's one of the most warts-and-all portrayals I've ever read. Lee's sexual insecurity, lack of self-worth, crush on Cross Sugarman, latent racism, and constant awareness of her relative poverty at the fictitious, prestigious, money-loaded Ault School are bravely and fully on display. The book is told with excruciating detail, including authentic prep-school kid dialogue and close observations. For example, Lee is fully aware of the difference between her bubbly self growing up (she won a pie contest in her hometown) and her quiet, watchful self at prep school, constantly monitoring her own behavior and observing others. The difficulty of balancing these two selves makes Parents' Weekend an especially wrenching experience for her."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld reminds the adult reader why many people opt on school reunion websites NOT to do high school all over again if given the opportunity (nevermind wanting to go back in time in order to play more sports, take life less seriously, study more, etc.).Curtis captures the self-absorption and insecurity of teen angst in such a way that the reader relives this uncomfortable phase of life along with Lee. I like that Sittenfeld (I don't know to what extent this book may be read as autobiographical or at least, semi-autobiographical) does not idealize Lee and use authorial revisionism (if it is in part autobiographical) to cast her in the best light. Lee can be a self-serving, insensitive jerk. She can also be sweet intermittenly. Like the rest of us, she's a mixed bag; however, it's apparent that high school was not her hour of self-actualization.This is not a feel-good book, but it is a brutally honest portrayal of an insecure teen. Lee's self-talk borders on paranoia, and she is constantly overanalyzing and overreaching in her perceptions and conclusions. She is not always a likable character, yet I never wavered from wishing her well and taking her part. The scene where her parents visit during her junior year is one of the most painful in the book. Lee was trying too hard to be one of the Ault students and had none too subtly let her parents know about her newfound sophistication. Her dad did not take kindly to this attitude. Later, this brutal scene would be rendered less awful (and almost humorously) in family folklore.As I wrote before, I appreciate Sittenfeld's honesty and her willingness to let this character be seen at her worst. High school wasn't the worst time in my life (although it was no bowl of cherries), but I'd definitely choose NOT to do it all over again if given the opportunity. Sittenfeld's \\"Prep\\" helps confirm this choice."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was a big disappointment to me, I figured I should definitely read it because of all the rave reviews. Well, I don't know what those reviewers were thinking. Although, yes, at times Sittenfeld did have good writing and some of her observations rang true, this book had no true, original insight or anything to say. It was cliched, overly long, and most of all, had an extremely unlikable protagonist that almost made the book impossible to read.Another reviewer said it was okay that Lee, the main character was flawed, and I agree that characters should be flawed, but no so much that you hate them. The fact that this was told in Lee's first-person narration made it even worse. Throughout the entire novel, Lee was whiny, overly insecure, unmotivated, materialistic, and shallow. She was a pushover and only cared about what other people thought of her. I thought that by the end of the novel, when Lee was a senior, she would mature and learn her lessons, but she never did. As someone who just finished high school, I saw Lee as incredibly immature. Her obsession with other peoples' opinions was equal to a thirteen year old's, and she didn't do anything to distinguish herself.All of the other characters were cliched and underdeveloped. I never really got a real grasp on them. It was also cliched that (of course) Lee would fall for the most popular guy in school, althoug I don't see why since Sittenfeld's portrayal of him made him totally unlikable. The way that Lee let him walk all over her was sickening, and again, she never truly learned her lesson. The sex scenes between them weren't sensual but rather they were overly detailed -- I almost felt like I was reading a dry anatomical guide.Perhaps this novel would have been better if Sittenfeld wrote in third person and focused on other characters as well, to distance us from Lee and to make it more interesting. Prep was also overly long, and since its chapters were episodic, maybe Sittenfeld should've made this a series of interconnected short stories so the reader could pick and choose as they pleased. Out of (I think) 6 chapters, I only really enjoyed 2 of them, although those would still only merit a rating of three out of five.However, none of these suggestion wouldn't have solved Sittenfeld's fundamental problems of unoriginality, lack of insight, and most of all, a thoroughly unlikable protagonist. If Sittenfeld based Lee on herself, I can't help but feel sorry for her. The author does have potential, and I hope that if she writes another novel she'll strive for more originality (and editing). If you still want to read this book, I would recommend that you read it with someone else so you can vent about the novel's, and Lee's, shortcomings with that person."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Well, I did manage to be interested enough to read the entire book, but when I was finished I wished that I would not have bothered. I was mad at the author, mad at the main character, mad at the people who gave this book good reviews, and mad in general. I wanted my 3 hours back. I'm over that anger now, but frustrated about stereotypes of the Midwest and the Northeast were prevalent in the book. I think that I would have rather read a fluffier book about a shallow, happy girl who learned something than this psuedo-philosophic girl. Save your time for something truly worth reading (like The Heart is a Lonely Hunter or The Secret Life of Bees.)"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is a great book! I admired the main character and found the book to be oodles of fun!Everyone should read this book! It's worth the money! The book cover is nice too!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Both are about small town girls gone to a more sophisticated place out of their element where they don't fit in. The difference between the two is that in Prep we are not expected to believe that any young girl could be as naive as Charlotte Simmons. Lee has just the right about of naivete and it doesn't drag on throughout the whole book regardless of her experiences."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"First, let me say that I was sucked in by the cover of the book so whomever was responsible, hats off to you! The other blunder I made was in seeing the author's name and assume that it was a guy who wrote it. This, it seemed, made the book most interesting, a guy writing about a girl in prep school. So I dove into the book with expectations that just were not met in any way. The only person I can see who would like this book is one who is akin to the lead character. She is a whiney and weak character who just gets more annoying as the book progresses. The only interesting part is when they discuss her furtive attempts at sex.I felt this book was a waste of time as it did nothing to leave the reader with any lingering thoughts. I was just annoyed that I had wasted my time on this book. If you are a teen girl you might enjoy this but that might be a stretch as well. There are better books out there to spend your time on."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was absolutely horrible. What did the author try to describe in this book? Was this book written to give a perspective of how minorities are treated in prep school? Or to simply entertain, giving readers things to relate to the main character? If it was the first reason, the author has completely messed up, and has written it without thought or reasearch. If it was the later, this book wasn't meant to be praised by so many readers.Personally, another reason why I hated this book so much was that it was impossible to track what time period this book was set in. How many teenagers listen to Bob Dylan these days? Do you actually think someone who owns shoe factories (I would have understood if it was a computer parts factory or a car manufacturing company) in Korea would be rich these days? What is this? The 70's?Not only that, but the book was slow moving as well. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"What a disappointment. This book was a mishmash of prep school cliches. The plot was thin, the main character not at all sypathetic or even interesting. Who wants to read about a high school girl who has so little self regard that she would allow the boy she \\"loves\\" to use her for sex while forbidding him to acknowledge her in public, and who cheats on exams to stay in school, with no repercussions? There were multiple mixed messages but it all boiled down to BORING and TRITE. I expected more from an author with the credentials of Ms. Sittenfeld but was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is a great example of an over-hyped mess. Kept me somewhat entertained, waiting for something to happen, but it never did and I completely forgot everything about the book within about an hour of finishing it. If you want to care for or feel empathy for the main character, skip Prep and try The Wonder Spot by Melissa Bank instead."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is single handedly the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of partially reading. I did not even get to page 50 and I threw it in the garbage! I don't know how people managed to finish this book! The protagonist is a huge bore from whom there is nothing to learn or be inspired from. From the other negative reviews I have read on here, it seems that she is that way to the end! I actually resent the author for creating her.I am positively shocked that there are other reviews comparing Lee to Holder Caulfeld!! Lee is to Holden Caulfeld as Faster Pussycat is to Bach!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld nails the pain of being an overly sensitive bordering on pathologically narcissistic adolescent girl, infatuated with an unexceptional randy teenage boy whose every move becomes the subject of endless fantasy and self-recrimination. In other words, almost any woman who still remembers high school (or perhaps more accurately junior high) will identify with this book. The question is whether you will really want to. Yes, it's impossible to put down. And the feat the author has accomplished is indeed admirable, even awe-inspiring. But does such legedemain really have the gravitas to sustain 416 pages? I especially found myself asking this question at the end when, George Eliot-like, Sittenfeld gives us the Victorian epilogue so that we know just what happened to each character later in life. Isn't the point that the narrator is overreacting to every little thing that took place in high school? And if that's the case, why should the reader care what \\"really\\" happened to these folks? At its best, this is a moving coming-of-age novel; at its worst, Sittenfeld seems to merge with her narrator and, more troubling, expect her audience to join in becoming unironically invested in the book's drama. That said, I'm going to have to reread it to find out what happened to Martha..."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"First of all I'm not under 13, but I couldn't write a review otherwise. Anyway, I can't decide whether or not I like this book. It starts out slow, but the writing style is very intimate -- we know exactly what is going on in the main character's head -- and her thoughts make her somewhat easy to relate to. I know lots of people critisize Lee for being overly self-conscience, but the truth is alot of people have a hard time being suave and sophisticated in high school. I personally found her awkwardness the best part about the book. That's why the last chapter is such a killer to the story, and not in a good way. I think I would've given the book 4 stars if it hadn't been for that last part which, by the way, is completely ridiculous. The idea that a hot popular guy who could have any girl in the school would choose a dorky, anti social average girl is extrememly unrealistic and judging by the other reviews on this site, I can see that I'm not the only one that thinks that. It's just bothersome that a book that tries so hard to make it's main characters flawed and true to life would make the ending so formulaic and stupid. Oh well."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Unfortunately, this book engaged me right away. I was very interested for the first half. As I got to the middle, I was starting to get a little sick of Lee's insecurity issues and I just wanted her to make a change, enjoy SOMETHING about her life at Ault. I decided to keep on truckin' through the rest of the book, hoping that she would have outgrown the feeling of insignificance. I found it aggravating that she obsessed so much over the stupid things, and in turn was not able to enjoy any aspect of her life. I think this theme is a little overdone in the book, to be honest; I don't think a real person would be this extreme. It would have been nice to see her make a change as an adult and at least find happiness in SOMETHING. A big disappointment in the end."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this book in such a short time. I thought Lee was a little pathetic, but she was still very young. She did care way too much about what people thought about her, but we all did that when we were in High School. It brought back memories of staring at a boy and you wanted him soo badly,but you could not have him, or he would only speak to you when the prettier girls were not around. I felt bad for Lee,and in the end, Cross ended up being a bigger jerk then i had antisipated, which most of the time the boy you loose your virginity to is. The author at the end tells you what most of the characters are doing in the present, Martha got married, Cross is also married. I kind of wish Lee got married, and got over caring about what people think to the extent she still does. Overall, I definately recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"i was intrigued by this book because i remembered ms. sittenfeld's essay from the great anthology \\"listen up: voices from the next feminist generation\\". she also wrote about prep school in that essay. i hate to say it, but that essay accomplished more than this book--it was smart, interesting, fast-paced, ended well and had something to say. the book was mildly interesting and pretty smartly-written, but failed sorely in those other aspects.it was really hard to like the narrator when she was so bland. does the world really need another wishy-washy female protagonist? there were a few characters who really intrigued me, like the korean lesbian or the heiress who dressed all in ruffly primary colors & didn't care what anyone thought. but those characters are judged and disdained by lee and then disappear.i admire ms. sittenfeld's attention to detail. i just wish the events she detailed were more exciting. i wish there was some more plot.occasionally, sittenfeld will have a brilliant one-liner, like when she mentions that (i'm paraphrasing here) \\"everyone liked the black guy from the bronx, what's more, they liked the fact that they liked a black guy from the bronx.\\" or the exchange she has with her mother after she's lost her virginity. if the whole book were slightly snarkier & slightly more understated, it might be really great. alas, it isn't."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was one of the most boring coming-of-age novels I have ever read. Lee Fiora bored the s#*! out of me, there was poor character developement throughout the novel, and hardly any plot. Also, the writer had the annoying habit of Lee telling a story then jumping into her present life and relating the incident in the such a dry and pointless way I wanted to just slam the book shut. Lee failed to evolve in 4 yrs and I could not relate or empathyze with her in any way. The best thing about this book was that it was available @the local library and I did not have to waste mi dinero$$$"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" is a book that is too long, unexpectedly far too graphic, and extremely depressing. Lee doesn't fit in, feels lower than her peers, gets subpar grades, never has a boybriend, gets into a lousy college, and ends up having sex with a jerk who doesn't even care about her. At the end of the story, she looks back and realizes that she didn't enjoy herself and then rarely talks to her former best friend. IF I WANTED TO BE THIS DEPRESSED, I WOULD'VE READ THE NEWS."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had high expectations for this since I like coming of age novels and it was so highly rated but I couldn't accept the first premise of the novel-that the major character could ever be accepted to this prestigious prep school. Anyone who has no alumni ties, no money and hails from a public school in the Midwest has to be exceptional to be admitted into a place like this-exceptional in academics and most likely with other highly developed skills, including a competitive and confident nature. Instead the central character acts as if she was dropped off in the school recycling bin one day. Worse, not only is she undistinguished, she delights in her incompetence totally petrified to raise an eyebrow let alone a voice. Sorry, a kid like this doesn't get into a school like that and, if she did, she would be working hard to distinguish herself and prove her worth. Finally, we are to believe that this mousy girl, who won't even confide in her best friend suddenly gets this urge to blab all to the New York Times, thereby, finally distinguishing herself as the school traitor and malcontent. Masochism is the overriding theme of this book. The book is funny-in spots; telling-in spots; but is-as Holden Caulfield would say- phony."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"There are definitely moments of cleverness and rich evocation: the names of Lee's fellow students, for one, are funny and spot-on. And the main character's best (only) friendship does effectively evoke the nuances of young female friendships. BUT: a well-drawn character who is troubled and awkward should make you want to hug them, not smack them. Lee messes up and self-sabotages so consistently -- and not in an endearing teen-angst way -- that she just gets more and more painfully irritating, willfully un-self-aware, and, frankly, pathetic, and therefore, less and less worth rooting for. In a really good book, she'd Grow and Learn From Her Experiences in subtle and unpredictable ways. In a mediocre (and way too long) book, however, she just gets buffeted about by a series of moderately skillful descriptions. I was drawn along by a few compelling plot turns (Assassin, the math test) but ultimately disappointed -- and frustrated by the excessive hype."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Nothing in this novel is profound. Nothing in this novel is redeeming. Nothing in this novel inspires, puzzles, or educates. It is the ramblings of nothingness. Where feelings of the moment have a higher priority than values, morals, standards, virtues or ethics which, by the way, were nowhere to be found in the main character's daily struggles as an individual growing up -- only feelings.There was a little trace of regret, and only then because of its inconvenience to Lee herself, but there was no trace of shame or guilt in Lee.\\"Where these is yet shame, there may in time be virtue\\" Dr. Johnson"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Am I the only reader who found the prose ponderous, the dialogue stilted, and the whole thing badly in need of editing? I am amazed at the status this book has achieved, and doubly amazed that anyone would utter Salinger and Sittenfeld in the same breath. Read the prose out loud to yourself: are these long, wordy, rhythm-less sentences pleasing to the ear? Read the dialogue out loud to yourself: does anyone really talk like that, and do we need to have every single tedious, expository word in every conversation? At the end of Chapter 2, where was an editor to cut out the second half of the last sentence? (We get it!)Really, why is such schlock getting such praise?"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep sucked me in with it's cute cover, teenage protagonist and bestseller status, however by the time I finished this book I literally had to fight the urge to throw it in the trash. The authors writing itself is captivating but the storyline is non-exixtant. Lee travels through four years of high school with no major growth or emotional development. The book makes you care about her and you find yourself rooting for her to make some kind of breakthrough or to at least accomplish something. But she never does. The author does convey a huge amount of information to the reader about the school and it's pupils, but for me, this did not make it an engaging novel. The ending was a major disappoinment, Lee reveals what has become of several of her peers after high school and virtually nothing about herself. I was not looking for a happy ending, but some type of progress or closure would have been nice.What I wanted was a good book that I could be engrossed in, what I got was a bunch of pretty words and phrases."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Growing up is such a bitch. And in my life high school was just about the worst (well there was being in the Army later on, but that's another story). There's such a desparate urge to fit in, and if you transfer into the school from another town there are all these cliques to which you do not belong.There have been several well known books of this genre, but most of them come from the male side. This one takes a naive young lady, invited to an exclusive prep school by a scholarship. She is suddenly with people where money is not a problem. But this is only the tip of the iceberg as she finds they have many of the same problems sexually, socially -- basically with growing up. It's a delightful story, well told.It tells you a lot about the author to know she was voted:the most likely to become a nun,the most sarcastic, andrunner up for most sincere. Sounds like high school."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The nutshell: Lee goes to private school. She's from the mid-west, & suddenly finds herself surrounded by the hoity-toity, richer than God set. She makes a bunch of semi-interesting observations. Lee isn't an incredibly likeable narrartor, but I give Sittenfeld credit for that. Lee is honest. She makes unfair judgements; she's jealous, and self-involved: She's a teenager.Much to the books detriment, she becomes obsessed with a boy about 100 or so pages in, and spends the next 300+ pages analyzing his every move and her every move around him.For a quick read, (easy, flowing language, colloquial wording) the novel becomes incredibly tedious. What began as an interesting assessment and exploration of teen life at a prestigious boarding school, ended as an over-the-top meditation on what it's like to have a lot of sex with someone and it turns out they're using you. Realistic? Sure. But pretty darn boring in her telling of it.I'm assuming Curtis Sittenfeld had a seriously dedicated group of book pushers behind her with all of the promotional campaigning \\"Prep\\" received prior to it hitting the shelves, not that it isn't without merit, but I have a hard time imagining this sometimes sluggish novel making its' way into all of the \\"Best of 2005\\" lists without the marketing push behind it.In fact, I almost didn't read it- I was so sick of seeing her face plastered everywhere, and those goofy, preppie, reversible belts showing up in all of the stores... A book cover pushing an article of clothing? Odd.It makes me sad to think if the marketing team behind \\"Prep\\" had divided themselves in half, a few more first novels could have made their way into the heads of readers across America.It isn't that the book is bad... It just isn't that good."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep, a story told by the talented Curtis Sittenfeld, was hard to put down. The narrator, Lee Fiora, an unremarkable girl from South Bend, Indiana, does a remarkable thing. At 13 she decides to apply to East Coast Prep schools and winds up spending an angst-ridden four years at Ault School just outside of Boston, Mass.(\\"How was I supposed to understand, when I applied at the age of thirteen, that you have your whole life to leave your family?\\")This is the story of EVERYTHING that goes on inside her head. The quote above is just one example. It's all about observation and laying bare the atmosphere that is Prep School as experienced by an outsider. And this outsider believed herself to be \\"a petty, angry, impotent person.\\"Lee outlines her memories by grade level, (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and focuses on major and minor events shaping each year. The detail is both exquisite and annoyingly sharp and pulls you into each scene as though it's happening in the now rather than some 20 years ago. It's personal and revealing and I can't imagine anyone who didn't experience at least some of the same thoughts during high school--no matter what school or what place.Freshman year it's all about roommates and assimilating to what is for Lee a foreign climate. It's also the year where she first develops a crush on a golden boy named Cross Sugarman. Other students, Dede and Martha, for example, use their time at Ault to get the education they were promised; however, Lee--an average to poor student--spends all her time fantasizing about Cross. As the years sail by, Lee learns to deal with all things associated with coming of age, except for what it truly means to fit in.Great storytelling, tremendous character development, extremely well written and I highly recommend this book. I have to say it reminded me a little bit of four years at Hogwarts, without the wizardry, of course, and a heroine who unlike Harry Potter, wasn't popular and had no self-confidence.Michele Cozzens is the author of It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The \\"Sugarman\\" crush is the only theme that runs through the whole book, all others such as \\"assassin\\", \\"teaching bike riding\\", \\"theft\\", \\"hair cutting\\" etc. are not. If you think the \\"hair cutting\\" is far-fetched, the \\"hooking up\\" with sugarman toward the end is even more so. Why all of sudden, the boy decided to hook up with Lee in their last year? What has made her different in Sugarman's eyes after being classmates for three years? This part and the last chapter (after colleges) are so \\"Hollywood\\" and are the worse parts of the already flat plot."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I picked up this book for a premonition of how high school would be for my now-middle-school-aged kid, and needed that motivation to finish it.It did provide ample insight into the social fabric of teenagers, and in particular the atmosphere of normal folks among the privileged. The details were familiar from my own experience with elite private schools, such as the Banker Boys and the scholarship kids, and the plot was engaging.However, numerous debacles were painful, and telegraphed far ahead, which made plowing ahead with the reading a chore at times. Given the sparse action, a shorter book would have been more appropriate.Most noticeably, the narrator was described, if I read the events correctly, as avoiding most overtures of friendship, leading to her own isolation and alienation. She seems to have moderate psychological problems. At the same time, the elitist atmosphere in the end is blamed for the bulk of her problems, so I received a mixed message about the root of the issues. Even if her situation is not uncommon, a more integrated wrap-up would have made the author's attitude towards the issues more compelling.In the end, the realism of the underlying dynamics of the action, much as in the similar and similarly over-alarming \\"Queen Bees and Wannabees\\" non-fiction book, made this a worthwhile and interesting journey."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"A librarian reccomended this book, and on a whim, I read it. It is one of the best books I have read! I loved the hitting edge, hold nothing back appraoch Curtis took to this book. I am saddened by reading all these negative reviews.The beauty of this book is how Curtis does not have a hook. She doesn't have a climax, or a set beginning middle and end. She writes about high school the way high scool really is. Lee Fiora, the main character, is like millions of girls all over the world. She's unsure of herself, insecure, and experiencing things for the first time. Of course she's going to be self involved and a little whiny. That's life.High school isn't supposed to be fun, and Curtis' description is amazingly accurate. The fact that Lee doesn't have many friends and doesn't fit in is normal. Reading some of the sections in this book felt like I was reading my memoir.This book is a true description of bording school, and I hope that people can read this and appreciate it for the greatness that it truly is."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Boy oh boy, despite all the critical raves and Top Ten lists this book garnered, I can't say I was that impressed. This is definitely a first novel. Any comparisons to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" must have been part of the PR campaign because the only thing this book shares with that novel is the prep school background of the characters.The main character of this novel lacks inner fire; her personal motto may as well be, \\"Lie down in the road and let the truck find you\\". As the school years progress, we get a very matter-of-fact narration that at time veers off into almost comical \\"deep musings\\" that place much too much gravity upon a situation.The only time the novel really sprang to life for me is when Lee is talking to the \\"New York Times\\" reporter; I was very moved as four years of frustrations and observations come pouring out of Lee. Unfortunately, Sittenfeld then ruins that for me by having Lee ostracized by her peers once the article comes out. This final turn of events is much too much like the purloined journal incident from \\"Harriet the Spy\\" for me. I would read a book by Sittenfeld again but I don't think it would be at the top of my list.For those of you who like to keep your books in good condition, if you're reading the paperback you'd best carry it around in a plastic bag. The white cover gets very dirty, very quickly."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I did not go to boarding school and was never on scholarship, but for some reason Curtis Sittenfeld's Prep is the closest to my feeling of what high school was like.I am sure that statement does not qualify me as the most unbiased critic. That said the things I related to most were not the situations so much as the emotions. The desire to avoid seeing some one after an initial first contact, never knowing if a connection is real etc. all that I understand. I went to a private school so the schools legacy, how it being there makes everything more important, as well as the secret games and changing teachers. The promise of some elite dream world and the way it cease to exist once you get there.I also really enjoyed the structure. Each chapter works as a short story as well as adding to the resonance of the novel. This added to the feeling of reality that I got from the novel. Life happens in little stories that get strung together. And unlike so many high school stories the big revelation is not in what happens in school but in the reflections made after leaving it. As this point I have to defend the last chapter with its explicit sex scenes as necessary. The chapter before it has Lee's parents visit bringing up Lee insecurities in a passive way. She is acting more aggressively with the false bravado but all the insecurities she has spiral out of control. There is a wonderful sense of self-consciousness in the sex scenes recalling the physicality and the psychology of the moments.The prose is also an accomplishment. Ms. Sittenfeld has an ear for the sex and style obsessed youth culture and the desire to seem smarter than everyone else that is so normal amongst these communities and the Fiora's familial relationship. Lee is also narrating from a period in her life where she is smarter and that comes across will the plot does not dumb anything down."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Though it sometimes seemed that there wasn't much of a story in there, it was more of an experience and I got really hooked on the book. I think the book is intended for teens, but I picked it up at the airport at age 25 and it seem like it would be appropriate for any age."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I need to start by saying that this book isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a book with an exciting plot and lots of twists and turns, this book isn't for you. If, however, you're more interested in reading books about people, you might enjoy this character.Lee Fiora is extremely self-conscious. She's so afraid of saying the wrong thing that she often doesn't say anything at all. She makes stupid mistakes and doesn't always make the best decisions, but I find her extremely realistic. Some people think that she's too extreme to be realistic, but she described me perfectly. Lots of people like to say they're shy, but Lee takes it to a completely different level. I'm tired of reading about \\"shy\\" characters who have several friends that they talk to constantly. Lee felt real to me, even with her faults.I loved this book. If you like reading about flawed, awkward characters, you probably will, as well. If you're really outgoing and/or have a lot of friends, you probably won't like this book, as you probably won't be able to relate to her."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book dragged and dragged and dragged. I could not finish it. Filled with one tedious scene after another, I honestly don't know how this book ever got published. It had no interesting plot, characters, or storyline. I found myself yawning as I read it. Usually, I force myself to finish all books I start. But I finally had to give up on this one. I didn't want to waste one more minute of my precious life."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is awful. Such a waste of money. Lee is extremely insecure and can't even have a normal conversation with anyone. For four years, all she does is sit in her room and do absolutely nothing other than think about and judge her classmates. She somehow forgets she's at a boarding school and needs to study and makes awful grades. She has a huge crush on the most popular guy in her grade and one night he magically appears in her room which starts a series of hook-ups. She basically lets him use her. Seriously, save your money and don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I find it hard to stay interested in a book where you can't identify with the main character in anyway. And this was the case in this book. All I could think the entire time was that teenage angst was way overdone. The story of trying to fit into the popular crowd is one that has been done many times before, and in a more entertaining way. Not one of my favorite reads, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora knew from a young age she wanted out. Out of her hum drum life in South Bend Indiana, out from under her parents smothering thumbs.... she dreamed of being a boarding school student but her family did not have the means or the desire to see her attend such a place. Lee knew is she wanted to make that dream come true, she would have to work for it. When Lee earns a scholarship to Ault, her family is shocked but accepts that their daughter is going away.What Lee finds at school is mostly money kids who have always had access to money and never have known what it is like to live on a budget. These students were raised as privileged and Lee finds herself feeling insecure in her placement at Ault, while few know she is on scholarship, she fears she reeks of inadequacy.Between hot girls and cute boys (enter the likes of super hotty Cross Sugarman), Lee stumbles along always feeling like an outsider. She works hard to earn every tiny step she makes towards feeling good about herself and if making slow but steady progress when she makes a major lack of good judgement and destroys all that she has worked so hard to earn.Prep, is Lee's story. She narrates this as being 24 years old looking back at her days in Ault, reliving each feeling and what, now in hind site, she could have done differently.Narrated by Julie Dretzin this 17 hour+ audio can feel long at times, and yet author Curtis Sittenfield keeps it engaging. As Lee retells her prep school adventures you can feel for her... trying to find a good roommate, avoiding the girls that others pick on so she can up her status, meeting the guy, thinking about the guy, dreaming of the guy... and then getting the guy...sort of.It's hard to review this book because it really is day-to-day life at Ault and while as I mentioned above, there are periods in Lee's retelling that seem to be drawn out... in reality, life is not one big moment after another... but times of small moments... with occasional big ones. :D All in all, while PREP wasn't over the top engaging, it did hold my interest and I am glad I had this opportunity to listen to it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I love novels relating to coming of age themes, adolescents, and schools, and the novel \\"Prep\\" is one of the best! From the moment I began reading the book, I had difficulty walking away from it, finding myself thinking about Lee and her boarding school experience throughout much of the day. She is possibly one of the most interesting young girls I have had the privledge getting to know. Often I felt voyeuristic, like I was privy to her diary complete with her most private thoughts. The character of Lee was so carefully composed by the author. At times I loved her biting wit, was charmed by her shyness, was annoyed by her constant self-analysis, and was angered by her intolerance and self-loathing. She is the quintessential adolescent teenage girl! The richness and depth Sittenfeld brought to her character was uncanny. Often, it read as a memior, so personal and raw with emotion. Many reviewers noted the disturbing sex scenes and I agree they were, but high school sex is often disturbing-- a lethal combination of passion, shame, insecurities and desire to connect with another person in the most intimate way possible. As creepy as it was, the sexual relationship between Lee and Cross allowed the reader to glimpse into the psyche young teens. High school can bring back memories of the best times of our lives as well as some of the most painful we will ever experience. Curtis Sittenfeld has written a novel that captures that time of our lives in her vivid portrayal of Lee. The novel is one to be commended on its insight and authenticity."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I wanted to go to boarding school. I wanted to leave my life and my family. I wanted to be part of this elite lifestyle. I was inspired by Princess Diana being at boarding school. We didn't have any money and this was never going to be an option for me. My parents would not have even know what scholarships and financial aid was. My husband did go to boarding school as did one my best friends. And this book was very accurate. I felt like Curtis was telling my story if I would have had my dream come true. There is a dark side to boarding school, my husband went to an all boys school and of course there was old money and while they were great with the scholarship kids, life was never equal. My husbands experiences were a view into something I would never know, except through books. My female friend went to a co-ed boarding school and her experience was similar to the one of this book, it actually reminded me of her school. Another book with a great look at boarding school is Black Ice. [ASIN:0679737456 Black Ice]] You end up feeling bad for the main character in Prep, but then you realize she set herself up because she wanted to be part of it all. I think I would have done the same, to only for a year or so to have that exclusive lifestyle and education."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm not a literary critic, and to be honest the only reason I'm writing this review is because a woman in my book club suggested this book. When she did we all went on Amazon.com to read the reviews and the vast majority seemed to be positive so we agreed to read the book. What a waste of one month of bookclub! Maybe the writing was really great (according to the good reviews here) but the story itself, not so much. How many books/movies/television shows can we watch about how difficult and uncomfortable high school is/was for a teenager? Am I supposed to feel guilty because I actually had FUN in high school? It's not even so much that the character is difficult to like (usually those are my favorite types of stories) - it's more about the fact that nothing actually happened in this book BESIDES not liking the main character. It just wasn't good. It was hard to read because I just didn't care what happened next (or at all). There is an entire chapter on Lee cutting everyone's hair. I mean, maybe I'm shallow and didn't understand it, but it wasn't enjoyable for me. At all."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As another reviewer said this is a \\"train wreck\\" of a book. Disjointed. Poorly developed characters. Weak, phlegmatic female character. I can't believe it took Sittenfeld three years to write this mess. I could have done it in a week. And so formulaic. I'm just angry that I picked the book up at a garage sale and wasted my time on it. \\"Fish\\" versus \\"cheese\\"? - puhleeze. St. Albans should be ashamed for housing Sittenfeld as a \\"writer in residence\\" while writing this \\"novel\\". No way I would recommend it to any child, adolescent or young adult. Pure trash."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The main character does nothing but whine throughout the whole book, it is irritating. The narrative drifts in and out from the topic at hand which would be fine if there was some relevance I literally skipped over paragraphs of unimportant drivel. Save yourself some time hang out at the mall if you want to hear real high school angst or whining this was just self absorbed dull wannabe teenagers."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Maybe it is because I AM an editor, but I found myself wishing that I could take this book and chop it to pieces. That way, readers could find the cleverness without having to wade through the muck. The paragraphs are way too long, the descriptions unnecessary, and the subplots extremely boring. Sittenfield beats a dead horse. Way too many times. She'll write something bordering-on brilliant, and then repeat it again and again, diluting it's effects almost completely.But, buried beneath the drawn out details that no one in their right mind would really care about, is a poignant, sometimes painful, tale.A product of private prep schools, and an Ivey-esque University education myself, I thought the descriptions of Ault and its students were right-on. I enjoyed all the student's last names for first names. (Aspeth, Horton, Cross). The small, hypercritical environment where everyone was beautiful and smart, polite but not necessarily NICE, reminded me of my prep day school. Even the stupid game Assassin, seemed like something my high school could have come up with.In the beginning, I couldn't figure out if I was bored because I had already lived Lee's story, or if the story was just boring. It was like trying to live the worst parts of high school all over again: Did he smile at me or was someone behind me? Or, maybe it was just a smirk.I found Lee's relationship with Cross Sugarman the most interesting and realistic, and personally painful to read. She compromises herself for a guy she's put on a pedastol. Her attraction to him lies in part because she will never have him completely, and in part, I think, because he reaffirms her insecurities. She has created a \\"nobody\\" of herself, which her \\"relationship\\" with Cross confirms, and she clings to this view of herself because it is the only one she's got. Even at the end, when just before graduation her mother reaffirms her that she's not a \\"nobody,\\" Lee isn't quite ready to give up that identity. She doesn't realize that much of what she complains about is the result of her own choices, even going to Ault in the first place. This is high-lighted by the newspaper story fiasco at the end.I wish that the adult Lee would have given us some more of her thoughts in hindsight. Her character doesn't really develop much throughout the novel. I wanted Lee as a character to change more, but I don't think that she really could have until she left Ault and went out in the world. There is something about that stifling, prep school world that keeps you from growing up, until you get back out and realize there are bigger problems than who is class president (or prefect) who is hooking up with whom, and what you are wearing. But, maybe that is just high school in general. Thank God, none of us have to go back.Sittenfeld has some good material and could have come to some interesting conclusions. Instead she leaves the reader relieved to be a grown-up, and unfortunately, a little relieved when the book is over."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The narrator/heroine/protagonist - and I'm stretching it by applying the latter two terms to Lee Fiora - is an overwhelmingly one-note character. Over four years, she manages not to evolve or change in any way, good or bad. Her detached insecurity is annoying rather than endearing. She observes people rather than interacts with them, which is just as well, because the other characters in the book are pretty boring and one-note as well. I can't think of any redeeming qualities for Lee - she lacks ambition, is jealous of her friends, and [spoiler alert!] can't find the courage to initiate a daytime conversation with the young man who climbs into her bed and has sex with her at night. (Don't get excited - you have to wade through the first 3/4 of the book to get to anything that remotely interesting.) Most of the scenes begin with such gripping openings as \\"The night of the fire drill ... \\" Save your money and your time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I went into Prep with an open mind--it had decent reviews and hey, it sounded like a fun read. Frankly, I found it disappointing, owing nothing to Lee's experience or to Sittenfeld's criticisms of boarding/prep school and everything to Prep's unrealistic and underdeveloped characters. Its message--that young people often forgo individuality in order to fit in--was far too obvious. Contemporary teen fiction has experienced a reawakening, reemerging more like Heathers and less like Sweet Valley High. Generally, this makes it more interesting, but Prep was so utterly formulaic that, interesting message or no, the story itself was resoundingly trite. Lee, her friends, and her parents are all caricatured beyond the point of entertainment. Lee herself is missing more than a few screws. Despite her self-declared overanalysis, Lee rarely appears to think anything. Slipping grades are brushed aside, loosely attributed to low self-confidence and increasing self-absorption. Lee's bicurious tendencies are pushed away after a few pages exploration, never resurfacing except to highlight differences between \\"real\\" homosexuality and Lee's brief, fleeting, inexplicably disappearing interest.In sum, Prep explores a variety of issues, but lacks depth of any kind. As entertainment it serves well enough, but its formulaic structure deters even from that by the time this 300+ page novel is finished. Fluff isn't bad by default, but it's good to know what you're getting into when you pick up a book of this size."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As someone who attended an elite northeastern prep school, I have to say that the characterization was extremely accurate. In fact, at times I thought that she might be writing about my school (i'm still not sure that she wasn't). In addition, although socially I was the antithesis of Lee, the parallels between what went on in her head and mine were, at times, freaky. Overall, this novel was a great read, the characters were plausible, and the writing style was top notch. I am looking forward to her second novel!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Imagine, if you will, leaving Indiana at fourteen, by yourself, for one of the nation's elite boarding schools in Massachusetts. Over the next four years, you never distinguish yourself--not academically, athletically, or socially--though once you were the very definition of overachiever. Though miserable, you never return home, and you never do anything to salve the pain of staying.This is exactly the situation Curtis Sittenfeld creates for Lee Fiora in her best-selling Prep, a first person narrative style that is, in fact, a fictional memoir, told years later. A masterpiece of teen angst, Prep sits on the same continuum as Hairstyles of the Damned but at the opposite pole. Not only is this the feminine perspective, but it is also the overly analytical introspection of a true introvert, which some might misconstrue as narcissism.Prep is a classic fish out of water story. Ault, the fictional boarding school Lee attends, is populated by the beautiful and the wealthy, and Lee, a scholarship student, is neither. When she arrives, her desire to conform, to fit in, causes a paralyzing anxiety from which she never recovers. Lee, the once outgoing student, becomes the passive receptor who cannot even muster the courage to be passive aggressive. Presented time and again with opportunities to do something, anything, Lee instead chooses to do nothing for fear of revealing herself to be a fraud.In the end, Lee's first love, Cross Sugarman, diagnoses Lee's problem. \\"'I'm just saying that--' His tone softened. 'That I bet things would be easier for you if you either realized you're not that weird or decided that being weird isn't bad.'\\" If only every teen could come to that realization. Conformity is the bugaboo of adolescence, but those who come through it without being broken by it, often have the most to offer society as individuals, not just cogs in the machinery."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Is the writing fabulous? Yes. Is the story very ordinary? Yes. However, what makes this book worth reading is the depth of Lee Fiora, as explained by Sittenfeld. There were times when I loved Lee and was rooting for her, but there are also parts of the novel were I was disgusted with her behavior. However, Lee Fiora is very human and thats what I like most about it. Sure, there are parts of the book that are for lack of a better word, bubblegum. The comparisons to Holden Caufield, I think are without merit, but overall its very enjoyable. The writing is quite impressive for a debut novel. I am very much looking forward to Sittenfeld's next work and am hoping the sophomore effort does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora is the quintessential adolescent struggling to find her place. This novel was so true to my memories of high school, of the insecurity everyone feels but tries to hide, of the fact that people think shy people are stuck-up, not insecure and frozen in their insecurity. Lee gets the reader to buy into her own hype--the reader starts believing she is inherently boring and unlikable and doesn't fit in with her rich boarding school classmates. The whole book is about Lee learning how wrong she is, and how she's paralyzed her own social life by believing in her own brand of insecurity. Lee agonizes about every social ineraction she has, rehashing ths situation and trying to see what she did right or wrong. I'm sure I'm not the only person who relates to this self-doubt.A few reviewers have talked about Lee as \\"unlikable.\\" Well, yeah, how many adolescents are totally likeable? Of course she's not charming and winning. She doesn't believe in herself and she's trying to (painfully) find her own place in the world of her boarding school.Although there are sexual themes, I recommend this book to mature teenage readers, as well as to those for whom high school isn't too distant a memory. Sittenfeld has created a memorable novel about coming-of-age and relating to one's peers."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Many reviewers here have criticized Prep for being boring, plotless and too detailed, while others admire the writing and the realistic take on prep school life. I agree in that halfway through I felt bogged down and weary of Lee's analysis of her own feelings--her self-consciousness becomes claustrophobic. Yet something compels everyone to finish the book, and the last half makes it all worth it, in my opinion. Real insights are delivered.The very thing that makes the book flawed is also its exceptional gift--Lee's remarkable and intricate emotional insights about herself. The character of Lee is so thoroughly developed and revealed, and her emotions and responses so fascinatingly dissected, that unfortunately there is little room left over for any other characters. Everyone else in the book is kind of a cipher or a stereotype.There is no plot because real life doesn't have a plot, and this story is about a real life. That's, in part, what gives the writing its remarkable insight. I assume the book is based quite a bit on the emotional life of Sittenfeld herself, and this is also a negative and a positive about the book. The positive is the acute realism it gives the character of Lee. The negative is that those parts of the story that are not in some way autobiographical ring false.Also, characters who are actual real friends in Sittenfeld's life are not fully developed because she's protecting them. Other characters, you can tell, she is wreaking revenge on---for example the poor, hapless teacher Ms. Moray. Sittenfeld says something to the effect---I would not want to see her today to either thank her or apologize to her.... What does this have to do with the story? It's just Sittenfeld getting back at the real Ms. Moray, I would guess. Likewise, other characters seem to be jabbed at or protected. So no character in the book is artfully and imaginatively developed. This is not fully a work of imagination. However, it is a remarkable chronicle by a gifted and intelligent writer. Like many have said, I look forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"PREP is a delightful novel that focuses on Lee Fiora, who hails from South Bend, Indiana and decides to go to a posh boarding school near Boston. Ault is filled with students who are so privileged that they don't need cash on campus, whereas Lee is on scholarship. For most of her first year, Lee is friendly with her two roommates but is mostly friendless. Then she becomes best friends with Martha, and things get a little easier. But throughout high school, Lee feels the usual teen angst compounded by the fact that she really is an outsider, no matter how comfortable she becomes with the school.Lee is also never completely honest with her family about her feelings concerning Ault. She is fundamentally close to her family, but as with many teenagers, her relationship with them changes as she gets older. Lee makes things harder for herself though by not accepting that she is indeed an outsider and doing her own thing, a fact that several friends mention along the way. This all comes to a head near the end of senior year. At this point, she has been intimate with a boy but was not in a real relationship with him. Nonetheless, Lee becomes downright nostalgic about a school that changed her life but never really embraced her.Fortunately, this 400-page tome is filled with fascinating characters. There's Dede, Lee's roommate from freshman year who is both bristly and friendly throughout high school. Sin-Jun, Lee's other roommate from freshman year, later tries to kill herself after an unsuccessful relationship with another woman. There's Conchita, who Lee assumes is on scholarship but is actually ridiculously rich. Conchita has a limo pick the girls up one day when they meet her mother in town for lunch. There's Aspeth, an uber-popular girl about whom rock songs are written. Cross Sugarman is a young man who everyone likes a lot, including Lee, and Darden Prittard is a black guy from the Bronx who is friendly with everyone.As for the teachers, Ms. Moray is from the Midwest and teaches English. Her first teaching assignment is at Ault, and she tries too hard in all the wrong ways. Ms. Prosek is an advisor who doesn't stick up for Lee when things get rough. And who can forget Aubrey, a shy boy who develops a crush on Lee when he becomes her math tutor.Even minor characters, such as Little Washington, a scholarship student who stole from Lee's dorm-mates freshman year, stay with readers long after they've left the school.Curtis Sittenfeld utilizes these characters to tell a coming-of-age story, give a snapshot of prep school life, and subtly explore class and race. Sittenfeld writes from the perspective of Lee as a 24-year-old who is living in an unmentioned city. Throughout the book we get glimpses of the characters' lives after high school, which gives depth to the story. There are a few times when Sittenfeld offers too much analysis and explanation, and on one occasion her foreshadowing gives part of the story away. But for the most part, her story is flawless.Sittenfeld clearly has an insider's perspective of boarding school life. Her protagonist is defensive about people's perceptions of prep life, and there are a number of details that only can be known by someone who has experienced prep school firsthand. It's doubtful that Sittenfeld's story is autobiographical, and it hardly matters if it is. Sittenfeld won a Seventeen fiction contest when she was 16, and her journalism has appeared in national publications. Clearly, her writing speaks for itself.--- Reviewed by Jane Van Ingen"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am writing this review before I read any others, so that I am not influenced by them.I read this in two sittings, and was aghast at how I felt afterwards. I was an English boarding school pupil (scholarship) at around this time - the mid-1980s to 1990s - and so much of this rang so true, it was like ringing in the New Year.I loved the fact that Lee was flawed, and a snob. Of course she was. She was brought up in a small town as the brightest star, then transferred to a town where stars twinkled so much more brightly, and expensively, and effortlessly. She wanted to fit in, but didn't do so on the first day and thus became awkward, and diffident. And so all her problems arose, and mounted, and escalated.I loved the free-thinking, self-deprecating nature of Sittenfield's writing. For the first time in a very long time, I didn't feel the main character was perfect, or near-perfect, or deserving, or Disney-esque. Lee was insecure, and flawed, and sometimes deeply introspective, yet sometimes distant and mean. Aren't we all? The Conchita episode made me almost weep with recognition and sadness.Although the romance in the second half seemed to fulfill everything Lee had wished for, of course it really didn't. How many women/girls would read that account of sexual insecurity without thinking 'Oh God, I've been there - in that very room!' The outcome seemed so painfully obvious - girls feel an awful lot, whereas boys tend to want to 'experience' an awful lot.The chapter about Parents' Weekend with Lee's father brough back a hundred painful memories. We have all let our parents down in hideous ways, and reading about them AS parents doesn't dilute the pain of those days. I could almost follow Lee's experience (the embarrassment, the shame and the resulting rudeness on my part followed by a resounding slap) word for word. I cringed as I read it. Thank God it wasn't only me who treated their parents so badly at 16!My daughter is 11 and I shall pass this book onto her when the time is right - it is EXACTLY the kind of thoughtful, flawed, painfully aware account of school (public or otherwise) that all teenage girls should know about.Especially the popular, pretty ones - after all, I think they must identify with this a little too, depsite the bravado?!For any English girls out there, this was like Malory Towers or St Clare's - comforting, familiar, vaguely exciting - with all the desperation and hopelessness of real life thrown in as well.Brilliant."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"After reading some of the other reviews, I am ashamed to admit that I loved Lee and actually could relate to her in some ways. Sure, some of the things she did were stupid, and others made you cringe but she seemed like a real person. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted a fun, serious, and entertaining read all at the same time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep was one of the most engaging books I have ever read. This is not just because I couldn't put it down, but because even when I had to put it down, even when I was finished with it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I don't usually feel this way when I read a book, but I felt intensely like I was the main character, Lee. Sittenfeld describes some of Lee's habits and emotions that are things that I imagine everyone must experience, but are never talked about. This confrontation of things that I could relate to made me feel a great connection to the main character, and that was one of the most intriguing things about the book.One thing I have to address is that although this book is not at all happy, and doesn't have a fairy-tale ending, it is not simply a depressing tearjerker. Even though, feeling like the sad things that happened to Lee had happened to me, I was depressed at first, the book had an overall positive impression on me. After coming out of the depression, I could see that things would be okay in the end: both in the end of Lee's unfinished life (her story is told at the age of 25) and in mine. Lee's problems are such that they are not trivial, but not unresolvable, either. Another thing that's positive about this book is that everyone can learn something from it. That might sound cliche, but it's true.This book without a doubt deserves five stars. Everyone, especially teenage girls, should read it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I really liked this book. It is certainly a page-turner. First, the good things. Curtis Sittenfeld is a good story-teller. She creates characters with depth, situations that cause the reader to squirm in anticipation, gasp with shock, and giggle. I was also impressed with the prose. The main character's thoughts are told in such a sophisticated way. Looking back, Lee speaks of her teenage years with such clarity. Her ability to look back at that time and see herself clearly for what she was is priceless. I was struck by how precise the description of the mind of an outcast girl was. I mean, it was phenomenal. And that is no small task; the minds of teenage girls are like forbidden territory. Lee's interpretation's of her actions and certain situations are spot-on, both funny and heartbreaking. Any woman can see a bit of herself and her experience in Lee.And now for the bad. I thought there was more than one instance of a plot twist being unbelievable. For one, I thought the Lee-as-hair-stylist plot was a bit ridiculous. It just seemed really contrived. Also, how many quiet, ackward teenage girls have a gorgeous, popular athlete just show up next to their bed in the middle of the night to deliver their first kiss? This was so unbelievable that it kind of taints the rest of the book. Also,in the book, Lee Fiora, the narrator, is utterly \\"average\\" at sports and academics. She has no particular interests. I found it hard to believe that she got into boarding school in the first place.I also agree with a past reviewer that Sittenfeld should have made it clear when the book is set. The language sounds modern, but the clothing and music described sounds like it is in the 1980s. This was confusing."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I enjoyed Prep because I thought Curtis did a great job at relating the everyday anxieties of being a high-school aged human being. I liked the way the book ended, because there was no neat tie-up of the story...school ends and Lee goes back home. Just like real life. I appreciated that in the book.However, for being so true to life in describing Lee's inner life, there were some moments in the book that I felt were far-fetched and did not ring true that took away from the book. The scene where one of the Ault adults drops Lee off at the hospital because of a friend's overdose seemed nothing more than a plot device so that Lee could be forced to get a ride home with the cook.And Cross Sugarman, the man of Lee's unrequited dreams, just suddenly appears at her bed one night, climbs in and begins to fool around with her. Right. I guess as a writer if you can't come up with a natural way for Lee and Cross to begin a relationship, just skip that part and head right to the sex. That really was a weak part of the book, in my opinion.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the painfully awkward walk down memory lane of teenage life that is Prep."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is not great literature, but it doesn't try to be. Some reviewers have complained about Lee, as the protagonist, as being unsympathetic. This may be true, although most teenagers are unsympathetic at some point, I don't even see her as the protagonist. The boarding school, Ault, is really the main character of the book. And the author does a remarkable job of describing boarding school, and the relationships between students and the school, students and each other, students and faculty, all of which are intense and complicated and completely different than those you have a college or summer camp or anywhere else.The book could use some editing, but it is paced well, is a quick read and has some narrative and descriptive passages that are phrases I'll likely remember and refer to long after I've forgotten the plot and characters of Prep."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"What does it say about the state of American literature that this book is hailed as adult literary fiction? I mean come on, this is a Young Adult book, a good YA book but not for grownups. NO WAY. I started this book with great hope, but halfway through--when the embarassing juvenile sex scenes started--I got really bored, (is this her diary from prep school?) and realized that nothing meaningful or interesting was going to happen. The realization that prep school is full of preppy--get it, prep-py people is no surprise, and neither is the fact that there are differences between rich people and middle class people!!! If you are a teenager, read this book, if you are an adult looking for a high school graduation present, buy this book. Otherwise, pass it up."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The author, first published as a teenager in \\"Seventeen\\" magazine and a grad of both Stanford and the Iowa Writers' Workshop, nails teenagers dead-on. On the surface, the book has a very commercial feel, and I read it cover-to-cover in two sittings. It's a great yarn about growing up and the dysfunctionalism of adolescence. But there are a myriad of deeper layers to this story. It's a discussion of class in American culture. It's a narrative analysis of feminine deference inside male systems. It's a sociological deconstruction of clicks. And Lee Fiora, the prep schooler through whose eyes we watch everything, is one of the most complex and nuanced teenagers you'll find in literature.Honestly, PREP was a book I read way back in August in manuscript form; however, I didn't really appreciate it until after I finished Tom Wolfe's I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS a couple weeks ago. You don't realize how well Curtis Sittenfeld nails the voice in PREP until you read a book in which someone completely misses the mark. There are books where the author takes on the persona of the teen protagonist--Salinger of course, PREP, Tom Perrotta's JOE COLLEGE, even to a lesser extent DBC Pierre's VERNON GOD LITTLE (a decent but not great book, no matter what the Booker Prize committee said). Then there are books that sound like a 70-year-old man pretending he remotely has a clue about the culture and social norms of today's young people. I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS is most definitely the latter.Pick up a copy of PREP. Recommend it to your friends. Put down your Bret Easton Ellis, your Hunter S. Thompson, your Dave Eggers--Because I think you could be staring at the next big generational novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I do not look to sympathize with characters. I look to understand them. Few books shed light on a character the way this one does.Prep documents a young girl who was smart/popular in her local Junior High and now finds herself in a wealthy prep school. And her social life doesn't go the way she'd hoped.She complains about the popular kids while her actions indicate that she'd be one of them if given the opportunity. Furthermore she's passive. She just sits around complaining about her life while doing nothing to make it better and accepting whatever crumbs the social hierarchy throws her. On multiple occasions she ditches people who really like her in favor more \\"popular\\" relationships.Throughout much of the novel I often wanted to shake the main character and yell \\"just be yourself!\\" But she never changed. Realistic characters rarely do.If you're looking for a thorough, yet readable, account of a passive adolescent who lives based on other people's opinions I strongly recommend this."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is an intriguing, well written novel, and the most honest account of adolescence I have read to date.The novel begins when Lee Fiora, a naive, middle-class girl from Indiana, is accepted into a prestigious boarding school in Massacheusetts called Ault School. But even though Ault turns out to be everything she dreamed it would, Lee finds that she is still unhappy there. She doesn't believe she fits in with the rich, attractive students that dominate the school's social hierarchy. The reader follows Lee throughout her four years at Ault, watching her slowly make friends, fall in \\"love,\\" and begin to confront the social, economic, and racial issues that are prevalent within Ault.Being a teenager myself, I can truly say that Prep's narrator, Lee Fiora, is the most realistic adolescent in any novel I have read so far. Her deep, unflinching awareness of herself and those around her makes the novel much more intense and compulsively readable. Lee tells her story with painful honesty, articulating those uncomfortable feelings we have all experienced but find difficult to put into words. There is nothing perfect or romantic about her character. She is insecure, awkward, self-centered, and oftentimes overly pessimistic and critical. But these traits are what make Lee and the rest of her world so interesting.Prep was an excellent first novel, and I look forward to reading more by Curtis Sittenfeld."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"It's a truism these days that nobody wants to relive their high school years. Somehow the old saw about high school being \\"the best years of your life\\" has fallen by the wayside. In Curtis Sittenfeld's first novel, the narrator not only experiences the normal problems of adolescence, but does so as a scholarship student at an elite eastern boarding school. In an environment even more conscious of status than a typical, cliquish public high school, how can a normal teenager not feel insecure?The book follows Lee Fiora, a middle-class student from Indiana as she navigates the waters of the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts. Lee is not always an easy character to like. She's a fish out of water, insecure and yet self-absorbed as only a teenager can be. Oftentimes, she's her own worst enemy, and it was painful to watch her sabotage herself. The most devastating sections of the book dealt with her interactions with Cross, her pseudo-boyfriend, and the denouement of their relationship. Lee may be an annoying character at times, but this reader at least also felt her pain.Overall, I found \\"Prep\\" to be a worthwhile book. Its episodic structure made it a little disjointed at times. The vagueness of the period during which the novel takes place is occasionally frustrating, but it does give a sense of timelessness to the events. Sittenfeld does a good job dealing with issues of class, race, and gender. I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this book in one night and really enjoyed it. I wanted to go to a boarding school after i read this and now can't wait to go to college. This book makes you feel loke you are away from home on your own and free. I could easily relate to the main character Lee and could see me and her being best friends. A great read and a good vacation away from home. Although I hope my college experience is not as dramatic as hers."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lately I've felt less of a need to force myself to finish a hardcover book I've bought just because I paid so much for it - as a matter of fact, because they haven't worked out so often I will probably rarely buy hardcover books again, except bargain ones. So - about 100 pages into 'Prep' it was pretty good...but then I realized nothing was going to happen, ever. Just the thoughts of a 14-year-old going to a snooty prep school. I was reading it because it got a good review from the New York Times. I was realizing that she's not even a very well-drawn character. Her inner thoughts are often that she doesn't fit in, that she's horrified of doing or saying something embarrassing, etc., and yet she often speaks right up in a small group or in class, and she seems to talk to the outsiders as much as to the popular kids - she's rooming with one, and there was an incident with a pillow case that involved her hanging out with popular kids. She even had an incident that brought her very close, one-on-one, with the most popular guy in the school. So which is she? She's a very vague character - it's like the writer just can't pin her down. When the writer reached the point of describing the very embarrassing incident of Lee, the main character, killing a bee in class, I knew for sure this book wouldn't keep me up late at night reading it. It's not awful by any means, but it's just a waste of time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The promotional quote on the cover of my copy of this book: \\"A young writer with a crazy amount of talent\\" from David Eggers, was spot on.Sittenfeld is a truly gifted writer and one who, I have no doubt, will go on to great things.I really loved this book for the eloquently expressed teenage experiences that we can all relate to (unfulfilled academic promise, unrequited love and universal struggle to find your niche in the world).Lee Fiora is a diffident, infuriatingly fragile and interior sort of character who does try the patience at times. However, in Sittenfeld's deft hands she becomes a gripping narrator who compels you to keep reading this verisimilar tale. I'm not sure that I will revisit it over the years though (like I have with 'Catcher in the Rye').Just as Lee Fiora says of her boarding school \\"the single best thing about Ault, [was] the sense of possibility.\\" The single best thing about this book is the wordsmith behind it. Bravo Sittenfeld! I will definitely be looking out for your next book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is fun to read. It's the story about this midwestern girl who goes to a boarding school in the East Coast. It could have easily been a bad book with lots of cliches and stereotypes, but the author manages to make the characters and situations seem real.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thought \\"Prep\\" did not give an accurate description of what boarding school life is about. It made boarding school seem overly cliche, and a place where only the rich and the elitest are schooled. The boarding school that Sittenfield created is one that is seen in movies, not real life. If Sittenfield spent more time at boarding schools today, she would realize that her description of boarding school is inaccurate, and poor kids who are sent to boarding schools do not automatically become outcasts. A reader might enjoy this book if he/she has never been to or heard of a boarding school; if the reader has, he/she will find it ridiculous."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Many other reviewers have already mentioned my chief problems with this book: #1, that the main character/narrator was a neurotic and completely unlikable cipher; and #2, that none of the other characters are really well developed. Ms. Sittenfeld was fairly accurate in her depiction of prep-school life -- I'll give her that. But for a much more interesting look at prep school, and getting inside the mind of a messed-up prep-school student, read Sean Wilsey's memoir, \\"Oh the Glory of it All.\\" (And Wilsey's book is a fabulous read for other reasons, too.)"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I heard and read so much about this book. But that's not why I hated it. I hated it because it was absolutely awful. This is the worst first person narrative I've ever read. And I've read a lot, trust me. The narrator and plot are flat, flat, flat. My feeling about this novel and the narrator was who cares? If you want to read about adolescent angst don't waste your time with this - read or reread \\"Catcher on the Rye.\\" The few times Holden rants about prep school will tell you all you need to know. What a waste of money! This was such a dull read I don't even want to torture anyone by giving it away."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I really like the teen books, but this was a disappointment. I didn't get very far before I felt that there were things that I didn't want to read about. There were too many mentions of things that I didn't want to be hearing about, sex, and names of things that I just didn't want in a book. I read for entertainment, not education. If I had kids, I would not want them reading this."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"From reading the back of the book, I was very excited to dive right into it. As I did so, I grew tired of how Lee prejudged everyone and everything and was nieve to the world around her. Yes, she was supposed to be 13 when she went to school, but the character should have matured slightly over the 4 years.The plot was slow and dragging although the writing was on target with what I expected.In the end, I was disappointed because I had begun reading this book with such high hopes, but by the end of the first chapter, I was bored."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am a pre-teen, and from the description on the back of the book, this book seemed suitable. However, I was entirely and disappointingly wrong. This book is a book about a girl named Lee Fiora who, for otherwise pointless reasons, decides that she will leave her Midwestern home in South Bend, Indiana to attend a prestigious, private high school in Massachusetts. The major flaw of this book is that it lacks any true and intriguing plot. It is simply a string of tiresome events that occur during Lee's four year period at the school, called Ault School. This causes the book to be utterly boring and it drags on in certain parts (and since it is 400+ pages, these parts that \\"drag on\\" really \\"drag on\\" for a LONG time).The second major problem is that Lee possesses no form of self-esteem whatsoever. This is exhaustingly annoying and pointless. OF course, all teens, including myself, are self-conscious, but her confidence level is embarrasing. She does not possess any defining qualities or talents, other than the fact that she has a knack for cutting hair. She isn't even charming and it most certainly doesn't make you feel sympathetic towards her.Thirdly, this book was basically about the intracacies of high school romance. This, though it sounds innocent, is merely an understatement. It describes the intracacies of physical high schoool romance. Lee, who nearly flunked out of Ault, spent her time and enrgy spacing out on all other activities and focused on fantasizing about her crush of nearly four years, Cross Sugarman. The book implied she was Catholic, and I am, too. Later in the book, Lee \\"hooked-up\\" with Cross; several times. Eventually, she lost her virginity to him. I found this extremely insulting, seeing as the Catholic church adamently detests pre-marital sex, and that was what she seemed to obsess about. Not only was this insulting, but she rarely even seemed to share a conversation with Cross. This is a sad reality for some girls, but she certainly regarded the matter lacking any ethical or moral consideration whatsoever.However, there were some interesting points, especially when Lee would flash back to her former self in South Bend, a person I could much better relate to.Overall, this book was disappointing, dull, and excruciatingly pointless. Please, do not read this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee isn't always likable and yet...I liked her. I love the way she admits to her myopic preoccupation with All Things Lee in that way only a teenager can...and those folks who never grow out of adolesence. She's a jerk sometimes and knows it, feels bad about it and then goes on to make some of the same mistakes. I've never been to a prep school, but the book did capture that \\"dorm\\" hothouse sort of feeling and unrelenting judgement dormies have for one another. The \\"bank boys\\" stuff was dead-on, along with her \\"first love\\" with one of them. I approached the end of the book almost in dread because so many authors can't pull off a truly wow ending. I didn't see the interaction with the media coming and the fall out. And I really liked the way she let you know what happened to some of the main players. A nice conversational tone to Sittenfeld's writing makes me look forward to seeing more of her work. Good stuff. I didn't give it a five because I didn't care for the way it was so difficult to tell what era the story was set in, don't know if that was purposeful or not but I found it distracting. Still, a very good read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am amazed at Curtis Sittenfeld's way with words. She is the genuine article."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"i can't generalize about this book as a whole. nothing about it is average, but it averages out that way. after a slow start it makes a strong impression but ends up shifting focus in a way that is hard to follow.first half:i'd think that to find the main character relatable or even believable you'd have to have aspergers syndrone. what functional person could have any understanding of the realism of this character?the majority of the reviews prove that they don't understand what it's like to feel like a socially inept outsider. that's the original aspect of this book. you can say it's about the fact that the main character is a girl, or from a midwest town, or at a boarding school, or dealing with the wealthy elite, or whatever else, but the only original aspect, and the only thing it gives any significant insight into, is what it's like to be a socially inept outsider. if you can't understand that or don't want to then this book is not for you.second half:at some point she develops a huge ego and resents that people aren't talking about her and pities people who aren't dignified and sauve. it's not that she wants people to understand her, just for them to think she's important. as the second half progressed i understood the character less and less until i found the last chapter, which is the whole last quarter of the book, alternatingly objectionable and boring. i don't actually know whether teen Lee's ego or older wiser Lee's sporadic reflections bothered me more. it's like she thinks she has to disown her teen self to prove how far she's come and implies that if you relate to the character then the author looks down on you."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"oh.my.god. I can't believe I finished this book when I fould it incredibly cloying almost right away. The character Lee Fiora is a black hole of need and neurosis.

Save yourself!!!!!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this book from the perspective of fellow prepster, having also attended a boarding school in the Northeast. \\"Prep\\" rang very true to the prep school world as well to its caste systems. The whole section about college admissions was especially accurate. (I am sure glad my school was all-girls, since it would appear that all kids at coed schools ever think about is sex.) In one section, Lee reviews yearbooks containing the pictures of Ault students going \\"all the way back to 1976.\\" Yikes! That's my class! Second, I found the main character to be incredibly unlikable in all her mealiness, indecisiveness, timidity, and self-deprecation. In retrospective, I guess there were kids who just kind of slunk through school, but I don't remember any of them being such human punching bags. I did enjoy the book (reunion is coming up and I'm sure we'll all be talking about it), but I think it had more to do with the depiction of the prep school environment than about caring what happened to this insipid and wretched girl."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The only reason I am giving this book 2 stars is because I think the author did a great job of portraying prep school life with all it's bizzare traditions (the green jacket, etc). However, that was probably the only good thing about this book. It got off to a good start, but half way through I was asking myself what I had done. Lee Fiora came across as a total snot. I tried in desperation to like her, but I could not. From her general \\"whatever\\" attitude about life, to the way she treated her parents, she came across as a very shallow human being.I though the sex scenes were gratuitous. Were they really necessary? This book was terribly formulaic. Awkward, shy girl wins over the handsome, sexy popular boy. Real life could not be further from the truth. Give me a break. Bottom line, stay away from this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This cheaply constructed story was engrossing but so full of self-absorbance and self-hatred and so pointless...A major disappointment and a sellout"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"If someone without connections had written this book, it would not have been published let alone lauded by all the critics. This is clearly a derivative, dull, prep school girl's memoirs. I don't care if she did come from Indiana, she's another prep school girl, in love with the rich despite disclaiming it. It is so overwritten, it's practically unreadable. Shame on the critics who fell for it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I saw this book on the shelf in Sweden, where I live. I am always on the look out for books in English here and I had heard about this one a while back before I had come here. I just decided to buy it to have something to read.Why the long winded introduction? A book I bought because it was English turned out to be one I liked for the most part. I liked how the protagonist was just sort of average, though she made the point that she hadn't been average in South Bend, Indiana. I liked most of the book, not because of the alienation thing that we all experience at least once in our lives. I liked it that it did portray that time in your life realistically. You get friends, you lose friends, you pine after the handsomest guy in the class, all things that happen to all of us at that age.I also liked how at the end she said she always thought boarding school was going to be this ideal thing, but it turns out to be just as difficult as anything else.I didn't like her allowing herself to be used by the Cross Sugerman character and the sex scenes were absolutely painful to read. They were really degrading and I didn't like that. I also kept waiting for her to stand up to the guy, but she never does.Overall, a quite good read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"... and I wanted to root for the protagonist, but I just couldn't get behind her or any of the characters. Nobody was very likable, particularly Lee. Also, I had a hard time getting past some of the characters' unusual names--Gates, Hunter, Devin, Dede, Darden, Cross, Aspeth, Aubrey, Little, Horton, etc. I suspect these choices were deliberate on the author's part and that they might reflect the kinds of names you'd find in an East Coast boarding school, but I found them distracting.The last chapter was depressing, and I was glad when it was all over. Still, Sittenfeld is a great writer and I'd be willing to give her a chance again."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Another reviewer mentioned how unlikable the main character is. I agree. Also, the navel-gazing, woe-is-I tone gets old well before the story ends. A forgettable book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Recently, the author visited my private boarding school on the east coast and had nothing to say about her book. She read a paragraph from it and then proceeded to not be able to answer any of our questions. It was as though our questions were too hard for her to answer. She couldn't even answer the question, \\"What would you define preppy as\\". She had written an opinions in The New York Times at the beginning of the summer saying that boarding schools were basically awful and she would never send her child to one. Being a graduate of boarding school, she couldn't even explain as to why she had written the article and didn't know how to defend or clarify hereself besides finally ending her visit while the rest of us students sat restlessly and bored at this supposed \\"New York Times\\" best selling author who even told us that her next book which is coming out next year HAS NO PLOT! Please, I beg you, do not read this book. The author has no literary skills whatsoever and is an even worse public speaker. I couldn't even finish the book, it was that repulsive, sterotypical, and just plainly AWFUL!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm tired of people who try to say that this is what a High School student goes through, because that's just crap. The average High School in America is a bunch of middle and lower class students, who are sex obsessed, drug obsessed, callous and in an age of true catharsis, with no cares of life and death, and all cares of life and death, self-multilators, pornographers, anorexics, bulimics, and constantly morally immoral. My generation of Teens that go to High School, aren't anything like the preps described in this book, and most of the prep's I've experienced are hypersexual, and carrie the best coke, so I see a world of crooked cliches and aimless wandering, in a hopefull and nice view of a much darker world, even though it does get sad at some points, and does convey an interesting and important character of literature. I just cannot stand people trying to compare this to what High School really is like... so please refraim."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This was a good read. I listened to the audiobook in parts and read parts. The audio was really well read. The book was good, except it took a long time to get to the \\"big\\" conflict."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This was not my favorite book but it gave an interesting perspective. It is probably a worthwhile read for parents of tweens and teenagers who want to get a better idea of what is going through their kid's minds.It was hard for me to get past the maturity that the main character Lee Fiora had for certain people skills which seemed well beyond her age which made the story somewhat unrealistic. For example, in her thoughts about when Martha was telling her something she didn't agree with she would say to herself I didn't say anything because that would mean that Martha would stop being so honest with me. It is hard for me to imagine that Lee is so mature in this perspective when she is so immature (as most teenagers are) in other regards.I think there are much better books out there that I would recommend like The Kite Runner, The Poisonwood Bible, and The Time Traveller's Wife."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"DUMBEST BOOK I READ ALL YEARThis book was boring. The writing was bad and the author insults anyone from South Bend Indiana."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"If you are interested in reading 400+ pages waiting for a plot to form, you might like this book. Overall, this is a book (I couldn't even say \\"story\\") about an insecure adolescent who thinks absurdly too much and says/does absolutely nothing. I would guesstimate that if you were to combine all conversations the main character, Lee, spoke in the book, it would not total 3 pages."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am from South Bend, Indiana and am completely offended by this novel. Obviously, you never heard of the Trinity School nor think we have homes on Jefferson. I graduated from a prestigious university in South Bend you all heard of and am disappointed a publisher would let this book even make it to a galley print. I have already returned my copy and pointed out to both Barnes and Noble and Borders in South Bend that this book reflects a negative view of South Bend and was told both stores returned copies back to the publishers for that reason alone. I work in publishing in NY and I think no one should buy this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was soooooooo disgusted with this piece of so a called literature. I would suggest the author Curtis Sittenfield find herself a name that matches her gender. Them I would suggest she invest in a bottle of shampoo and get some advice from that.

This book is amazingly well written, but also at times stunningly shallow and depressing, revealing that our American culture is indeed as empty as the flood of commercials and insipid moovies that influence the modern mentality.Lee is supposed to be the sympathetic hero, but she spends most of the book avoiding the unpopular people, yet secretly knowing herself superior to the popular ones (even the beautiful Aspeth and the beloved Cross are at one point only geeks undeserving of their belovedness). She blatantly calls people like herself the \\"undeservingly unpopular\\" emphasizing in the next lines that \\"the ugly and the poor\\" are the deserving ones. I am sure if a law was passed making ugliness a crime, Lee Fiora would promptly approve of it. More often than not, she dismissed people on the basis of their ethnicity or their income, and all the while attempts to portray herself as a caring, insightful person whom more intelligent students recognize as being \\"real\\" (the author here revealing her obvious sympathy and identification with her more than lightly flawed hero).The writer fails to distance herself from the subtle racisim, complex of superiority and hunger for elitism that her character (and I supsect, more of American teenagers than I want to know) so desperately succumbs to: the only thief in the school is of course the poor black girl; the Jewish girl is \\"too obviously Jewish\\" because she has a big nose; the only hispanic girls worthy of mention are either tacky flashy-dressing nuveau rich or dismissable \\"minorities on scholarships\\" (whom Lee never considers as possible friendships)... and these are just a few of the world of \\"us vs them\\" that Settenfield wants us to feel drawn to.But there is something about Lee that is at times disarming, her ability to articulate complex emotions with such precision and clarity establishes Sittenfield as a sensitive and sophisticated writer. She is able to keep us interested, if only for the morbid curiosity of seeing Lee continuing to blunder, missing chance after chance to connect with her gaol of being accepted, battling actively agains her own self interest, leaving readers wondering if she will succeed in completely self-destructing. Lee's neuroticism is painted with such precision and depth as to redeem in many ways all the pettiness of the elitism and racism that surrounds the Ault subculture. While Lee Fiora may not be the most likeable heroine, she is indeed original and complex.The book is impeccable in its building of tension, cutting insights and subtle ironies, but ultimately reveals the ugly muck and murk of America's obsession with whiteness, richess and power, with remarkably brutal snobbery and deprecation for honesty, diversity (social, racial, personal or financial) idealism and wholesomeness.As intentional social criticism it would have been brilliant. Unfortunately there is much to indicate that the writer herself is fascinated by this world and wants us to respect it. Depressing."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I found this book a very good read. It was written in a very \\"teenage\\" way. As the main charater goes away to boarding school she finds that the place she thought was going to be heaven on earth is almost the exact opposite.

Lee was insecure and shy, like a lot of the characters teenagers read about. Because of this I thought I'd be able to relate to her, but I didn't at all. She annoyed me so much throughout the whole book that I had trouble reading it. She was one of those characters that I just wanted to scream at for being so flawed. Maybe that's not fair, but Lee was supposed to be the character you support, and all she did was frustrate me.Other than that, it wasn't bad. There was no real plot line, but I was fine with that, because it was more of a \\"character development\\" book.

I probably did not like this book because maybe I not old enough to understand these boring events. I recommend this book to no one in middle school or anyone who attends a public school. Lee had problems like nearly flunking out of Ault, and spending her time and energy spacing out on all other activities and focusing on fantasizing about her crush of nearly four years, Cross Sugarman.

I, like her was the one who wanted to go but, I could not relate my problems to anyone because it was the choice I had made and there were sacrifices made. Luckily I didn't fall too behind in school but I could have done better overall in life had I went elsewhere at the time.It's not that I didn't get anything out of it but I would have been happier.

It was well-written, and just barely enough over the line of realism for the uncomfortable parts of the book to be tolerable.

It was so colored by her youth.Her relationship with Cross, well, let's just say that it was realistic.

Her family lives in South Bend, Indiana, and doesn't have much money so they don't think it's possible but Lee is fortunate enough to get a scholarship. The book is separated into four sections based on each year Lee is at Ault. The school turns out not to be quite what she expected and she finds it difficult to make friends there. She feels like an outcast but she later comes to realize that it was her own feelings of inadequacy that held her back from reaching out. While prep school is a world I haven't experienced, I found myself being able to relate to Lee at times based on the difficulty of starting out at a new place.

It was neither. Though the author does have a neat turn of phrase, she only manages to make a handful of really excellent and unique observations throughout the the course of the book. Most of it is just run-of-the-mill recounting of cliche high school experiences that we've all experienced no matter where we went - public, private, prep, boarding, whatever. If those high school experiences still sting and you still remember the full names of all the popular people in your grade and all the injustices of teachers and administrators who, sadly, \\"just didn't get it,\\" then this book is for you. It'll take you right back there, to all of the short-sightedness and self-absorption and stupidity of adolescence. I can't believe it is touted as \\"literary.\\" One would hope we've moved on to larger concerns and more far-reaching ideas by this point. Anyway, to sum it up: not worth your time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Cincinnati-native Curtis Sittenfeld's story about a middle-class Midwestern girl's adventures as a square peg at a snooty New England prep school was less exciting to read than it was to look forward to. Make sense? Probably not, but it spares me from spelling out my slight disappointment. As I said in my title, Prep was exceedingly well-written, Sittenfeld is a fresh voice in American literature from whom we'll often hear, and the level of realism in her tale was admirable. What hurt this novel was the fact that for its considerable length, she left it a little thin on plot. The lightness of detail (in plain English not much happened through too darn much of this book) impacted the quality in ways that need not have been so. I completed this book less than an hour ago and though writing so soon after reading lets my impressions be fresh, it does deprive me of a more seasoned view. Maybe down the road I'll be less hard on Prep, but as I sit here at this moment, I can say it needed a little more to it than it had. There were several characters who richly deserved to be explored more than they were, and there were others who would resurface long after I'd forgotten about them, with no polite reminder of the context in which they'd last appeared. \\"Who is this?\\" I'd be thinking, with no help from Sittenfeld. And the matter of the cook at Ault (a school presumably secretly named by the author after a famous Cincinnati-area park)...Lee's dumping of him was harsh and went by so fast I didn't realize it had happened. For an entire chapter to be called \\"Townie\\" and have only a few anticlimactic paragraphs be about someone...that was weak. So let me say, Sittenfeld got a lot right and she made some mistakes. I did enjoy reading Prep, although Lee's parents were sketched as hicks and her father was absolutely unlikable. The novel also drifted into gross-out WAY more than I was expecting given the genre and quality. So let me conclude by saying Prep by Curtis Sittenfeld was a flawed, fine read that delivered some good characters and settings, but any acute reader will immediately sense, as I did, that elements were missing that kept this from being a great debut novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had to respond to all the negative reviewers-- I thought this book was one of the best I read all year. I think the only way you might not like this book is if you can't identify at all with the protagonist-- if you never felt insecure in high school, for instance. Otherwise, the author's well-written observations (through the eyes of Lee) ring true on every page. I only wish more authors could so accurately sketch emotions with words. Great read!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"My daughters brought me to hear a reading by Curtis Sittenfeld at our local bookstore. If anyone has an opportunity to hear her talk and read it is well worth the trip/ time. The book is well written although a bit disturbing at times.

While Lee clearly yearns for a better life than what her fanily can offer, she is too deeply attached to material goods and status than the book explains.A definite let-down, but one I still finished and thought about."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I have to admit that what intrigued me about this book was the cover. I was immediately consummed by the first chapter. \\"Prep\\" is honestly a very well written novel, and Curtis Sittenfeld really makes us aware and understand the main character Lee and her observations of her boarding school. Having went to a private boarding school, Sittenfeld is right on the money and makes observations that are so honest and true. This novel really shows how one girl is affected by her boarding school \\"Ault\\" and what happens to her throughout her four years and how she grows as a person. I read this book in 4 hours non-stop, and i'm still reading it over and over again because it's one of the few novels that are actually real and well-written. I would recommend this novel for anyone of all ages because it represents emotions that we have all felt at one point or another in our lifetimes. It is honestly a truly amzing novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora may be a boarding school version of Bartleby the Scrivener. She would \\"prefer not to\\" go to her school dances, have conversations with the popular kids, and spend her weekends at the mall. Yet she never loses her urge to try to fit in. As her classmates might say, \\"therein lies the paradox.\\"As a somewhat precocious 13 year old from a LMC (that's lower middle-class) family in Indiana, Lee gets the notion that life is better as a prep school teenager. So she applies and wins a scholarship to Ault, the east coast boarding school that boasts many accomplished alumni. Lee dreams that she'll fit in with the moneyed kids and live an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog life. Yet, once an outcast, always an outcast.Some reviewers claim that Lee never changes throughout the book; this is simply not true. Yes, she always remains a critical observer, and yes, you sort of want to shake her into reality, but Lee is not quick to realize that life at Ault is not necessarily reality. She does, however, quickly find fault with the school; noting that minorities are always outsiders, and that the popular kids really are as evil and shallow as they seem.But it's not until Lee's relationship with hunky Cross Sugarman until she realizes that maybe, in fact, she deserves better.Prep is a poignant and nuanced tale of a smart but clueless teenage girl with dreams of a better life. You won't be able to put it down, or put Lee Fiora out of your mind."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was really disappointed in this novel, especially after reading all the hype in the NYT. I found Lee, the main character, to be remarkably unchanged throughout her prep school career. She was \\"sad and angry\\" throughout the whole book and nothing -- not friendship, rejection, embarrassment, or humiliation -- fundamentally affected her. Also, as the parent of a boarding school student, I found the portrayal of her relationship with her parents profoundly misleading. Lee's inability to relate to her family was not because she was a boarding school student; she couldn't even relate to other boarding school students!! Lee seemed to have personality disorders that preceded Ault, but the author didn't acknowledge that."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Wonderfully written, it definitely brings back all those memories of high school.

I absolutely found this story engrossing, if not totally believable; having not attended a private school in high school I could not directly relate to the emotions of an adolescent in the same type setting that I experienced my freshman year in college (we did the assasination game, even!)What I liked about it is that it described segments of Lee's life--and things that stood out to her, as a teenager; I DO think this is an accurate reflection of being a teenage girl: being overly critical of yourself and others, thinking you know a lot more than you do, being moody and bitchy to your parents, having a crushes on other students, etc. To me it definitely read more like a diary or memoir, but I absolutely appreciate it as a novel because after the James Frey debacle (and perhaps now Augusten Burroughs?), I'd rather read someone's \\"enhanced\\" memoir as fiction that a \\"fiction based on a true story\\" as memoir.I definitely found myself a little dissatisfied with the outcome of some storylines, but that, too, is life. Sometimes there is no climax; things just end or you quit caring about the outcome.However, I agree with the issue of timeline. It was never clear when this is to have taken place, which I thought hurt the story. The phrase \\"hooking up\\" definitely was not being used before just about everyone and their dog had a cell phone. I also found the incredibly long paragraphs to be a bit much and think the editors could have spent a little more time--I found myself skimming some passages. I also agree that there seemed to be little change in Lee over the course of her time at Ault--those four years of anyone's life are very formulative, and I didn't feel that she learned or changed much at all. I kept hoping for a bit of an epiphany, at the least.Regardless, it kept me up until the wee hours of the morning and I find myself still thinking about long after I was done. Definitely not a waste of my time, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I went to a prep school as well, so I can really relate to the characters in this book. Pretty much all the incidents that were told in the books happened all the time in prep school. I really like the main character -- Lee Fiora -- so insecured, no self confidence. It's interesting to read the book from the viewpoint of the out-crowd in prep school. I can't put this book down. A great book!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Thanks to Ms. Sittenfeld for providing the reader with an entertaining and engaging coming of age/\\"fish out of water\\" tale of a lower middle class girl from the Midwest who manages to gain admission (and just as importantly, a scholarship) to a fictional elite prep school in Massachusetts. The book follows Lee from freshman year to graduation, with all the angst and heartbreak one would expect an intelligent, insecure and self-aware young woman to endure. I enjoyed this book a great deal; the only quibble I have with it is the chapter that concerns Lee's senior year. The events that lead to her crisis seem a bit forced. And it is maybe not quite believable that such a bright person would get herself into this kind of a jam, for lack of a better word. But overall I really enjoyed spending time with Lee and the other characters. They seemed like real live young people; believable. There are graphic depictions of sexual intercourse, so in my mind, I'm not sure of how appropriate this book would be for some young people, but for young adults it would seem to be a great choice!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This gets at the heart of teenage insecurities so well! You will find yourself remembering exactly what it is like to wonder if someone thinks your joke is funny or if anyone will ever discover who you TRULY are. I really enjoyed the memories this conjured up in me and it reminded me how hard it is to be a young person and how our insecurities become more complex as we get older - but they don't really go away. Sittenfeld is terrific at the art of characterization!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The author's style of writing was engaging and authentic. Her characters are real,there were so many moments when i was reading the book that i was like, yes exactly! i thought i was the only one who thinks like that.i liked how the book wasn't glossy fluff, don't expect to read a charming tale about a poor girl who finds the love of her life and eventually becomes queen of the school. the book was authentic almost to the point where sometimes i wish that the protaganist got a little break but sittenfeld is an amazing writer. i can't wait to see what else she writes."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I like Lee's character, even if many times I feel like slapping her in the face for not expressing what she really feels. But what I like most is the angle of the adult Lee, occasionally interjecting in the narration and showing how different things look in hindsight, when one is older, wiser and jaded and all the dramas become insignificant and distant.This was the brilliant part, and the fact was really difficult to put down.Some of the characters seem archetypes lifted from Queen Bees and Wannabees, but I didn't go to school in the US and so I suspend my judgment about these characters being realistic."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Like most of the others, I read this because of all the hype, and because the author was coming to speak at my school's bookstore. Lee, the main character, got obnoxious after the first hundred pages or so, and there were so many incidental characters that I couldn't keep track of their importance. I read the whole book, including the last half excitedly, because I thought that certainly Lee would undergo some major change that would make her see how wrong about everything she was. I was disappointed at the end that nothing occurred. I read the last page three times to see if I'd missed something, but I don't think I did. It's ok, but the static character and the racism and stereotypes means I won't be recommending this book to anyone I know."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book reminded me a lot of the satiric tone of Tom Perrotta of Little Children, or Election fame and even Bret Easton Ellis' Rules of Attraction. Are there stereotypes here? Definitely! Do they ring true? Absolutely. There are so many cliches running around campus or boarding school campuses that it can be hard to count them. The narrator is a bit snobby or judgemental but so are a lot of teenagers and thank god this one is smart, funny, whimsical and interesting. Not everyone will like this but I really did and I find that the more I read it, the funnier it gets."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"I was terrified of unwittingly leaving behind a piece of scrap paper on which were written all my private desires and humiliations. The fact that no such scrap of paper existed ... never decreased my fear.\\"Lee Fiora, is a young woman in a coming of age novel unlike no other. On the one hand she is insecure and unsure of most everything, and on the other hand she shows a maturity of thought on what she really wants to be:\\"The interest I felt in certain guys then confused me, because it wasn't romantic, but I wasn't sure what else it might be. But now I know: I wanted to take up people's time making jokes, to tease the dean in front of the entire school, to call him by a nickname. What I wanted was to be a cocky high-school boy, so damned sure of my place in the world.\\"Curtis Sittenfeld, the author, grew up in Cincinnati, and went to Groton and then on to Vassar and Stanford. Lee Fiora grew up in South Bend, and then on to Ault Prep School and the U of Michigan. Curtis Sottenfeld would have us believe that this is not an autobiography, but many people who went to Groton can identify with much of the book. I would suggest that many people who were ever adolescents can identify with much of the book. This is a true coming of age novel, and one that reflects accurately the angst of the teenager. Most of us can sympathize with Lee Fiora, we have been there, we have suffered the same problems and issues, and Curtis Sittenfeld has depicted these events as startlingly and evenly as we remember them.\\"Prep\\" is not an \\"us against \\"you\\" novel as suggested elsewhere. It is more of a compelling read about our lives and times. The \\"haves and have nots\\" are certainly registered. Cross, Aspeth, DeDe are all names that gleam money and power. \\"The Bankers Boys\\" are a reflection of the rich young men whose fathers are found on Wall Street. \\"Prep\\" also brings in the stereotypical race and sexual issues, but they are told with insight and familiar settings. We understand what these people are going through, and we can identify with the feelings and behaviors.Lee Fiora is a young girl of the late 80's and early 90's. Just before the dawn of email and computer land. The students talk to each other and on the phone and communication with their parents is as I remember. The love/hate relationship with the family we have left behind and the values taught by our parents.A memorable read. Many of us can identify with the behavior and feelings of Lee Fiora. In trying to find your place in the world, we all are wrestling with our inner beings. Well done Curtis Sittenfeld. My adolescence remembered, one of the best times of my life and one of my worst. Highly recommended. prisrob 01-01-06"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This was one of the best books that I have read regarding the teenage youth culture. I could really relate to this book, because like Lee, I was often a loner in highschool. Also, I went to a very small, private school for college and many of the issues that she dealt with in high school, I dealt with in college.The book starts out during Lee's first few weeks at Ault. As the novel progresses, we see Lee change and grow as she experiences more and more of Ault's culture. The book centers around her obsession with Cross Sugarman, a popular basketball player in her grade. She first meets Cross her freshman year and it at this point that her obsession starts. The rest of the novel describe's both Lee's triumphs and disappoints that she must deal with in her \\"relationship\\" with Cross Sugarman.The story accumulates Lee's senior year when her whole world comes tumbling down around her including her feelings for Cross. It is both painful and difficult to see Lee in the position she is in, but it also a triumph to see what she does within her situation.My only regret with the book is that we do not really get to see what happens to Lee after she leaves Ault. I'm curious to see how her college years turn out and what happens to her as she continues to grow and deepen in her relationship with herself."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Sittenfeld writes in such a way as to open up emotions I haven't felt in a long time. She candidly describes feelings most girls have had at one point or another and to some degree during their younger teenage years. I loved this book, not because I necessarily related to the character all that much, but because she truly grabbed the essence of high school, the politics and the insecurities."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" is a thoroughly engrossing read, a thoughtful and sad look at high school. The compariosns to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" ring true, although \\"Prep\\" showcases growth over four years while \\"Catcher\\" spreads itself across three days. I teach 9th grade English, and passed the book off to a number of kids and they all liked it a great deal as well. The truths about life that Sittenfeld uncovers really hit a chord.Here is my favorite passage: \\"None of which justifies how I acted. I was wrong, I screwed up - how else can I say it? But there was plenty to learn from Dave. Later, after all that happened between Cross Sugarman and me, I even saw Dave as practice for Cross, as preparation. He made me ready, as Conchita had once made me ready for a friendship with Martha; there are people we treat wrong, and later, we're prepared to treat other people right. Perhaps this sounds mercenary, but I feel grateful for these trial relationships, and I would like to think it all evens out - surely, unknowingly, I have served as practice for other people.\\"This idea of \\"practice\\" really moved me, as did many other passages throughout the book. A great read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"At first, I really liked this book. Sittenfeld does a great job of capturing the claustrophobic, treacherous world of high school. She also does a good job of illuminating what it's like to be young, and very privileged, and she shows that these advantages do nothing to protect one from the terrible feelings of inadequacy that plague teens. I also went to elite schools, and I knew that outsiders thought I was very lucky, but on the inside, it never felt like I was one of the \\"golden ones.\\"But then the paralysing grip of the narrator's bizarre terror at social interactions of every kind slows everything down and the novel starts to feel arid and pointless. Instead of developing normally, the narrator stands frozen in terror. She spends years watching the other students, and silently worrying about what they think of her, or what they would think of her if they ever noticed her. Meanwhile, every developmental opportunity passes her by.The narrator is so painfully shy that she contrives ways to avoid making eye contact with strangers on walkways, runs out of class when called on to speak, and completely shuns all social activity. Because of this paralysing self-consciousness, she never meets anyone, hardly makes a friend, never seems to feel the thrill of physical activity, the joy of sports, the excitement of discovering that you're good at science, or geometry, or music. The narrator recounts in agonizing, moment-by-crushingly-dull-moment detail, how she stands on the sidelines, holding her breath, trying to be invisible, tortured by fantasies that someone will notice her and like her, wishing for nothing more than to talk to a boy and devoting hours and hours to elaborate ruses that might -- someday, if she's incredibly lucky -- just MIGHT bring her into a few seconds' proximity with a boy, but completely avoiding all normal social opportunities during which she might actually get to talk with that boy, or any boy, or any girl, or teacher, or houseplant, for that matter.It's horribly frustrating to be trapped inside the head of an adolescent completely withdrawn from the world who doesn't really develop, have experiences, share intimacy, learn things about the world or herself or other people. (Oh, and the big passions of her school years? Are for people to whom she speaks exactly once. And then watches wistfully from afar. For years. You read that right: years. B-O-R-I-N-G.)The narrator wants nothing more than to be accepted and have friends, yet she views other students who reach out to make friends with her (or with anyone, for that matter) with contempt and loathing: they're \\"trying too hard,\\" and are therefore revolting and pathetic. The one teacher who cares enough to try to get this kid to come out of her shell? Yeah. She too is a joke, a loser, pathetic and clueless.This complete lack of self-knowledge makes for an unreliable narrator. An unreliable narrator can be comic, but here, the combination of fanatical self-absorption and total lack of self-knowledge is ultimately joyless and monotonous.Reading this account of a stunted, frozen youth is like reaching an understanding of what it would be like to be preserved in aspic. Nothing moves, mothing happens, nothing changes. Every developmental opportunity -- even academic opportunities that she is required to address -- just pass her by, as she stands there, too self-absorbed to act, too frightened to do or say anything that would make her stand out.So, why is she such a freak? Did her father rape her every night for ten years? Did her mother lock her in a closet from the age of three? Is she brain-damaged? What makes her shrivel in terror and self-hatred at the prospect of saying to a classmate, \\"Hi, can I borrow your Latin textbook?\\"No. Apparently there are no diagnosed disorders, her family is rowdy and loving, she is physically healthy. The novel doesn't even contain an interesting account of the diagnosis and treatment of the psychosis. It just stalls, blind and pointless, denying the reader any explanation.The reader ultimately reaches the conviction that the narrator's adolescent self-assessment was correct: the narrator has an utterly charmless personality, and a reader forced to spend much time in her company really is making a mistake."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was recommended to me by Amazon, so I thought I'd give it a read during my work commute. Unfortunately I had the expectation from the cover (the belt pulled a bit too tightly around the cover) and title that it was going to have a dark humor tone or be a satire on the prep school life--something in the vein of \\"Election\\". That only set me up for the inevitable let down.The time period, as other reviewers have said, was difficult to pin down. I had thought it to be the mid-80s by the various mentions of cassettes, the description of outfits (including the neon pink and green belt from the cover), and the slightly dated vernacular amongst the kids. It actually seems to take place around mid 90s, just before the reign of cell phones. Time period issues aside, I just didn't feel any sort of attachment to the main character, Lee Fiora, despite seeing slight reflections of myself at that age. The insecurities she had with literally everything in her daily life became ridiculous as page after page she'd describe why she couldn't perform one mundane task or another due to something being \\"inappropriate\\" or not knowing what to do. Where exactly this ideas came from or why she felt that way was never explained nor was it apparent from peer treatment. After a hundred pages you just want to hit and shake her--sadly her lone friend doesn't share this sentiment with me. I wondered for most of the book why anyone at the school would even bother speaking to her much less be her friend. It's not her snobiness that bothered me, it was her inertia; I just wanted her to *do* something. There was absolutely no character growth from freshman to senior year in Lee or in fact any of her classmates, friends or otherwise. The story is told from a flashback standpoint and the grown Lee makes scattered comments throughout that she has changed--but the reader never gets rewarded with that discovery on their own. In fact everything the author wants you to feel about Lee and her life is force-fed in statements rather than the actions and experiences of an evolving character. Throughout the book snobby/preppy rich kids are eluded to, yet none of them ever appear. Actually the students seemed almost bizarrely nice to each other so the tension and fear Lee feels again is hard to believe because there's just nothing there.It's very clearly a book written by a first-time writer and that Lee Fiora was a projection of the author herself through her protective treatment of her character. There are no consequences for her behavior, or at least nothing she actually learns. Despite repeated statements that she'd changed over the four years, by the end of the book I felt as though Lee was the same person I had met at the beginning and I'm glad to finally be rid of her."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this book over the course of last weekend, turning page after page thinking it HAD to get better or that the main character would evolve into a human being that a reader could empathize with. Alas, that never happens.The main character, Lee, is a dour, self-obsessed oddball (but not in an appealing way) who doesn't appear to care about anything. Literally. When asked to write an essay about something that matters to her she scrawls at the bottom of the assignment that she really doesn't care about the subject she's covered but believes she's fulfilled the assignment.Does Lee go on to evolve or develop ideas or convictions? No. The writer takes us through the base, humiliated 'relationship' Lee has with her highschool crush, a cringeworthy tale through and through.At the end of the book we're left scratching our heads. Has Lee learned anything, grown or changed? It appears she'll continue on forever being uninterstingly odd and never connecting with other human beings in any real way.The racial stereotypes were tiresome and the main character was singularly unlikeable. I'm mystified by the hype around this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am a teacher at a prep school, and I thought that this book captured both the teenage years and prep school life as well as any book I have read. It was a well written, enjoyable read, and one that rang true with authenticity all the way."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" describes in agonizing detail the coming-of-age of a teenage girl from South Bend, Indiana attending a prestigious prep school in Massachusetts called 'Ault' (rumored to be a thinly disguised version of the Groton School). Lee Fiora is painfully self-conscious and observant, overthinking everything and suffering in frozen passivity as a result. She is the polar opposite of a person who 'shoots from the hip'. Her obsessive scrutiny and judgmental behavior prevent her from acting spontaneously and possibly even (gasp) enjoying herself.But Lee is not an entirely unsympathetic character. The cloistered environment of the prep school just enhances and exaggerates the angst that she's struggling with, and though she's sometimes infuriating in her inability to assert herself, I believe most readers will have some empathy for her. Who among us was never burdened by insecurities and anxieties, during adolescence especially? After all, the root emotion here is 'fear', though author Curtis Sittenfeld seldom (if at all) mentions it directly. And for a young person on scholarship from the Midwest, away from home for the first time and placed among the spoiled and the privileged, with their wealth and pedigreed yuppie status, there's plenty for this uninitiated person to be afraid of.Ms. Sittenfeld captures all of this splendidly, though it takes Lee some time into adulthood before she gains the perspective of distance to see it for herself; at which point some of her realizations are stark and abrupt. For example, upon mentioning her Ault School crush years later to her adult roommate, she is stunned when said roommate suddenly laughs: \\"Cross Sugarman? What kind of person has a name like that?\\"Indeed. I'd been wondering the same thing throughout the entire book, and this remark made me laugh aloud. So did much of the rest of \\"Prep\\", but I was also moved as well. Don't let anyone tell you that this is a \\"lousy book\\", or that \\"nothing happens\\". \\"Prep\\" is a substantial achievement, and Curtis Sittenfeld has great writing chops."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I found this book to be very affecting...it was not at all what I expected. I don't know why I was led to believe the book was some sort of \\"chick\\" book, but obviously it isn't. Something about this book was really sad to me...although it is set in this kind of ridiculious prep school environment, it's still a very accurate picture of adolescence/high school in my opinion...since as I recall, high school was a pretty all encompassing experience regardless of the fact that I was never in boarding school.There's just something really touching about the portrayal of this girl, who is just way too hard on herself during her formative years and just can't find a way to fit in and feel normal about herself and her feelings and place in the world. The way the book is written from her perspective when she's a young adult makes the novel make sense for adult readers. The main character is able to reflect on her youth with distance and without any bitterness...it was what it was.It's not a perfect book--some parts/characters stretch reality and are unnecessary--but it's still a good book and it really had an impact on me...I was impressed with how well the author was able to recreate the voice of a 14-17 year old girl. I wouldn't want to go back to that place myself.All I can really say is that the book touched me personally. Lee's interactions with her parents, her unrequited high school crush, as well as the abrupt ending to her high school experience (so unnatural in real life) were the most poignant for me. I would recommend the book even though I didn't love it entirely...books that actually stir up emotions in me that emanate from my own life experiences are rare."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I stayed up all night reading this book, but not because it was so wonderful I couldn't put it down. Rather, I kept waiting for the wonderfulness I'd heard about from critics to show up.This is not to say I didn't enjoy the book. The author's portrayal of the angsty loner teen was spot on, and I recognized myself and others I knew in the characters. The sex-not-love relationship was particularly poignant. This is an above average book, and I thought about it a long time after reading it.But some of the passages entering Lee's thought process were overwrought, overlong and overcomplicated, and I think the book could've been a good 50 to 100 pages shorter. By the last fourth of the book, I was ready to see some development and change in Lee that never came.I still recommend anyone read this book, but don't go in expecting the greatest novel of our time, like many of the critics make it sound."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Perhaps not as much of a 'what's lurking on the next page' as \\"THE DA VINCI CODE\\" and not as flowery as \\"MIDDLESEX,\\" but a finely written book that proves to be a true guilt pleasure treat. Like the seedily addictive \\"MY FRACTURED LIFE,\\" \\"PREP\\" shows off a journalist's attention to detail with the author's descriptions and a soft touch for the pains of coming of age like in \\"LIFE OF PI.\\" Not the fiery race-on-the-edge of \\"MY FRACTURED LIFE\\" or \\"VERNON GOD LITTLE,\\" but a powerful ride worth taking."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I can't say that it is the best book I've ever read, because I am so cautious with such a distinction. But it is rare that a read a book that I enjoy so much, and that lives up to so much of the acclaim that it has received! This was a very, very good book. I don't know if the protagonist Lee Fiora is the type of character that I would innately understand or identify with, but Curtis Sittenfeld takes us so deeply into the mind and thoughts of Lee Fiora that we can't help but to know and understand her --it really is an amazing ride. I have never gotten to know a literary character so well, nor have I ever enjoyed it so much."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Sittenfeld completely captured what it feels like to be young and uncertain. Though nothing incredibly dramatic or suspenseful happens in the book, I was transfixed and couldn't put it down. You don't have to be at boarding school to appreciate what Prep's protagonist, Lee, goes through. There's nothing trite or predictable about Prep."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I've read some of the reviews about Lea's character never \\"growing\\" and learning from her experiences. I'm 34 and felt 16 when I read it! Not every book has to end perfectly. In life, people don't always develop in the four year span of high school. I can say that I had as much angst in my senior year of highschool as I did as a freshman. Like Lea, I don't think I grew emotionally until my 20s.Sometimes I wanted to jump into the book and give Lea advice. Almost like I wish I could jump into a time machine and give my teenage self advice.This book is for someone who still remembers those raw feelings of high school.If you enjoyed the book, then it wasn't too long. Some reviewers said there was no story line. The book may chronical Lea's four years in HS, but it also takes place in her head. You have to put yourself in the mind of a teenage girl.I too, was hoping Sittenfeld added dates to Prep. Was it the 80s, early 90s?A definite read!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I've glanced at a few reviews that said this book was boring, and the main character sucked. My personal experience though was a bit different. I couldn't put this book down, and I thought Lee was honest, awesome and easy to identify with. People aren't perfect in the real world, and they shouldn't be perfect in books either. This book was a true picture of the school experience, whether it be at a boarding school, college or whatever. I urge you to take a glance inside this book, and create your own opinion."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book started well, but after awhile it became a chore to finish. The main character of this book doesn't grow, and she has nothing interesting to say. She doesn't have as much money as most of her classmates, but it's hard to see where that really gets in her way. She has a miserable sexual relationship that just kind of goes on and on. So what. The book finally ends and I just didn't care.There were some good sections, such as the parents visiting day sequence when the main character was so (unjustifiably) embarrassed by her parents that her father decided to leave early. I also found the aborted relationship between the main character and the townie to be fairly interesting. Yeah, both of these sections were overdone, but there was a ring of truth to them. Most of the rest of the book was an attempt to make us feel sorry for a character that was totally unremarkable and unlikeable."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Much of your enjoyment of this novel depends on your tolerance level for the meticulous details of boarding school life and the obsessive expression of insecurities that accompanies the narrator at her age. Of course, the story of Lee's stay at a boarding school is recounted at a later stage of her life, which led me to wonder: &quot;How does she remember precisely how she felt in that exact moment, so many years ago?&quot;Whatever. This is a story of &quot;trying to fit&quot; or the search for acceptance, not only at the school, but with herself. Lee is a bundle of insecurities and often her self-loathing spirals into self-pity. This is all like real life, except that in fiction a reader may expect something less &quot;familiar&quot; or drab.The overall prose is excellent. You can't say the author writes badly, yet after so many hundred pages, I found myself growing tired of the main character and this is a bad thing. The main character in a book is like a friend; and I found Lee to be a little draining, after a while. I would still recommend this book, along with another novel often mentioned by reviewers, The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez. Ultimately, it's all a matter of taste, of liking a character, of tolerance levels regarding the subject matter, etc. However, I would still personally recommend reading either book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Sittenfeld tries to emulate Holden Caufield in this book and it's easy to say that she succeeds in doing so. Although many books have been written in a similar vein this one stands out because Sittenfeld accurate portreys the character of a teenager. It doesn't even matter that the character is a girl and this novel is just as accessible to guys as to girls. I knew many girls in high school who were like this character. She reminded me of many of them in terms of her humour and self-consciousness. Overall the book is quite funny and it's an easy summer read for the cottage or the beach. I'd recommend it for all ages, and for anyone who looks back upon their teenage years with fondness or with dread."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"If I ever consider sending my child to prep school, I hope someone will remind me to re-read this book. It's a very engaging story about one young woman's painful experience at prep school, especially if you've ever been an outsider in the world of the truly rich. I found this much more captivating than Tom Wolfe's I am Charlotte Simmons, which takes a naive young woman to a \\"Duke-esque\\" school. Both books are good reads if only to make me very, very glad that I'm no longer a teenage girl. (Hmmmm. Maybe I should add Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood to that group!)"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is a great read. Ms. Sittenfeld captures the experience of Prep School and the inner workings of a teenage girl- as she obviously knows both well! The main character, Lee, looks back on her years at Prep School, living away from her family and working to create a new \\"family\\". It makes you wonder what's going on in the heads of those who are silent!?! It's definately a book you will have trouble putting down.If you prefer Alfred E Neuman and MAD magazine, like \\"Constance\\" the negative reviewer, then you might rate this with one star. If you like a fun read that will take you back to the good old days, then you will rate Prep 5 stars."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"First let me start out that this book is NOT written about (Lee) a guy, nor is it written BY a guy. There are two reviewers who stated that. Easy to do, I'm sure, considering the book is written by a woman named Curtis. But this can also shed some perspective on the book now that you know.I would find Lee a much more likeable character if we weren't inside her head all the time. It's like all those things you think to yourself but don't say out loud just because they aren't worth saying - that's kind of how this book is written. Lee is probably one of the most self-concious, self-doubting characters I've ever read about, and it's equally depressing and a bit dull. I find her sometimes brashness to be a bit out of character for someone who is otherwise a bit of a wallflower or constantly worried about what people will think to the point they're almost afraid to move. And I'm not even done with the book yet! There are moments, as the review suggests, that just when you want to smack Lee, Sittenfeld does something to 'reel you back in.' Yes, I can agree to that; but those moments, sadly, are few - at least for me. I thought this novel would better be suited for the Young Adult section, rather than a novel geared towards adults.The constant over-analzying of Lee's character starts to get on one's nerves after awhile. If I finish this book, it will be a miracle."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this over the weekend. It is funny (in a dry, parenthetical way), insightful and compassionate. Sure, Lee is at times annoying, snobby, insecure, unlikable, etc. But she is also at times their opposites as well. Like all of us. This book is NOT a rollicking chick-lit puff pastry crammed with \\"hilarious antics,\\" \\"out-sized personalities,\\" and \\"shocking twists.\\" It's the serious, at times slow-paced story of a middle-class girl who goes to a prep-school.Also, to a certain genius who already reviewed this book: it's \\"waste,\\" not \\"waist,\\" Einstein."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I bought it on whim when browsing my local bookstore, not expecting much, but hoping for a fun read. My expectations were certainly exceeded by this book. It was a fast read for me, and I really did get pulled into the storyline. The character Lee was certainly someone that I could relate too. I hope to read more from Curtis Sittenfeld in the future!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is the story of Lee Fiora, a middle-class teen from South Bend who enters the privileged world of Ault private school via scholarship. Over the course of the too-lengthy book, the reader is treated to four years of Lee's misery as an outsider passively trying to survive her boarding school experience and find some way to if not fit in at least not stand out, as well as hoping the supreme goal of Cross Sugarman (big man on campus) comes her way.There is without a doubt some fine writing in Prep--some beautifully rendered passages, some achingly honest depictions of teen life, some poignant moments of domestic grief, but these moments are eventually diluted and eroded by the book's plodding and basically plot-less pace, its too-great length, the passivity of its main character, and some bouts of hard-to-believe dialogue. Individually, any of these would have been minor flaws but together they so overburden the book as to make it difficult to finish. It's telling perhaps in reading over some of the stronger reviews that so many of them rate the book highly on the way it allowed them to recall themselves rather than the craft of the book--a not-to-be-scorned compliment but one which makes one wonder if they would have liked any book with a sad and passive outsider girl as its main character regardless of how well it is written.Lee's passivity is utterly plausible and well-depicted, but it is so consistent, so dependably predictable and so monotone that it grows wearisome rather than sympathetic or interesting over the course of several hundred pages. A shorter book would probably have avoided this but by the halfway point I kept flipping to the end and asking how the author was possibly going to keep this interesting for another 250, 200, 150, 100 pages. She didn't. And too often the narrator falls back on stating \\" I thought/felt ill-in-the-blank was the saddest thing I'd ever seen/heard/tasted\\".The characters besides Lee are mostly superficial types rather than fully-fledged characters--the black urban girl on scholarship who turns out to be a thief, the banker boys, the popular pretty girl, etc. That isn't to say these types don't exist; they do. That's why they keep cropping up in books. But what distinguishes the good books from the lesser ones is when these characters transcend their types and become individuals, or at the very least are balanced out by more original characters. This doesn't happen, or at least happens too infrequently in Prep.The dialogue, especially at the start, is too hard to imagine as freshmen in high school dialogue, no matter how exalted their background. The dialogue improves, becoming much more realistic a bit into the book, but still has its wince-inducing moments where characters sound more like authors imagine teens sound or like smart, educated 20-year-olds like to think they sounded as teens.By the end, the book became more chore than pleasure, the character too whiny, too monotone, too static for me to bother much about. And since the character is pretty much the book, that didn't leave much else to compel the reader.As mentioned, the talent is obvious in scattered portions, and while I wouldn't rush out to grab a second book by this author, I'd be interested enough to pick it up and give it a chance. Not recommended though, despite the flashes of strong writing."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I work in a bookstore and therefore we ge to read the book before it comes out! I absolutely loved this novel. It brilliantly demonstrated the struggle of a teenage girl to not only find her place in her own school, but in the world. The characters were so lifelike, so common to each high school that it was so easy to relate to. The world of privledge that the main character, Lee, has been throw into is one she must get accustomed to and find her rightful place. What a great read!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld has completely captured the angst of any teenager and especially one in a prep school environment. The book is painful to read at times because it brings you back to that time but you cant put it down. The book is also extremely funny and well-written. I am only sad that it had to end. I am looking forward to reading more from Curtis Sittenfeld-she has a real gift!!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Sittenfeld used EVERY racial stereotyped character she could create: the black girl who was caught stealing, then thrown out of school; the \\"cool\\" black guy whose only mentioned accomplishment is playing--you guessed it--basketball; the Asian girl who speaks broken English, and stentches up the dorm room with exotic Asian foods; the Latino girl who is pretty but not intimidating to the main character because the latino girl is not white? It's relentless, and highly offensive to those of us who know real prep schools where the \\"minority\\" students are not living stereotypes!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Yes, this is a well-written book. It is easy to get into, holds your attention, and the characters are all developed very well, especially Ms. Moray, Lee's 10th grade English teacher. This is a very fun book to read, and while you're reading it, you think it's pretty darn good. For that, the book gets 3 stars.The thing is, after the book has been read, you realize that it isn't so darn good. The narrarator is whiny. She is selfish. She has almost no redeeming qualities-- in fact, the only time I found myself rooting for her was near the end of the book, when she confronts her \\"sort-of\\" boyfriend.This book has been compared with \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and Lee Fiora is supposedly a female Holden Caufield. True, she does have the angst and apathy, but she has no Phoebe; no one she truly cares about.So, should you read this book? Yeah, sure, but don't drop $14 on it. This is the kind of book to check out from a library."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Covering much of the same ground as \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\", but far more realistic and better written, \\"Prep\\" is an sensitive insider's look at four years in an exclusive prep school. Curtis Sittenfeld (a woman) writes circles around Tom Wolfe here, especially in creating a believable and authentic sounding heroine. Both books (which share the flaw of being overly long and in dire need of rigorous copy editing) take a long time to get around the main point, which is the phenomena of \\"hooking up\\" -- very casual, male-oriented sex that has largely taken the place of traditional dating.Ms. Sittenfeld has an edge here because she's a woman and closer in age to her heroine, and also because she is a product of elite private education (she's the daughter of a private school educator, and attended Groton). \\"Prep\\" has the distinctive feel of a thinly disguised memoir, even though the author denies it and has taken pains to change the location and economic background of the heroine from her own. Still, the sheer mounds of detail and lack of action give the novel the feeling of an autobiography.Lee Fiora is a bright and high-achieving student at a public school in her hometown of South Bend, Indiana when she independently applies for a scholarship to the prestigious Ault School. This is about the last really assertive action the heroine takes, and technically it occurs before the novel even begins. After arriving at Ault, she quickly realizes that her academic skills are far from outstanding at this selective private school, and she is neither beautiful nor athletic nor popular. This causes her to lag into a wallflowerish, mildly depressive state for her entire four years. While this makes for some dull stretches, it's a very realistic look at the world of a teenager and certainly convinces as a look inside the snobby status conscious world of prep school academies. (You can't help but wonder what Lee's experience might have been had she stayed in public school in South Bend, where she would have been a stand-out academic star, rather than a \\"nobody\\", and if this was truly a worthwhile trade off for her.)Eventually as a senior, Lee gets together with the handsome blonde athelete, Cross, she has been crushing on since freshman year and they embark on a graphically described \\"hooking up\\" relationship -- in other words, casual no-strings sex in the dorm. Lee is in love with Cross, but he's a cad who is basically screwing most of the girls at school and barely acknowledges her in public. I found this to be a brutally honest picture of this type of relationship, which is increasing common, as so many low-self-esteem young women feel they have nothing to offer to the young men they desire except \\"free sex\\", especially oral sex., and sadly this situation only ensures that the young men involved develop little caring or respect for the women they encounter this way.In this respect, \\"Prep\\" is possibly a bit too racy (although bluntly honest) for a junior high or high school audience of readers, and yet it's precisely these readers who would be most interested in the story and to whom it would offer the most value. Prep school is not exactly a compelling interest to adults over 25 (whether they went or not), and Ms. Sittenfeld's story mostly wraps up at graduation (with a few footnotes as to what happened to some of the supporting characters). Personally, I would have liked more development as far as what happened to Lee, not just after high school, but how she developed as an adult woman after her initial romantic experience was so demeaning.On balance, this novel is very well written and certainly many parts of it are interesting and authentic in feeling. I do wonder if Ms. Sittenfeld, with her all-prep-school background (she even teaches today, at a prep school!) has anything else in her repetoir to write about. It's fine to have a catharctic release of all the frustration, loneliness and pettiness that make up high school (for everyone, rich and poor), but eventually we must move on into adulthood, where frankly nobody cares much where you went to high school."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was excited to read this book, waited months reading reviews and gearing up for a real ride. I was disappointed. After finishing what was a seemingly endless story focusing on the four years of Midwestern Lee and prestigious and snotty Ault academy, I was not surprised this was Sittenfeld's first novel and I was shocked that the marketeers aligned it with Salinger's masterpiece.I did quickly take to Lee's character and as a person who attended an all-girls school and is now a high school teacher, I could immediately see how dead-on the description of that first year was especially from the young woman's point of view. My problem began when time started passing and Lee, so full of potential and possibility, became this static slug of a character, slogging through her life and not growing or learning much. In the beginning, I was led to believe that Lee went to Ault to change her life and realize things about herself she couldn't in her boring life in Indiana. The last three years at Ault betrayed any of that hope.In concept, the novel was good. Teenage years are tumultuous, to the point that reality just does not seem real. Because of that I thought there would be so many 3-dimensional characters, good and bad, to really make the fictional gauntlet of high school as interesting and heart-rending as it can be in reality. This heroine, though, was boring and made me wish the book was about some of the other characters. Personally, I wanted to read more about Martha and that worried me a little. Whenever secondary characters start stealing the heroine's thunder, there might be some problems brewing.I started reading this really wanting to like it. I ended up feeling that the best thing about it was the textured preppy belt cinching the cover. High school is a colorful place to be. It's a shame I can only describe this novel as bland, flat, and prosaic."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I did. I bought Curtis Sittenfeld's \`PREP' without really knowing anything about it because...well, I liked the cover. Luckily the inside was even better than the outside.I loved the story of the extremely shy and overly conscious Lee Fiora mainly because it was so real. Many people who believed that Lee was a snob or who had hoped that in her four years at Ault that she would have evolved into some sort of social butterfly must not have ever been to high school, because unfortunately, things don't usually work out that way in real life. I can't honestly say that I was ever really shy but I was, as most teenagers are, very self-conscious in high school and being less than ten years out of it I can still recall feeling like everything you did was being observed by everyone. My guess is that most teenagers...yes, even the popular ones feel this way much of the time. Which is why I think that many people will relate to Sittenfelds \`PREP'. Lee's story is told after the fact, through her eyes as an adult, which gives the book even more credibility and likeability because she is able to be somewhat nostalgic for those days while at the same time realizing her mistakes.\`PREP' takes us through fourteen-year-old Lee Fiora's first days at Ault School, an upper class Massachusetts boarding school, all the way up until her graduation day. Lee is one of the few non-minorities at Ault on scholarship, which only serves to intensify her already existing insecurities. Unfortunately, the thing that Lee wants most is also the thing that she is most afraid of and that is being noticed. She therefore takes extreme measures to ensure that she goes unnoticed for as long as possible. She purposely remains friendless for as long as she can until her friendlessness proves to be too noticeable. She also does not participate in any social activities whatsoever because, well, she has no idea what to do in a group setting. Lee eventually becomes so afraid of anything happening in her life good or bad that she never actually lives it, she just becomes and observer and lets others take charge. I felt that Sittenfled accurately portrayed Lee's struggle with her family, the love and sometimes anger she felt for her best friend when she sensed that they were drifting apart and her first relationship with a boy and how often times they can be very one-sided. I feel that this book could serve well as a teenager's guide of what not to do in high school. Lee tends to be a little on the severe side in regards to her self-consciousness where sometimes you just want to scream at the book \\"get over it!\\" But for those of us who have already lived through it, you will more than likely feel some small kinship with Lee.This is one book that I truly did not want to end. I wanted to read more about Lee Fiora, her life after Ault and even her life in present day. I cannot wait to see what Sittenfeld's follow up to this one will be but I guarantee you I will be amongst the first to purchase it!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"At first, \\"Prep\\" looks engaging, but it quickly becomes a piece of work as the main character's whiny voice grates on our ears. Lee has no brains, motivation, passions, or ideas. She isn't good at anything, she is rude to people who try to be her friend, and I wanted to smack her. Is it any wonder she is an outsider? It's not because she is from Indiana. It's because she is a whiny blob.More than that, Lee is BORING. I don't mind hating a main character; everyone hates Scarlett O'Hara sometimes, but at least she is interesting. I don't mind reading about a serial killer as long as the story is engaging. But Lee isn't. She has no spirit.The story is blah and often doesn't make sense. We go through four years (and four hundred pages) at The Ault School, and in that time, Lee never changes once.When she is a freshman, her only \\"friend\\" is another scholarship student, an African American girl named Little Washington. When Lee catches Little stealing, I expected Lee to think about not turning her in, or at least give the decision some thought, considering that she'd be indirectly expelling her only friend. Or she could decide to turn Little in because she felt it wouldn't be right to say nothing--that could be an interesting idea. But no. We only see Lee catching Little in the act, then find out in a subsequent scene that Lee turned her in. It makes me want to smack the author.In Lee's junior year, she is still a stupid, boring mess. Nothing much has happened, except that Lee now has a weird hobby: she has become the school's official haircutter. She cuts people's hair because that is the only way she can get close to them. It's a bit strange. Then Lee gets another chance to change. Her English class has to write about a cause that is important to them. Lee can't think of anything, and when she writes the paper, she puts a note on it: \\"I don't really care about this cause, but I believe it fulfills the assignment.\\" (I believe the author is trying to parallel CATCHER IN THE RYE: Holden too wrote a note at the top of an assignment, stating, \\"This is all I know about the Ancient Egyptians. You can fail me if you want...\\" But it isn't the same, and Sittenfield should stop trying to write great literature. It doesn't work.)I was disgusted. Honestly. This girl is 17 and she can't think of anything outside her Ault bubble? It makes me want to smack her. But then her English teacher fails her and yells at her, telling her to get off the sidelines, and gives her an A for a haircut--Lee's makeup assignment. I hoped Lee would change after this lecture. But she doesn't. She did not deserve the A.Life goes on, blah blah blah, nothing much happens except for very graphic descriptions of oral and vaginal sex with Lee's crush. I can't understand why he likes such a stupid, boring, selfish piece of work. She is even chubby by this time. (As a freshman, Lee thought she might be gay, and even had fantasies about feeling another girl's breasts, but the author apparently forgot about that after Lee's first year.)The climax of the book is when (spoiler) a NY Times reporter comes to the school and interviews Lee. Instead of giving a glowing report, Lee confesses her sadness. Which, by the way, is her own fault, not the school's. So. She never acts on it, she just admits she's sad. It is not exactly thrilling. So she has managed to remain completely passive throughout the whole novel. We don't see much hope for the future.My sister asked me why I bothered to finish, since I obviously hated it so much.\\"Because,\\" I said, \\"it's like a train wreck: painful, but you can't stop watching.\\""},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The book is so clear and concise I was fooled at first into thinking it was a simple story without much depth. But I found I didn't want to put the book down. Lee is someone I wanted to wrap my arms around and hug and rock and at the same time I wanted to shake her. Sittenfeld captures a reality of life -- people in our lives -- especially ourselves -- can not be \\"type cast\\". We can be loving and vulnerable and honest and also fearful, selfish and closed, often when afraid, saying just the oposite of what we mean. There was a satisfying melancholy about the way the narrator, writing in the first person, looked back with acceptance and even understanding at her teenage self."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Sittenfeld has conveyed the emotional mindset of a sensitive, unhappy adolescent girl as perhaps no writer before her. So well does the book immerse the reader in the feelings of a high school misfit, that prolonged exposure becomes uncomfortable, calling forth the inevitable unhappy memories.This feat is tempered somewhat by the lack of a plot (other than the passing of time) and the aggressive unpleasantness of all the characters (except Lee's wonderful father, the only character with a discernable heartbeat).Whether Sittenfeld's accomplishment resonates with you will depend on how long you can bear to be in the raw, sensitive, overheated mind of Sittenfeld's Lee Fiora. I was impressed for about 150 pages."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm not quite sure what some of the readers who have posted negative reviews here expected when they picked up this book. It's an introspective tale of a self-absorbed, neurotic teenaged girl that's told in a first-person narrative. It's clear that the narrator, an adult version of Lee, is sharing her memories of prep school and how her own insecurities and lack of self-esteem had a crippling effect on her social and academic development. Lee is clearly a bright girl, but she is also one, how like most adolescents, is uncomfortable in her own skin.There is some indication that, prior to enrolling in Ault, Lee was opinionated, ambitious, and self-assured; however, she is so intimidated by her peers at Ault that she becomes introverted, unmotivated, and overly preoccupied with gaining social acceptance. Admittedly, the details of her neurotic analysis of each and every decision that she makes become exruciating, but I think that the details are necessary to underscore just how much of her time and energy are consumed by making everyday decisions that are inconsequential to most adults, but that are momentous to teenage girls.The most endearing aspects of this novel are: (1) that the narrator is so flawed that she is oftentimes not even likable, and she does not experience any real personal growth during her four years at Ault; (2) there is no neat Hollywood-style ending to this story, and in fact, the narrator appears to have continued to struggle during college; and (3) the adult Lee appears to be more well-adjusted and is able to place her experience at Ault into context, and realize that the world is a much bigger place than the insulated confines of a New England prep school."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Being 19 years old, and just graduating high school a year earlier than I read this book, I feel as if a part of Lee lived in me. All those awkward moments with her high school crush, whom she thought didn't even notice her. Not being the wealthiest most popular girl in school. The extra poundage she had compared to most skinny girls. I went through it all.I enjoyed this book immensely, and recommend it to anyone who went through the tough time of adolescents. Which would be EVERYONE. I don't think there is one person who can't just familiarize themself with at least one character trait Lee possesses.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the book ended, but not the way I wanted it to. For some reason I wanted something astonishing to happen to Lee. I mean come on it is a fiction novel. Things worked out the way they would in real life, I guess I wanted some fairy-tale ending for Lee. Oh well, now on to the next book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora, an average, peripheral girl from South Bend, Indiana, gets a scholarship to the prestigious Ault School in Massachusetts. PREP tells the story of the four years she spent in boarding school there, all the while trying desperately to fit in to the upper echelons of the old money social stratosphere of 1980's New England.Lee spends pretty much the entire novel trying way too hard to fit in, alienating the few people who actually care about her along the way, and never actually succeeding. Witnessing every insecurity, paranoid anxiety, and and ridiculous thought from the inside of Lee's head gave me a headache. Having to spend so much time in the perspective of someone who cared so much about what other people thought of her (while all the while remaining too clueless about the fact that no one actually thought of her the way she wanted them to) was simply exhausting. I think the most frustrating part of all was that I kept expecting her to learn some sort of lesson from her experiences, to grow up, to mature in some way, or make any sort of progress, but at the end she's still the same insipid, shallow, self-absorbed girl she was at the beginning.That's not to say that this novel had nothing going for it. I actually read it pretty quickly, because (despite the unyielding headache) I found Lee's deadpan social commentary to be fascinating. There are a lot of clever details, nuances, and subtleties that could only come from Sittenfeld's own prep school experience. The relationships also rang true in a raw way -- though I found the sex scenes to be so degrading that despite being one of the more objectively relatable parts of the book, they were almost painful to read.That said, I cannot remember the last time that I detested a protagonist in a novel to this degree. And it's hard to enjoy a novel when you can't relate to a single thought that passes through its narrator's selfish, short-sighted, utterly clueless head (not to mention the whole wanting to strangle her thing)."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I heard a lot of hype about this book being a great break out book for teens and adults alike. Unfortunately, I found it exhausting, long-winded, and unaffecting. Readers follow the main character, Lee Fiora, through her four years at an exclusive Massachusetts prep school. Lee, who comes from a lower middle class family from the Midwest, does not fit in with her rich and sophisticated classmates at The Ault School. And she does nothing to change that. Pages and pages of this book are dedicated to Lee's self-conscious obsessions about how long is too long to talk to someone and whether or not the people around her are secretly wishing she wasn't there. I felt very little sympathy for Lee and by the end of the book I just wanted to shake her. I expected her to undergo some sort of change; either to learn that there's more to life than wealth and priviledge or to become more comfortable with who she is and stop idolizing her peers. At the end of the story, Lee was pretty much the same. This is definitely one of those books that I read all the way through just to see what would happen. And I was unimpressed."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Honestly, I wish I could meet Curtis Sittenfield and have a long conversation with her. It is rare that I read a book in which the protaganist thinks so much like me. Although I did not go to prep school, and am from a \\"UMC\\" family, Lee's insecurities hit close to home. From her fear of making friends with the wrong people, to not fully understanding why people who she thought were \\"more interesting\\" liked her, to looking at mansions as a little girl and being told she would never live in one by her father. Even her decision to hook up with Cross not so much because she loved him -- but rather out of curiosity of the process, a desire to be like the other girls, and then to say \\"don't tell anyone\\" while secretly hoping people find out. I get it. ALL OF IT. I dreamed about this book twice the night I finished it.I know a lot of reviewers disliked Lee's self-centeredness, but really, it's very typical of a teenager. Lee is insecure, selfish, shallow, jealous, lost, but she almost grudgingly falls in love with her new world. What she dislikes in other people is what she dislikes in herself, and that is often a hard lesson to learn. I look back on my high school years in much the same way, cringing at some memories, but accepting them nonetheless because that's what I did, that's who I was at the time.Bravo, Curtis."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was duped into spending a whole day reading this book, duped by an attractive cover, an intriguing setting and several pages of glowing reviews. I thought surely, the sages at New York Times Book Review cannot be wrong.At first, the story is interesting, though implausible. Clever, sensitive, keen-eyed, observant girl has the courage to leave her family at 13! to go somewhere completely different from anything she's known. After a few semesters at the Ault School however, Lee Fiora (parents like hers would never give a girl such a cool name) begins to metamorphose into something bizzare & unrecognizable. She aquires a 2nd personality that sort of inexplicably sprouts and grows on her like a toxic mushroom - no doubt bred by the damp, & chilly New England air.The 2nd Lee Fiora is a self-absorbed imbecile without gratitude for any of the extraordinary opportunities given her, or even the daily acts of kindness some of her teachers and classmates show her. She never sees good in anyone or anything unless they are of some use to her (ie her best friend Martha), and her initial curiosity and wonder turn into ugly selfishness, meanness and repellent small-mindedness. There is nothing in her that is interesting or worth any empathy, because she's no longer a recognizable person. She's a synthetic character, a cartoon, a silly thing that could never be a flesh and blood girl. She's the sketch you see on a pamphlet, to prove a point, not to depict a person.There are also some ridiculous stereotypes that make you wonder whether the author has ever met people of different races/nationalities. Sin-Yun would never speak such bad English after several years of studying at an American school. \\"Sin-Yun leave school\\" or some such ridiculous 1st grade sentence is what an non-English speaker may say after 2 months of being in the US, not after 2 years. And believe it or not, even non-Americans know that referring to oneself in the 3rd person is weird. Obviously, the author never met a smart, educated person from Asia.I wish I'd never known about Lee Fiora. 10 minutes conversing or getting to know a real person would be far more fascinating than a whole book of this fabricated monster. The only thing I learned from this waste of time is that New York Times can be wrong, very wrong."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am not sure what makes this such a powerful novel. Perhaps because it has at least two layers.One layer is a story about boarding school, and one girl's struggles with it. If that were the only layer, or if it's the only layer you focus on, then there would not be much more to \\"Prep\\" than a screenplay for a mediocre teen flick.The other layer is a story of an adult looking back at her teen years. This is the layer that made the book gripping for me. I think most adults feel some degree of pull from their high school or college days. A mixture of nostalgia, embarrassment, regret, etc. Sittenfeld captures those emotions, along with the actual teenage emotions.I also think that the final scenes in the book are beautifully written. You really feel the process of Lee's separation from the school.Finally, the scenes, relationships, and emotions in \\"Prep\\" seem authentic. Precisely because there is no tight plot, because characters appear and disappear, because vignettes (such as a period during which Lee cuts other students' hair) lead nowhere, \\"Prep\\" resembles life.

There are many poignant and telling insights and descriptions, some wonderful scenes that carried me along, but all in all, it was too much narrator staring at her navel/author flexing her (considerable) skills. The story was flat, the main character not fully developed or believable (or particularly likeable). I kept reading it, willingly, but also kept looking to the end to see how many pages I had still to go. I kept hoping the story would take off, but it didn't. Too much of the same. But given the number of Amazon reviews, the book is clearly being read, which is something every author wants, so she's a \\"successful writer.\\" I can only hope she'll take her talents, and she does have talent, and grow into an author who can turn out books with more impact.

That being said, I didn't particularly like Lee. She is snobby and stereotypical; and just doesn't seem to get that \\"life is what you make it\\". She keeps expecting Ault to transform her life, but doesn't want to put any effort into it herself. I thought it was kind of sad: she isn't happy at Ault, but feels it will be too degrading to go back home. But despite not liking the protaganist, I really enjoyed this book.

Yet her gift--her ability to observe the nuances of her own and her classmates behavior-is both extraordinary and unrecognized by nearly everyone (save for a perceptive individual or two) around her.Sittenfeld tackles a subject that is almost anthema in our society: the one of class. She notices all the subtleties amongst the rich (there's dignified rich, and old rich, and simply over-the-top, laugh out loud rich). Small things--like who has flowers on their bedspreads--tell of great differences.Not much happens in this book. Then again, that is the point. When one is in one of these small, precious, insulated and isolated environments, one thinks that this is life. Lee, at the end, realizes an entire world had gone on for the four years that she was at prep school without her realizing it. And that comforts her.I highly recommend this book to lovers of contemporary fiction everywhere."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While Sittenfeld is a commendable author whose writing is heartfelt and convincing, her protagonist Lee Fiora is so frustratingly pathetic and misguided that it is a difficult read. Fiora is a character that at first you sympathize with because she is an awkward outsider, but then you grow to hate Fiora because she learns nothing from her past experiences and continues to make that same mistakes over and over again. Her repeated gaffes make you cringe throughout the book, and at the end you are thankful to be rid of Fiora and her annoyingly analytical and aggravating ways."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book made me burn my dinner,and forget to let the dogs out before bed. Sittenfeld and her characters of Ault academy captivated me from beginning to end. As a former English teacher, this is the first book that I've read since Wally Lamb's, She's Come Undone that really captures what it's like to be young,akward,and adolescent.By providing her characters with identifiable flaws, Sittenfeld made it easy to connect with the ficticious students. Although the book takes place at a prestigious prep school and there are most definitly issues involving money and social class, Sittenfield remembered to include elements that most people can relate to on some level; sex,friendship,and peer interaction to name a few. If I was still in the classroom, I would bring this book to my students in a heartbeat. As an adult reader, I enthusiastically reccomend this book to anyone looking for a new take on a familar theme. Curtis Sittenfeld is one to watch."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" has, like no other novel in recent memory, managed to make me squirm in embarrassment and recognition. Transfer Lee's four years of boarding school to four years of college and, eerily, that was my experience. It's both a delight and a terror to encounter one's feelings and thoughts articulated so perfectly. As I read, I was transported back to those four tumultuous years when you can't see the forest for the trees. Strangely, I am unable to maintain a decently objective distance from this novel--is it good because it's good on its own merits, or because I am awed by the experience of reading it? What I am struck by is the knowledge that these events are being narrated by an older Lee, at some point in the future--watching how that fact colors the stories she tells (most of sophomore year is missing, for example) and how she tells them. In all, a fabulous debut."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Upon picking up the novel Prep, it wasn't easy to put it down while reading it or to forget it afterwards. Prep told the story of Lee Fiora, a painfully shy girl at a prestigious boarding school on a scholarship. The book takes the reader through all four years of high school, omitting the summers when Lee returns home. While the overall plot wasn't what kept the book moving along, it was the brilliant characterization that the author placed in Lee. Highlights of the book are Freshman Spring and Junior Winter. In Freshemen Spring Lee begins to make friends, and a sense of relief and happiness comes over her; from there on she knows she won't be completely alone. In Junior Winter she goes back on a forgotten friendship and starts to date a \\"townie.\\" Throughtout the book, Lee is in love with the most popular, best-looking boy in her class, and their affair is described later, in her senior year. You begin to love and hate some of the characters...the ones Lee treats well and the ones she treats badly. Basically, Prep is the story of an outsider, an isolated girl who just wants people to understand and love her. I would reccomend this book to many, as Prep is a different take on the fantasy idea of boarding schools."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'll admit right here that I couldn't even get through the book. I simply couldn't deal with Lee's snobbishness and isolation. The entire book appeared to be an inner-monologue of angst. It was painful to see Lee brush off friendly overtures again and again, and then to blame those who made them for being too stand-offish.I don't know if Grotton has changed any since the author went there; as a (boarding) prep school student on half-scholarship myself, I can say that I've never encountered the level of self-absorbed angst Lee exhibits through all four years. A girl who doesn't manage to change in four years should never have won that scholarship."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am very impressed with this author's gifted writing style and ability to create a character whose voice rings true for a young person grappling with the questions of identity: \\"Where do I fit in here? Within my family? Within the world? And how? Or do I? Or don't I? Or is it just best to choose to remain on the periphery, and should that be my identity?\\"Even if you didn't go to an exclusive boarding school, there is much that anyone with recollections of some of the confusion of adolescence and early adulthood can relate to here. Haven't most of us had the experience of the discomfort and anxiety of fitting into a situation that is foreign to your background--whether it was at a school, a job, a social situation? That inner voice that says, \\"Uh oh, I'm in over my head here. I'll be found out. I might fail. What is my best defense?\\"Two situations in this novel stood out as particularly poignant (which probably isn't the word I'm looking for to give due credit): (1) Lee's brush with the idea of popularity and being known for something by cutting her classmates' hair. When her roommate Martha tries to gently enlighten Lee that her infamy isn't really what she wants it to be, I could honestly sense the pain and awkwardness of both characters. (2) When Lee's parents visit her at school for a weekend, it ends up emotionally disastrous for her and her parents. Lee has a foot between two worlds and seems torn by the warm comfort of the family she has left and the new, more sophisticated, arena she has fallen into. The dialogue, action, and feelings during this scene are portrayed beautifully.I agree with one reviewer here that it would have helped to have a better sense of time (80's, 90's). I grasped a reasonable idea by what the author revealed through references to music and such. It's a minor quibble, though, because the whole of this novel and its themes are timeless.Well done, Ms. Sittenfeld. I look forward to reading more of your work in the future."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Almost all books feature a main character who stands out from the crowd--someone with a sadder or happier or more talented or more unusual life than most of us. This is one of the few books I've read where the main character is not like that, in fact, Lee is a bit of a wallflower. She never once goes to dances, she tries very hard to not stand out, she harbors a crush on a jerk who takes advantage of her, but she doesn't brilliantly expose him or make him pay, she is petty at times, as most of us are, and she is very convincingly a a high school student. The very point of this book is not that she changed much during high school, but that she stayed herself. The writing is deadpan---it's written as many high school diaries are---a bit hung up on feelings, a bit melodramatic at times. Lee's family back home in South Bend seem totally real to me. She chose a life that took her away from them, and it's to the book's credit you never completely decide if that was a good idea or not.Most of all, the book's message on subtle class differences really rings true. I recently have been debating with myself whether to look at prep school scholarships for my sons, and this book certainly helped me decide. They would never really fit in. There is a line drawn here in America, which perhaps you don't see plainly unless you are close to it---the very rich and the very poor might not see it, but those who live close to it certainly do. We might say we feel we are all equal, but of course that's not the case. If it is, why are schools not all equally funded?I was surprised to see this book didn't have a higher rating by readers than it did. I felt it was a real triumph---a wonderfully written and very unique book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld does an amazing job of getting inside a teenager's head. All the musings, anxieties and personal declarations are forever swirling in there. Our heroine is charmingly contemplative and the story is great."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While the book isn't life changing, I found it to be an enjoyable read. It digs up the teenage angst most of us have moved on from. You cheer for the books main character, Lee at times while feeling embarrassed for her at others (hence her behavoir with her less-than-boyfriend Cross). In the end, she comes of age but I did feel like there could have been something a little bit more defined that made the finale a little more impactful. A wedding, a great job (she never really gets into what she's doing now), something concrete to show she's lived, learned, moved on. I just felt it ended with minimal resolution."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"PREP is a touching, perhaps disturbing, and semi-autobiographical (the author having attended elitist Groton) story of a middle class thirteen-year-old from South Bend, IN, Lee Fiora, who wrangles her way into Ault, a fictitious, prestigious boarding school near Boston, on a near-full scholarship. It is a tale of caution: be careful because you might get what you hope for.Lee could have never known the extent to which her social and economic class would make her an outsider among her fellow students. She becomes almost paralyzed in her ability to act and interact. She fears violating social protocols and how she will be perceived so much that she keeps largely to herself, limiting her speech to the perfunctory. Fortunately, she finds a somewhat sympathetic and understanding roommate. The story is told form Lee's perspective, so her self-abnegation is painfully evident. In addition, she distances herself from her family back in Indiana, regarding them mostly as an embarrassment.There is no doubt that the author captures the reality of the teen-age world - the brutal social dividing that occurs - although that is hardly limited to elite boarding schools. The prerogatives and assumptions of class are clearly delineated. The elite and their offspring operate on the assumption that they \\"belong,\\" requiring no anxious introspection.Despite these realities, it can seem that Lee's passivity and distress are just a bit overdrawn. Given Lee's daily ordeal, one can wonder how she manages to complete four years. Not entirely in character, the author has Lee stepping forward and cutting hair for students during her freshman year. Of course, that becomes expected and merely accentuates social differences; her \\"customers\\" expect her to sweep up the hair.There is little plot to speak of, but a thread throughout her four years is her incessant pining for class hunk, Cross Sugarman. Though she finally \\"hooks up\\" with him in a series of late-night rendezvous her last year, she is eventually forced to acknowledge the impossibilities.The book transcends teen-age angst. It really is a very thoughtful and prescient examination of a character facing very difficult social circumstances, experiencing a great deal of self-doubt, with limited means to overcome realities. As made painfully clear in a situation near the end of her last year, any attempt, no matter how mild, to shed light on the consequences of the assumptions and machinations of elites will result in the closing of their ranks and the ostracism of the offending party."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is pretty good. I like the fact that it's told by the character when she's in her 20's. The only thing that is kind of frustrating is that I don't know what time period this book takes place in. I'm assuming the '90's because she talks of seeing a cell phone once. The chrachter is very self-conscience, almost to a fault. It's still a good read though."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I looked forward to reading Prep after the good reviews I read here. I was disappointed. I didn't feel connected to Lee at all, even after being in her head for four years of boarding school. She didn't seem real and I wasn't intrigued by her or her situations. The writing was good, I enjoyed reading Sittenfield's descriptions of the daily activities of the boarding school students, but found myself bored when it came to Lee's love-life and lack thereof. Maybe it's just been too long since I was in my teens and I couldn't appreciate her situation, I don't know."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I think I know Lee, the protagonist of \\"Prep\\" after being \\"in her mind\\" during the reading of this book, and for the four years time of her studies at Ault . I cannot say however that I am sure she is a person I would like to be friends with or that I understand her actions. In fact there are many times in the story where Lee explains her actions but I keep thinking that this is a girl I am not sure I would get along with. There were so many upsetting things in this book, upsetting for Lee and for the readers as well who want to see her come out... enjoy the world. Yet, I had a hard time with a part like the newspaper interview - as much as I was sorry for Lee, getting carried away I was upset at her for not being careful.In spite of the seemingly sweet nature of this book subject (high school years...) and the fact that it is a good read and very well written, the subject is truly uneasy and quite disturbing at times. The main issue is not about being a scholarship student among other wealthy students, but more about growing up, coming out to the world - and this is never easy, especially when you have to do it alone. I myself felt these struggles only at a later stage, when I went to the University. Facing the fact that you are no longer the best student or \\"special\\". Anyone here is as smart as you are, and a lot of them are a lot smarter. Lee describes a harder battles who are not only academic and at a much younger stage.One of the happiest moments in the story is the moment of the bond being made between Lee and Martha, a bond that was never broken during Lee's time at Ault. This connection was so strong it manages to ease out and smooth some of the harder parts in the story.The main asset of this book is that it is totally candid, honest and real, with no sweet soapy descriptions. At times I felt however that the conclusions and realizations Lee goes through are far more mature for her age and could only be accepted if they were to be acheived at a later age.and also... I am so happy I am an adult."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Perhaps I would have liked this book if I hadn't read \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" so recently (last year). I didn't much care for \\"Simmons,\\" but I pushed through it, determined to finish. 50 pages into \\"Prep\\" I felt like I was reading \\"Simmons\\" part 2 and couldn't go on. It is very similar in tone and writing style as well as plot. If you loved \\"Simmons\\" then you'll probably love \\"Prep,\\" too. If you didn't care for the former, however, I suggest skipping the later."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This was a book that I could not put down. I was constantly yearning to find out what happend to Lee. It is a good book for someone who thinks a lot about the way things are or has ever felt a lack of confidence. Overall, it was well worth it to read and I really thank the girl I saw on the Metro with it because she is the one who tipped me off!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The author is extremely talented as far as her writing ability goes, however that the story was questionable. As a white female from the Midwest, I could relate to Lee and see myself feeling some of the things she did had I been in her shoes as a teenager. However, I was really disappointed in that she really never changed in four years. She made only one friend and the whole sex thing with Cross was also disappointing and disgusting. I also thought the author's use of stereotypes was out of control and unnecessary. I think the only thing that kept me reading was that I kept hoping that it would get better, but I don't really feel that it did."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Prep. For awhile, I kept waiting for something really big to happen...a cataclysmic event. But then I realized the cataclysmic event was being a teenager. I'm 52 yrs. old, and Sittenfeld enabled me to relive my teen years as if it were yesterday. Thank you for that, Curtis. Also, I give kudos to the author for realizing her book is nothing like Catcher in the Rye which I have read many times and as an English teacher have taught for many years. Two completely different stories; neither negates the other. Lastly, I recommend Prep to any 8th grade female and older. For adults it's a trip to the past...for a teen it could be the present or the future."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As you've already read, Lee Fiora was entirely unlikable with zero redeeming qualities. I'm completely alright with hating the protagonist, (Bella from Twilight anyone? Ugh.) But Lee is just too much. I can't say anything interesting happened to herin the 4 years, because she was too boring and afraid to interact with anyone.The other characters were so poorly developed that the only way you could keep track of them was because they had stupid names like \\"Cross\\" \\"Aspeth\\" \\"Horton\\" \\"Darden\\" \\"Dede\\"It makes you wonder about the author...All that education, and still uses ignorant stereotypes and sophmoric writing. No thanks!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be an easy read. The portrait of Lee, a girl with a working class background among her rich classmates at a prestigious prep school, is realistic. She struggles with self-esteem, fitting in, and romantic feelings for someone out of her league. She is extremely self-absorbed, but tries so hard to be cool and uncaring on the outside. Teenagers are like this. I could relate a lot to this character even though I went to public school. Anyone who had trouble fitting in in high school could relate to this character. She is often stupid in the choices she makes, especially in her \\"relationship\\" with Cross Sugarman, which frustrated me to no end at times. However, despite my frustration, I truly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thought this book was really well written and totally engaging. Lee has more than a few awkward moments, but I found them endearing and I could relate to almost all of them. An surprisingly complete and intimate character study, although the plot could have been a tad more structured for my tastes."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Sorry to say I got only about 100 pages into this book before I abandoned it. I really wanted to like it because the premise was intriguing --- ordinary girl from Indiana gets scholarship to an elite boarding school on the East Coast, but unfortunately the characters never sprang to life. The writing itself was pretty good, but I had to keep reminding myself that this was supposed to be about kids in high-school, not college, since the characters spoke and acted more like 18 than 14. This had bothered me all the way through, but when the main character Lee said something about someone \\"sporting a mustache\\", I gave up. So many books, so little time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep was a good teen book. It is about Lee Fiora and her four years at a boarding school. Lee feels like an outsider because she is from Indiana and is there on scholarship. She spends most of her freshman year alone or with one of her roommates who is quite and kind of an outsider herself. During this year she has a run in with a fellow classmate Cross. He took care of her after she fainted, and after that she develops a big crush on him that sticks through out all four years. At the end of the school year she meets Mary, who becomes her closet friend and they room together all four years. Lee feels very comfortable around her and Mary is one of the few people she can be herself around and trust that she will tell her the truth. The book is told by Lee. She is telling about boarding school in past tense, including what her life is like now. She relates the stories that happened throughout the year to her current relationships with people and life lessons she got out of them. Although she evolved a lot through the four years, at the end of senior year she still had a lot of maturing to do. And this was shown through her actions at the end. This book was interesting because the main character was very awkward but you were really able to get into her mind and feel her emotions. It did get annoying how clueless she was and how she always thought so little of herself no matter what. At times you wanted to shake her and tell her to stand of for herself that her fellow students weren't really that intimidating. But overall I recommend this book, it is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I recently read American Wife and enjoyed it, so I decided to try her previous books. This is a well-written book about the world within a world at a boarding school in the northeast seen through the eyes of a girl who never quite fits in. It studies the heirarchies that are found in any community, but particularly in a high school where there are some very wealthy students and others who are there through scholarship. I don't want to give too much away, but I enjoyed the book, even if I didn't always like the main character."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"In this coming of age story, an ordinary girl fights to succeed in the most extraordinary environment. Fourteen-year-old scholarship student Lee attempts to achieve greatness by enrolling in a prestigious boarding school. Besides the typical teenage girl drama (read boys and friends), she ends up battling mediocrity, loneliness, and class issues.Lee is written with an authenticity that will make you cringe as she conjures memories of you as a high school student. She's written with the unmistakable blend of vulnerability, narcissism, and naivet&eacute; that defines the teenage girl. The novel is undeniably chick lit, and may not offer much to the male reader, but is a relatable and modern coming of age novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I absolutely love this book and have read it several times since it's publication. It's a story I don't tire of and I find myself really feeling what the main character is going through. Her portrayl of the East Coast boarding school life is uncanny and it brings to light everything a kid of that age must deal with. Excellent, excellent book!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee is a beautifully drawn awkward, petty, short-sighted teenage girl. This novel is an incredibly well-constructed portrait of a teen struggling to walk the tightrope of adolescence, hoping that someone will like her and failing to find any true friend. It must have been very difficult to write a character who has no real affinity with any other person, who is so totally isolated, and yet we still come to know her so well. I was completely absorbed by this story - really wonderful! (I'm not really under thirteen - just don't want to sign on at work.)"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The writing in this book is atrocious, proving again that publishers will print anything they think they can promote. Also there appears to be no plot. And it is repetitive in the extreme, extreme, extreme, and so forth. I relied on a NYT review. Never again."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The book cover shows excerpts of reviews from well-known and respected sources that seem to think this book is great. However, it is not great. I only finished it because I really, really kept hoping it would get better. But it never did.The main character, Lee, is boring, negative, and unhappy - but it is ALL her fault. She has many, many, many opportunities to make friends and make her experience happier; but she doesn't. Then she complains about being so unhappy. As my dad says, \\"life is what you make it...if you sit around acting unhappy, you're always going to be unhappy.\\" This statement fits Lee perfectly. If I met this Lee character in real life, I would probably hit her right in her face.So, if you want to read a book about an unhappy teen, who has every opportunity to make her life better, but refuses every single one of them because she's too self conscious - then sits around and whines and moans about how horrible her life is...and NEVER changes...then read this book.In my copy, there were book club questions and an interview with the author. I glanced through it, and much of it seemed to center on how her experiences are universal to all adolescents. Um, no. I could not relate to Lee in the least - even at my unhappiest and most self conscious times as a teenager. I understand the concept of being self-conscious and worrying about what other people think - but she doesn't do ANYTHING AT ALL because she is so hung up on it. Unless her one friend is around (and honestly, I don't know why this girl is friends with her) she literally sits around by herself complaining about being sad and alone and by herself. She would say things like 'if I have a good experience with someone, I have to let time pass avoiding seeing them so that I don't ruin that good experience. And the better the experience, the longer I have to avoid them.' See why I want to punch her? She doesn't try, and that's the most annoying thing of all.I usually sell my books back to a bookstore when I'm done with them. I threw this one in the trashcan, with great relish.I was on vacation, if I was at home I think I would have burned it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was Lee Fiora.While I didn't grow up in a quaint midwestern town (by my measurements, South Bend would be considered a city), or enjoy a scholarship to a prestigious institution during my high school years, I can certainly identify with her social quandaries.I grew up in a teeny town of NH. I was the 'smart, quiet one', at least by standards established by those who occupied the nest of social definition in high school. Unlike Lee, I was excellent at math and managed to get >700 on my SATs in mathematics. I also withdrew myself from my peers so that they'd not be bothered to find out who I am.Many people have criticized this book, saying that Lee was an awful person and one-sided. To be honest, she wasn't. I'm not. However, she was me in high school, and because I had to be: I was one-sided. That's the general focus of being a teenager: you have to fit a mold. Your social interactions are calculated. Your enjoyment is mild and purely judged on what is acceptable. That is, if you've got brains and personality that hasn't shown itself.Luckily I'm 30 now and I've grown extensively since high school. In some ways, Lee was trapped in a prison during high school that she had to swallow the keys for. I empathize with her. If you spent your high school career being aloof, insecure and flooded with self-doubt, you too will find this book to be a relief that you're not the only one."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The good thing about this story was that the author definetely has potential. She writes beautifully, with realistic situations and people. So the start of the novel was promising.Then, it soon became apparent that the novel wasn't going anywhere. The main problem was that it tried too hard to be philosophical or moral-y. And Lee, the protagonist, was a total slacker. The end."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Maybe I'm getting as grumpy as a certain NYT reviewer, but I can't think of much good to say about this novel. I'm not sure that it can really be called a novel and that may be my biggest problem with the book. I know that it was well liked, NYT notable book and all, but there was no real cohesive element here. No arc. No compelling plot line. And our first person narrator wasn't even terribly likeable.Believe me, I wanted to like it. And though I didn't like Lee Fiona, I understood her. And there were great things brought up, great revelations. Yet, I kept looking back at the the number of pages I still had left to read and wondering why I should continue reading. I was really let down.I'm beginning to feel more old fashioned all the time. I just expect more out of a book. I was just looking for something to pull me along in this book. The author misses opportunities to make a point. Somewhere near the middle of the book when there actually is a crisis, her friend steps in and saves the day without a lesson learned. Disappointing.Was this an autobiographical novel? Was this one of those that could have been a memoir? It feels like that to me. And that's not a good thing for a novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was a little long, but I did enjoy reading it. It's filled with rich details and emotions that I as a fourteen year old can relate to. It seems to depict boarding school life in a realistic way, unlike so many ridiculous YA books that are out these days. However, this book was much more graphic than I was expecting, too much for my taste."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I loved Prep. One thing that I adored about the book was how well i got to know the main character, Lee. The book takes you through all four years of her College Prepatory Catholic High School experience. It starts off slow, but halfway through you'll never want to put it down."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I consider myself to be good with details and having a pretty good memory. Prep, however, fell into the oblivion of my mind. It was so utterly forgettable that the only things I can remember are: a bording school, a girl named Lee, and the fact that it was even worse than I Am Charlotte Simmons. The characters are trite and typically high school, the plot is insignificant, and overall, the book is, as I said, utterly forgettable."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" was overlong, and I found the prose to be unoriginal and the tone and setting to be underdeveloped. Lee is an incredibly uninteresting and unlikable narrator. There were repetitions of certain small details that made me feel the book was inattentively edited.Additionally, the time period was unspecific; elements eventually pointed to the 80s, but I don't believe that the phrase \\"hooking up\\" was used then to describe sex or making out.I don't get why the NY Times picked this as a notable book. I found it tedious and pedestrian."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"When is the last time, if ever, I have hated the main character of a book as much as I hate Lee Fiora? Nothing comes to mind at the moment. At the beginning of the book I saw some simularities between myself and Lee. But as the book progressed all simularities vanished and I couldn't stand her!Here is the plot of this book:\\"LMC\\" Lee goes to boarding school. She hates it. She spends her all her high school years pining after the same worthless boy and feeling awkward, leftout, and alone. She is ashamed of her parents, herself, everything.She is a spineless, snivelling, feel sorry for herself girl with no confidence or self respect.The book has no real plot. It constantly shifts pointlessly across wide expanses of time, leaving the reader confused and annoyed.And to finish the story off with a bang for anyone who stuck around long enough, Lee lets a boy take advantage of her and is still self hating, deplorable old Lee. No, you will not even be granted the satisfaction of seeing her become a better person. The story just ends and thank god it finally did.I'm sure there are lots of people like Lee in the world and that this book provides an excellent view of their world. But you know what I don't care. I read books because I enjoy them. This book made me want to recycle it as toilet paper.I do not recommend this. There are WAY better books out there."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Not only was this book poorly written, but it also contained no character development on a character i believed to be despicable. I have heard similar comments from other friends and family who have read the book. It was possibly one of the worst books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"...did I really enjoy high school as much as I thought I did? I always listen to people moan and groan about high school and I don't understand. I liked it! Then, I read a book like Prep and I can identify with some of the things that Lee goes through. Like most teenagers she feels rejected at times, like an outsider even within her own group of friends, annoyed by the popular kids, her heart aches for someone who she feels doesn't know she exists, she has parents who embarass her at times, etc. etc. If all of us go through the same things, then why was high school great for me and miserable and lonely for someone like Lee?Answer: I didn't whine about it.While Prep was worthwhile enough for me to finish, I wouldn't call it a happy read. I thought Lee's story was interesting and there were times in the book that I didn't want to put it down, but there are only so many times I can \\"listen\\" to someone complain about how miserable they are. Lee complains about her lonliness, how she doesn't fit in, etc. for the entire book. She longs to do more, but she does nothing. She knows she could be happier, she says it over and over again, but she doesn't try.I won't give away the ending, but it didn't conclude how I would have liked or even how I would have assumed it would have. It was just kind of a so-so read after all. Not great, not bad, just not worth reading again."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was rather engrossing initially. The author gives good details on the characters and you can almost picture them--with the exception of the main character, Lee Fiore. Lee's physical appearance is unknown, but her personality is bland, and her character weak.I kept waiting for the story to build to a climax, but it never left the ground. It was pointless--Lee went to school, and left school.Utterly boring."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The review I originally saw for this book made that comparison, and based on that, I was delighted to get a copy. But what unfolded was so disappointing. It wasn't catty enough to really give a peek at life in a prep school, (or maybe I just went to a similar public HS socio/economically)? Lee Fiora is possibly the most annoying character I can recall spending time with. If I were dealing with her in person, I'd have pushed her out the door. How her relationships, particularly with the object of her devotion play out (no further details here in order not to spoil the book for others), seem highly improbable to me. Unlike another reviewer here who sited Mr. Fiora as most tolerable character, I'd have to give that accolade to Lee's roommate, Martha, for putting up with her for 3 years. It's a dilemma to me how this girl was ever accepted in this school. But I believe this author has promise, and hope she'll try again."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"extremely untrue. Don't expect to gain insight about boarding school from this novel. I currently attend a boarding school in CT, and find this novel to be extremely biased, untruthful, and obnoxious. All of my friends who read it hated it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I have never written a review before, but I feel it is my civic duty to warn people that is the single worst book ever. I wish I could get back the hours I wasted on prep. It was beyond horrible. The main character, Lee, was the most pathetic individual I have come across in my 30 years of reading. She did not possess one redeemable quality and by the end of the book, I simple could not wait for it to be over. Lee was not interesting, passionate, compassionate, intelligent, witty, kind, selfless, nada. She is lucky she even found one person to be nice to her at school. Unless you are 14 years old and attend prep school, I can't think of a single reason why anyone would find this remotely worthwhile. Never has a book left me with such a bitter taste in my mouth. Lee was annoying and pathetic and it bothers me greatly that young, impressionable girls have been exposed to these pages of utter garbage - even for a nanosecond. I might add that I got this book from the library, and I am still angry I wasted my time on it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld has proven herself as a master of characterization. She has managed to get inside the head of her main character in a very real way, revealing the kinds of thoughts that most of us have had, but would never admit to. This book took me right back to being a teenager."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was surprised to read any bad reviews about this book because I enjoyed it so much I practically read it in one sitting. It probably appeals more to younger audiences- I read it in high school and while Lee could be frustrating at times, I found I really identified with her. I read in one review that the chronology of the book and when it took place was confusing, but that's not really the case."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I have no idea why I kep tputting off reading this book for so long. A friend recommended it to me a long time ago, but I'd never really had the inclination to read it. Well, I was hooked from the first page. Lee's struggle through adolescence is a painful one, and her character reminded me a lot of myself--not just for that period in my life, but because her personality was so similar to mine. I really was as insecure as Lee is in the book.I enjoyed watching Lee progress from secure child to insecure adolescent at Ault, to secure adult, though I would have liked to have seen more about Lee's life back at home, and what her life was like before she came to school. This is truly one of the best books I've ever read; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I enjoyed the character and plot development that Sittenfeld was able to provide. While reading, this development helped me feel as if I truly were experiencing life through the eyes of Lee, the main character. The one thing that made me dislike the book, however, are the graphic sex scenes toward the end of the novel. I found them to be unnecessarily graphic which I was unprepared for. These scenes lessened my opinion of the book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While Im not going to say this is the most captuating, cant put the book down book ever read (in fact at times i found myself drifting off because of how slow the storyline was becoming) I definately enjoyed reading it. While I didn't go to boarding school, and was not so much as insecure as Lee, reading her story brought back so much of my own self back in high school. I, like all teenage females, had some self confidence issues, some which just went away as high school went on, some i had to really work on, some which remain to this day. While reading \\"Prep\\", I was really able to go back to my own high school experience, even remembering a lot of my own thoughts and observations, and it really felt good to realize how much I changed. So, if not so much entertaining, this book is definately therapeutic!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I have not read a good book in a long time, Prep did it for me. I did not enjoy my 4 years of high school. The reason is because I was a lot like Lee, socially awkward. However, this book actually made me reminisce about high school and it actually brought on memories that I did enjoy: staring at the crush from a distance admiring him and knowing that he will never ask you out, the anxiety of how many flowers you are going to get for Valentines gram - which I never got any but you just always hoped. Since she stayed in the dorms, it reminded me of my college years (which I had a blast!) of staying up late at night sitting in the hallway chatting with your new hall-mates, eating junk food, and just talk about life. Even though the book also discusses social-economical status, that storyline was not the most interesting to me. I enjoyed reading about Lee as she matures and learns things about herself. It made me want to go back to those simpler times - well, almost."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld has written a wonderful debut novel that explores the insecurities and search for self that is the essence of life in adolescent and high school years. Lee Fiora, a student at Ault and narrator of Sittenfeld's novel, allows the reader to follow her along for four years. During this time, Lee watches her classmates, roommates and \\"friends\\" and tries to learn and discover things about herself through others. Lee constantly prays that no one will ever really see her or notice the things she says, does and believes. It is this fly on the wall mentality that Lee possess that gives the reader an honest and accurate portrayal of the awkwardness and trauma of being a teenager. However, what Lee learns, and what most people discover through life, is that no one can be a fly on the wall forever. Ultimately you make your mark and create a space for yourself. It is in these difficult moments that beauty and truth are formed."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Last night, I finished reading Prep.And after, I closed the book and thought about how I was going to articulate my opinion/review of Curtis Sittenfeld's teenage angst novel. Normally, I finish a novel and can analyze it fairly quickly and accurately but Prep left me feeling confused.I didn't know if I liked it or hated it. I definitely don't love Lee Fiora [the protagonist] yet I can relate to her [which makes her likable] but she really annoys me through the majority of the novel [so I kind of hate her].I, myself, attended a private school and then a rich public high school so there were many instances and feelings that Lee and I shared towards Ault [the prep school] but yet I don't agree with Lee's views of the school all the time or any of Lee's peers' view either.And about Sittenfeld's writing style- there were some extremely poignant paragraphs or observations that I loved, LOVED, and really touched my inner high school student but what I found myself doing for a couple of paragraphs here and there and here was skipping them. I NEVER SKIP a single paragraph but the verbosity of his words really bored me to tears sometimes. Although, something that I enjoyed very much that not many authors do well was the way he incorporated what happened after Ault. Sittenfeld perfectly wove the present into the past and vice versa without missing a beat. Another thing to credit to Sittenfeld was his portrayal of friendships. The loss, distance and closeness of friendships felt very real and true.Prep left me feeling a little angry, antsy, sad, intrigued, and bored. Basically, Sittenfeld made me feel like a teenager all over again. And it was not a particularly enjoyable experience.Borrow Prep, not buy it. Unless you feel a longing for the teenage days of past or unless you are a teenager."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I can totally relate with the novel PREP. I use to go to a really, really expensive summer camp when I was little and the only way I went was on schloarship. I was an outsider I only had a few friends and usually just one or a kind camp counselour. It was a totally different world and the ideas of society were vastly different too. I really do love this book because I can relate to it and understand the character! I would recommend this book to any one."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I went to boarding school. I was Lee Fiora. I remember those fall days with those golden red tree leaves, and groups of girls eating and laughing in the dining hall, and I remember always thinking, maybe i will look back on this and miss it, miss feeling part of this prestigious group of people. Which later you learn are as insecure and unsure of anything as you are at this time in your life. This book reminds me, that boarding school is as bad an experience, and as funny as memory as any you'll have in your life. Skip the 35,000 tuition, and just read the book!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"If I have ever read a book with the potential to be my life story, this is it.I am a student at a very prestigious Massachusetts boarding school, although not the one \\"Prep\\" is based on. I am not a Greenwich girl and my wardrobe, for the most part, does not consist of J. Crew and Polo. Like Lee Fiora, the book's main character, I had to convince my parents that leaving home at 14 was the best option for me. However, the one thing that sets me apart from Lee is that I thoroughly enjoy the daily life that my school atmosphere presents me with.I found it very interesting to read about the events and relationships I see in one form or another every day at school. For the most part, Curtis Sittenfeld does an excellent job of portraying both the tragedies and triumphs of life at a boarding school. Perhaps my life is not always as dramatic as Lee's is, but I have certainly dealt with my fair share of kleptomaniacs, social climbers and eating disorders. Lee's character is honest, and the book is very well-written.Many of my classmates did not enjoy the book because in parts it becomes a tirade against boarding schools and turns very cliche. While there are certainly people like Lee at my school, they make up a very small percentage of the population. However, I enjoyed getting a different perspective on my high school experience. I would reccommend it to all high schoolers and adults, but take it with a grain of salt- it doesn't always portray the truth of boarding school life."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was ready to love this book. But I didn't. High school is so rich with opportunity for great stories, and yet this fell flat. With all the publicity and accolades surrounding the publication of Prep, I thought the story would keep me hooked, but about every twenty pages I wanted to just put it down. I kept thinking it had to get better, so I trudged through. My problem with the book wasn't that it was terrible, just that the main character was so devoid of personality I didn't care what happened to her. Lee is touted as a nuanced and complex character by the authors on the back cover - were we reading the same book? Lee barely changes throughout her four years at Ault. She even verges on being downright unlikeable, and not in a love-to-hate-her way, just plain old vanilla bland. And humor? I couldn't find any. The funnest part of the novel for me was the game of assassin the students play. Lee is just so devoid of character or interest, she couldn't pull of the story. If Lee Fiora is the Holden Caulfield of our time, we're in deep trouble. I'd try another book by Sittenfield, because it wasn't the writing that was lacking, it was the plot and character."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is a well written coming of age story that is writtem for a \\"contemporary\\" audience. (If you wonder what I mean by coontemporary, think of the beautiful but somehow forgetable writing of The Lovely Bones.) But this is a coming of age story, not the sort of journalistic view presented by Tom Wolfe in I Am Charlotte Simmons, and readers will therefore feel the angst and uncertainty of growing up, a la Catcher In The Rye or a new book called The Big Kids which also does the genre justice. There will be complaints about whether this book accurately gets at boarding school life, but come on, it's fiction! Prep could have been deeper or broader, but it's still a decent read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Sittenfield writes about the age old story of an outsider entering the cliquish world of affluent teenagers at a private boarding school in New England. This book follows the story of Lee, the outsider, through her 4 years at \\"Ault\\". However, Lee never grows as a person or a character; she remains shallow and immature throughout the novel. This book, like the main character, lacks depth and meaning."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Before starting this book, I finished Oh The Glory of It All by Sean Wilsey. I read Oh the Glory because of Curtis Sittenfeld's recommendation on NPR.Oh the Glory is probably the best thing I got out of Sittenfeld. Please read that book.Sittenfeld has a knack for putting into the words the simple things humans feel and think but don't realize they think and feel. She's not a writer devoid of observation, but Prep has no redeeming qualities.It's true that Lee Fiora is awkward and self-concious like most teens are. But who the hell wants to re-live those painfully awkward and overly self-judgemental times of their lives? Especially when there is no pay-off in sight.Prep should be in the Young Adult section and I'm not sure why it's not."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As much as I have no desire to return to teenage life, still this superb book by this first time author is well worth the trouble. Well written and insightful, it tells the story of a young girl caught up in growing up in an old new england prep school. Her betrayal by the New York Times is particularly powerful ."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had hoped to find a book that would somehow continue the serious social criticism and art of Tom Wolfe's \\"I am charlotte Simmons\\". Instead I found this superficial, politically correct fluffed up fantasy version of pseudo elite culture, equivilent to a true romance type genre...shallowly written for those who don't want to think...nothing wrong with that I have my own favorite fluff novels...but let us not pretend that this book is anything more than continuation of a superficial version of angst for those who write professional reviews. You can do as well reading a magazine, watching some tv show or the like. This is not a book for a reader looking for literature, art or challenge. Why do the professional reviewers beat the drum for this drivel?"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was hoping for a coming-of-age book in a setting with which I was familiar. Although much of the setting was very familiar and really rang true, there was no personal growth in the main character. I loved the references to \\"morning meetings\\", adoration of \\"the seniors\\" and the \\"pet words\\"(patina). Unfortunately, that was were my experience and Lee's diverged. If I had known I was reading a book about a person with an avoidant personality disorder and how she dealt with the stress of prep school, I think I would have enjoyed the book more. Instead, I was sold a coming-of-age book, where the main character was trapped in her disease and never grew up.We did have a great discussion in my book club about this book though."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld delivers an acceptable first novel on a topic that is growing tiresome, the struggles of adolescence. Ms. Sittenfeld is the beneficiary of much praise from the likes of Dave Eggers, Tom Perrotta, Jennifer Egan and Wally Lamb, along with the New York Times. Much buzz but a light delivery is what the reader receives. There are moments of greatness in this novel of co-ed Lee Fiora at prep school in New England. But it lacks much depth and character development. It seems that all in the literary community are in a rush to find the new Salinger. What happened to Donna Tartt? By all accounts there is a rush to positive judgement about any reasonable young writer that they are the \\"new WHOever\\" before they truly establish themselves. This book is a reasonable beach read, certainly above the typical generally read bestsellers. It, in my mind, demonstrates a writer who is better than average but not deserving of all the praise she has received to date."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"don't waste your time with this terribly boring, pedantic and tedious book. barely anything happens and it takes 400 pages for that nothing to happen. if you want to read a good book about a young teen trying to fit in, making mistakes and learning from it, try \\"I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS\\" BY TOM WOLFE. Don't waste your time with Prep."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I never really got a grasp of the main character and I kept waiting for a climax in the book - which never took place. It is good writing, but the story needed to spark."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This Book was horrible! I heard really great things about it and so i figured i should read it. The main character is really boring and shallow and i didn't like her at all. And for her to allow a boy to just take over her life even though she knows he doesn't love her is simply ridiculous! I don't know i thought that this book was kind of boring and i just didn't like it that much."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"These reviews are so embarrassing to read. If this is the state of America today, I for one am glad to be going home. You don't like the narrator, so the book sucks? I commend anyone that can sit down and write a story, no, no, make that complete a story and, better yet, get that very same story published. Only. Only to have people write reviews such as these wherein they state that they didn't \\"gain anything\\" by reading it. Since when do you have to \\"gain\\" something to warrant time reading a book. Inhale. Prep is real."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"To be perfectly honest, I had expected a far better book than that of the one I read. While Ms. Sittenfeld clearly has talent, I did not enjoy her book. It was slow, even over exagerated. I, being in high school, know exactly what it's like. And no, it is NOT that bad all the time. And the character, Lee, was just poorly outlined. Especially by falling for Cross. I also hated the in depth portrayal of intimacies. For pity's sake, leave me with a somewhat purer mind than that. So, in conclusion, I did not enjoy this book, nor would I recommend it to anyone. I do not mean to insult Ms. Sittenfeld, however, I do believe that she could do better, and I wish her the best of luck. I hope this helped whoever reads this review."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I REALLY didn't like this book - mainly because the main character was just not interesting enough to care about for 406 pages - it had moments, the self-reflecting moments, that made me keep reading on (and I don't like \\"not finishing\\" a book that I've started) but they were few and far between - I would not recommend it"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"completely inaccurate portrayal of prep school. This simply propagates the inaccurate belief that because we have money and wear pink, we're bitches"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is pure garbage. The main character is dull, depressing and pathetic. I have not a single clue why anyone over the age of 14 would rate this book with more than one star. The rave reviews must be from friends of the author. Don't waist your time on this book. Oh, I suppose the book has one single appeal - the belt on the cover is cute."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this book, beginning with relish and ending with annoyance. It felt, overall, like Curtis imagined in his head what a NE prep school might be like without ever having visited one and then imagined what it might be like to be a young woman without ever having been one of those either. His characters are distorted cariactures with no depth and no sympathetic interest. If YOU have a high school education, I suspect this book is not for you. However, if you like insipid pop-fiction, and don't mind obvious imagery and blandly overdone comic characters, go for it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I can't remember another novel's protagonist who I grew to dislike more and more as each subsequent episode of her life was narrated. Her four years as a self-inflicted outsider in an exclusive east coast boarding school are a slow but steady series of mis-steps and missed opportunities. In her obsessed endeavors to observe what is proper and acceptable behavior at Ault, done in order to avoid making mistakes, Lee draws into a shell of deadened lifeless unresponsiveness. Every situation or interaction she faces is weighed and analyzed ad nauseum. I kept thinking that as time passed, she would change, show some spark of wisdom (as opposed to understanding), become likeable. But it didn't happen.Still, in spite of my frustration with Lee's inablility to win my sympathy, I would recommend this novel to others. Reading it was sort of like watching a car wreck. In spite of the unpleasantness, one can't help but look. And even though it isn't a spectacular car wreck,it's certainly something to set one's mind to work. This isn't a throw-away story, but one that should lead to periods of wrestling with your reactions, of conflicting identification with and censure toward Lee Fiore. Whether that's what the author would want as opposed to some other reaction, I don't know. But it's more than many other books have achieved."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this book as a book club selection, and while it was good for provoking conversation about our own high school experiences, I cannot say it contained much depth apart from liking or disliking each character.Sittenfeld does a nice job of describing the typical teenage angst that most of us go through at some point in our lives; however, after four years of it, I grew tired of Lee. There was virtually no change in her attitude, despite several catalyst events to spur that.When a book makes me severely dislike a character, I typically consider it a successful book. In general, while I may not have liked the character, I can't help but appreciate the author's efforts in writing someone so well. In \\"Prep\\" though, the development in Lee is missing, and it is her friends (acquaintances, rather) that remain the dynamic forces in her life.The journalist arriving at the end, and Lee's subsequent \\"big reveal,\\" feels like a bad version of deus ex machina, with some big event trying to wrap up a plot that lacked depth in the first place.While indulgent simply for the sake of reminiscing, and for sympathizing with Lee's desire to fit in, I think Sittenfeld just missed the mark."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I can't tell if the story depresses me because it so unrealistic or so very realistic. Also, I can't tell if I identify with Lee Fiora or can't understand her at all. I'm not sure if that's what the author was going for but that is what she got from me.High school can be isolating. But it seems to me that Lee Fiora creates her isolation. She has been told repeatedly that she could fit in so long as she talks back to those who strike up conversations. Could any child be so awkward? Would any girl who gets the most popular guy in high school want to hide it? I get shyness, I get isolation, and I get fitting in. But Lee is still enigmatic and incomprehensible to me. Does she never understand that Cross is using her? Is Cross even using her (I can't even tell that?). For all the hub-bub about social-class stereotypes, it seems that it was only a big deal to Lee and that the kids themselves really didn't ostracize as she felt they did. Was that great writing by Sittenfeld to show us the reality through the voice of the girl who is cynical?But I read through the book hoping for an epiphany. And it comes in the form of \\"The world is so big!\\" In the end, her defining relationship is Cross Sugarman, the boy she loves and never knew a thing about. She compares all her future men to this boy who likely used her for nearly a year for sex (but dated no one else either which is interesting). And long after she has graduated college and entered the workforce, Ault is still very much in control of her thinking, her life, and her social endeavors. Again, I don't know if many would be so consumed by life in HS, but our 'heroine' certainly is and that is perhaps the most depressing thing."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it didn't live up to even mediocre standards. It plods along steadily but follows no path. I felt like I was just waiting for something to happen. A few things happen at the very end, but they just sort of come out of nowhere. The main character is really unlikeable because she is SO anti-social and socially lame, yet blames everyone else for all her problems. If she at least developed as a character and realized what a lame dweeb she is, it would have been better."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora is an interesting teenager. She becomes, for whatever reason, interested in attending boarding school. All we know is that she completes the application process independently of outside influences. Lee tells us that she her public high school is not of the same caliber as Ault School. With a scholarship, Lee is off to Ault.And so begins our look into Lee's experiences at Ault. Her family and hometown friends are peripheral- she focuses solely on her time at Ault. We discover Lee's family only through her days at Ault- parents weekend, Christmas vacation senior year, phone calls. We do learn about Dede, Amy, Sin-Jun, Martha, Conchita, Cross and many other Ault students. We see how their lives affect Lee. I could not put down this book.Then, the grown-up Lee starts to tell us about their futures. Sin-Jun's \\"illness\\" and what happens much later is thrown into the mix. Lee also mixes her past and present in her stories. I wasn't all that interested in the grown up Lee, the 26 year old Sin-Jun, etc. I wanted to know every little detail about the teenaged Lee Fiora, Sin-Jun, Martha, etc.Anyway, Lee is a very disturbed, very complex teenager. She is the epitome of teen angst, insecurity, and fluctuating hormones. She shares with us all the teenaged taboos we all wished we could have shared. I felt that I got to know Lee quite well.The end of the book is satisfying. We get our closure on the lives of Dede, Cross, Sin-Jun, Darden, Aspeth, etc. As for Lee, well, the grown-up Lee is never quite sure of herself. We're left hanging because Lee is a work in progress. All we really know is that her clearest life experience happens on the T. And maybe that is all that matters- the small insights into life's mysteries...Lee Fiora doesn't have the answers, but she can take you on a fascinating journey through her PREP school."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"A book that beautifully captures adolescent. I loved Prep. I read it years ago and just recently picked it up again for a second time and found myself loving it even more.Lee is in no way and perfect character, but therein lies her charm. She's snobby, self centered, hyper aware, and downright obnoxious at times; in that however, I found myself thinking back of at least one example of my own adolescence and thus cringed at how I had acted in a similar manner. This book honestly made me want to go and apologize to my parents and anyone else I would have known during those years because I could see so much of myself in her.I'm also a fan of Sittenfield's ability to capture the details of being a teenager; of being back in school as if she herself were still attending. Boarding school and public school may be different worlds, but teenagers follow a pattern and Sittenfield cracked that code. Her ability to remember and express the tiniest (yet oh so significant) details that teenagers dwell on is fantastic; her painting a true to life picture about sex (and not sugar coating as many do when referring to teenagers) and other adult issues that kids deal with everyday is refreshing. It creates the backbone of the book.Would recommend to all who enjoy a good coming of age story."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I found \\"Prep\\" to be deeply moving, highly readable, and quite funny all parlayed with a sweeping sadness that propels the book from start to finish. We follow protagonist Lee through 4 years of Prep school. Lee is a character we can all relate to on some level. Her lack of confidence doesn't have as much to do with her \\"low to middle class\\" social status and being on scholarship( though this doesn't help) as it does her shy, perceptive, anxious and overly sensitive personality. The relationship that she accepts will make you cringe but clearly depicts Lee's sense of herself and what she thinks she deserves. The story recalls the isolation and agony that high school can be, be it prep school or otherwise. Some of the writing passages are so wonderful that you can feel yourself right there in the back seat of that car. The few encounters between Lee and her parents are brutally honest and right on target. I wish I knew what happened to Lee after graduation but while Sittenfeld tells us the professions and fates of many of her classmates, Lee's remains curiously vague. Perhaps this is just in keeping with Sittenfeld's overall portrayal of Lee as just a \\"nobody from Indiana.\\"There is no \\"sugary\\" happy ending here: this novel is painfully honest. I loved it and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book hit home for me with a lot of things. I was amazed how much like my former prep high school Alut was and the irony of it just could not be shaken. I appreciated the often times unsavory main character because deep down I think most of us have had her thoughts flickered through our brains. I found that on many levels I could relate on a roundabout way. I think if people are truly honest with themselves they will see that they have more in common with her than they'd like to admit--and maybe that's what they don't like about the book. If you're looking for an insightful, solid read, don't be fooled by the American Eagle-like belt cover. This book has got it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep hooked me from the first chapter - something about Sittenfield's novel is so real and engaging that it is hard to read without seeing some of yourself in the writing. Even as a college student, I felt like I could have written some the passages about my own life and experiences; Sittenfield has a gift for putting thoughts into words. The book is funny, sad, uncomfortable, awkward, but above all, real. It is filled with honesty and truth about how we grow up and come to terms with who we are versus who we want to be. I have recommended this book to several of my friends, and i have not received one negative comment back."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am currently in the midst of this novel and I can't put it down. After having read reviews from people who were not as pleased with the book as I am, I felt compelled to comment even before I have finished. PREP is Lee Fiora's first person account of HER trials and tribulations at Ault, her coming of age story. I find it funny that people are criticizing her thoughts and actions--we have all been 14, 15, 16 years of age and gone through our teenage years thinking we know it all, we are ugly, everyone has more than me...but we grew and realized that there is whole world out there that is waiting for us to come out of our teenage years and enjoy what it has to offer. We may not have written a memoir about our time but I am sure some of us kept a diary and if we looked back we would find some comments that are so unthinkable or laughable to us now.The author has done a remarkable job of capturing the teenage years--the thoughts, the naivetes, the mannerisms. It may not resemble everyone's boarding school and it may hold stereotypes but remember this an account of an Indiana girl going to an elite boarding school in Massachusettes--there are bound to be stereotypes that she confronts and must get over. I think many of the reviewers who did not like the book lost sight of who the narrator was--She was not a 45 year old woman from New york people!!!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Very disturbing. Basically a rich kid's idea of what a \\"scholarship\\" kid's inner life might be like....Sittenfeld's projections into an unlikeable wannabe.No wonder we are in trouble in this country when the privileged see \\"LCMs\\" (the lower middle class) as lying around passively waiting to be screwed. What a metaphor!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"It was a very engaging tale, a sort of \\"coming of age\\" story, but, like all stories of the same genre, it was very predictable. Lee goes to a \\"snobby\\" prep school and doesn't fit in. She suffers what alot of adolescents go through, a sort of \\"weird\\" shyness because she's ashamed of her middle class upbringing, and thus, she almost makes an effort NOT to fit in. However, the story was well told, but very predictable. It's very obvious the path that Lee is on, and the eventual outburst is almost expected.Not a bad read, but not as engaging as the bookjacket lead me to believe."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is awful. It's just a big bunch of nothing. There's no real plot. The main character, Lee, is a whiny, self-absorbed brat. The only common thread throughout this novel is Lee's self-hatred.Prep is centered around Lee Fiora, a girl from South Bend, Indiana. At the age of thirteen, she gets it in her head that she just has to go away to boarding school for her high school education. How she got this idea in her head isn't referred to until the end of the novel, and is left unexplored. There is an anecdote that she tells a reporter at the end of her senior year about going to Florida on vacation with her family when she was 10, but that is the only reference to her decision to go to boarding school in the entire book, other than a couple of throw away sentences about her parents not understanding why and that sort of thing.Lee is a miserable character. She's whiny, self-absorbed, and just flat out unlikable. She is so busy worrying about what other people think of her that she just twists in the wind. Lee is the worst kind of follower - she doesn't even know why she dresses like the other girls or why she cares about what they think of her. She isn't comfortable being herself, yet she doesn't \\"try on\\" other personalities either. She just freezes and retreats from every interaction with other people. Part of her problem is that Lee has poor self-esteem. This is compounded by the fact that she has zero social skills. She's not really shy, she just has no clue how to act, so she doesn't even try. Instead, she retreats. It's amazing that Lee managed to make a single friend, let alone maintain her friendship with her roommate Martha. Even then, she's second guessing and reading between the lines whenever she has a conversation with Martha.Basically, Prep is Lee recounting her experiences at Ault at some point later in life, at least ten years after she graduated, as she mentions that she went to both the five and ten year reunions. The story timeline jumps forward in chunks (Freshman Fall, Freshman Spring, etc.), so we're not getting the whole story, just the events from that quarter that stood out in Lee's mind as significant. Most of what Lee considers significant is actually pretty boring, run of the mill life stuff.The only times the book got interesting for me were when her friendship with Conchita was developing (before it imploded), when she first interacted with Cross at the mall, and when she was sneaking around her senior year hooking up with Cross. The rest was just filler between those events. Her friendship with Conchita died when Conchita introduced Lee to her friend Martha and Lee hit it off with Martha. There was this childish conversation about \\"stealing friends\\", but Lee had no sympathy or understanding toward Conchita's feelings. The scenes with Cross at the mall came across as the popular boy being friendly to the girl no one notices only because no one who mattered was around to see him doing it. He was taking pity on her and Lee read more into it than it really was. Then later, when they're both seniors, Cross comes to her room late one night and they make out. Lee never questions why he showed up out of the blue and acted in this fashion. For all her observations of her classmates, Lee seems to have no idea of Cross's reputation where girls are concerned. She just acts like it's a dream come true and does everything she can think of to keep him coming back. But even Lee knows in the back of her mind that it can't last forever, yet when it ends, she acts as if though she doesn't understand why it ended.The last few chapters of the book are Lee wallowing in angst over Cross ending their hook ups. She never seems to grasp her own or other people's motives. She never grows as a person. Even though Cross isn't the nicest guy in the world, he's a more well-rounded character than Lee is. He has more insight into Lee's personality than Lee herself, which is ironic, considering how trapped in her own head Lee is as a character.There were times when I had to force myself to keep reading. This book really grated on my nerves. I like characters that grow and change. If they don't change, at least they do interesting stuff. Lee Fiora is just flat and boring. I've disliked characters before (Scarlett O'Hara), but Lee takes the cake. At least Scarlett O'Hara wasn't boring. I didn't like her as a character, but she had a spine and a personality. Lee, on the other hand, is so forgettable, it's ridiculous. The author could have done something really interesting with this novel, had her main character evolved as a person over the course of the book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I can't tell you enough how much i love this book.I am not really one to read a book cover to cover, I don't really latch on to many concepts and find them worth me keeping to read them.But when i was in 9th grade (quite awhile ago ha ha) i was suggested about this book from a friend. She seemed to love it so i picked it up.WOW, did i love it! I even highlighted passages from my favorite pages.I still have my copy and always recommend it to people.After all those years it is in the top 2 of the 2 of my all time favorite books.It is not really \\"preppy\\" persay..

If you don't like it just return it..."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Even though the main character is shallow and annoying, what can I say, this is an addictive page turner. Many people have commented that her lack of growth is a flaw in the novel. I totally disagree. How many shallow people do you know that stay shallow? It's not uncommon - what's wrong with a high school student who doesn't walk away from high school with maturity and wisdom gleaned from those year? You will most likely find the main character's 4-year obsessions to be trivial, but you still feel enormous empathy for this character's pain. I gave this book 5 stars because it really is addictive."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I wish I could give Curtis Sittenfeld 10 stars for this book. Whenever someone asks what my favorite book is, I say Prep. It's a perfect combination of good writing (also: very plain writing, she sure knows how to tell a story without preening) and juicy, fun high school stuff. This book took me right back to my awkward school days, and I don't know why that's a desirable thing, but when you're reading this book, it just is. Maybe because you can think: Thank God I'm not in that place any more!I adore this book and would love to go back in history and read it for the first time again.Also: she does a nice reading. I saw her here in Seattle once and she was so unassuming and interesting and funny."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that people who neither have experienced nor feel interest in the East Coast, boarding schools, or semi-cloistered communities will have no interest in this book. A quick check: Do you like fall? Have you ever referred to a campus as \\"the bubble\\"? Are you in possession of more than one piece of plaid clothing?If the answer to any of those questions is \\"Yes,\\" please read on.\\"If a guy believed my value to lie in my looks, it meant either that he'd somehow been misled and would eventually be disappointed, or that he had very low standards.\\"The narrator/protagonist of Prep is Lee Fiora: a girl who falls in love with the idea of going off to boarding school and reinventing herself. After all, the only difference between the Indiana school where she excels and the Massachusetts school she aims for is one time zone, right?Well, no. Not so much.It turns out that Lee's new school is home to a sub-society of fabulously wealthy, beautiful, and talented people. She may have been the sharpest crayon in the South Bend box, but the kids of Ault School have gone digital. Perhaps an utterly-confident girl with a knack for reinvention could have swung it without problems. Lee, unfortunately, is not that girl (see quote above). Throw in the not-insubstantial travails of teenagerdom and she's pretty much doomed from the start.\\"There are people we treat wrong, and later, we're prepared to treat other people right. Perhaps this sounds mercenary, but I feel grateful for these trial relationships, and I would like to think it all evens out--surely, unknowingly, I have served as practice for other people.\\"The book follows Lee's four years at Ault, with each chapter covering a season. While the usually high school events all occur (classes and dances and crushes, oh my!), a few out-of-the-ordinary things are put in, too. One classmate gets expelled for theft. Another tries to commit suicide. A third comes out of the closet. (To be fair, these things may all have happened at your high school. If so, you and I have very different academic histories.)\\"You confuse being weird and spending time alone. But anyone who's really interested in anything spends time alone...if you want to be good at something, you have to practice, and usually you practice by yourself. The fact that you spend time alone--you shouldn't feel like it's strange.\\"Throughout, Lee struggles. Academically. Emotionally. Romantically. I won't say whether she comes out better in the end (you'll need to read to find that out), but you can be sure she leaves Ault a changed woman.I enjoyed this book immensely. I felt it had a strong enough narrative thrust to overcome being read it in snatches on trains and at bus stops. I'm a sucker for a good bildungsroman. I can also identify with that desire to move and reinvent yourself; I think all of us have those moments at some point, though so few people actually act on the impulse.Perhaps what I appreciate most (other than the examination of crippling self-doubt) is Lee's fascination with the structure, mores, and habits of her school. The joy she gets in reading the school directory. Or looking at the names of all the school's prefects engraved in gold in the dining common. Unfortunately for Lee, school's not just about the building. It's the people that make it...interesting."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The story was so-so in spite of rich details. I cam away thinking I knew what a boarding school was like. Although I more or less enjoyed gaining that knowledge, I didn't really care about the book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee, the prep school protagonist, is definitely a well-rounded, realistic character. Sometimes she was so frustrating I wanted to reach into the book, grab her by the shoulders, and shake her. She's so passive, such an observer, and so frequently judgmental (and often wrong). But her thoughts about how high school boys relate and flirt, how people of different classes interact, how adolescent girls often feel, are spot-on. And the other characters in the book seem so real, as well! Everyone in the book is a complete, full person. I buy all of it; nothing pulled me out of the story and said \\"this is a book, a work of fiction.\\"I wrote more about it (and other books) at my blog: [...]"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"In many respects this novel is a real achievement. The emotional realism and authentic details of high school life make this a great read. The fact that our protagonist doesn't seem to complete a grand hero's journey and arrive at the finish line with some hard fought self knowledge is not a big problem for me. I am even willing to extend some sympathies to the author who seems destined to be confounded with her character by nearly every reader who picks up the book. My problem, however, is precisely that she is NOT the character she wrote. While some elements are clearly autobiographical this reads as an attempt to dump all of the insecurities and self conscious neuroses of her experience into one character and this is where she is unsuccessful. Nobody is quite as one dimensional as Lee. She seems to have no passion for academics, sports,art, music, casual reading....ALL she does is worry about what others think of her and desire the attentions of boy she has a crush on. I am skeptical that this is ALL that anyone does. Perhaps instead of distancing herself from these things by placing them in an alien character who would have been of a lower social class than her own experiences support, Ms. Sittenfeld might have done better to treat her character with a more sympathetic and balanced eye. Flaubert can say, \\"Madam Bovary, c'est moi . . .\\" not because she was admirable, but because she was real. His work is successful in that it acknowledges and painstakingly unearths his own faults. Had the author attempted to construct a character she would be willing to be eternally mistaken for, her novel might have been a classic."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"My mother lent me this book a while ago mentioning that I might enjoy it as I had a somewhat similar experience to the main character. I didn't go to boarding school, but in 7th grade I was pulled away from my public school friends and sent to an equally expensive upscale private school. I didn't want to go, and it took some time (and a lot of hard work) to acclimate, especially since most of the students had been at the school since Pre-K (when they graduated, they were in the exclusive 14 year club). Even though I'm a male, the time period (though they never explicitly spell out when the book takes place, but it's fairly clear it's in the mid 90's) lined up perfectly with the time I was having my own high school experience.Going further and making the world one where the protagonist is not only going to a boarding school outside of her means, but CHOOSES to go, was completely open to some wonderful story telling and insights. The only problem is that your protagonist needs to EARN the right to command your attention for 400 pages.Sadly, Lee Fiora was neither compelling, enjoyable, well rounded, or worthy of being the lead in a short story, much less a novel.The biggest problem I have with this book is one I see creeping up in other popular young adult novels featuring female protagonists. These leads see to have a sense of entitlement that they offer something special, yet they never live up to that promise. Lee suffers a worse fate in that the book is clearly told from her adult self. She has had time to look at her life at Ault with PERSPECTIVE. Yet, her adult self clearly has learned nothing. The idea that the adult Lee still holds her relationships up against her \\"relationship\\" with Cross is disgusting. We all act stupidly and selfishly in high school. We all have things we'd like to have done differently. We'd like to have acted in ways that don't embarrass us when we look back on them as adults.No adult female with any kind of self respect or brain would look back on what happened with Cross with ANY kind of rose colored glasses. They'd recognize that they have been used (and that they used that person a little themselves). They might not REGRET the experience (because they could chalk it up to a learning experience), but they certainly wouldn't feel this was deep, true love that occurred. The idea that she can't find the right man because she keeps trying to find Cross is so depressing and ridiculous that if I'd known the book was going that way, I'd never have started.Furthermore, the one likeable character in the novel (Martha) loses her only good characteristics in inexplicable developments throughout the book. Her last one happening a mere 10 or 12 pages from the end of the book. Her revelation makes her seem stupid and shallow when heretofore she hasn't been painted as such. Now, one might argue that's the point, it's the change her character makes, but it doesn't jive with any of her previous actions or interactions. Though, truth be told, it's unfathomable why she (or ANYONE) would want to be friends or roommates with Lee.Having been in a similar situation (but I'd argue worse off since I didn't CHOOSE to go to a school like that, but HAD to), I find it personally offensive for a character like Lee to exist. The entire novel she feels she secretly is offering up this caustic, sarcastic, funny girl that hides behind shyness (but if you got to know her...you'd see all that she has to offer). She is none of these things. She is selfish and insecure, with ZERO personality save for one or two jokes here and there. She lets her self worth be defined by the \\"man of her dreams\\" and a friend she hasn't earned. Seeing so many of these types of female characters pop up in novels, it truly makes me wonder where the proper role models are for young teenage girls."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While in the hospital I had a choice of this book (left behind by someone) or watching The Price Is Right. I should have watched Price. The book's character (the author) is so unlikeable that I kept reading hoping there would be some resolution to her personality. Some change. Never came. She started out awful and ended up awful. I dumped the book to spare the next patient who might have the same decision to make -Price of Prep. I also decided to check out the reviews. What did interest me was the number of people who identified with the book's character. Now that is really awful."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was a little unsure of reading a book that took place in High School, but I loved boarding school novels when I was in HS! This book is such a great example of teenage insecurity, fear and the feeling of not fitting in. I have re-read this book many times and each time, you find something new. The character of Lee is well written and for me was easy to relate too. This also looks at issues of class, wealth and privilege in our society."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Somebody recommended this book to me. I didn't realize it was a teenager book. I couldn't stand to listen to much and I returned it to the library in the middle of the 2nd CD.Teen angst: worrying about outfits and popularity. Gimme a break. Wait till you get older and you have to worry about your health, job, mortgage, etc."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is a wonderful insight into the class system in America (I am an Australian who has never even visited the US so very much approaching this as a total outsider). I read it around the same time as I was re-reading Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence and found it really interesting to compare and contrast the two, ie, both highlight the power of social conventions and show how easy it is to get chewed up and spat out if you don't fit in. Lee is no Ellen Olenska though, ie, you get the impression that she brings a large part of her downfall onto herself by being so self conscious and hung up on not revealing her origins that it ends up paralysing her. Definitely not an uplifting read but very rewarding for those who can stomach it. In terms of comparisons, Donna Tartt's Secret History springs to mind but I actually liked Prep more than that."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I started this novel with very high hopes as it was recommended to me by one of my best friends who has a very similar taste in literature as me. I listened to the audiobook and was so entranced that I borrowed the hardcover from the library to read when I wasn't listening. I devoured the book, rushing to what I expected would be a fabulous conclusion. No such luck...Nothing really happened in the whole book which made me think that the ending would have a wonderful twist or resolution, yet it seemed to just fizzle.The plot of this book centers around Lee's experience at a prep school in Massachusetts. The majority of the students at the school are affluent and Lee finds it difficult to assimilate once there. The novel follows Lee as she makes friends, develops crushes, ends friendships, and goes through the ups and downs of teenage life. There are certainly passages that are heartbreaking as Lee struggles with herself, her friends, and her family while trying to find a balance in her life between who she wants to be and who others expect her to be.If Curtis wanted to capture the \\"typical boarding school experience\\", I think that she did a pretty decent job but it read too much like a boring diary than an insightful look into a young woman's growth during her teenage years. As a former faculty member at a boarding school, I thought that this novel would be filled with the exciting and sometimes outlandish things that happen at prep schools. However, I had no such luck. I am a bit surprised as to why this novel received so much attention when it was first released as it only really scrapes the very surface of adolescent troubles. I feel that YA novels such as \\"Speak\\" or classics like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" are far more poignant than this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"admittedly, i'm only half way through the book. but, even now i want to like the main character more than i do. i find her a little irritating and selfish. maybe that's the point, but she doesn't have enough good qualities about her to make me really want to root for her. at this point, i'm forcing myself to finish it since i've invested the time. not a bad book by any means...any girl that's gone through middle school or high school can relate at some point."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Summary: Prep chronicles the life of fourteen-year-old Lee Fiora who attends high school in a prestigious boarding institution. We follow her in all four years of her life in this school, as we see everything, including her triumphs and tragedies, through her own eyes.Review:This novel was promoted as a \\"coming-of-age\\" story and was even compared to the classic, The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. First of all, I will say that there is no doubt in my mind that the author of Prep can definitely write. He did a great job writing about teenage angst, and not making it stereotypical or cliche. There are also some great insights, prose, ideas, and dialogues in there. However, to compare the whole novel to Salinger is completely absurd. It just doesn't even come close. The plot and storyline was disjointed, the main character and narrator (Lee) was so unappealing and unlikable. The development in her character was also missing, and this novel being \\"her\\" narrative, it made everything even worse. It was as if she was still the same exact person in her senior year as she was in her freshman year. She did not get more mature, get wiser, get more confidence, or gain more self-esteem, or anything! In truth, I actually found her very, very annoying.The plot itself did not develop either. There were many issues and topics that were raised, situations started, but either they were not answered at all or the author took too long to give us an answer. There were also many loose ends, an even worse ending, and overall just a bad, bad, bad main protagonist.Consensus: Good writing, blah story with the potential to be awesome but is ultimately a let-down, and an even worse main character. Don't read it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I did not like this as much as I enjoyed American Wife, however it is still a good read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is completely captivating. That characters are so easy to identify with and you really feel for them as a reader."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The honesty in this book is incredible. Sittenfeld captures both the innocence and the struggle of adolescence without fear or apology. The end was the best part for me. Very subtle, but if you've ever lived in a city on a hill and then entered the real world, you will know what she's saying. Contrary to some reveiws here, I think Lee Fiora's experience is perfectly summed up, and just like in life it happens in nearly the blink of an eye."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep tells the story of a young Midwestern girl's four years at an elite New England Prep school. I ended up really liking this book in large part because of the refreshingly honest portrayal of teenage adolescence complete with shocking self involvement, and the lack of a neat Hollywood ending that brought everything to a happy, satisfying close. To do that would of negated everything that preceded it, and what is so great about Lee Fiora is that she presents her story without apology. There were times reading it I wanted to smack her, but many others when I recognized and sympathized, with a familiar feeling of, \\"I've felt that and I've been there.\\"Certainly one of the most painful and realistic threads through the story are the near heartbreaking passages of a first and lasting crush.Sittenfeld manages this deftly, from the searching glances to the near life and death feelings of,'I can't live without you'. Having very little expectations when I opened this, I was surprised both by how much I liked the book, and how much the character of Lee affected me. She's one of the more complex and fascinating characters I've come across in some time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This novel was very fast to read and quite engrossing. Lee Fiora, the blue-collar Midwesterner on scholarship at an exclusive Massachusetts prep school, was a believable and fairly sympathetic character. Her foray into the WASP-y world of boarding school is entertaining, a little funny, and more than a little heartbreaking. The author perfectly captures that time in a teenage girl's life when she is discovering herself in relation to others: her friends, her family, and boys.I read this book in 2 days, which is actually pretty fast for me now that I have a toddler to run around after. I read it while on vacation and it was perfect for taking to the beach or lazing by the pool. At the same time, it offers more substance and heart than your average beach read. It's not a novel that will haunt you for weeks or even days after finishing it, but it's fun to read and somewhat affecting."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I've had a very enjoyable summer at the lake to read and leave my troubles behind. This book is one of the best I've read this summer. Ms. Sittenfeld is a heckuva writer."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"My first review on Amazon!Possible Spoilers Sittenfeld quickly establishes Lee as a shallow, materialistic girl, who would also be vain if she had any confidence (the few physical compliments she does receive, she gloats over - so it's likely that both Sittenfeld and Lee herself want us to believe that she's actually fairly attractive, but Ault crushed her self-esteem). So I wonder why we are never given any detailed physical description of Lee, or really any of the characters. Teenage girls do obsess over minutiae when it comes to looks, so this just doesn't seem accurate to me. Of course, I could overlook this if it was an overall style, but it's not consistent.However, this is in no way the least realistic aspect of the book. The relationship between Lee and Cross Sugarman is ludicrous. As I mentioned above, Lee is likely of more than average attractiveness, so Cross's passing sexual desire school for her is not crazy. But the liaison would never last that long. Even if their relationship had been drawn as purely exploitative on Cross's side, he would have grown tired of her much sooner, because the female population of the school was wide open to him and nothing is remarkable about Lee. Cross says he was attracted to Lee because she was funny. I didn't find her that funny. This whole section, the last quarter of the book, insults the reader's intelligence.- nitpicking: there's a point when Cross first kisses Lee, and she explains how she was obsessed with kissing and thought about it all the time. How boring is an 18 year old girl whose only admitted sexual fantasy is KISSING? I thought she was Catholic, not brainwashed out of normalcy. It's clear later she's not a prude. It makes no sense.I think I would have believed the storyline more and had more respect for Lee (and Cross would have had more respect for her) if she was the one who sought out Cross. There would be support for that action since she'd been lusting after him for years. Then there would have been fallout for acting slutty, but at least then she would have done SOMETHING.There's no reason to like Lee. When she wonders why her super-achieving roommate formed a bond with her, I wondered too. However, though Sittenfeld seemed to want to make that passage an explanation in itself \\"So, this great girl liked me, I don't know why but she did, so that must make it plausible and I must be likeable,\\" I didn't see it like that. Lee's admission that Martha had no reason to be her friend just highlighted the situation's improbability. I was like, \\"Lee, you're right (for once)! Wait, why AM I supposed to like you again?\\" She joins no activities, but she doesn't seem to do anything on her own either. She doesn't even really do her homework. Cross tells her interesting people spend time alone; you realize all the time she spent alone was wishing she was doing something interesting.. Are we supposed to pity Lee for wasting her high school years and her parents' money, sabotaging her chance to get into a good college?I think Prep could have been excellent and that Sittenfeld has the potential to write an excellent book (just stop the comparisons to Salinger and Holden Caulfield - one review said that if Holden and Lee met in an alternate universe, Holden would love her. No. Just no. That's sacrilege. Holden would think she's a loser, cuz she is). However, the early reviews I've read of her upcoming book are all saying it's worse than Prep.Two stars. Might have been more for potential, but this book is so hyped already, that I can afford to be harsh."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"With such an impressive author resume and endorsments, I expected this to be a great book. It was not. I actually had to skim the last twenty-five pages to find out what happened because I just could not bear to read anymore of this tediously boring tale. Aside from the fact that the story goes nowhere, nothing ever happens with the main character which is even more of a let down. Lee starts out as an irritating, vapid mess and despite opportunities to grow, never does. There was not one moment that I liked or identified with this girl and having spent several years as an outsider at a snobby private school, I thought there would be some parallels. I am never enlightened about why Lee is such an annoying, horrible person, how her inner snob came to be and why she is so unable to at least embrace it, which may have at least given her some facets. The writing, while decent, is as flat and uninteresting as the main character. I can only guess that Sittenfeld has great connections because I don't see why else anyone would bother publishing this book. As I read the five star reviews, I am left scratching my head and wondering if we read the same book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"What is is: The Nanny Diaries goes to Prep School.

For a better example of Salinger, check out Andrea Siegel's vastly superior novel, LIKE THE READ PANDA.About PREP: the book certainly had its moments. It was edgy, fast-paced, and entertaining. However, a lot of the scenes felt forced and the whole \\"angst\\" angle was a bit overplayed. It tried too hard."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"elisabeth harvor \\"www.elisabeth-harvor.com\\"Several reviewers on this site have found Lee Fiora annoying, making me consider what sort of person tends to annoy me. Lots of different sorts, actually. But in general it would have to be someone who makes me feel ashamed to be myself. Or someone in constant need of an audience. Or someone who's judgmental in useless or superficial ways.But Lee Fiora isn't any of these things. She's reflective, yes. She's introspective, yes. But I never found her to be even a little bit annoying. I didn't find her to be particularly self-absorbed, either, or at least not any more self-absorbed than most adolescents, she's too observant.In fact in the scene where she's cutting Ms. Moray's hair (she's become locally celebrated for being a gifted barber, and since Ms.Moray has requested a haircut she feels she really has no choice but to cut this teacher's hair) she tells us: \\"We didn't speak. I think she'd have liked to, but I gave her no encouragement, and as the minutes passed, I could feel her becoming calmer, settling into the lull of her own stillness...\\"Could a narcissistic narrator have thought this?I don't think so.And could a \`shallow' or \`bad' writer have come up with such an emotionally astute description?No.In fact, Ms. Moray's ability to understand Lee Fiora falls far short of Lee Fiora's ability to understand Ms. Moray (as Ms. Moray's infuriated but intellectually limited comments on an essay of Lee's make all too clear).And although Prep doesn't have the dynamic lyricism and swift compression of some of the greatest novels about the trials of adolescence (Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and Jamaica Kinkaid's Lucy come to mind) I didn't find it shallow, for me it had so many moments of real depth. It's all about change and how gradual and deep that can be, it's all about the history of how change happens, it's all about that trajectory....Scene by scene we see how adolescent friendships develop, how crushes begin, how rumors spread, how cavalier many people can be about causing other people pain. And we also see how a teacher like Ms. Moray, initially popular with the students at Ault, loses their affection by imposing politically correct agendas on complex issues and moral dilemmas.But at the same time I can't help but feel that Prep could have been a more thrilling and memorable book if it had been more compressed and if many of its scenes (and also many of its words) had been chosen with greater fierceness; while I was reading it I was too often reminded of the advice Virginia Woolf gives to writers in Granite and Rainbow, advice I'll try to accurately paraphrase here: The writer's task is to take one thing and make it stand for twenty, only then is the reader relieved of the great swarm of life...But then Woolf practiced the bracing tyrannies of a poet whereas Sittenfeld is a more quiet and democratic writer (but also, inevitably, a less alluring one) and it seems to be in her nature to be honest rather than seductive. And so I would have to agree with the reviewers here who found the writing, overall, a little dull because it does lack a certain originality and excitement.When I was reading one of the first reviews of Prep, though, I admired the following quote from the book so much that I decided that if it had only this one great insight in it, it would still be worth whatever I'd have to pay for it. And so I knew that I'd be buying it and not only reading it, but keeping it. So here's the quote: \\"I believed then that if you had a good encounter with a person, it was best not to see them again for as long as possible...\\"If you have this kind of belief about yourself at fourteen, it can fill you with secret shame. But if you're looking back from adulthood and you can remember having believed this at fourteen, it can fill you with surprised and affectionate respect for your younger self.I'm grateful for the times I felt this same kind of surprised and affectionate respect for Curtis Sittenfeld and like many of the other readers on this site I'm really looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is boring! Lee Fiora is joyless. Her constant angst was depressing - she was on the outside because she chose to be, and lamented the fact for 406 pages. The other characters were one-dimensional, except for Martha. I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been about Martha - special and ordinary in Lee's words. Her \\"hook-up\\" with Cross Sugarman was not believable, and by that time I wondered why he would bother with someone so uninteresting, so unremarkable, so nothing. She excelled at nothing, because she made no attempt to be anything but an outsider. How could she have been so special at home? The book was awful. If I see the author's name again, I will run."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As an African-American woman who graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree Cum Laude, currently in grad school, and an active freelance writer, I am always discouraged when I read about people who feed into stereotypes. Believe it or not, there are very successful and intelligent Black people in this world who didn't get where they got through scholarships, athletics, and rapping. I don't knock these ways of getting ahead, but this story fed into so many negative stereotypes to the point where I wanted to know what DECADE this book was in.I hadn't even gotten to page 40 and I read about:#1 A Black girl, Little Washington, who left pubic hair in the sink, was a thief, spoke broken English, only got in through scholarship, and had a foul mouth. The 1st and 3rd line of dialogue when she's introduced are \\"That b@#%@ is crazy\\" and \\"She ain't funny.\\"#2 Little's sister's name was Big, as if she couldn't possibly have a more civilized name.#3 Sin-Jun, the third roommate, was an Asian student who couldn't speak English very well and didn't seem to notice that dried squid was smelling up their room. The girl may be foreign, but I'm sure her senses work very well.#4 \\"Darden Pittard, who was our class's cool black guy; Darden was good at basketball and from the Bronx and wore a gold chain...\\" As if it's not possible for a brotha to get into private school without athletics. Ofcourse he had a white girlfriend and tacky jewelry to go along with his oh-so-convenient hometown of a ghetto.#5 On page 44, the narrator says \\"Intermittently, I tried making conversation with Rufina Sanchez, who'd been recruited to Ault from a public school in San Diego and who was so pretty that I'd have been intimidated to talk to her if she were white...\\"It was so depressing to find out that this book was copywritten in 2005. In the current century, a book like this not only supports stereotypes but helps folks who already simple-minded reinforce their own beliefs. By the time I got to page 50, I took the book back to the library. There was no way I could stomach the rest of this novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The main character was so entirely unsympathetic, if not to say downright ghastly on occasion, that as the book went on I found it very difficult to relate to her, much less empathise with her situation."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I heard about Prep by way of Arts Journal, Terry Teachout's blog. I thought, gad another tiresome J D Salinger tome, this time written by a young woman. Oh no! Chick Lit! Before going into full bodice buster alert, I read what Terry had to say, putting the book on my list. Three months later I read and guess what? I loved Prep, and Curtis Sittenfeld, now a thirty-something I think, has written a fine book. She's the new Jane Austen. Austen's country gentry morph into rich American High School kids. Curtis's alter ego, Lee Fiora has wrestled a scholarship to a fancy private school on the East Coast. She thinks it'll be really cool, but maybe she should have attended an Indiana high school and partied with her true peers. The rich aren't like you and me said an author once.So overachieving Lee at fourteen is overwhelmed immediately without mom and dad for a prop up. The kids are smart, rich and savvy, and they seem to have a cultural code written in invisible ink. Snafu after awkward embarrassment befalls our heroine and she is beaten down into a sniveling cracker eater. For the next four years, she over-analyzes every social move to the point of teen paralysis. In less weighty hands than Ms. Sittenfeld, Lee would be considered a boring navel gazer which is a step or two lower than a senseless slacker, but her gazing is so insightful and clever, though often wrong-headed, we wonder if her logic would overcome Socrates.The title brings to mind the young adult market, but Prep is not for kids. You can put an R rating in those argyle socks, because Lee is so passive, the local heartthrob can pretty much write his own ticket on her ass. In the end, I'm paraphrasing Sittenfeld, high school is a golden opportunity of possibility, but adulthood: you are what you are.I read the author interview included in the Random House Trade Paperback, 2005 and was surprised that Sittenfeld attended, nay, endorses the famous Iowa Workshop where she loved her teachers. How often do you hear that kind of thing, but between preppy school connection and workshop crony, obviously her work has gotten about. She says she is not a fan of precious prose with limp plotting. She's kind of an old fashioned entertainer though I can assure you she writes beautifully. I hope to hear more from this rising star."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Loved this book; it brought back painful adolescent memories of extreme selfconsciousness, when you're dying to be noticed and to be invisible at the same time. And Curtis Sittenfeld is a first rate writer too. Even the most minor characters (like Aubrey) are completely recognizable and memorable. For those who complained that Lee did not change much over the course of 4 years, well that's real life isn't it? It's more novel-like to think there will be some great transformation but it's more recognizable that we mostly remain the same even if we don't much like the self we are.My only negative was, what time period was this novel supposed to represent? It seemed like the late 80s because the parents drove a Datsun, there was no Internet, cell phone and people still played cassettes along with CDs. On the other hand, from my memory, at that time \\"hooking up\\" (as a term and a concept) thankfully did not exist among teens. Otherwise, highly enjoyable read"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I just finished this book last night and I was just happy that I got through it. The author's writing and way with words was the only thing that kept me going. The main character, Lee, was un-interesting and did nothing but basically pity herself for the entire novel. I couldn't figure out if we were supposed to feel sorry for her or not. Then there were some very descriptive intimate scenes towards the end of the book which basically just really grossed me out when I kept thinking to myself that the scenes were about two highschoolers. If you're looking for something with a real heartfelt story and a main character you will really care about, this is not the book for you. However, I would give this author another chance (with a different book)."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I just finished reading this novel and I find that it is without a doubt one of the best novels I've read in such a long time. It is a coming of age story for a female. The angst Lee feels attending Ault is dead-on. While at times her angst gets overwhelming and exhausting to the reader, it is so realistic. That's exactly what it is like to doubt your worth and your sense of self when you feel like an outsider in a new environment. The scenes with Cross are perfect as well. The way Lee doesn't have faith in herself to believe that Cross would really like her and they could be a couple is more true to life than if the author had given them a happy ending. Sittenfield knows the voice of this character. For all the girls out there who don't believe they fit in, this is your book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"one day while on vacation in florida, a young, impressionable, and naive, lee fiora is driving by beautiful waterfront houses with large bay windows, hammocks, and palm trees when she asks her father if she and her family could buy a house like the ones described. her father laughs and explains that people like her family did not live in those types of houses. years later she decides that she wants to attend a boarding school in massachusetts, thousands of miles away from her middle class family in indiana. she wants to be the exact opposite of everything her family is and throughout her four years in high school she somewhat tries to achieve this goal by not drawing attention to herself. lee is painfully akward and microanalyzes every social interation she encounters. in some ways it is easy to dislike lee because she is often snobby and self absorbed, but one also sympathizes with her because it is only natural to want such things as nice clothes, guys, good grades, attractive parents, and pretty smelling hair. i can relate to this book because i attend a very similar school to the one lee attends in the novel. i enjoyed the book because it is extremely accurate as to what life is like at a boarding school. it is a place that can at times be wonderful, but it can also accentuate (at least to oneself) everything that you are not. for some this book may seem dull, but i think that it is very true to life, which doesn't always mean super-meaningful, or exciting. i took one main thing from this book. while attending a school like lee's (it can seem like a bubble separated from the outside world) it is easy to become consumed in things that seem all important to you, but are actually materialistic and shallow. this book got me to step back and realize that its a big world out there and that one shouldnt stress about insignificant, superficial things that dont really matter in the grand scheme of things; such as if you look awkward walking up to a certain group of students on the quad, whether or not you have $150 jeans, or if you look like a loser for being a roomate w/ the girl who is a minority and is on scholarship. all in all i think this is a pretty good read for teenagers who are looking for something that will help them in a way try to put things in perspective."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Of course, I didn't like \\"She's Come Undone.\\" Both books are about a girl who is disconnected from the world. Sittenfeld's novel was mildly entertaining, but if she'd used the words \\"definitive\\" or \\"definitively\\" one more time, I was going to throw the book in the toilet.Interesting narrative, but her jumps between Ault and life-after-Ault were annoying. For example, there was some minor suspense regarding \\"spring-cleaning,\\" but a review of Lee's yearbook clearly shows that she was not thrown out... so much for that."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I simply adore it!What a marvelous, nuanced and sensitively written novel! PREP is just a lovely book, very well written, page after delicate page.This is the story of a poor, impoverished (a few might say \\"blue-collar\\") young lady who is granted the opportunity to share her otherwise wretched middle-class high school years at a respectable, civilized boarding school called Ault. There she meets well-bred children, (boys and girls from wonderful families) and tries (though unsuccessfully) to \\"fit in.\\"This book recalls my own wonderful years spent at a Prep school much like Ault, when I was gracious enough to be kind to such unfortunate, less-distinguished creatures as Lee Fiora.I cannot tell you how much I loved this wonderful book. The writing is marvelous. So sweet. Restrained. People have mentioned \\"stereo-types\\" but I don't see any. Yes, a black girl is a thief, yes a Jewish girl has a big nose -- so what. This is a book I enjoyed wholeheartedly while drinking my afternoon chamomile tea.PREP is just simply a marvelous book, one all you children should purchase right away. Believe me, I know good writing when I see it!A novel I certainly DON'T recommend is one another reviewer has mentioned -- called, \\"THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition,\\" which is completely disgusting, full of vulgar people, freaks and transvestites -- even lesbians! Not to mention it's also full of rampant alcohol use, drugs and raw dancing. Set in the cesspool of New York City, it seems to promote the most disgraceful, wretched behavior I have ever seen, heard about or read!Do yourselves a favor and stick with a nice book, like PREP. And learn to behave yourselves and grown up and be civilized men and women, useful members of society. You'll be much better off.PREP is just a wonderful book - if you don't believe me, just read the wonderful reviews in all of America's finest newspapers and magazines. I've already had my education!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I picked this book up because it was reviewed in The New Yorker. It had a catchy title, a vivid book jacket, and a promising subject: an expos&eacute; of what modern life inside an exclusive New England preparatory school encompasses.What I read disappointed. Lee Fiora is a shy girl from a middle class Indiana family. She had done well in elementary and junior high school. Unassisted by her parents, and unexplained by the author, she wins a scholarship to toney Massachusetts preparatory school, \\"Ault School.\\" Once on campus she is intimidated by the beautiful people, turns inward and whines her way through four years. She is a self-made underachiever and loner, a classic introvert. She excels at nothing, hides in her room for most of four years and dotes on the big man on campus. So, ho-hum, quickly PREP becomes less a lens on life in an exclusive academy and more of an insufferable tome on the social perils of teenage adolescence. We certainly didn't need to center the book in a prep school; any secondary school in North America might have sufficed. And yes, anyone who had difficult self-centered moments during their teen years, (not you - right?) might identify with Lee. But it doesn't make her any more interesting.At 403 pages it is too long. Character development of the most interesting possibilities at the school - the \\"bank boys\\", the kitchen staffer, or the teachers come to mind - isn't permitted by the total self-infatuation of the protagonist. She never gets to know anyone, she complains; sadly, neither does the reader. If F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about the rich being very different, we certainly cannot turn to PREP to instruct us how they differ. Except for the use of WASPY names like Aspeth and Cross and Dede, we aren't really introduced to their worlds at all.It's also old. This is no view on today's prep school. No cell phones, no XTC, no form-fitting blouses, no text messaging or Internet or 9/11 discussion. It all happened in an ill defined past.This is a predictable, clich&eacute;-filled, portrait of a teen struggling with finding herself. It's just not very compelling. Skip it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had heard good things about this book and it looked to be an interesting novel of teen self-discovery. The main character, however, was rarely redeemable in any situation in the book. Slavish to men, to authority, to the wills and wiles of her peers, Lee Fiora was neither complex nor very interesting. Overthinking every situation was one of her specialities, a characteristic that Ms. Sittenfeld played up so much that it became hard to endure. I think perhaps worst of all, was the fact that Lee seemed to never learn from her mistakes. Every so often, she would discuss how she would later react to a similar situation in the future and oftentimes, it was not that different from her teen self, especially situations involving men. I find this disheartening and not true to the fact that the author seemed to think Lee was actually learning something from her surroundings. It was a lesson in what a dismal, self-fulfilling prophecy life can be if you let it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is the perfect summer book. The characters are well developed but the plot isn't too heavy. I love this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"PREP was such a breath of fresh air fo me. I normally have my head stuffed in Psych books, which tend to get a little old despite how much I love my profession. My Mother passed away on the 2nd of April, 2005 from Lung Cancer and this book just helped me to get through, well, the first tough day of grieving. I live in New England, went to a private Highschool-(not boarding, just had to manage the train until I got my liscence), and then onto Mt. HolyJoke for undergrad so the descriptions of the students, the very articulate descriptions of the campus as it changes from season to season, the protagonist, and the supporting cast of characters made me laugh, slightly regret some things I may have done in my past, and just remember my days in highschool as being fun, weird, awkward, boring, enlightening, and asking who had a brother next door at Prep? (Brother school to my highschool;)) My friend who moved to Cali from CT read the book at the same time and we agreed that, if you know NE and the attitudes of its inhabitants towards \\"society,\\" imagine a child from the midwest going to prepschool on a scholarship. This is a character you feel for b/c anyone with a semi-functional brain can understand why she is who she is, and how she changed from a midwestern girl to a savy, NE woman. I think both males and females will easily relate to her character only because everyone feels the teen angst that she experiences at some point along the way. Granted, I'm not going to hold my breath to see how many men actually read this book but those who have (my fiancee, friends' husbands) have all enjoyed it. This was such an enjoyable read that it's sitting in a prominent place in my library at home.

However PREP has infuriated me to the point where I need to vent. Never has a book simultaneously bored and riled me! The main character, Lee, is a snippy, whiny, unmotivated and throughly dislikeable person; unfortunately she is surrounded by a cast of characters equally unengaging. If this is an autobiographical novel, perhaps we can excuse the tedious, mundane story and the intensely irritating characters. However that does NOT excuse the sloppy writing -- particularly from someone with the stellar credentials of the author. (If the book is not autobiographical . . . .well, shame!)The central character never grows, never grabs opportunities for self-improvement, never learns from her mistakes. If you don't like her in the first chapter, sorry! \\"What you see is what you get.\\" Lee remains cynical, bitter, mypoic and unpleasant throughout. Her teachers come across as academic lamebrains, her peers as one-dimensional typecasts. In true \\"PC\\" mode, one is set up to believe that Lee feels alien because she is a (white) scholarship student in a privileged, moneyed cloister. In fact, few well-heeled students could equal Lee's expectations that friendship, romance, academic success and simple grounding be handed to her on a silver platter.

I liked the book becuase it described a situation i have never been in: boarding school. It was an interesting insight into the lives of these kids who go to to school in most cases far from home.

She leaves her old school for this \\"prestigious\\" boarding school which her parents can barely afford and what does she do there? She covers up her real personality and becomes a quiet little freak-a-leak who only cares about the acceptance of a certain male classmate, (and real \\"mate\\" later on) Cross Sugarman. He uses her and manipulates her and in the end she acutually thinks that Cross likes her when really he's just doing some sort of list with his roomate. She is so dependent on him that it takes away from ther rest of the story. I ended up feeling bad for her when Cross tells her about the fish/cheese list and she finally realizes that the only reason he kept sleeping with her was because she gave good head. He also knew that she wouldn't tell anyone about their secret \\"hook ups\\" becuase first of all no one would believe her and second of all she is too shy in the first place. Overall the main character and her desperate desire to be accepted bothered me throughout the entire book. I may seem like i'm flip floping like John Kerry but i really did like the book just not the narrator. I would definetly recomend reading this becuase I think it is a good coming of age novel.

I have come a long way since high school, but seeing my current self in a high school character is definitely a kick in the pants to \\"get confident, stupid\\", if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"There are so many complaints that Prep's protagonist, Lee, is snobbish, uninvolved, and just plain annoying. I am starting to wonder if this is a reflection of the novel, or of the review author's themselves. I am a sixteen year old female and an avid reader. I picked up Prep while browsing, and was impressed that it was acclaimed by the New Yorker. I have to say that the novel is stunningly insightful in numerous aspects of teenage life. Yes, Lee is flawed. Who isn't flawed at this age? Who honestly could say they didn't spend some of their teenage years pining over an unreachable guy or wallowing in self pity? No one! I found Lee to be an embodiment of my teenage fears and insecurities. For example: Lee mentions how \\"it's better not to talk with someone after you've had a good conversation with them. Once you do, the good thing you had starts to fade. What if you talk, then run into them again in the book stacks? Then what do you say? I spent a lot of my time hiding.\\" This hit me, because I have been known to have the same trepidation, even going so far as ducking into a different aisle in the grocery store. Immature? Yes. But that's part of growing up. As the saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. It's easy to tell Lee to grow up and not worry what people think. But did you do that at fourteen? I'm not saying the novel is perfect, there are some character flaws. Lee's lack of academic work kind of annoyed me, because she had to have been very intelligent to get admitted to the school on scholarship. There is little explanation on why she decided to be academically apathetic. Also, Lee does not have any obvious epiphany. This may be frustrating, but it is realistic. I have had no such epiphany, but over the years have gained far more confidence and maturity, without me even realizing it. In the end, Lee is going to be okay. She may not be in the same league as Holden Caulfield, (who I, personally, also found frustrating) but with practice and work, she'll get there. I'm not just talking about Lee."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"It is not often that an author can climb inside a character's skin and make that character seem absolutely true to life. However in \\"Prep\\", Curtis Sittenfeld accomplishes just such a feat. Her brilliantly-drawn character is Lee Fiora, a bright young girl from South Bend, Indiana, who feels that she will do much better in a boarding school than in her local public high school. She convinces her parents that this is the road she should take, and when she is accepted as a scholarship student at Ault, she eagerly takes the position. The next four years consist of unending misery for Lee, as she continually measures herself against others and always finds herself lacking. She becomes a veritable recluse while she \\"toughs out\\" the four years of high school, while attempting to be as invisible as possible. Even when others reach out to her in friendship, she finds it impossible to reciprocate. Only a kind girl named Martha can get through her shell, and they spend their last three years as roommates. Lee becomes obsessed with having a boyfriend, yet she always seems to sabotage any efforts that boys make to befriend her. She finally centers her obsession on a boy named Cross, and predictably this relationship is doomed from the start. Sometimes Lee can be maddeningly self-destructive, but whataver her reactions to the situations around her, she comes across as an honest portrayal of an unhappy, self-conscious teenager who is just trying to surivive in a demanding and difficult situation. I am very much looking forward to this author's second novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read everything from chick lit to true crime to the classics and this one was just too slow and too shallow for me. There is very little depth to this book and I am truly suprised I perservered to the finish. The main character, as another reviewer put it, is annoying and pathetic - and not in an endearing way. It also killed me that the one black girl got expelled in the beginning bc she stole money from all the white girls - come on! cliche and stereotypical.I did enjoy reading about some of her coming of age experiences (which were truly hilarious and quite graphic) but it was not a page turner for me (I am a reader who needs action-packed or intricate stories to stay hooked). This is almost like a Judy Blume book for adults."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I enjoyed this book very much because it is quite different from many other books written about teenagers in high school. Yes, the subject matter is the same in many novels, but the protagonist, Lee, has a very unique voice, which I think is truthful and easily relatable. Everyone has felt like an outsider at some point in time and Lee is unapologetic about the fact that she is too. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"From the first paragraph to the last, this book was nothing short of amazing. The dialogue is real, the characters are all unique, and the insights of Lee Fiora make her an unforgettable character. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had a very mixed reaction to this book. It's generally well written, but there are a few major caveats:1) Chapter one is by far the weakest section of the book, an odd editing choice, to say the least. It's flat and fairly boring, and it trots out stereotype after stereotype. If it hadn't been midnight when I started reading this book, and I hadn't been bored, I would have returned it to the store without reading the rest of it.2) It feels like this was initially a short-story collection, and someone told the author short stories don't sell, make it a novel. The same way short story collections tend to be uneven, this book is uneven, and some sections feel tacked on after the fact in the interest of making it feel more like a novel. In places the organization is strange, or the focus seems off, and individual sections (the bike riding and english teacher chapters, for example) have more of a coherent story arc than the book as a whole. There are dropped and incomplete plotlines (Gates, anyone?), and information that appears multiple times in ways that seem more redundant than deliberate.3) The author just doesn't get race, and her attempts to deal with it range from offensive to simply not credible. I'm not saying that no \\"ethnic\\" characer can ever have a sterotypical trait, but her ethnic characters are almost entirely composed of stereotypes, and never really move beyond them. It's like she realizes on some level that she has no idea what's going on in their heads, or what happens in the minority student alliance, or how minorities really deal with white institutions (not that there's only one way), but knew that if she talked about class without dealing with race she'd get complaints. I'm willing to go with the idea that the ignorance is partly an attempt to demonstrate that Lee, the narrator, doesn't quite get it, but by the end of the book (and the hopelessly awkward \\"we need resolution\\" conversation with the token black guy), it's clear the author doesn't get it either. Another clue that the problems are the author's, and not Lee's, is that her \\"ethnic\\" dialogue is off. The Korean girl speaks the exact same cartoonish English as an adult as she did her freshman year of boarding school? The black girl from Philly speaks like an old southern black woman? yeah, ok.All that said, this book brought me back to high school trauma in a comforting way. This book will resonate with all of us who were hopelessly awkward, who invested every moment of interaction with profound life-altering potential and freaked out accordingly. It's comforting to read that you weren't the only person who was that stupid, and occasionally still is. I have not read a better written and more honest account of that peculiar and obsessive adolescent relationship logic (and I don't just mean romantic relationships-- family relations and friendships are well written too.) On the whole though, this book is gooey comfort food that's not that bad for you--organic pizza, if you will. If you're the kind of person who can connect with this book, it probably won't teach you anything new or profound, but it's not a bad way to spend a weekend."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I didn't love it, and after all of the glowing critical and reader reviews, I expected to. I enjoyed the time I spent reading it and felt Lee's narration flowed smoothly; however I didn't think it was anything revolutionary and at times I felt myself far more interested in some of the minor characters than in Lee herself. At the end, even though the book is 400 (or so) pages long, I couldn't help expecting, and feeling like I was waiting for, more. I predict that anybody who considers reading this book will enjoy it but not be at all blown away by the story of Lee's four boarding school years. Don't avoid it, but don't set your hopes too high. To end on a more positive note, I will be reading the author's next book, whenever it may be published."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep follows Lee Fiora as she enters and eventually graduates from a prestigious prep school. The chapters are large and the book is divided into semester sections, though not all semesters are described. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why certain semesters and events were written about and others were not.In some ways, this book was very well done. Lee's voice was honest and conjured up my own adolescent memories with painful accuracy. Lee was a candid narrator who didn't make excuses for her teenage shortcomings and instead simply described what was, what she felt, and what she observed. I was able to relate to so many things Lee described and, even though my own adolescence was markedly different from Lee's in terms of events, I often felt transported back to my own shared experiences and feelings. Still, while I often felt bad for her, I didn't actually like her very much.But is any of that really a good thing? Who wants to relive the awkward, uncomfortable, aimless, and painful parts of being a teenager? Sure, the author wrote well and captured the voice and experience of a teenager very well, but who wants to read hundreds of pages of that? Compounding this is the fact that the book has no real direction or point. Lee, like many adolescents, pretty much floats through high school. She doesn't really have any climatic event happen to her, she doesn't really grow or improve, and there are no real lessons or point to reading her experiences. I'm not sure why I read this book, why the author wrote it, and what the point of it all was. This type of book just might not be for me (I also disliked Tobias Wolff's Old School for similar reasons), and while I don't recommend against it, I don't recommend reading it either."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As a senior in college, I found this book to be remarkably insightful and realistic. No, Lee is not the most sympathetic protagonist. In fact, she's downright selfish. Is that really so shocking? Sittenfeld manages to show that Lee, the underdog and the outsider, has the potential to be as mean-spirited as the popular Aspeth Montgomery. The book refuses to paint its characters in the stark black-and-white terms of bitchy elite versus sweet, brainy outsider, and that's one of the things I like about it. Sittenfeld is also successful in capturing the unpopular-girl ethos with its heavy burden of self-doubt as well as the importance high schoolers place on popularity. I would be lying if I said I didn't identify with Lee, not only in her lack of confidence but in her self-centeredness as well. The book doesn't leave you feeling as if justice has been served, because in the real world, it generally isn't. Like most outsiders, Lee doesn't really come out on top.The book does contain some rather sexually graphic scenes. However, I would still recommend it to high-school readers, most of whom will be unfazed by those sorts of references. The book dispells the popular high-school-girl notion that having a boy kiss you is going to fix your life. In fact, it reveals how horribly messy sexual relationships can be--something it's a lot easier to find out from a book than from real life.In general, I would recommend the book to anyone willing to stomach a less-than-ideal protagonist and a less-than-satisfying ending. I think Sittenfeld is brilliant. Props to her for writing a story that tries to tell the truth."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm undecided as to whether this is actually a good book or not. The observations by the narrator and heroine (or anti-heroine, if you prefer) are spot on - Lee Fiora notes the interactions between students and staff and the rules of discussing money in this upper-middle-class environment where she is one of a handful of scholarship students. On the other hand, her academic progress and her interactions with her family outside of school are only briefly touched upon, and although the boarding school atmosphere is captured and the intensity of adolescence almost tangible on the pages, it feels too much like a memoir, rather than a work of fiction, to be completely comfortable."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I wish I could say I felt more strongly about this book as I had awaited reading it with interest after seeing a brief write up about it in the New Yorker. Unfortunately, it left me a bit indifferent.It's not that the writing is bad-- it isn't. In fact, Sittenfeld has managed to perfectly capture the voice of a girl coming into womanhood while braving the difficult navigation of the boarding school caste system. Her characters were utterly believable and realistic.That being said... they seemed rather lifeless. I didn't get a great sense of growth or development or epiphany. I wanted so much more out of her protagonist which I never got. I could have saved myself the time and expense by calling up one of my friends and saying \\"Hey, tell me about high school!\\"For my money, a more engaging and dynamic take on similar subject matter can be found in Colleen Curran's \\"The Whores on the Hill.\\""},{"Title":"Prep","review":"When I finished this book and read the author's acknowledgements thanking her agent and editor for encouraging her to keep writing this book, my first thought was that they had a lot to account for. It is true that the writing is powerful in places, especially when pinpointing the universal yearning for connection with others. But can we like a character who is angry and bitter at anyone else's happiness yet takes so few steps to achieve her own? The sadness of this story is in the many weak and mean spirited choices made by the main character: dumping a putative friend's offer to room with her by choosing instead to room with the girl's only other friend; repaying the longterm support and loyalty of her roomate (School Prefect) by betraying the school in a bitter tell all interview with the NY Times; cheating on her maths exam, and letting her best friend become entwined in her cheating? It is true that we all know there are people like Lee, but would we willingly choose to spend several hours of our time listening to their tale of woe about how no one was nice to them at school? I think not."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" does not have a plot. Other than the role of the protangaist (Lee), few characters play a continuous role in the story, but rather fade in and out--make a point, fulfill a need, and then move on. That leads into one of the more unique, and simultaneously boring, themes of this book: that this is not a story of a relationship between Lee and a friend, parent, or lover, but just a story about Lee.And so it is impossible to say if this book is good or not, as the reader could be fascinated and intrigued by the protaganist, or could be repulsed and dismayed by the sheer imperfection that Lee represents, as I was. I found myself unable to put the book down, much as I often find myself unable to look away from a brutal car accident that I pass on the road.Reviews claim this to be a representation of life for a high-schooler, but as a high-schooler myself, I see few similarities. Lee so abases herself, so loses all concept of her own self, that the reader feels an echo of her pain in himself; a sign of good writing, true, but an altogether unpleasant experience. True, high school may not be the best part of anyone's life, but this utter hell that Curtis Sittenfeld portrays makes me, at least, feel simple pity."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Well to whoever said \\"The girl, an \\"outsider\\"...is driven by insecurity, cluelessness, chronic angst, self-loathing, whininess and stunning self-absorption...These characteristics, common in adolescents, would be bearable if only this young woman were also funny, imaginative, smart, rebellious, interesting. She is instead unrelentingly bland, vacuous, shallow, not very bright and very, very ordinary.\\" this book is obviously above you. The fact that Lee is an ordinary teenager is part of the books brilliance.Too many recent books about teens have far too unrealistic characters. In every book there's a teenager who has some family problem (i.e. decesed parents, abusive, alcoholics, something of this nature) and is going some big coming-of-age crisis. The character usually seems normal but has some hidden wonderfullness about them (secretly paints masterpieces, is a math genious, a fantastic athlete, etc.)Being a teenager myself i apreciate a book with a fathomable character. Lee isn't \\"funny, imaginative, smart, rebellious, interesting\\" which is the beauty of the book. Most high schoolers don't feel like they are any of these things, or if they do it's rare.I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to know how a real high schooler feels. Someone who is more unpopular than not, someone who feels like an outsider evenw when she's on the inside. Although the book may not hit close to home because it takes place in a boarding school that severly lacks diversity, readers will be surprised how much they can relate."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I don't really understand the glowing reviews for this novel. By the time I reached the end, I had such complete dislike for Lee, the narrator, that I couldn't believe I'd wasted my time reading it. The book is divided into four sections, one for each year of high school. For the first three years, I felt some (minor) sympathy toward Lee for feeling that she didn't fit in. However, her behavior in her senior year ruined that. It was clear that her \\"outcast\\" status was self-inflicted, that she made no attempt to relate to her classmates, and that she preferred whining about not fitting in to actually attempting to interact with others. I couldn't believe that the most popular boy in school would be interested in her (for more than a one-night stand, anyway), nor could I believe that a well-adjusted girl like Martha would ever consider a loser like Lee her best friend. That it was a quick read is about the best thing I can say about the novel. Lee has got to be one of the most unlikeable narrators in history."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was expecting it to be pretty good given all the comparisons to Catcher in the Rye and the rave reviews. I thought it was so-so. By the middle I didnt really care anymore about the characters. Just unimpressive people in the teenage situations that I no longer find interesting to relive."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Well, the voice and tone of this lovely debut are dead-on perfect, and that's a tremendous foundation for a ripping good read. All the adolescent drama (mostly internal) is evoked marvelously well, and the prose is steady and sure. For a book without a huge dose of plot, it's a real page turner. A lot of this has to do with the fact that each chapter is somewhat self-contained--like individual short stories--and well crafted. Anyway, it's a winner."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"One cannot but grieve for the trees slaughtered to produce this tiresome book. While it may be of interest to a few under-thirty graduates of private boarding schools, the eyes of most discriminating grownup readers will surely glaze over by page 20. PREP's 400 pages narrates in exhausting, mind-numbing, largely meaningless detail the passage of a teenage girl through four years of a tony New England prep school. The girl, an \\"outsider\\" (because, poor dear, she is from Indiana and her father sells mattresses), is driven by insecurity, cluelessness, chronic angst, self-loathing, whininess and stunning self-absorption (A year in a Calcutta slum would serve her well.). These characteristics, common in adolescents, would be bearable if only this young woman were also funny, imaginative, smart, rebellious, interesting. She is instead unrelentingly bland, vacuous, shallow, not very bright and very, very ordinary. So too, it seems, are most of her friends.The flat, pedestrian writing in this earnest but dreary work is devoid of humor, irony, compelling descriptions, sharp imagery, a sense of place, drama, interesting, piquant word choice, penetrating insights, fire: it reads like a technical report on say, fish culture, but lacks the depth that such a document would probably possess.I slogged through the first hundred pages of PREP and then skipped ahead to the last hundred in the hope that things would improve: they didn't. It is, all in all, a tale full of little sound and not much fury signifying almost nothing. At least one blurb intimates that PREP is a modern counterpart of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE. Well, yes: PREP is to Salinger's masterpiece as the Spike Jones version of \\"Cocktails for Two\\" is to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In all fairness, I must record that apparently, I am a minority of one in my negative response to PREP, which is a best seller and has received many laudatory reviews. Ms. Sittenfeld has some impressive writing credentials, so one may hope that her next novel will be about people and events that matter. I'm looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book has got to be one of the worst I've ever read. The main character Lee is from a middle class family and is attending a boarding school where all of her peers are wealthy. Lee overthinks EVERYTHING and it gets annoying really fast, she can't do anything for herself and you'll be screaming at the book telling her what to do. She's so self-involved and if the book were funny it would be okay but it seems as if the book is supposed to be serious. I got tricked by an adorable cover and a cute story but the author just didn't bring this story to life for me. For God sakes you don't even know what year it takes place but you know everything about every person attending Lee's school, Ault, their first and last names, what their parents do, how many siblings, these are all people Lee has never even talked to. Boring book and really hard to get through."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had to throw a reference to Finny in there. You can't read about a relentlessly optimistic boarding school sports hero with a leg injury and not think of _A Separate Peace_.A friend of mine read this for a book club, and she was the only one willing to stand up for Cross. Everyone else thought he was a complete jerk. It just goes to show how absorbing the narrator's negative attitude can be. The reader really has to work to see anything from any point of view but hers.Of course, once you do the work, you start to see how worthwhile everyone is. I loved all the characters the second time around."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" is the story of Lee Fiora who joins a private boarding school in her freshman year of high school. From the moment we meet her, she comes across as an overly shy, awkward teen paralyzed by her fear (and maybe awe?) of being surrounded by a bunch of priviledged rich kids. Lee herself is from a Mid West middle class family, a great source of embarrassment and stress throughout her high school years.Because Lee's life has been so different from all the other kids - who go skiing every winter and all have backyard pools, and their fathers are bankers, lawyers, politicians or own entire conglomerates - she is unable to behave functionally around them. She does the only thing she can, which is to continuously second-guess every minute aspect of her behavior to the point where she shuts down completely. In short, she becomes a dysfunctional, paranoid, teenager that is unable to make any real friends, or, heaven forbid, have a boyfriend.But boarding schools are small, and in spite of all her best efforts to be ignored, she does form some, albeit mostly unstable, relationships. At the end of her freshman year Martha becomes an actual friend and they decide to room together for the rest of their high school years.We come to know Lee as overly self-deprecating and hyper-analytical of everyone's behavior. If someone so much as smiles at her across the dining hall, she tries to interpret a meaning: were they being friendly or sarcastic? Should she smile back, or is that too needy? Lee paralyzes all her emotions, never acting honestly on any of them until it is far too late. All around her, her classmates slowly grow to a semblance of maturity, readying for top notch colleges, while she herself remains socially inept.Even Lee seems somewhat surprised at her own behavior, which is so different from how she was \\"back home\\": top of her class, outspoken with friends and family. But it was her desire and choice to trade all that to rub shoulders with the elite. Sadly, she never manages to fit in completely.What Lee fails to realize is that in her attempt to \\"fit in\\" and not appear \\"abnormal\\", she forgets to be real, engaged and interesting. That is also the biggest problem of the book: Lee never becomes interesting. Her lack of self-esteem becomes boring, even irritating. Yet, there are things that happen to her that are obviously at odds with her behavior - she actually has an intimate relationship with the most popular boy in her class, Cross. This seems odd. Lee falls head over heals in love with him, but is utterly unable to express this (or indeed anything at all) to him. He appears to care somewhat, acts like it sometimes, but drops her like a dirty rag at the end - no surprise there, given Lee's behavior.I found the first half of the book fascinating, engaging. I was hoping, waiting, praying for Lee to develop. I was expecting a story of personal growth, a coming-of-age. Instead, Lee fails to do this, and even as an older Lee looking back at her teenage self, there is still something very pathetic about her tone. The ending is somewhat surprising also (I won't spoil it for you here).\\"Prep\\" was very jarring to me. I attended a private boarding school full of priviledged kids. Some things I could relate to: nothing is ever a secret. But at the same time, you live in such close proximity to so many people, it would be virtually impossible to hide yourself in the way Lee did. Having a friend such as Martha would in itself have been enough to make the experience a happy one for her.The other aspect that rang untrue is that Lee claims she was an A-student in her old school, but performs below par in boarding school. I cannot imagine why someone who's essentially smart, would suddenly drop so many IQ points. The boarding school, after all, still follows a standard curriculum (with smaller classes and better teachers, maybe, but the material is the same).Overall, an enjoyable book. I had a hard time putting it down. But I was at times enormously frustrated with Lee, wanting to shout at her to get some sense in her head. Maybe that was the point ..."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is NOT legendary but it is a well written, interesting, decent book. It kept moving, I kept reading. It is an easy read and doesn't take much thought to read it. A good story line, interesting characters and a great writing style make it a good book. I recommend it. It reads a lot like \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" by Tom Wolfe(also a good book)."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"OK, I'm in my 50's and didn't attend prep school. However, as a big fan of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" growing up, I was anxious to read Tom Wolf's \\"Charlotte Simmons\\". I thought Wolf was way out his league writing that one. I couldn't wait to finish it, and nearly left it in midstream; however, I thought perhaps it might get better. I was so thankful I did NOT have a kid in college... \\"Prep\\", however, was wonderfully written and I enjoyed every minute of it. I read it over a weekend because I simply couldn't put it down. The writing style, language, etc. rang so much truer to me than Wolf's ponderous writing. Three cheers for Curtis Sittenfeld!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was very dissappointed with this book. Very slow going. While reading I kept thinking that this book would appeal to my 15 year old daughter. However, the graphic sex in the last chapter changed my mind about that. Not sure what type of reader she was looking to attract. The subject matter was too juevenile to keep my interest piqued. If she left out the last chapter this book would certainly be shelved in the Young Adult section. A real dissappointment."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This it what it feels like to drown. Lee, jumps into the \\"pool\\" of Ault School, and the reader is called on to hear how she sinks rather than swims with occasional gasps of air at the surface. We are mired with her in her lifelong major depression with no salvation. The reader longs for Lee to grab the life savers tossed to her even long past high school, but she never will. There will be no salvation, and it appears Lee will struggle for the rest of her life. At Ault School, she has the permanent weight attached of being out of her economic \\"class\\", but nothing provided for her is enough. Instead we are left with simply a memoir of her unredeemed four year's worth of misery with no evidence of any gain as time passes. Nor does she seem remotely happy about the life she lives as an adult. The reader is asked to spend four years with a person who gained nothing!It simply is unfair to blame a prep school, job, or relationship for her unaddressed mental health problems. It's all believable, yes! But why put yourself through her unredeemed misery? Prep's story is a tragedy with this lesson: Depression unresolved grows up to adult depression."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is a hugely talented writer - amazingly deft for a young person. It's fun to read, and also drives you crazy because Lee is so intensely self-conscious, picky - she's the queen of exactitude, constantly analyzing and calculating. Lee's touchingly sincere English teacher, exhorting her to believe in something - to develop a passion, to care, to stop withholding - was spot on. My take is that the school's social hierarchy, its cultural differences and expectations from the way she grew up in a middle-American family, the snobbery, the \\"code\\" of stilted communications among her peers - these things corrupted her and pushed her into herself. Basically, the book shows how a social situation can change a person for the worse. Lee veers off her birth path onto a dark and unhappy one. She said it herself right at the start: she was an outgoing, cheerful young girl before Alt. \\"Alt\\" to me means \\"altered.\\" Lee is altered by a thoroughly corrupt system...and \\"Prep\\" is a tragedy."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is very readable and I loved the flow of the story. Lee Fiora is a memorable though sometimes frustrating character. One of the only problems I have with this book is that the sex scenes are too many and too graphic. This takes away from the quality of the story. A classy author can write about such things without dwelling on them so much, and Sittenfeld fails to do this. For this reason many schools may probably not be able to use the book for students to read, which is a shame because the rest of the book is very good."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I could not put this book down i even read it on lunch breaks at work! I am a 22 yr old woman and related to every problem and accompishment, even though i never went to a prep school or had any view of school other than public.To me the underlined story of this book was to not disect your life but to just sit back and enjoy being you. We all have that feeling of not belonging or feeling weird, outcasted or shunned for not having the money to support their teenage desires. The race and sex was there but it always is a factor in everyones life, just some people acknowledge every choice and every decision while wondering why others can just... do as they wish. Lee learned to stand up for what she wants and not to let others decide for her, also as bad as today seems the feeling will fade as fast as they had happened. READ THIS BOOK! High school is all the same no matter where you went."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I don't know about you, but I loved this book! I'm in 8th grade, and I could completely relate to Lee, the main character. I too feel like an outsider.I don't know why you think there's no plot. The plot is highscool. It's four years through Lee's eyes at Ault. Satisifed, now?I think the best part was when Cross came to her. I loved all the sex scenes!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"\\"Prep\\" is the kind of novel that young women dream about being written. Being a college sophomore myself, I picked this up because I liked the belt on the cover. What I discovered was that Curtis Sittenfield has perfectly captured what it is like to be a teenage girl in high school - or a prestigious, private school of Ault on the East Coast.Lee Fiora is the novel's heroine and there's absolutely nothing special about her. Which is perhaps why I feel she works perfectly as the heroine. Lee is not unusually beautiful, not overly intelligent, and not an all star athlete. She is simply a teenager who is desperately trying to find her place. As cliche is this sounds, it works well in this novel. Sittenfield brings so much to the story, which spans over Lee's four year high school experience at Ault. Family struggles, friendships with girls that are difficult, and, of course, that one guy that she just can't stop thinking about.These storylines are so real. There is nothing magical about them; the popular jock does not suddenly recognize Lee after a makeover, and she doesn't get popular all of the sudden. No, these stories, written with hilarious dialogue and perfect detail, are what most teenage girls go through. Heartbreak, self-consciousness to the point of annoyance, and incredible joys.This may well be my new favorite book. I can't think of one negative thing to say about it except that I, myself, was heartbroken when it ended. I didn't want to stop following Lee's life. This book holds power and I think men, as well as women, will enjoy it. But for any girl who clearly remembers the horrors, embarassments, heartaches, and happiness of high school, this book will make you smile and, oddly, reflect fondly on your own particular high school experience. A must-read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"An excellent insight into the emotions of high school and just teenage years in general. Prep is an easy read but also a very well-written one capturing the rollercoaster of teenage experience. (If you like this you'll love classics like Catcher In The Rye or To Kill A Mockingbird or more recent novels like Saturday (Ian McEwan) or You Are Here (Steve Horsfall)"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Having never attending a boarding school or out of town college, I was always jealous of those who did. This book gives me a picture of some of the things I missed out on. In this case however, it is presented from the eyes of someone who experienced the life but as someone who was considered an outcast (but not really a nerd).Lee, comes from a middle class family in Indiana. Having received a scholorship to attend the prestigious boarding school Ault, she is thrust into a campus life with a lot of kids from very affluent families. Lee never seems to \\"appreciate\\" herself and feels inferior to the other students throughout her time at school. Though she have very strong emotional feelings she keeps them bottled up because she cosniders herself a \\"loser\\" and is constantly in fear of failure and never takes any risks for pleasure.Lee is very good at judging the other people around her but never realizes that the real short-comings in herself are her own self imposed boundaries. At various times she has strong crushes on other students, the first being with Gates (a female) and then Cross (a boy). She never gives any of her crushes even the slightest hint how she feel even though she watches them from the fringes with a very strong attraction but not enough imagination for even a fantasy. You keep reading along and wish you could make yourself appear into the story and guide Lee along on the right path to getting what she really wants.The book rarely covers anything in the classroom and most of the story takes place over the four years of high school in the student dorms. I thank the author for giving me a glimpse of what I seemed to miss out on."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As those who have read my reviews before, especially for books set in prep schools, public high schools or college campuses knows, (see my review for Speak Softly, She Can Hear by Pam Lewis), I love books set on college campuses or boarding schools, etc. Therefore I was really looking forward to reading the debut novel of Curtis Sittenfield, Prep: A Novel. But while the book took place at a prestigious New England prep school, think a coed Choate or Exeter, ultimately I was sadly disappointed while I read this book and certainly when I finished it.We first meet the main character, a young student from Indiana who on her own decides she wants to attend a prep boarding school. Not realizing all of the ramifications of going to a school like this, Lee Fiora, enters these academic halls where the focus of the book seems more social than academic. The usual prep school things occur like unhappy students, class distinctions between the rich girls and the ones who attend on scholarship, the wild crush on a male students which lasts for four years, parents weekend where Lee is embarrassed by her middle class parents who are a bit of place and finally graduation. Only then does Lee realize there is more to life than this school. Too bad she didn't realize this earlier on and concentrate on the real reason she went to his school, the academics instead of all of this social mumbo jumbo. While there were many things I wondered about in this book, most of all I wondered what initially possessed this young woman to attend this school at all since she seem so ill suited to enjoy herself in this atmosphere. And as the book proceeds we watch as Lee tries to navigate through prestigious Ault Academy with almost few successes and again I wondered why she remained there.Many other authors have tackled the theme of what prep and boarding schools are all about and more often the idea of the haves and the have nots and the social ramifications of these institutions. But what really disappointed me was that I couldn't really warm up to this character or understand most of her decisions. And while reading about her ongoing lust affair with a fellow student for four years and her attitude to her parents on visiting day when she realizes how out of place they really are, made me feel annoyed at first and then sad for her family. Even a glimpse into her future and attitude showed an almost irreverent attitude towards Ault Academy and her peers but an equal portion of snobbiness to the actual world around her most likely fostered by her academic history. Most of all, though, was the fact that once I closed the book I all but forgot about Lee and this book except for writing this review.I rated this with a B because I did enjoy the beginning of the book. Unfortunately by the middle of the book I was eager to readthe last about Lee and her prep school days. I will read this author in the future because I did think the writing was good, just never warmed to Lee or her days at Ault Academy."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book is definetely not an inaccurate portrayal of Prep schools. I admit I go to one, and this is a very accurate portrayal of teenage girls in rich prep schools, and can even relate to teenage guys. Curtis Sittenfeld is a teacher at my school, St. Albans School, and almost everyone in the school has picked up a copy of the book. Ms. Sittenfeld admits that some experiences from her teaching at St. Albans affected her book, and after attedning St. Albans and reading the book I can tell you its true. Admittedly from what I hear Ms. Sittenfeld isn't quite the best teacher in the school, but she's an amazing author and you have to pick up a copy of \\"Prep\\"!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am trying to read as this book as slowly as I can to completely savor each and every word. I fell in love with the story from the first page. I am about halfway through and I don't want the story to end. The author has a wonderful talent of bringing her character, Lee, to life. I cannot wait until her next book!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I think that after reading this book and many other so called teenage life books, i relized that this is not really what life is for me. yes there are a few incidents when i want a boy friend, or i kiss a guy, but it is not always the most interesting thing to read over and over again in every \\"teen\\" book. Prep is kind of like that. Highschools are not all perfect, they have their flaws to them. Like crime or racists. Every teen book so far has been about the better off people, how about writing one about some people on the streets or the hood. They have stories too. they aren't just people reading stories, they probably want to read one that relates to them. Again if you want another pathetic teen book, read prep!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is a book that will totally absorb some people and be tedious for others. Personally, I loved it. It satisfied, at least temporarily, my nostalgia for those highly emotional high school / college days. And that alone was worth the read.This book brings to life the excruciatingly analytical thoughts and sometimes exhilirating misadventures of a girl through 4 years of prep school. Sound boring? Then you will not like this book! Sound intriguing? Then you will relish every word.Through the whole book, I kept thinking I've felt that, I've thought that! Sometimes the insecurity and self-consciousness of the character was so overwhelming that the book became uncomfortable which made me realize I had been sucked in. That to me is a sign of an exceptional book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As a former student at a pseudo-prep school, I was able to relate to Lee Fiora. While my school wasn't a boarding school, it was a NYC private school made up of mostly affluent kids who were headed to Ivy League Schools. Like Lee, I, was a middle class, somewhat mediocre student of non-desctip popularity in that environment. There were so many anecdotes in this book that I found so relateable, that I have to commend the author for being so right on. However, much of it was a bit extreme - particularly Lee's extreme lack of self esteem (despite it all, I did enjoy high school - i can't imagine I would have stuck with an experience as miserable as Lee's).While overall accurate and enjoyable, there were times when it dragged a bit. It also got a little depressing, I could have handled a few positive story lines. But, overall, an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Great author - he writes so well from a high schooler's point of view that you wonder if perhaps he still is one. Because I can uniquely attest to this girl's adventures and tribulations through my own high school experience, I found myself rooting for this protagonist through her many troubling yet evolving years of high school, filled with too many trust fund babies with too much time. I really wanted her to get as much out if her experience as I did. She seemed to be evolving over the years. In the end, however, she lacked the maturity to overcome the materialism and superficiality that surrounded her. Her actions at the end of the book came as a disappointment. Perhaps I was too optimistic but she seemed to have missed the learning curve..."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"What I liked best about this book was the fact that Curtis Sittenfeld established the character as somewhat relate able in the beginning, and then even though she does things that make you confused and says things that are inappropriate throughout the book, you remain engaged and you sincerely want to know what happens to Lee Fiora. Lee's not a strong female character at all, she's weak, indecisive, quiet, stalkerish and uninspiring. But she's very cerebral, and Sittenfeld does an excellent job of laying out her thoughts and insecurities on the page. The best part of the book is the erotic yet unrequited relationship Lee has with Cross Sugarman. You're happy for her, but at the same time you know the true nature of the relationship and you see its imminent doom. I liked how HONESTLY Sittenfeld portrays unrequited love, or delusional love, whatever you want to call it. I thought that was the strongest feature of the story, and that was where you see some of her strongest writing (towards the end of the book). I thought it could have ended with a little more drama, but I suppose the quality of this book is belied in its realism."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I enjoyed this book because it takes you deep inside the mind of the main character - a teenager who is in an environment where she doesn't fit it. I don't much care about what teenagers think or about prep school, but somehow I found this book very interesting. I was depressed toward the end of the book and after I read it because I had a similar experience with my first \\"boyfriend\\" and I also felt very out of place in high school and in some work settings as an adult."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I've never experienced a lot of things that our main character, Lee, does in Prep. I've never been to a boarding school or had to deal with a lot of the characters she had to, but at the same time it felt like I may have done so in another life. That's why I like this book, and why I found it to be an easy, enjoyable read. It's very witty and rather blunt at times. This entire thing could have been really dull. Beyond dull, even, but thankfully it isn't. It's refreshing and catchy.I'm not really sure just what keeps me from giving it a fifth and final star, but perhaps it could be because I'm not sure that this book is something that anyone could get in to. A lot of literary greats out there are stories that any person could pick up and fall in love with, but this may have a different demographic. I certainly fit in to it, though, and you'll never know if you do too until you try.And by the way, Curtis Sittenfeld is a woman, not a man. This is why you should always read those little author bios, or look up more information on them, hm?"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Curtis Sittenfeld is one of the most nuanced and captivating writers I've read in a long time, and \\"Prep\\" is one of the best first novels I've seen. It follows the life and loves of outsider Lee over the course of her four years at boarding school. While I can't entirely disagree with other reviewers who've noted that the plot of this novel, such as it is, seems to meander a bit, this book's strengths lie in its completeness as a character study. And a fascinating one at that. Moreover, the themes running through this book of alienation, self-consciousness, and class divide are maintained as consistently over the course of the novel as anybody could wish. You'll laugh with Lee, cry with her, cringe with her, and find yourself yelling advice at her (or maybe at the teenage version of yourself you can't help remembering as you read this) at the top of your lungs.Quite simply, this is an exceptional first novel, and I highly recommend it for anybody."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Someone wrote that any girl can relate to this story. I think anyone who has been in high school can relate. It's not so much about going to a boarding school or being a girl, but about the awkwardness and fakeness of your teenage years. Prep reminds me of the movie \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\". Almost every scene makes you wince, but you still want more."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is self-indulgent to read, the protagonist is self centered, introspective to a point of obsession, and overall obsessed with external validation... But what teenager isn't? The novel will take you back in time to high school, and give other high school students a kick of perspective through (what I hope to be on the author's part) satire. It's a good story that entertains and brings to light the politics of race, gender, and class in a closed in setting."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am somewhere in the middle of all the reviews which are bashing it out over this novel. Hate it? Not really. Love It? Not really, either. Like it- yes. Interesting- yes. And here is why-Lee Fiora makes an independent decision to get out and away from her family- and apply to a boarding school. Surprisingly, she gets in on scholarship, and off she goes as a young freshman. The life she lives there is not unlike most of our own high school lives. We have crushes, we try to find a friend or two to trust, we keep secrets, and sometimes we don't keep secrets. We realize we are not as smart/ funny/ popular/ as maybe he would hope to be. We follow fads in silly clothes and annoying sayings. We have our hearts broken....Sometimes when reading this I was shocked at how great the author hits this on the head. You read something you would have TOTALLY done, making a fool of yourself. Those moments are great and easy to relate to.Other times the plot is so...not there, actually. Little Lee does nothing to improve her life. Nothing to be interesting, nothing exciting. The amount of excitement she has is sucumbing to her secret crushes physical needs as he calls on her privately to help him relieve himself and take advantage of her selfishly.There are bits of sex and other small indulgences which will keep you reading, but over all Lee's horrible relationship with her horrible family and lack of any true friends anywhere is well, a bit depressing.That being said, Sittenfield has fun moments where I loved her writing style and so she won me over there. I just wish she would have taken a chance with her character. For me, high school angst and sarcasm was much better portrayed in the revealing and beautiful young adult book \\"Speak\\" by LAurie Halse Anderson.I give 3 stars becasue it is an okay and interesting read- but it will not blow you away in any way shape or form. Thank goodness for friends who have also read it, this book is much more satisfying when discussed in detail!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"SO much better than Tom Perrotta's book--I had to comment on the reviewer who compares the two: this is just so much smarter! and deeper!--and as much as I like (well, love) Tobias Wolf's Old School, I wouldn't compare it really to that, either. That seemed to me more a 'writer's\\" book--nothing wrong with that! But this one is a real girl's book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was terrible. Just because this book is set at a boarding school does not put it into the ranks of J.D. Salinger and Knowles as the cover eludes. The main character is annoying and I found my self waiting for action to begin. No intelligent internal dialogue. This book does not even begin to touch issues such as those in Catcher or A Separate Peace. I found myself quitting it when I was 3/4 of the way through wondering when the main character would get a self-esteem so I wouldn't have to read descriptions of sexual acts."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"As a former student and teacher at a New England prep school, I found this novel infuriating. It's hard for me to tell if the author is projecting her own prejudice or if someone really experienced this while at Groton (the obvious basis for Ault).For good, bad or indifferent, boarding school requires that a student engage the community and the protagonist here, Lee did none of those things. She was a bad student (and I am not just referring to grades), and did no extracurriculars. She was in a setting where her teachers were at her disposal night and day and at an institution whose facilities rival most major colleges, and yet, she did nothing. Her treatment of her parents was abhorrent, even by teenage and boarding school standards. I've witnessed students treat their parents badly, but never have any of those student hidden their parents from everyone on a Parents' Weekend. Her constant complaining, whining and snobbery were annoying; it was hard to empathize with this character.Siitenfeld should stick with what she knows and her characterizations of students of color at the school were so off base, it is clear to me that while at Groton, she spent little to no time with them. In this area, Lee's prejudices, and possibly Sittenfeld's, are on full display. Lee assumes that her Latina friend during her first year is poor and on scholarship; the exact opposite is true. She assumes that none of the white boys would be interested in dating the minority scholarship girls from New York and is shocked to find, that unlike herself, the rich, popular white boys have relationships with these girls. Unlike Lee's beliefs and own actions, minority students didn't (and don't) sit around these boarding schools obsessing about their rich, white schoolmates. Possibly, she should have learned from their example."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee, the narrator and protagonist of Prep, is one of the most unlikeable main characters that I've encountered. Her tedious self-consciousness gets old by the time she's a sophomore. The endless introspection and judgments of others seem to be way beyond what a teenager would actually think or be able to articulate. The author's adult perspective is too apparent in many of Lee's riffs on her classmates, teachers, parents, etc.The story is absorbing enough; the settings seem authentic. It makes for a decent read, but Lee comes off as a selfish, self-absorbed and ungrateful snob-in-reverse."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"How many times have you picked up a book about private school and ended up putting it back down in disgust? Was it filled with unrealistic scenarios, hollow characters, and cheesy writing? And were you almost positive that the author who wrote it had never been to, or even had the faintest idea about, private school? This has happened to me dozens of times, and just when I thought I would never read another book about private school, Curtis Sittenfeld's PREP came along and became an instant favorite of mine.Sittenfeld has been to boarding school, and her debut novel isn't full of erroneous misconceptions or glamourous fantasies. In fact, PREP is about as close to the cold, hard, and sometimes painful truth of life as you can get. It definitely wouldn't be considered escape literature, so if you're looking for a nice beach read or just something to take your mind off things, this isn't it. Instead, the near-neurotic dissecting perspective of PREP's narrator and main character, Lee Fiora, makes this novel almost excruciatingly relatable to real life. Lee is, above other things, an extremely flawed teenager. She's insecure, judgmental, overly analytical, ashamed of herself and her family, jealous and sometimes racist. And there will most certainly be moments in the novel where you will not like her, but there will also be moments that you sympathize deeply with her. This novel contains some of the most honest statements I have ever read, and the most honest character portrayals. For example, in other books when someone is crying, that person's best friend might shower the crying person in love and comfort and assure them that they have done nothing wrong. Whatever happened, it's not their fault. But people don't really always act like that, and in PREP, you will find passages where the best friend will say things like \\"Don't let it bother you,\\" while still not alleviating the blame. The same is true of the romance in this book. It's not smooth and picture perfect. Like real relationships sometimes are, it's weird, unorthodox and emotionally confusing.This book may at times seem so wrenching that you will want to put it aside, but that is only because you feel the sadness (and intermittently the happiness) of the main character as your own. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the ending is not cry-your-eyes-out-horrible as you might expect it to be after reading the rest of the book. It was actually optimistic and hopeful from a certain angle, but not in an obvious way. The main defining characteristic of Sittenfeld's work is the lack of sentimentality and, thank God, a total absence of the nauseating cheesiness usually associated with the private school genre. Everything is kind of ambiguous, but not in a way that feels open-ended. PREP is one of my favorite novels, but it's heavy reading and not for everyone. Its painful sincerity is both its best feature and its downfall in the eyes of those expecting a lighter, happier read. Personally, I believe Sittenfeld's developmental and writing talent merits five stars."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I can't believe the mixed reviews for this book. I don't understand how some readers just did'nt get it, maybe they were so popular and socially adept in highschool that they could not relate. I certainly could relate to Lee on many levels. Did I like her? Not so much, but I could have been her in many cases. Is this hard to admit? Kind-of. I could relate to her need to over analyze everything and everyone. I could relate to her inability to respond well in most social situations. I could relate to her awkwardness, insecurity and lack of grace. I think this is called being a teenager. I certainly relate to the fact that in highschool one is consumed with, well, highschool. In those four years, highschool is your world, and it is all that matters. So many viewers didnt seem to get this and then wonder about the ending. After we are done highschool we realize it's a big world and there is more to life than, well, highschool. In many cases people complained how her four years seemed to shape her later life. I believe this to be true. Certainly highschool is a riveting time for many of us. It is a very intense experience and because of the development that happens to one while there, it can form you in many ways. Many girls firsts are in highschool, first love, first kiss, first sexual experience, etc. Of course these are so important in how you evolve and in who you become. It can determine how we relate to others in later life. Many a valuable lesson is learned in the time spent there. I could certainly relate to the time period. It did'nt have to be spelled out. She spoke of the lack of email and cellphones and the music that was listened to. It was self explanatory. It was the late 80's. Going into freshman year most girls in that era would have been fresh and innocent. I recall it with great clarity. In just four short years so many things change for the average girl, because to go from 14 to 17 or 18 is life changing. In no other time of our life does so little time pass while so much change and growth takes place. People complain that Lee does not grow. I think she did, but even at 17 we are babies, and I think it takes that very short period between the end of highschool and into the early twenties to garner the most change, and that is because highschool is such an insular experience. Once out in the real world, that growth can bloom. As for her relationship with Cross, I understood that too. In highschool it takes a rare girl to be so secure that they would'nt find themselves in such a situation as that. Being used sexually, giving instead of recieving, yes, I had a few of those kind of experiences. I certainly learned from them. Everything in this story was believable and on point. It certainly brought me back 25 years. It made me recall many of my own experiences. Certainly the distinction beteween popular and not so was dead on accurate. I could also identify with the distinction between the rich and LMC as I saw that first hand in one of the schools I attended. Really a thought provoking book and and a very interesting read. My daughter just graduated highschool and I had to remind her many times during her four years, it's just highschool, it's not real life. Now that I have read this, I remember all over again, and I understand that I was too glib."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I could not put this book down. I loved the narration and pace of this book. I loved Lee's keen insights. I cringed at her painful insecurity and acute self-consciousness. I felt grateful to be on the other side of adolescence. Sittenfeld painted a picture in this book with a vivid setting and characters. If you are looking for a book that will entertain you and transport you, pick up this book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I couldn't put this book down and loved it from beginning to end. Unlike some of the other reviewers, for some reason I didn't find her ongoing insecurities irritating or off-putting. I thought it was a pretty accurate account of adolescence. Reading others' reviews makes one realize how apparently without insecurity many people experienced adolescence -- if only we all could have had it that way."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book was so extraordinarily well-written -- it reminds me completely of what high school was like -- of all the complex & sometimes nonsensical thoughts that ran through my head. It makes so many other novels about adolescence seem somewhat one dimensional.In the same way that Dave Eggers' stream-of-consciousness \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" captured the way my mind works now, Curtis Sittenfeld's rather more carefully written novel captured a lot of the way my mind worked then. Only for some reason, I can't seem to capture this essence on paper as well as these two authors can."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The novel chronicles the inner workings within the mind of Lee Fiora, a fourteen-year old girl from South Bend, Indiana, whose father sells mattresses and thinks nothing of yelling at his two sons to stop whacking off and come to dinner,and who accepts a scholarship to Ault, an exclusive boarding school near Boston. The students at the school come from moneyed families, and these privileged individuals have names like, Cross, Aspeth and Tullis; their mothers sport names like Fifi, Tinkle, Yum and Birdie. They all have money, so it is considered very bad form to discuss it. There are only very, very few students who are quietly referred to as LMC (lower middle-class), and everyone knows who they are, but in this pristine environment, where everyone may know your name and the most intimate details about you, even if he or she has never spoken to you and never will, discussions or mention of race, class or privilege never see the light of day.Lee is a stranger in a strange land, and the novel painstakingly and accurately records for the reader her every insecure, self-conscious, self-centered and tortured thought as she navigates this new terrain. Lee's experiences at Ault serve as a kind of a baptism by fire initiation into the already convoluted and complicated interactions in any high school in America. Lee dissects, analyzes and overanalyzes every interaction and noninteraction, and some readers may find this unnecessarily tedious. Lee assumes that everyone, other than her one friend, Margaret, perceives her as unpopular, uninteresting and worthless, because that is how she views herself. Lee is an unusual protagonist in that there is nothing extraordinary about her. She doesn't excel at anything except cutting hair, and her behavior is not always admirable. Like many adolescents, she can be insensitive, cruel, dishonest and envious.So, the question is, why is this book worth reading? The novel is not just about a whiny teenage girl who can not seem to get her act together. It is a brilliantly rendered, minute-by minute account of adolescent angst, and Lee does grow and change. She tells us that, \\"Ault had been the toughest audience I'd ever encouter,\\" and the novel is a wonderful, albeit painful reminder of the trials and tribulations of navigating the sometimes treacherous high school terrain. The novel reminds us that those trials and tribulations won't last forever; it just seems that way at the time."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"What did I like about this book? Three things. First, it engaged me right from the outset. While I can't completely disagree with those who pointed out the relative absence of plot movement, still, I was never bored and was always interested to see what would happen next. It was one of those books, where, when I wasn't reading it, I was looking forward to getting back to it. And isn't that really the threshold test of any novel? Does it engage you? If the answer is yes, then it's a good book, no matter what else one might say about it.Second, it was very well-written and thought-provoking. It was the kind of book that stayed with me after I was done reading it and that doesn't happen with every book, even some good ones.Finally, having gone to a prep school myself (although not coed at the time), alot of Lee's experiences resonated strongly with me and I felt like I knew exactly what she was talking about with respect to certain aspects of school life. (It's interesting how some of the reviewers say that Lee's experiences bore no resemblance to their own, while others said the exact opposite-I'm in the latter category.) In particular, though it's a cocoonish, somewhat surreal world, it still becomes your home, for better or worse--such that, when you leave the campus, it feels like you're leaving your \\"real home\\" and going to some alien environment even if that happens to be your actual home. At the very end of the book, Lee talks about seeing people at the train station \\"whose lives had nothing at all to do with Ault\\". That may seem obvious to most people, but I know exactly what she meant--if you're in prep school long enough, that actually comes as somewhat of a revelation.Despite all of this, there were certain drawbacks to the book, and virtually all of them relate to the annoying Lee herself. A first person narrative requires, virtually by necessity, someone who is observant. Most frequently, that person will be introspective as well--i.e. they can observe themselves as well as others. With these qualities often comes some self-criticism, because who among us would not be critical of ourselves, at least in some degree? Thus, for example, it would be highly unusual for a book like this to be written by the coolest, most popular kid in the school.However, that being said, Lee's degree of self-loathing, total insecurity, total lack of self-confidence, lack of scruples (not just cheating on a test, but knowingly compromising herself repeatedly when she thought it would help her curry favor with the cool kids), combined to make her a truly unlikable character. The fact that she has full self-awareness of these character traits don't help the situation. In fact, one of the paradoxes of this book is that Lee (or at least the author speaking through Lee) tells a great story, despite being not only a bore herself but an unsympathetic bore.I also didn't really care for the long last chapter, where Cross re-emerges on the scene. I felt like I was reading the private diary with the puppy love musings of a 12-year old--who is writing totally for herself with no interest in an audience. Lee went from making interesting observations about other aspects of prep school life to page after page of the most banal and hackneyed comments imaginable when talking about Cross. It felt like she was picking apart a clover and saying to herself: \\"He loves me, he loves me not\\", over and over and over.I know that there are those (particularly women) who would defend Lee on the grounds that she is so REAL and authentic. They write that \\"Lee is me!\\" or at least can strongly identify with her. I don't dispute that she is real and that her character resonates with alot of women. However, this is still a novel intended for an audience. I'll bet that the diary of a 9th grader who writes for 50 pages about whether or not some boy likes her (or even knows she exists) may be \\"real\\" for alot of women too, but that doesn't make for greating writing (or reading). Nevertheless, despite this, and on balance, for the reasons given above, I would still easily recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"After hearing a good deal of negative reviews of Prep, I was a little reluctant to start reading. But I really am glad I didn't let other reviews convince me not to read it -- this is one of the best books I have ever read. As a white, middle-class, 16-year-old girl attending a prestigious private school, I could easily relate to Lee Fiora, the novel's protagonist. This book is a favorite at my school because so many girls there can relate to it.Many of the other reviews have claimed that Prep can be racist at times, and I have to say I completely disagree. Lee, only fourteen years old at the start of the book, is honest to a degree where it may offend some. An important component of her character is her naiviety, which makes her slightly unable to see the ways hispanics and blacks are treated differently than whites at her boarding school, Ault. I think what many perceive as racism is simply Lee being honest.While other reviewers have also complained that Lee whines and complains relentlessly, I think this was just your typical teenage angst. She may be more upset or whiny that other teens, but again, I enjoyed the great degree of honesty in Lee's commentary of her life. All in all, as a girl who has attended private school for more than half her life, I can attest that while maybe being a tad overdramatic at times, this is an accurate and honest depiction of life at a New England private school, and would encourage female private school students to give it a try."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"this book was like reading about myself. not to mean that everything that happened to Lee has happened to me, but more that i have experienced a lot of her feelings and observations. i have always wondered if i was the only one who saw things this way and it was nice to find out that i wasnt. i felt like if i was to write a book about myself that was how it would be. it was so honest; everything rang true.yes it was depressing and heartbreaking and did not have a particularily happy ending but that is how real life is. there were many times when you expected things to turn out happy, like with Cross or with the article or with any other interaction Lee had, because in most books they do. but they didnt and i found that extremely refreshing. i think in most people's lives, including mine, things dont always turn out happy and its nice to read about other people who experience the same thing.i definitly reccommend this book. it was the first book that i completely related too. its a true depiction of life in highschool."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I loved this novel, and I'm betting you will, too, if you've always considered the first 50 or so pages of The Catcher in the Rye (the boarding school chapters) the best part of that book. (As a teenager, I used to reread those pages over and over on after-school bus trips to high school cross country and track meets, until Holden's dormitory floor was utterly burned into my brain.)So you can say I was an easy target when it came to liking Prep, since I was already a big fan of the premise: outsider teen attends elite prep school and struggles to adjust. But I'm also happy to report that the book vastly exceeded my expectations and left me eager for Sittenfeld's next effort.This is a long, satisfying novel -- the best kind, really, where the author pulls back the curtain on a fully-populated world that's endlessly fascinating, where you get to spend 400 pages as a fly on the wall with a perfect view of the action. I've never attended a prep school (never even set foot on a campus), but by the end of this book, I'd been there and I KNEW this place. Sittenfeld's storytelling ability and attention to detail is that good.One unexpected joy of reading this book is Sittenfeld's colorful language. She's great at using original metaphors, but does so in a way without making her prose overly artsy or look-at-me deliberate. (One of my favorite passages occurs when Lee, the main character, breaks a mirror, and Sittenfeld describes the shards of glass as being in the shapes of Tennessee and North Carolina.)Great books like this are why you read fiction in the first place."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this book in one sitting. The author describes emotions in such an honest fashion that at times I felt that I had found a secret diary and I should look away because it was just too personal. If possible I would give this book six stars on a scale of five. Warning-This is not a happy book. If you're looking for one of those books that starts with the awkward ugly duckling who turns into a swan and lives happily ever after with her prince this is not it. But most of us have already read enough books like that. This book will make you re-evaluate your own life and experiences and take you someplace new and isn't that what the best books do? If you were an outsider you'll relate to and appreciate this book. If you weren't an outsider you'll wonder about the so called \\"loser\\" kids you never bothered to know in high school and you will see them in a new light."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"PREP was nothing like I expected it to be. My sister recommended it to me and since she teaches at a private school in Boston and since we lived in South Bend during our childhood, it seemed to pull me in.Lee Fiora is the key character and if you expect her to be beautiful and smart and talented and everything a prep school student should be, you'll be surprised. There's very little special about her except she's different and confused and not someone that I would particularly like if I met her. Her self-consciousness raises all types of flags and causes her serious confusion as she goes through four years of a prep school where she seldom fits in.I became interested in this book for some reason I can't actually explain. Because it was different from what I expected, because Lee was the way she was, because visiting her and the fringe relationships she had with her classmates (and this is NOT a book about her classmates) intrigued me.PREP is not to be taken lightly. It has some truths to it, and it probably makes some people uncomfortable, but if you like stories about people and their lives, there's a good chance you'll find it to keep your attention from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am not sure what makes this such a powerful novel. Perhaps because it has at least two layers.One layer is a story about boarding school, and one girl's struggles with it. If that were the only layer, or if it's the only layer you focus on, then there would not be much more to \\"Prep\\" than a screenplay for a mediocre teen flick.The other layer is a story of an adult looking back at her teen years. This is the layer that made the book gripping for me. I think most adults feel some degree of pull from their high school or college days. A mixture of nostalgia, embarrassment, regret, etc. Sittenfeld captures those emotions, along with the actual teenage emotions.I also think that the final scenes in the book are beautifully written. You really feel the process of Lee's separation from the school.Finally, the scenes, relationships, and emotions in \\"Prep\\" seem authentic. Precisely because there is no tight plot, because characters appear and disappear, because vignettes (such as a period during which Lee cuts other students' hair) lead nowhere, \\"Prep\\" resembles life. Which is not a screenplay."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While reading this book I began to wish that I was the kind of person that could stop reading a book without finishing it, but no such luck. When I put this down last night, I felt for the first time in a long time that I had completely wasted my time. I kept waiting for something of substance to occur, for some epiphany to leap out at me to make it all worth my time, and nothing came.This is a typical story about an annoying teenager who feels like she is nobody and who has the usual (yawn) high school angst. Nothing new, novel or exciting here. Rather a cliche in my mind. I had hoped that this very unappealing protagonist would realize something, anything, that would make it seem like her experiences in school had meant something, or that I had not wasted my time reading about them, but no such luck. Basically, this awkward and unhappy girl, who is completely bored with everything in life and who has no passion for anything or interest in anything, but who has disdain for everything, floats through 4 years and drags us with her. I can't think of any kid who doesn't have SOME passion or interest in life; whether it be reading, video games, shopping, eating, sports, cartoons, TV, ANYTHING!! But this girl has nothing. She's like a walking zombie. I wanted to shake her and say \\"WAKE UP!!!\\" At the end of this tedious novel I thought that I might discover that she had actually figured things out at some point. That she had found her \\"groove\\" or her niche in college, or through a job, or through a friendship or other life experience. Nope. She hated college, didn't really find a relationship (or at least never alluded to it), didn't really have any meaningful or substantial friendships, and by the looks of it, drifted from job to job. She didn't even travel or try to \\"find herself\\" (to carry on the bad cliche). When I finished reading this, I wanted to slap her, and write a letter to the author (and the publisher) asking \\"what on earth was this supposed to be about?\\". The poorly written scene at the end with her standing on the T platform with a hangover and watching people walk by going about their business was a sad attempt at I'm not sure what. I think the author was trying to accomplish something with this novel, but she just didn't achieve it. Don't waste your time. Read Catcher in the Rye again and save this for the dog to chew or to start the fire when winter arrives."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"On the plus side.It's compulsively readable, even when you want to reach in and strangle the angst-ridden, preternaturally detached, protagonist.On the minus side.After a while, you just want to reach in and strangle the angst-ridden, preternaturally detached, protagonist.Full disclosure: My high school years were spent at a Catholic boarding school. The first year away from home was miserable. I'm familiar with detachment as a survival mechanism, but Lee Fiora, the protagonist of \\"Prep\\" brings it to incredibly irritating, and ultimately implausible, new lows. But whatever you think about Lee, Ms Sittenfeld certainly knows how to write."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Something about this book was painfully sad. Perhaps it was re-living the years nobody wants to re-live..an awkward, uncomfortable, insecure, popularity yearning teen leaves her safe home in Indiana to attend a prep school in Massachusetts..double ugh. She spends her four years lamenting the fact that she doesn't fit in with the rich, chosen ones, alientating herself from her schoolmates and her family back home. The fights with her father are excruciating and never addressed after the scene(s) took place..sort of forgotten. It is hard to decipher what time period the story is taking place. If I had to guess I'd say the 80s, going by the description of her heinous wardrobe and listening to Madonna's Holiday. Occasionally the main character, Lee, would add commentary from present day signifying that she was writing the story from a late 20s to 30s professional woman's view point. Lee is tolerable at the beginning of the novel and forgiven for her behavior but as the story progresses she becomes a bit tiresome, obessing over the same problems..boys, popularity, her looks etc..It was hard not to look at the author's picture on the back cover and put her face onto Lee's character. It seemed conveniently autobiographical. It is an easy, entertaining read but hardly comparable to Salinger."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is about a Midwestern gurl, Lee, who attends a fictitious boarding school just outside of Boston. She discovers the many painful contrasts between life in New England and her life in South Bend, Indiana. She struggles with issues of class and race, and also with competing against students who are far more academically gifted than she believed herself to be whilst attending public school.The plot of the book is excellently crafted. While the book is a retrospective - Lee is at least 10 years out of high school at the time that she is narrating - there are several foreshadowings of what is to come throughout the book that blew my mind.I had several laughing attacks while reading this book. My husband sat in the other room wondering to where his wife had fled and why he was suddenly cohabitating with a hyena.There is also one part in the book that made me cry. Lee's parents come to visit her over Parent's Weekend. The incident is portrayed in a terribly truthful light. It attests to the fact that no matter how old we may be, when our parents enter our personal spheres, it is always - at least slightly - an intrusion. Our parents will try to ask the right questions, or observe things in our little universes sympathetically, but sometimes it feels that they don't get it. Sometimes they try to express their pride in us, but the message gets jumbled or misconstrued. But, as in Lee's case and in my own over and over again, because they are our parents, they somehow forgive us and eventually laugh about Parent's Weekend right along with us.But the real hallmark of the book is the voice. Lee is a melanthropic yet hilarious character whose social commentary is biting and also compassionate at the same time. I always find voice to be a rather difficult thing to master when I write.I could most positively relate to Lee's teenage obsession with whether or not life would improve. The problems with which we contended in high school may seem microscopic now, but we must remember how consuming they once were to us. Will I ever meet a boy who is not a tool? Why can I not redeem myself with my English teacher? Will my relationship with my family ever improve? These are questions I asked myself in h.s. It is a safe vantagepoint now to laugh over them, but oh! How I remember the nights I stayed up listening to Tori Amos \\"Crucify\\" on my walkman, the tears streaming down my face. My parents fast asleep.*********I recommend this book with some reservation, however. There is a great deal of sexuality explored in this book, which in some ways was realistic. Yet, Lee's attitude toward premarital sex, while unchristian, was surprisingly not even feminist. I mean it is one thing to have no reverence for the act of sex itself, but have some reverence for yourself, no? Since I have a high tolerance for such things and was still upset by the way certain attitudes were expressed, I wanted to forewarn anyone looking to pick this up post-haste."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This novel -- promoted as a \\"coming-of-age\\" story of a midwestern girl in an east coast boarding school -- could have been fabulous. It's obvious that the author can write, and she has some great insights into human nature of the teenage kind. But the overall storyline was disjointed, the main character wishy-washy and unappealing, and the sex gratuitous. Too much started to go on while nothing of any real substance happened. Lots of observations about the school and students, but the main character, Lee, was somehow unable to turn that same insight to herself. I found her unbelievable, and, frankly, unlikeable. A dull read -- like slogging through a slush-filled New England February."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I'm a fan of the author and have been for a number of years since she first won a fiction contest in Seventeen Magazine, but I was not completely blown away by this book. The writing is well done and the characters keep you semi-interested in what's going on, but it had a bit too stereotypical of a feel for me. Sure, everybody has an impression of what boarding school kids sound and act like, perhaps even from an outsider's point of view, but Lee's negativity about everything did start to get linear after awhile and drag the book down.I liked \\"An American Wife\\" much better than this."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I read this novel over and over again. I know it's not the best thing out there but for me it really resonates. I do think the belt on the cover makes it look dated. They should not have done that. I think this book is a classic."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is quite brilliant. I read it at breakneck pace and then listened to it again on audio cd about a year later, and was fascinated and enthralled all over again. So much of the criticism on this site of \\"Prep\\" seems to be based on the fact that (quoting from one one-star review), Lee is \\"rude\\" and \\"isn't good at anything\\". I would defy anyone to say they have never been rude (especially to their family) or to feel they are useless at everything and have no niche. This is part of what makes the book so real, and so compelling. Sittenfeld is a completely fearless author, who tells it scarily like it is.More of the complaints centre on the fact that Lee doesn't change. But which of us fundamentally ever \\"changes\\"? The pople writing these reviews have either no grasp of human nature or simply want a glossy, feel-good narrative. What do you expect Lee to do? She is who she is, the same as we all are who we are.I had to laugh at some of these one-star reviews where the writers comment that they could not stop reading this book. If it's that awful, how an earth did you all get through it?Curtis you are a genius, please keep doing what you are doing, and I hope you write a squel to Prep. Love you."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"No one should ever promise that high school, public or private, will be the best four years of your life. If they did, they were lying. Middle school through high school is an example of survival camp. PREP captures the plight of a dysfunctional teen who wants to fit in but doesn't know how. There are more Lee Fioras in high schools than there are Aspeth Montgomerys."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This is one of the most enthralling novels I have ever read and continue to go back to and read again and again. Lee is the perfect protagonist to portray in this novel because she neither fully fits in at her Massachusetts boarding school nor is she a complete outsider. Having come from a small town at the top of her class Lee finds it hard to fully fit in and as a result has this better than thou attitude as a defense. The trials and tribulations she goes through fully exemplify those that any teenager does during four years in high school trying to figure out who they are. It also gives people an inside look into the inner workings of what it is like to be a teenage girl going through the boarding school experience (having done so myself, this book is spot on in its portrayal of that life with its minor differences from my personal experience here and there). Every character in \\"Prep\\" is someone that you have run into in high school and has played a role in your life in some way or another. As a result I have recommended this book to many friends and continue to go back and read it again and again myself."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"An author I once meet told me that he usually wrote his novels set in boarding/prep schools because they give you the freedom to allow the characters to be a bit more grown up and more free from any kind of restrictions that might make you think that the situations they were in and how they were acting was completely unrealistic.Lee is a small town girl that feels like she can do more and be more in her life. It's a very realistic story of what it's like to be a young lady learning how to identify in the world today. She's a relatable character struggling with her family, her social class, her popularity, and her personality. She finds herself making friends with all sorts of different kinds of people, falling in love for the first time, and even coming to terms with who she is and learning to be happy with herself.This book got some comparison to a female more contemporary version of catcher in the rye, and i think those comparisons were very fair and a good starting point for review. This book is not a ride down life in a fantasy world, it's a realistic coming to age novel. It spans her time in high school and even follows up a bit after she's in college. I enjoyed this book because it was relatable to what I experience growing up. It's refreshing to read something that didn't seem so forced and made up, something that could easily have happened to any girl growing up. You might enjoy this book more if you can relate to the main character, because many reviews have complained of the more whiny and angsty nature of this book, but Sittenfeld is a remarkable writer and deserves to be recognized for her first novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The book follows Lee, a student at an exclusive prep school. Lee is there on a scholarship, having decided to move from her lower-middle class home in Indiana to this East Coast private boarding school. Of course, she's always on the outside, as she doesn't have the pedigree that most of the students have. Nor does she have anything like being a person of color or gay to make her popular.Instead, she struggles to fit in, far away from home and her usual circle of people. She does make some friends here and there, but still feels as though she lives her life on the fringe.I wouldn't say that this was a great read, perhaps because it was too real in some ways. The characters could have been examples in the book Queen Bees & Wannabes. They also could have learned a great deal from this book.Beyond having to deal with the usual stress of high school, the kids in Prep also have to be overachievers in just about every way. Even though most of them are legacies, they still need to get into Yale, or Harvard, or Columbia in order to please their families.All in all, an interesting read, and at the end you know what happened to all of the players."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep was the first book I read by the author and was immediately taken with her writing. The thoughts of her characters, their actions..so realistic. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Think Mean Girls (Minus lindsay lohan plus Kristen Stewart)This book gives a very vivid picture of an outcast perspective of a Prep High School outside the Boston Massachusetts area.The main character is not likeable to the reader nor to anyone she comes in contact with in the story, except her closest friend Martha.Unlike in mean girls, where the main character becomes popular and the meanest of the mean, our main character, Lee never becomes popular, throughout the story she stays at the lowerend of the social hierarchy makeup.This was a quick and enjoyable read for me. a good fluffer"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep is the story of Lee Fiora a young girl from Indiana who was convinced that her life would be somehow improved by attending boarding school. At the age of 13 she fills out all the applications and gets accepted into Ault along with a scholarship to pay most of the tuition. But Ault is not at all what she expected. What follows is the typical tale of teenage angst.I read this book for a book club and I'm still not sure what I think about it. One the one hand I'm not sure where the book was going. It didn't feel like it really had a point and just rambled through Lee's life. But at the same time I also felt like I really understood all that she was going through. The college I went to shared many qualities with Ault and I was, in many ways, Lee. My emotions weren't as dramatic, but that may only be the difference of age.I had a hard time rating this book because of my conflicting emotions.

The author covers four years of high school but relates little of what the main character actually does in school or how she changes and evolves. More action and more development of the other characters would help pull the reader in more and make a more interesting book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora is a typical middle-class girl from Indiana who talks her family into letting her attend Ault, a prestigious boarding school in the east, for which she has won a scholarship. Lee, in her teenage, midwestern naivety believes that going away to school will mirror the beautiful pictures on the school brochure...groups of students chatting benignly in front of brick buildings; endless games of basketball and lacrosse; girls in sweater sets and boys in blue blazers. What she finds is a completely insular world where money defines you, even though is is expressly never spoken about and popularity is defined by who is the most casually rich, beautiful, and sarcastic.A fun and outgoing girl at home, Lee immediately becomes wary of her surroundings and is withdrawn into herself, unable to express what she really wants because of her intimidation of their way of life. Anyone who was on the fringes of their high school class will resonate with Lee's thoughts on her unability to fully participate...she never goes to dances or social events and it takes her a full year to find one great friend.Throughout her high school experience, she is in love with Cross Sugarman, the 'golden boy' who helps her during a mall field trip when she gets her ears pierced by herself and faints. They never really have a real relationship, but she can't help herself from holding a candle for him. There are many other fascinating side characters in the story - her best friend Martha, dorm-mates Dede, Aspeth, and Sin-Jun, and her own family who remain her solid link to the regular world from which she came.By the time she is a senior, Lee has made a place for herself at Ault and is finally comfortable, if not with who she really is, at least with what she has become there. Then, in one instant, her entire painstakingly won work of climbing the social ladder falls apart around her and she's left to discover what really matters in her life.I loved this book and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had never heard of Prep until a friend recommended it to a coworker of ours. The idea seemed fun - somewhat a \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" type tale, this time telling a girl's adventures going through boarding school. (A brief pause of warning - don't try to compare the two. I feel The Catcher in the Rye - one of my all time favorite books - is just entirely in its own category).Prep was, indeed, fun. Parts of the novel were funny, and parts were very sad. I felt for Lee's character, for her feeling out of place, feelings of discomfort, and feelings of longing. I think those are emotions anyone can relate to. Overall, I enjoyed taking her journey with her. It's almost as if by reading Prep and taking a week (two, three?) to read what amounts to four years of Lee's life, you can't help but feel a sense of the bittersweet. Reading her stories made me think of high school, and college, and how many of the events in my own life could have been skimmed over, weeded through, picked out as the interesting, poignant, or special ones to be chosen and highlighted like the author chose particular events in Lee's life to write about. I feel it's the type of book that I can revisit in a few years, because it does give you that feeling of both satisfaction and longing for certain times in your own life. And I think that type of reflection is something we need from time to time. I know I do.That being said, I gave Prep four stars out of five because while I truly loved the journey, I was a little upset with the ending. I guess in some ways it seemed appropriate, but I was almost looking for a little bit of a tidier bow, a little bit more insight into where Lee had gone and what she had done since her times at Ault."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"It's 2 AM and I have been glued to \\"Prep\\" since the moment I picked it up, and have managed to finish the book in one sitting. Prep reminds me so much of my life at boarding school, it's uncanny. I think it's easy for people to look back at particular times in their youth, and try to remember only the good parts about it, or think of it in a positive sense and all that they learnt from the experience. While reading Prep, some of the experiences Lee has are SO similar to mine, I'd almost forgotten how many unhappy experiences I had at my school. Having said that, while I had MANY happy moments too, and made a lot of friends because I chose to be myself, I knew a lot of people who like Lee ached to be part of the \\"cool\\" gang. Some of them made it, and sadly, some had to up and leave in a year, or even in a few months. A lot of reviewers have criticized the book or called the character unbelievable or pathetic... I don't think Curtis Sittenfeld has tried to make excuses for the character, or make us like her. I think what she's done here is to tell a true story of an average girl in high school, and if you were a teenager recently, you will probably relate to some parts. If you were a teenager that went to boarding school, you'll relate to it a bit more. And if you were a teenager who went to a high profile boarding school, (I went to Switzerland, not MA), this book is a must read!!"},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Maybe I was too close to the story and setting of this book (I too was the outsider middle class girl who attended a rich girl school)... but I did not find anything likeable about the protagonist of this story, Lee Fiora, and at the end of the book I felt as if nothing had changed. Is it even possible to leave high school the exact way you enter?As the novel progressed and she moved through her high school years I kept waiting for her to grow up, come into her own, do SOMETHING besides mope through every day as an uninteresting, unenthused brat. I kept trying to relate to her on some level-- to have a reason to like her, have sympathy for her, ANYTHING! But it just never happened."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Interestingly, the boarding school protaganist is now a girl emerging into womanhood -- not a boy emerging into manhood. Lee Fiora is not Holden Caulfield (Catcher in the Rye), David Greene (School Ties), Gene Forrester (Separate Peace) or the unnamed narrator (Old School).But, Lee Fiora's issues are not that much different: wealth vs. middle class; beautiful vs. passable; brilliant vs. above average; athletic vs. not as athletic, etc. Lee is the former (or close enough) in public school, and the latter in her elite prep school.And, like any teenager, she has her classic misgivings. She absorbs many of her peers' bad characteristics: snobbery, materialism, pretentiousness, and separation from friends and family when each could help the most. At times, you feel like kicking her and telling her to get on with life as all of the mishaps are self-inflicted.Her parents become an embarrassment to her. Her boyfriend and their sex are almost blood-oath secrets. People do know though -- secrets are rare in the school's small community. And, when her beau rambles to look at others, she haunts him to ask why he is not more open in public with her. Huh? This quandary and so many other nonsensical confrontations lead us to only conclude: No wonder we do not want to relive our high school years.Language is interesting. The modern day usage of \\"hook up\\" is used at this school where chapel is still required 6 times a week -- a requirement more akin to boarding school decades ago. She teaches us what \\"spring cleaning\\" and \\"bank boys\\" mean. Lists of \\"fish or cheese,\\" and other immature teenage pranks ruminate. Colloquial English, perhaps more used at such schools, infiltrates the pages of this highly conversational novel.Like most teenagers, this mixed up kid grows to be a responsible adult -- we hear this when she reminisces about her later life. She becomes, in her language, \\"kinda okay.\\" For parents of a teenage girl, breath a sigh of relief as this kid waded through oceans of confusion in her adolescent years and was delivered to adult society \\"kinda okay.\\" Hopefully, your own has less of a swim."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I believe Curtis Sittenfeld wrote a fine novel. True, it ran a little too long and was thin on plot, but her crafting of the New England boarding school atmosphere seemed satisfactory.I do not believe that the book's central character, Lee Fiora, was a 'heroine'. Sure, she was a protagonist, but her constant negativity and self-absorption makes her seem bitter and unrelatable. I agree with some observations that Sittenfeld did not realistically develop Lee's character. Although she cites on many occasions that she was quite happy pre-Ault, you could not see any joy from Lee's observations when she first started at the school. It seemed as if Lee made a 180-degree reversal to a sad, confused and socially inept teenager, sabotaging any occasion which hinted at any prospect of happiness. Despite Lee's observation near the end of the novel that she has changed (especially when she was with Cross Sugarman), she simply hasn't. You yearned for Lee to make something of the relationship: to make it public, keep it exclusive, or be an equal, but she fails to even step in that direction until it is too late. It is simply frustrating to read a protagonist who does not develop socially. Her timidity, after four years, was unrealistic. And as was pointed out by others about this book, there is no explanation for Lee's ineptitude. Her family seems fine, which makes Lee's awkward behaviour truly bizarre. I wanted to like Lee, but sometimes she could be just inexplicably distant and uninviting (cf her relationships with Ms Moray, Dede or Cross), which made her seem rude and inhuman, even for a teenager.But perhaps my reaction to Lee is what Curtis Sittenfeld wanted: to become frustrated by reading the agonies of adolescence. However I do not think that is a great way of attracting an audience. Indeed, Curtis can write, but perhaps she lost touch with Ms Fiora."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Again, here is a hyped book (by readers, if not critics) which was an utter waste of time. One of the worst books I\\"ve ever read.That sounds harsher than it should. I tend to read reviews and take recommendations from trusted people before deciding what to read. However, I was asked to review Prep for a newspaper. It was really bad.I probably should just paste my published review, but it just got printed so I should probably wait. I'll summarizea) This book should be read as YA literature.b) It is well-written. No problem with the prose. As YA literature, it is amazingly writtenc) The book is utterly uninteresting. Nothing much happens at all. Mainly it details what prep school life is like, but we have all read or seen that a bazillion times. Who cares to read it again? Not me, unless something new an interesting is going in the mix.d) Lee Fiora is totally boring. She has no hobbies or desires (other than for the hottest guy in school) or personality. One quote on the book compares her to Holden Cauffeld. Maybe the most undeserving and absurd literary comparision I've ever heard.e) Not only is Fiora uninteresting, but she is a jerk. Who can sympathize with her? All she does is wallow in self-pity DESPITE the fact that nothing bad happens to her and then she acts like a jerk to her family and anyone not up to her snob standards.g) The coming of age genre is a bloated genre. There are a lot of great books out there (Catcher in the Rye, Virgin Suicides, etc) and a lot of others that at least mix things up (Harry Potter for example).Prep doesn't stand out in any way shape for form in this bloated genre."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Prep was lended to me by a friend who insisted, \\"read it, it mentions Crew twice!\\" She thinks that my world revolves around rowing. So, though I am not a typical fan of rich-girls-boarding-schools-daddy's paycheck-the world is so cruel-teen angst melodramatic hormones, I read it anyway.And I was pleasantly surprised.Brief summary (because you haven't already read it 30 times). Lee is the main character, a very passive 'wanna-fit in' social outcast type who goes to Ault, the boarding school of bank boys and rich daddy's little girls. She is on scholarship, and immediately feels outcaste from her classmates, though her distance is rather her own fault. She has no confidence what so ever, and automatically pulls herself away from all people that try to befriend her. She's not pretty, she's not too smart, she's white and middle class. Not the best combination for Witcho city USA. But then, the lights of heaven! A best friend (who happens to be insanely brilliant, popular, friendly, nice, and Jesus' daughter) and the hunky popular boy that smiles at her once (wait, maybe twice!) in the halls and rescues her from a fainting spell. The ending is weak, but the pages are easy to read as we explore Lee's four years of high school through Hell and Heaven.Why was this book any good? The main character. Though sometimes you want to rip out the page and beat a pencil through her tiny head, she's good and real. Her confidence is so draining you feel like shaking her and screaming 'Stop feeling sorry for yourself and do the right thing! GAWD WOMEN!' But, her flaws are what makes her believable. Her train of thought proves her witty insides can overcome her insecure outsides, with lines that make me laugh out loud (We'd take walks along the beach, and I'd be wearing his grandfather's hunting jakcet.) So teenager/hormone/funny/pathetic that you really connect. Her family fights, her friends fight, she gets insanely jealous and all that jazz. You are just waiting for a fight to break out as she tips on the brink of insanity.But basically, the book summarizes one thing. Teenage years are the 'golden years', but people really do forget how stressful they can be. Sure, work in the later years makes you sigh and look back affectionately at the best times of your high school life, but there is bad stuff too. Lee is haunted by her years at Ault, and though many goods things happen, bad things happen too. We can only truly move on and life if we remember those things, not shove them into a crevasse in the back of our heads and hope they go away. Midterms, boyfriends, the pressure for sex and perfect grades. College and doing something with your life. Being better than the last generation. It's a hard stage in life, and it's a miracle half of us aren't brain dead. But, you gotta suck it up and live life to the fullest and appreciate all the goods parts so that when you feel alone and depressed, you can smile. As does Lee despite it all.The book has believable character you relate too, and many fun and witty plot turns. It gets kinda long, the ending is just baffling, but i do recommend it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"But I wasn't expecting this. Prep was a little too creepy for me - creepy being the only word I can think of. Lee was so unlikeable I almost wished they'd kick her out of school so I could stop reading. But I did finish the book, it just wasn't something I'd want to read again."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thought that with the NYTimes most notable book accolade that Prep would be worth my time. As a former prep school scholarship student, I was hoping to find a kindred spirit in Lee. Alas, I found myself annoyed over and over with Lee. I don't think I would have hung around her if I'd been at Ault with her. And I think she is the type of kid who wouldn't have been happy anyplace. All that is to say, I had little to no sympathy for the protagonist. Several times I nearly quit reading it all together. I did finish it, but I really felt it hadn't merited my time. It was too heavy for fluff reading and too vapid for serious reading.I did give it three stars because at first it did grab my interest and there were some good depictions of teenage narcissism and emotional blindness."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am quite surprised by the really positive reviews I've seen on the site so far. I picked up Prep because I do like coming of age novels, and there aren't many books dealing realistically with a US boarding school experience. I did enjoy the book until about halfway, where Lee's unability to just be herself in front of others and be happy really got to me. She's always looking at others to try to define herself and looks up only to the popular people, regardless of who they truly are - for instance she is desperate to be like Aspeth, who ignores her completely, and yet she does not truly value these people that care for her, like less popular or perfect Martha, Sin-Jun or even Dede. Lee does make some uncomfortable statements as she realises quite clearly that she doesn't fit in and will never be part of the in crowd. However, I don't understand why she would inflict on herself to go through what are described as years of agony if she truly was that unhappy. Lee seems to me like a heroine unable to make choices, to stand up for herself or to just live in the moment."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"There have been several reviews on this site stating that Lee was a snob, that the book had no climax, there was no character growth...I really don't think these people understood the book for what it was meant to be. We're so used to reading books about characters like Lee (outsiders) who triumph in the end, or at least come to some sort of resolution. The fact that there was no real climax or \\"character-changing\\" event doesn't make this book bad; that's not what it was supposed to be! This is why this book is so amazing; it goes outside the \\"mold\\" of this type of story.This book is about the day to day mundane-ness of teenage life and how an overly perceptive and sensitive person views the world. Sometimes there just ISN'T a happy ending, or any real resolution for that matter. But can't anyone look past that and see the tragedy in the anti-climax? If you can't, I suspect you are too far removed from your teenage years or were lucky enough to not experience teenage angst remotely close to Lee's.As for Lee being a snob...please. Her attitude is completely normal for a girl of her age, and anyone who denies this is being unrealistic and ignorant to true to life feelings for a teenage girl in a competitive environment."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I really enjoyed this book of teenage angst and adolescent insecurities. I thought it was a very accurate account of one girl's experiences at a New England prep school."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"From the point of view of someone who went through boarding school, I can tell you Prep is a good book. It's not all that realistic. But its really good. I wouldn't classify it with a Grapes of Wrath or Great Gatsby or anything like that. It's just a good interesting book like My Fractured Life or Old School."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"It is not often that an author can climb inside a character's skin and make that character seem absolutely true to life. However in \\"Prep\\", Curtis Sittenfeld accomplishes just such a feat. Her brilliantly-drawn character is Lee Fiora, a bright young girl from South Bend, Indiana, who feels that she will do much better in a boarding school than in her local public high school. She convinces her parents that this is the road she should take, and when she is accepted as a scholarship student at Ault, she eagerly takes the position. The next four years consist of unending misery for Lee, as she continually measures herself against others and always finds herself lacking. She becomes a veritable recluse while she \\"toughs out\\" the four years of high school, while attempting to be as invisible as possible. Even when others reach out to her in friendship, she finds it impossible to reciprocate. Only a kind girl named Martha can get through her shell, and they spend their last three years as roommates. Lee becomes obsessed with having a boyfriend, yet she always seems to sabotage any efforts that boys make to befriend her. She finally centers her obsession on a boy named Cross, and predictably this relationship is doomed from the start. Sometimes Lee can be maddeningly self-destructive, but whataver her reactions to the situations around her, she comes across as an honest portrayal of an unhappy, self-conscious teenager who is just trying to surivive in a demanding and difficult situation. I am very much looking forward to this author's second novel."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Although I generally find this difficult to do, I could not finish this book. Although it reads fairly well, the content is peppered with page after page of Lee being insecure/uncomfortable/self-loathing/etc. We get the point. Go on. Lacks any real substance other than the internal conversations Lee has with herself, beating herself up, an on.If you are going to read this book, you might think it's ok for the first 60-70 pages then it dawns on you that it doesn't get better. There's no evolution. I made it to about page 160, spending around 100 pages oscillating between \\"sticking it out\\" or \\"waste no more time\\". Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I didn't want to like this book. It looked like cheesy chick-lit, and something about reading about the adolescent trials and tribulations of a working-class Hoosier girl named Lee...well, I got through being an adolescent working-class Hoosier girl named Lee once and I was not really interested in going through it again.But I was blown away by how good a writer Sittenfeld is, and how well she captures the main character, who is usually incredibly unsympathetic and unlikeable, yet always believeable and never without possibility of redemption.Lee Fiora isn't just selfish and snobbish and melodramatic...she's also very young. As a 14- to 18-year-old, she lacks the insight and perspective to realize that everyone else at the school has their own teenage problems equal or greater to her own. She hates the too-earnest young English teacher because she sees a lot of obvious similarities with herself...but doesn't realize that the other, more \\"popular\\" girls' hatred also stems from their own considerable fears and insecurities. As a freshman, Lee develops a mild crush on a senior girl named Gates Medowski and wonders if she might be gay (though the narrator in hindsight realizes that she did not want to have sex with Gates but wanted to BE Gates), but she's blind to the fact that her roommate Sin-Jun actually IS a lesbian. As for Lee's relationship with her sometimes and sort-of boyfriend Cross Sugarman, Sittenfeld has written one of the most spot-on and funniest descriptions of the mechanics of a first kiss since Flannery O'Connor's \\"Good Country People,\\" and one of the most realistically prosaic deflowering scenes since Mary Karr's \\"Cherry.\\"Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, Lee DOES grow up a lot in this novel, just not while in high school. True to life, it takes some time for the lessons learned in high school to sink in. The story of her time at Ault is told by Lee as a 28- or 29-year-old woman who fully recognizes and owns up to her own adolescent self-absorption, yet is still close enough to it to recognize that if all these trivial matters were enough to once rule her life, they probably were not entirely trivial. In one scene at her favorite teacher's house (Lee is flunking math and has come over for extra tutoring), she aches for the teacher to ask about her boyfriend, about her friends, about anything but precalculus. The grown-up Lee says something about wondering why her teachers and adults didn't realize just how much teenagers really did want and respect their advice, even if they didn't always show it. The grown-up Lee becomes good friends with some of the students she was indifferent to or even hated at Ault (once they all grow up and shed their carefully crafted adolescent personas, though, true to life, some people NEVER change), but she and her inseparable best friend Martha drift apart over the years, with no particular reason for their split.A lot of people have commented that \\"Prep\\" and its protagonist spend more time dealing with the minutinae and minefield of teenage social interactions and the actual rigorous academics of Ault School are barely existent in the storyline. The irony, of course, is that the social education IS the valuable preparation for adult life Lee Fiora got out of her boarding school education--she doesn't use calculus or Latin or Ancient Greek in her daily life, but she's got much keener insight into human motivations and relationships.\\"Prep\\" came out not long after and is similar to in basic premise to Tom Wolfe's \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons,\\" but while Wolfe's novel could be at best described as a noble failure, Sittenfeld knocks it out of the park."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"At times I found PREP a bit slow and also at times I found the writing a chore to read since it often had so little forward movement, but it's definitely had a long afterlife for me since I can still recall the most memorable scenes in it (I first read it over two years ago), the most amazing of which are the scenes evoking the sexual instruction that Cross Sugarman gives to Lee Fiora. I've often thought about these scenes since first reading this part of the novel and they always come across as more \\"brotherly\\" than sexual, with Lee as the younger sister learning what to do next. I don't mean that there's anything incestuous about them---far from it, in fact CS could as easily be teaching Lee how to play tennis as teaching her about sex and so what happens is really the opposite of incest--it's just that as writing that's so quietly honest, these scenes feel comic, awkward, tender, and true to life in a way that keeps on being a revelation."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Well, I guess it's not enough that all of the young lions and lionesses out there have an exclusive (Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Bennington, Stanford, etc., etc.) pedigree that places them in a different social league than 89% of their fellow Americans; now these folks are going to start writing about these delimiting experiences as well. Wow, I guess it's a nice break from the novelized versions of \\"Friends\\" that keep popping up in front of me like bright pink bubble-gum bubbles whenever I open a magazine. And I guess since the average consumer deigns to sit through a book review only if it has (a) 150 words or less and (b) a letter grade at the end to abbreviate the conclusion reached in those tedious 150 words, we might as well have a book that's all about grades."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I did not care for this book and the only reason I kept reading was to see if it would get interesting; it never got interesting. I kept skipping paragraphs just to get to more interesting parts. I went to school in a small town in Mass, although it wasn't a prep school, it was as close to one as any public school can get. I was the type of person to do what I wanted just because no one else did; I didn't care what 'they' thought of me. I started hating Lee very early in this book because she was such a fake, phoney person. I kept thinking that Lee needed to stand up and be herself. There was no depth to any of the characters."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The protagonist in this novel is so unreal and unrelatable that it's difficult to read. Besides the fact that this book is extremely slow moving, it's almost as if the author made a caricature of a character and we're supposed to buy it. She's completely unsympathetic and it's almost embarrassing reading about her naivete. It's just too difficult for me to buy that she could be as dumb as she is sometimes and then so insightful at others. She's not likeable and it's not any surprise that she has no friends (because, basically, she has no personality) and it's totally confusing when she catches the eye of the most popular boy (even just for sex) because it doesn't ring true at all. There are just so many things about being young that it seems the author has gotten wrong. To me, Fiora is the opposite of preppy, it's something she doesn't even know how to be.There were a lot of times when I almost gave up finishing this book, out of boredom and annoyance and I don't think that, by completing it, I have gained anything. Which proves, yet again that, just because a book is a \\"bestseller\\" and loved by the masses, does not mean it's quality."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I first picked up this book because of all the rave reviews and the enticing cover, but I was sorely disappointed when I discovered that the novel was nothing more than the annoying whining of a self-absorbed, low self-esteemed loser.The protagonist's lack of both personality and confidence is so disturbing and frustrating, that I could not even finish the second half of the book. Please know that I never stop reading a book smack in the middle.Not only is the main character unengaging, but the other characters simply fly in and out of her life. I don't believe I could identify any form of character or plot development. I personally don't believe it was well-written either.I didn't go to prep school, but I really don't think that has much to do with anything. I am not a wizard that plays Quidditch, and I still loved Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"She is over analyzing everything she sees thinks or does, And too much detail makes the story boring. It needs to keep my attention but it doesn't.. It's like reading a teen's diary."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While the novel \\"Prep\\" is an accurate description of what a New England prep school is like, I did not find it to be as engaging as I'd hoped. The primary reason for this is that the character development of the main character, Lee, is weak. Lee is not a likeable character. The reader tires of her whining and complaining about her inability to fit into a wealthy world with a unique set of rules.Curtis Sittenfield has commented that she realizes that readers may not sympathize with Lee Fiora, a rather naive young woman who enters prep school as a scholarship student from the midwest and spends four years feeling like an \\"outsider\\". Sittenfield also, it seems in an interview, advises those who dislike Lee to abandon the book - poor advice, particularly as an English teacher.The book is not wholely inaccurate. Prep school is a tough world particularly for someone who is not from Northeastern wealth. However, Lee does not even attempt to take full advantage of the academic opportunities made available to her. She does not seem to learn from her social experiences in prep school and apply them to her social encounters in college, which is disappointing.All freshmen, even those who are part of the Northeastern elite, feel awkward and left out as freshmen. This is one of the primary lessons of prep school - learning to find one's feet and autonomy. Lee is feeble because she does not do that.The first half of the book is good, interesting - it is in the lack of character development and the absurd culmination of the obsession of Cross Sugarman that the reader feels frustrated. I wouldn't say that the book is not worth the read, it is, but just don't expect to be overwhelmed. It does not enlighten the adult reader regarding the adolescent state of mind under extreme social pressure."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Great writing, but the character...ug! I was miserable reading about her miserable time at school. Nothing happened for her because she didn't do anything for herself except wallow in self pity. Again, the book was extremely well written and I hope the author comes out with another book, but hopefully with characters full of life."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I live in the city that the author is from (and have worked with her father in the past) so I was chomping at the bit to read this. I loved it! Curtis has a way of really drawing in her reader and telling a captivating story."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I will concede that this book was well written - but that is it. I found this character to be so incredibly frustrating and pathetic. Maybe it was because I could not relate to what she was going through - but is it really true that all those who feel like outsiders are so completely passive about improving their experiences? Lee was SO ANNOYING! I also thought that the book REALLY rambled at times and I found these parts to be rather boring."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The only reason I'm giving this two stars rather than one is because I really enjoyed the first \\"year.\\" Which made the rest of the book even more of a catastrophic letdown than it otherwise might have been.So, let's see: A rich girl who went to prep school and seems to have a massive chip on her shoulder writes a book about a lower middle class girl who went to prep school and has a massive chip on her shoulder? And said rich girl makes the \\"LMC\\" girl even more of a snob than her upper crust classmates? And nothing happens, ever? And you never get to know any of the characters, including the protagonist, on anything but the most superficial level? And the dialogue is crap? And \\"years later\\" the protagonist can look back and understand all the things they did wrong, and how inevitable it was because they were teenagers?And over this, we're all supposed to cream ourselves at the authenticity, and compare it to Catcher in the Rye, and say \\"ooooh, we know EXACTLY how Lee feels?\\"Give me a break. Of course we all know EXACTLY how Lee feels, because this is the most banal, overtold story in the world. It's not that we've really felt that way ourselves, it's just that we've read enough Juv-Fic in our lives that we believe we ought to have at sometime between the ages of 14 and 17.This should've been marketed as Young Adult Literature, because from start to finish, that's exactly what it is. What a trite piece of junk."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I hope Curtis Sittenfeld never writes another long weak awful book like this one was. While it captures some of the flavor of attending a prep school, it also meanders on for nearly 400 pages never making a point and never cheering up - whole book needs a good drug and was a waste of time to read.Her point - the breakthrough message of the novel - appears in the last 20 or so pages of the book: \\"If you feel like there are differences between you and other people, how much you want to play them up is really your decision.\\"I'm also mad that she waited to introduce new information about the main character and her past until - again - the last 20 pages of the book.The character, Lee Fiora, seems to have a natural bent towards journalism - she asks herself interesting questions - and since even the reviewers seem confused whether there's any separation between the protagionist and the author, Ms. Sittenfeld might consider a career in journalism - her fiction doesn't move, progress, or grow - it lacks a plot - it lacks a point."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"While I hesitate to put this author in the category of the Carson McCullers, I found this young author's first novel touchingly engaging, evocative and poignant. I sat up most of the night to finish it, an indulgence I can rarely afford. I am a graduate of a private secondary school and formerly all-male university and found so much to which I could relate, despite my being a generation older than Ms. Sittenfeld. Additionally, as a college physician and the mother of two adolescents, my heart broke for the protagonist, Lee Fiora, and hated her prep school advisor for doing so pitiably little for this needy child. To portray the book as a three-hankie is misleading, however, as there was plenty of caustic humor in her tale as well. Further, there was far greater verisimilitude in the portrayal of her female characters, in particular, than is generated in \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons,\\" Tom Wolf's unconvincing novel about a brilliant, athletic, beautiful and disciplined but inexplicably helpless adolescent and her cheerleader-esque cohorts in an Ivy League university. Ms. Sittenfeld's novel easily sits above the salt with the gold standards of adolescent literature, including \\"A Separate Peace,\\" \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" \\"Old School,\\" and \\"Brideshead Revisited.\\" My one minor criticism concerns the disingenuous title and dust jacket. This truly reminds us that one should not judge a book by its cover. The title is cheap, the jacket cheaper. I suspect the publisher was making an attempt to attract the \\"chick lit\\" crowd, but this is so, so much better than that newly popular genre of fiction. My dust jackets usually disappear into the black hole under my bed anyway."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I had a wonderful time reading this book. As the parent of an adolescent girl, it helped me recall the pain and torturous self consciousness of adolescence. It re-sensitized me to those very difficult times and that's a good thing for a parent. It was the perfect read for a cold, snowy weekend. I did not want it to end."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"This book had the potential to be so so so much more than it was. An Indiana teen-age girl on scholarship at an elite New England prep school. It received wonderful reviews and the write ups I read in magazines had me wanting to read it. And after I finished it, all I could ask was, \\"What book were they all reading?\\"This main character is boring, mindless, and self-involved. She's a brat, to put it mildly. And none of the other characters were developed enough throughout the course of the book to make me give it a better rating. This story line could have been so much better, but because Lee herself is nothing, so was the book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"After 494 reviews, I'm afraid I can't say much else.This was compared to \\"Catcher In The Rye\\". Yikes! No way.Basically, the \\"novel\\" takes us into the world of a girl named Lee, who earns a scholarship to a prestigious boarding school in Massachusetts. She meets many different kids her age and takes her passive self through stealing, having a seizure while getting her ears pierced at the local mall, dealing with parents who make almost seven digits a year, and even random oral and vaginal sex with a crush figure.The author claimed she knew what was going on, because she herself attended boarding school and she worked there. Seriously, I caught an interview where she claimed, \\"I could just go downstairs and see what they were having for dinner. It was really easy for me.\\" Well, I don't know what she was thinking with this as a debut, because it's really hard to read. I read it the summer I was thirteen, and even I knew it was a terrible waste. The story doesn't follow. It's very hard to read, understand, and even sympathize with the character.The platform scene at the end of the book didn't make sense to me, either. Yes, it's been four long years since you last saw the world, but is that really so accurate? Actually, to me, it's more like, \\"Thank God, I finally made it out of high school!\\" She went to the mall and restaurants, however protected by classmates and friends, during her Ault career. Why should standing on a train platform thinking she missed out on four years of life be any different (even if she just graduated the night before)? Lastly, how could anyone with a hangover even have such a comprehension (even if it's an inaccurate one)? Wow, I just... WOW."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, and it started off with an engaging premise. While it was interesting to have a behind-the-scenes look at elite boarding schools, the main character Lee Fiora seemed stalled as a character. She was mousy, and never seemed to develop or grow during her four years at Ault. Granted, not every teenager goes through momentous life changes during high school, but I would have expected a bit more character maturation during the span of the book. By the middle of the book, I was finishing it just to finish it because of the time I'd spent reading it, not because I particularly cared what happened to any of the characters. Perhaps at the end of the day, I didn't like the main character because the book focused on such an awkward stage of life, but I also think the writing was at fault by not pursuing more interesting character development."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiora is a bright, intelligent girl who shone academically in her junior high school years, but finds things very different when she joins a select, private high school. The precocious 13 year old rather fancied the idea of going to boarding school, not realising that students needed to have wealthy parents to be able to afford those kinds of fees. She wrote off to a few schools and was accepted for a scholarship at Ault School, an old, prestigious establishment, where there were places for minorities and for just a few white students. Life there is very different from the one she was used to in her small Indiana town, with no one flaunting their parent's money but just taking it for granted in the way that the very rich do. Lee never did feel accepted in all of the 4 years that she spent there but this was mainly because of her own attitude which was so introspective that she became totally self absorbed in the way that a lot of teenagers do. It was an ok read but I couldn't warm to this girl in the slightest."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Lee Fiola from South Bend, Indiana, applies and gets admitted to an exclusive private prep school, Ault, in Massachusetts about 30 minutes from Boston. Without any friends, family, or self confidence, she arrives for her freshman year extremely aware that her family's dusty Datsun does not really compare to the fancy cars in which her classmates are dropped off. This is only the first of many observations that Lee makes over the next four years that increase her feelings of inadequacy. She has trouble making friends, is clueless when it comes to interactions with boys, and finds herself suffering academically due to her social concerns. Prep traces her four years of high school and her convoluted road of personal development including rifts with both family and acquired friends.I was fairly disappointed in this book. I found Lee to be a hard to like character with personality flaws that contradicted themselves. It was difficult to believe that someone as timid and unsure of herself could be so bold and almost nasty in other situations. The character just did not work for me. Additionally, the story dragged in places and was not particularly engaging. Published just 2 months earlier, I am Charlotte Simmons, by Tom Wolfe handles this topic much more smoothly albeit with a character that is in college as opposed to high school. Otherwise, the topic of these two books is extremely similar with Wolfe's version being more credible and more entertaining despite it's own flaws.Not a bad first effort, but not as good as I had hoped. I would still read other books from this author in the future."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I was engrossed by this novel immediately. The main character is a teenage girl named Lee who is from a middle-class family & decides to attend boarding school even though she is not like typical \\"boarding school kids\\" (basically she's not rich, snobby, or of above-average intelligence.)The book highlights Lee's struggle with finding herself in a difficult, unusual atmosphere. It also deals with the thoughts of any typical teenage girl in regards to love, boyfriends, money, and friendship. One of the common questions that we come across in the book is Lee asking herself if she made the right decision in taking a risk and coming to boarding school. She often wonders what she's doing there, if she should go back home, and is curious about how others perceive her because she's different than them.I think this book gives comfort to teenage girls who feel unsure of themselves and about what others think of them. It shows that those feelings are completely normal, and that they are not alone in feeling that way. It also provides comic relief and may make some teens think, \\"I really don't have it that bad!\\" because of some of the sticky, embarrassing situations Lee gets herself into.This book is also a good read for non-teens, because it can show you what is going on inside the head of a typical teenage girl of today. It also may make you relive some of your experiences as a teen, which hopefully, as Lee does at the end of the book when she's long out of boarding school, you can laugh about now."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I have to say, I stayed up to finish this book in one sitting and I really love the nuances and minutiae that are nothing like anyone else I've read. I laughed out loud at the period where Lee snowballs her way into giving her classmates free haircuts but ultimately gets no social mileage out of it.My main complaint is that the author's \\"retrospective voice\\" kept tripping me up. I mean, let's face it, this is literary fiction and I prefer literary fiction. A story doesn't need a turbo-paced plot...but give us SOME suspense. There's no need to let us know before the end of the book whether Lee ultimately graduateds from Ault or which classmates she remains friends with in adulthood. Nothing would have been lost if we learned AFTER the fact that a teacher will get fired or a student will leave. Just when my curiosity got piqued -- e.g. academic problems that threaten her school standing -- Sittenfeld popped the balloon with \\"after I graduated...\\"When we do get to the crux of why Lee went out of her way to get into prep school and why she chose to stay, once again there's a false alarm. She gets a little too personal with a New York Times reporter who takes her remarks about school out of context -- but it's a week before graduation and the crisis is moot, anyway. It might have been more effective had the news article incident happened in sophomore year, when Lee was still in a position to make a decision on whether or not to graduate from Ault...and when she could have felt the full spectrum of the \\"cold shoulder\\" treatment from her classmates.By the way, if she was in danger of failing classes, wouldn't she have lost her financial aid before being in danger of expulsion?All in all a great effort, though, and I look forward to reading Sittenfeld's next book."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I am on chapter two and I have closed the book found my receipt and looked up the return policy...What a surprise the Black girl is the THIEF!!!!

I expected in a way I might be able to relate to this girls situation. I am an outsider at a jewish prep day school, and in no way am I able to identify myself into the groups of society. I didn't enjoy reading about this girls angst, when she was the one who needed to step up herself."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"The observant patron may have noticed that the Stern Librarian's already perfect complexion exuded an even more alluring glow the week she was reading Prep. She had at long last discovered an American novel that confronted the issue of social class head on. Officially, patrons, class does not exist in American fiction, and all it takes is money and an \\"Oggsford\\" education and a name change for poor Jay Gatz to woo Daisy Buchanan. Prep takes us into the world of an elite New England prep school, Ault Academy, which to the S.L.'s ear sounds like a combination of St. Paul's and Andover. The main character, Lee, is a scholarship student and never allows herself to forget it. Instead of immersing herself in Ault, she stays in her room and studies old yearbooks, memorizing the faces and the backgrounds of classmates inferred from their addresses. Such anti-social study becomes oddly social (or not) when the game of Assassin sweeps the campus, and Lee knows what everyone looks like. The Stern Librarian herself once fell for a sturdy young man in Gokeys and a cardigan at her own New England grove of academe, so she cannot fault Lee for her affair with Cross, the most popular boy in her class. However, the S.L. does condemn Lee for acquiescing to Cross's demand that they never be seen talking in public and Cross himself for visiting the foulest insult she has ever read in a novel on Lee. The scene the Stern Librarian will never forget is Lee's family's visit on Parent's Weekend, and the undeserved shaming which Lee's mattress salesman father receives from his daughter. The book follows Lee through all her years at Ault, and concludes with a perverse bit of revenge, which opens up a different discussion of what class is. This book will keep you up late at night and is not recommended for patrons who are bus drivers, pilots or otherwise need a lot of sleep. Book report writers, take note that it is difficult to tell in what time period this novel takes place--don't overlook the reference to a cassette player. The Stern Librarian tells you to whisper and you like it."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I enjoyed reading this book on the beach last summer while relaxing during a short vacation. It is an interesting take on a somewhat unoriginal story. I wouldn't give it a so-so. Not too bad, not too good. Maybe worth a try."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I go to a boarding school myself and like most high schools we have our own sort of culture. I had heard about this book and a lot of speculation it. I indulged myself and bought it here on amazon. After completing it and reading up on Curtis Sittenfeld I've decided that she's giving boarding school a bad name. I'm sure that some schools aren't as diverse as mine and do have a lot of the problems that Sittenfeld addresses but she believes that boarding school is a bad place for children and if you're not rich and gorgous you will feel alienated. At my school we have a large enough endowment that over half of the students recieve some sort of financial aid or scholorship and our student population has kids from not just all over the country but all over the world. I'm in my second year here and although I myself come from the same sort of backround as Lee, the main charactor, I don't find myself even remotely as alienated. Sometimes it's hard to be away from home but I doubt that I've suffered emotionally more then anyone in any high school does. I think that Lee and possibly Sittenfeld herself must suffer from some sort of social anxiety type disorder. By all means read this book, I had trouble putting it down. But dont become a boarding school hater because of it. I doubt that there is one student in my school of 700 that would tell a story as full of misery as Lee's."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"Although I have not finished the book yet (though I'm nearly there...), I have to point out the obvious datedness of this book.

Reading about high school experiences of the well-to-do prep school students was interesting, and if Sittenfeld's narrator was more interesting and less of a doorpost the book could have been a dynamic tour-de-force instead of what it ended up as, which is less than the sum of its parts.Recommended with caution."},{"Title":"Prep","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel!

Gon on Safari continues Masashi Tanaka's reputation for artistic quality and the warped humor that makes his little dinosaur an engaging hero for all ages. These are books accessible to any language; there are no words, excepting the titles themselves. Language is unnecessary, as all the characters are either animals or Mother Nature herself. Gon survives, -- thrives, -- on a life that tips everybody around him into chaos. The natural order of things is turned upside-down as he bulldozes his single-minded way through the African Veldt, championing the occasional underdog, and unlinking the food chain as he goes.Despite the fact that the character is a dinosaur that borders dangerously on the 'cute' side, Tanaka doesn't make the mistake of putting Gon in a Sanrio world. Predators prey, the vulnerable die, and even the best of animals meet death when it comes for them. Gon is the anti-Barney, hot-tempered, voracious, and unstoppable; Tanaka's meticulous pen depicts it all with real genius, and an incredible eye for detail that makes it no surprise that it can sometimes take weeks to draw a single page.This volume contains the following stories:Gon with the Huge Wise ElephantGon and the Bird Nest on his HeadGon and his Wounded FellowsGon Climbs a Mountain"},{"Title":"Gon on Safari (Paradox Fiction)","review":"If you've never &quot;read&quot; a Gon book, get thee to a bookstore. I use the word &quot;read&quot; in quotation marks because the only words in Gon books are the titles. Gon is a delightful meticulously-rendered itty-bitty dinosaur with a bad attitude. Sometimes, underneath his scaled tough exterior, he's a big softy. My favourite tale in Gon on Safari is &quot;Gon and the Bird Nest on His Head&quot;. While on a typical rampage, he knocks a bird nest out of a tree, and somehow ends up with it as a bizarre hat. The three baby birds who live in it are terrified, at first. After a while, they become accustomed to their new &quot;tree,&quot; and begin to notice some fringe benefits.The story may sound trite and simplistic, but seeing the art will change your mind. Masashi Tanaka is a master cartoonist. Each of his drawings must take hours, and sometimes even days to complete. He pays careful attention to even the most miniscule detail, and the end result is pure joy."},{"Title":"Gon on Safari (Paradox Fiction)","review":"In this edition of the Gon saga, our dinosaur tourguide takes us from the snowcapped peaks of Tibet to the acrid plains of the African Veldt as he goes on Safari. While it is in the same short story format that Gon readers will, no doubt, find themselves familiar with, one of the stories actually deals with more than perseverance and curiosity, holding pangs of sadness within it as it branches out to deal with the slightly touched venue of demise.A short synopsis of the stories (without spoiling them):Gon with the huge wise elephant is a tale that starts with the adventuresome Gon traveling with a herd of elephants in the middle of a huge storm. It slowly morphs into something more, however, placing Gon in the midst of an elephant's struggle to find its final resting spot, a cavern filled with the bones of other elephants. Though filled with some comical portions of classic Gon exploits, it is a bit more serious than most other portions of the book.Gon and the bird's nest on his head finds Gon with, you guessed it, a bird's nest on the top of his head. Three chicks are living inside at the time, three riders in for the experience of their lives.Gon and his wounded fellows pits Gon and some hardened animals against the wiles of an unfriendly, sometimes fire-riddened forest.Gon climbs a mountain, the final story in the book, puts Gon up against an impossible seeming task, that of climbing a mountain with stubby, almost nonexistent, arms. Besides weather and the height, he also has some other woes, like that of a very unfriendly Ibex dancing on his head."},{"Title":"Griswold Mfg. Co., 1918 Catalog Reprint, Catalogue No. 47 (Price Guide)","review":"Despite passing itself off as a catalogue reprint with a contemporary price guide, this book really only succeeds as a reference source for those few of us who are interested enough in collecting Griswold cast iron that we enjoy pouring over old documents such as this in an effort to learn more about the various products that Griswold made. There are only a handful of Griswold catalogues availible in reprint form, and at present this is the only one of those for sale on Amazon. If you're practically addicted to collecting old skillets and griddles and such, then you'll appriciate the fact that L. W. Publishing made this reprint. It is exactly that; a page-by-page reproduction of a 1918 catalogue of cast iron products (mostly cookware) manufactured by Griswold. If that was all that it attempted to be, I could have givin it a higher rating. I held that fifth star back because of the price guide, which is a very brief but just about completely useless price list tacked on, appendix fashion, to the very end of the book. Even taking into account the fact that this catalogue reprint was published at a time when more ideal cast iron price guides (Smith & Wafford's blue and red books, specifically) hadn't been around for very long, the price \\"estimates\\" are laugable at best, and downright careless at worst. No attempt was made to imbibe the price list with the details necessary to make it accurate; instead, price ranges are squeezed into nonsense groupings in a format to fit the pagination of the original catalogue. Unfortunately, the presentation of these pieces in the original catalogue is in no way representative of the price some of them command as antiques today. For example, if you collect Griswold, you know what a serious sin it is (and was, no doubt, in 1996 when this book was published,) to try and group skillet sizes 11-14 into a single $50-$75 price range; a sin that this book commits seemingly unknowingly. (By the way, if you don't understand why that's such a mistake, then no offense, but this book will never hold your interest.)As long as you don't mistake it for a price guide (despite its own cover's assertion that it can function as one,) and as long as you're into Griswold collecting passionately enough that you actually want to spend hours analyzing an old catalogue, then you'll be glad for this book. But if it seems like a cow flop to the rest of the cows, that's because it was never published with the general herd in mind."},{"Title":"Senator Joe McCarthy","review":"\\"Senator Joe McCarthy\\" is an account of the four years, 1950-1954, during which Sen. McCarthy held the attention of the nation and the world. Author Richard H. Rovere was serving as a correspondent covering McCarthy during the period of his national prominence.This book contains some material on McCarthy's earlier life and political career and a little about his personal life. It, for the most part, focuses on McCarthy's time as the Communist hunter in chief. Little is said about McCarthy's attractive personality and his close friendships in the Senate, particularly with Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.This book makes the case of McCarthy as a demagogue, seeking nothing more than personal glory. He makes the case that McCarthy was misguided and that, if the Communists in government issue had not been available, McCarthy would have pursued some other issue with equal vigor. He makes the case that McCarthy was misguided in that the Communist threat was in the form of external aggression rather than internal subversion. He claims that, for all of his ranting and raving, McCarthy got no Communists out of government. He makes the claim that McCarthy's preparation was sloppy and that his evidence did not support his charges. He criticizes McCarthy's treatment of witnesses as merely being an attempt to make McCarthy look good rather than a legitimate attempt to discern the truth.Rovere does give McCarthy credit for the immense power which he wielded and the influence which he had, for better or worse. He credits McCarthy for ending the career of Gen. George C. Marshall and other, less distinguished, officials. He explains how McCarthy took the issue of recognition of Red China out of the realm of public debate. He identifies Senators who, after incurring McCarthy's wrath, were defeated for reelection and issues on which the Truman and Eisenhower administrations were terrorized into positions which they, in the absence of McCarthy, might not have taken.I began this book with the expectation of disliking it. I expected a hatchet job of Sen. McCarthy, but really did not find it. Rovere makes cases for his opinions. He does not dig into the slime of gossip to support his criticisms of McCarthy. He raises the claim that McCarthy was a homosexual, and then concludes that there is no evidence to support it. He comes down very hard on staffers Roy Cohn and David Schine, but limits McCarthy's culpability to the decisions to hire them and subsequent failure to properly supervise. First published in 1959, it lacks some of the historical perspective that more modern works may have. It makes a reference to America falling behind in the arms race with the USSR, an issue which was important in the 1960 election, but which was later shown to have been unjustified. The subsequent opening of KGB archives may place the issue of Communist infiltration of government in a different perspective. The later success of his Senate cronies, Kennedy and Nixon, may shed a different light on the McCarthy's Senate career as evaluated by his colleagues. Rovere repeatedly refers to surveys which found McCarthy to be the worst senator. The quality of his friends may give added stature to McCarthy's career.This book changed my impression of Joseph McCarthy. He portrayed McCarthy as an opportunist who fought the wrong battle at the wrong time and fought it poorly. While I am grateful for those who carried on the battle against Communism, I am forced to consider McCarthy a flawed knight who lent his words, but not his heart, to the battle. Any book that can change my impression of history has value to it."},{"Title":"Senator Joe McCarthy","review":"Richard Rovere (1915-79) wrote this very readable book about Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin in 1959, two years after Tailgunner Joe passed away. Rovere provides brief background on the Senator, but concentrates heavily on McCarthy's Senate time as a anti-Communist witch hunter from 1950-1954. As the author shows, McCarthy had the look of a one-termer in 1950 and needed an issue to raise his profile when he made that infamous speech at Wheeling, West Virginia that set the ball in motion. Rovere shows that McCarthy was a man in need of an issue, and had communism not existed he would have searched for something else. Readers see how the issue and McCarthy's profile ballooned way beyond expectations, making McCarthy one of the most-feared public figures, not to mention most-admired and most-loathed. The problem, of course, was that McCarthy was couldn't back up his charges about 57 or 205 communists working in the State Department. Harry Truman and Edward R. Murrow stood up to him, Eisenhower saw thru him (but didn't oppose him), and some like Robert Taft saw McCarthy as a usefull tool for attacking the Democrats - but disliked how McCarthy kept going once the GOP took control. As the author shows, McCarthy declined rapidly after his 1954 censure by the Senate, passing away in 1957 from either hepatitis or alcohol-related liver problems. I'd have liked better documentation and more information on McCarthy's assistants (or henchmen) David Schine and Roy Cohn. Still, this is a readable, informative look.My father saw McCarthy speak at the University of Wisconsin in the early 1950's and recalled that every time the skeptical students called for McCarthy to show his evidence, the Senator kept answering that he had the proof right there - but never revealed it. Same old story. Did soviet communist spies exist? Yes. Did McCarthy find any? No."},{"Title":"Senator Joe McCarthy","review":"Just before the American Civil War, a Southern congressman explained why Abraham Lincoln's election was a sufficient cause for secession. He said that it was not merely the election of dangerous man, which he realized was part of the political process. Abraham Lincoln, he argued, was elected because he was dangerous.Senator McCarthy was not elected because he was dangerous. That McCarthy came to dominate American politics for the last years of the Truman administration and the first few couple of years of the Eisenhower administration was unforeseen by anyone, least of all himself. His rise from anonymity to become among the strongest people in the Unites States, and therefore in the world, was sudden. His decline was even faster, and if McCarthy started 1954 as a major player, by January 1955 Vice President Nixon could report that he was no longer any danger to the administration.Richard H Rovere, a journalist and an observer of the politics, wrote in 1959 what was seen at the time as the definite account of the Senator from Wisconsin. Rovere, a master of prose, is best when making a psychological portrait of McCarthy, seeing him as an empty cynic, a vain man who believed in nothing, who hunted not for power, but for money and glory. He was a dangerous man, who turned America away from important foreign policy issues and focused on looking for spies, traitors and \\"bad security risks\\" - and, although he terrorized the government, forced conformity, and shrank American freedoms, never found any.Yet there is also a certain mischievous appreciation in Rovere's description. He says that McCarthy was not in the Republican San Francisco convention of 1956, and that it was duller for his absence (p. 242). His descriptions of McCarthy's manipulation of the press, the way he knew how to create a story, appreciates the ingenuity of the Senator. And if McCarthy was a cynic, who ruined people who have not sinned, he also did it without spite or malice. As Rovere has it, McCarthy never took himself seriously, even as the world did (p. 58)Perhaps the best insight Rovere has into McCarthy is his description of McCarthy's great innovation \\"The Multiple Untruth\\". Not a single lie or even a few, McCarthy's lies were so huge and inconsistent, that they were almost impossible to disprove. Any part of it that you knocked down would also make the rest seem the more solid. McCarthy blew so much smoke that people assumed there must have been a fire somewhere.Rovere's greatest weakness is in explaining the chronology of McCarthy, and the background. Much of it is because he wrote for people of 1959, who knew the general outline. But for people with only a very general knowledge of the 1950s, Rovere's book never quite explains things all the way through. This is especially bad in his description of the Army-McCarthy hearings. As someone who is not very familiar with the events, I emerged from that vital part only slightly more enlighted then before.Another failure is the journalistic defense of sources, which keeps several of the people involved disguised. It is a little annoying to have pages devoted to either an \\"unnamed reporter\\" or to an \\"X\\".Both failures could have been addressed by the introduction, written in 1996 by historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr. Unfortunately, except for a few none too revealing comments on Rovere himself, Schlesinger chose to waste his introduction on a summery of the book's argument.If the lack of background and specifics make the book a less then perfect history of McCarthy and his time, Rovere's fantastic prose make it a most pleasurable read nonetheless.His discussion of the effectiveness of McCarthy's networks of informants: \\"If any communists [existed in the government agency], they were so well hidden that the sort of people who were in the underground [i.e. McCarthy's informants], would never find them - unless, of course, some of those in the underground were communists, which was not altogether out of the question\\". (pp. 197-98)Elsewhere, Rovere comments that \\"Hollywood has always been a hotbed of conformity, and advertising it always ready to ride with any hounds. By their very nature, these institutions yield before external pressure; it is, in fact their substitute for inspiration\\".Though dated, Rovere's is still a fascinating and very well written study."},{"Title":"Senator Joe McCarthy","review":"I liked this book as an overview of Senator Joseph McCarthy. However, the author is a bit biased and he does not provide any sources for his information. In addition, I expected the author to elaborate more on the famous trials conducted under McCarthy's orders, but I didn't find any."},{"Title":"Senator Joe McCarthy","review":"A lot has transpired since Richard Rovere died in 1979 that makes his book outdated and irrelevant: Venona and the disintergration of the Soviet Union, for example. Both have put paid to such questions as &quot;if there were Communists in the State Department.&quot; Arthur Herman's book &quot;Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator&quot; --using the revelations and documents from the former Soviet Union-- clarified these issues once and for all. McCarthy may have been an eccentric demogogue and an alcoholic (so what makes him different from many other politicians?) but history shows that he got it essentially right. Diehard communists, progressive communist sympathizers and all those misguided souls that believed and still believe that it was a &quot;noble&quot; cause-- will never forgive him for getting it right."},{"Title":"Senator Joe McCarthy","review":"No one will be offended by Rovere's much-racking depiction of Joseph McCarthy. Seriously, how many people are there left in America, or anywhere around the world, still willing to stand up and smugly look you in the eye and say Joseph McCarthy was a necessary man fighting for American freedom in a time when Communists were hiding in every shadow? But the book, written in 1959, just isn't all that up-to-date. Of course much of the information we now know was suppressed at that time and J. Edgar Hoover--viciously complict in the development of all the Red Scare and blacklisting craziness--was still in power at the time of publication. Nobody would want to make an enemy of Hoover, so anything dealing with McCarthy and Hoover's contact is treaded over very lightly. This, unfortunately, makes the book somewhat inaccurate, which is a shame because so many dark secrets and shameful public deeds are recorded with a passion and an obvious intense desire to destroy the image of the drunken old demogogue. In 1959, just three years after McCarthy's death, and five years after his disgrace, this was an important book because so many people were still unsure of their opinions towards Tailgunner Joe. I imagine that this book made quite a difference as even Hoover himself took the opportunity to smear the late Senator, drawing comparisons to Krushchev's posthumous denunciation of Stalin. The book is certainly worthwhile for anyone interested in a recreation of the terror of the 1950s, written from the perspective of the 1950s, but there are several more contemporary biographies of Joseph McCarthy and, regardless of the fact that this one is likely written with more beautific prose, in a case study like this, information beats out pretty words every time.--Lance Polin"},{"Title":"Senator Joe McCarthy","review":"Richard Rovere should consider himself a comedian. The book has so many flaws about Senator McCarthy that I can't believe Mr. Rovere can be classified as a legitimate historian.Declassified Soviet documents are proving that Senator Joe McCarthy was right. Biased historians like Rovere should be academically scorned for thier years of lies and distortions."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"The eye-catching title is really a reference to stock market jargon, which fits neatly into the story as the past career choice of the main character,Jacobia Tiptree, and which was extremely lucrative as evidenced by the vast amounts of money she shells out to fix up her antique house in Eastport,Maine. I live in one just like it, so I know of what she speaks.The mystery of who killed Threnody McIlwaine was filled with numerous red herrings, yet I had it narrowed down to 2 suspects about 2/3 of the way through. I liked the Eastport, Maine setting as the northern coast of Maine is one New England area I've yet to visit, and Ms. Graves' details made the area sound very inviting.Referencing cozy mysteries I've read lately, I felt this book a bit overlong in comparison, that the story could have been wrapped up sooner if some of the renovation details had been sacrificed and the story tightened up. Another common theme is the abusive ex/likeable new significant other and in this instance, as in previous books by other authors, I found nothing to like about the ex and a lot to like about Wade Sorenson. However, the similarities won't stop me from reading the other 2 books in this series (Triple Witch and Wicked Fix) and, in fact, they are in my to-be-read pile."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"An author I hadn't heard of before. I bought this based on a rec.arts.mystery recommendation, and I loved it. Lovely prose (reminds me of Margaret Maron's Knott mysteries in the lyricism of its description of Eastport), tight plot, and overall one of the most impressive authors I've discovered in the last few years. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I love reading mystery stories when I'm ready for a light and easy read. I have read quite a few of them and I am thrilled to add Sarah Graves to my \\"must read\\" list. Many \\"light\\" fiction books feel like you have just eaten cotton candy -- nothing to show for it and still unsatisfied. This book was just the opposite! The characters were well developed, the plot was enjoyable and the writing was very good. I am looking forward to reading the other books in the series and sharing my find with other fans of the mystery genre.What a delightful book to read (either on the beach or in front of a warm fire with a cup of tea) when you just want to have some fun!"},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"Being a former Mainer (albeit a Northerner, and not a downeaster), I'm always hesitant to read books with a Maine setting. Too few authors get it right. This author does get it right. The main characters (Jake, Ellie, Sam, Wayne, and George) are fun to get to know.What keeps this from being a four or five star book is the thorough unlikeableness of the victim and the suspects, apart from the sleuth's best friend, Ellie. The more I got to know about them, the less I liked any of them. There wasn't enough contrast between the suspects -- basically I wouldn't have minded if any of them had done it. In many mysteries of this genre, there's a suspect that you just don't want to be the killer. This book lacked that aspect, and it bothered me. I wanted some shades of gray that just weren't there."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I read these over the summer, while vacationing near Boothbay Harbor---three engrossingly-interesting paperback mysteries set in Eastport, Maine, about as far Down East as a body can go...The Dead Cat Bounce, Triple Witch and Wicked Fix feature the indomitable Jacobia Tiptree, an escapee from the NYC financial scene (the first two titles derive from Wall Street slang for troublesome stock market situations), divorced from a high-maintenance neurosurgeon, who, having purchased an antique home in the easternmost city in the USA, spends all of her time and money fixing it up, raising her bright son, bonding with new friends, and solving the little problem of the bodies which keep turning up...in her mudroom, in the tidepools, in a boat's bait-box, hanging from the cemetery gate...I really like these books! Not condescending regarding the Maine born-and-bred characters, but not over-romanticizing them, either. Graves catches the nuances of this small town on the sea's edge: the unrelenting hard work, the poverty, the long-gone fabled wealthy glory days of Eastport, the incredible natural beauty, the Edward-Hopper-like landscapes and the wealth of historical homes and buildings. She also manages to capture the feeling of being \\"from away\\" in a closed, tight-knit society where everyone knows everyone else's business and family skeletons...Jacobia's voice is a friendly, funny one, easy to like, and the supporting characters are all well-drawn and distinctive. Nor does she pull any punches in regards to the yuck-factor of murder: some of the descriptions are not for the squeamish. These ain't no tea-and-crumpets, civilized little murder mysteries...I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"Former stock broker extraordinaire Jacobia \\"Jake\\" Tiptree has traded her life of high pressure trades for the peaceful quite of Eastport, Maine, a quiet town on an island almost as far east as you can go. She's bought an antique home in need of great repair and fills her days trying to fix all the problems, from squeaky doors to leaking plumbing and rotten floors.One day, Jake goes to her storeroom and finds a man dead, lying on the floor. As if it weren't shocking enough to have a stranger dying in her house, her best friend, Ellie White, immediately confesses to the murder.The victim turns out to be Threnody McIlwaine, a local boy turned corporate raider billionaire. Even given his worldwide fame, Ellie did have a motive. Threnody had just tricked her family out of a fortune, leaving them bankrupt. With the prosecutors ready to act on the case to keep the media happy, Jake realizes that Ellie is going to be railroaded into a long prison term.There's just one problem, however. Ellie is too quiet to commit murder. Convinced her friend is innocent, Jake sets out to figure out who really killed the man. Even in a town as small as Eastport, the list of suspects is rather long. It will take all of Jake's abilities to sort through the clues to find the truth.This is the debut of what has become a highly successful mystery series, and it's easy to see why. Jake is a likeable and capable heroine. This is someone who could easily become a friend in real life, and spending time with her is fun. While Ellie isn't in much of the book, she is a likeable character as well. I look forward to getting to know her better in future books in the series. The other towns people we get to know were nice assets to the plot and created a feeling of community I loved.The only strike against the book is the plot. It seems to meander a bit at the beginning, taking it's own sweet time getting started. Once it does, however, it tells an exciting story with some nice twists that kept me confused until the very end. The title of the book refers to some stock market jargon. Not only is this a reference to Jake's previous job, but it also has an impact on the case.Even when the plot is slow, the writing style keeps you pulled into the story with its vivid descriptions and laid-back story telling. It fits a story taking place in a small, cozy town and I wouldn't change it for anything.The setting itself is great. The small town is warm and inviting, even in the middle of the bad storm they face over the course of the book.Even in the debut, it's easy to see why this series has won the hearts of so many readers. I look forward to visiting Jake Tiptree and Eastport, Maine, again real soon."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"As a Mainer and lover of mystery stories, this book was enjoyable on both accounts. Good for foggy, cool summer days on the deck! Ms. Graves doesn't lower her standards with BAD accents and the dry-demented humor that people always try to label New Englanders with. It is a wicked good read!"},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"This is a mystery of the first order and one that Mainers or those who have spent considerable time there will really love. It has the Maine character perfectly described along with the weather, the fog, and their inimitable style of understement-while understanding the vaguaries of the human condition of independence-totally captured. It would have made a good script for the 1940's &quot;I Love A Mystery&quot; radio program.You won't be bored because the author is so good at sidetracking you with clues that do not pan out.A very good read.. I had to control myself and space out the time when I read it because I did not want to finish too fast, but wanted to reflect on the clues."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"...had I not, I probably wouldn't have continued with this series. Dead Cat Bounce just seemed to meander. The characters were flat and the plot was pretty dull. Sarah Graves definitely picks it up in her next book."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I bought and read this book based on a positive review I had read on the internet and am glad that I did so. The main character, Jacobia, grew on me as I read further into the book, although I have to admit I did not care for her at first, thinking her to be a bit judgmental and a little whiny. I learned to appreciate her and I hope that in the following books, we can see more of her background including her financial work with some questionable characters; now that would make some interesting storytelling. I agree with a previous reviewer in that I found nothing to like about her ex-husband, and everything to like about her boyfried; in fact, I found them almost too one-dimensional (evil ex-husband & perfect boyfriend), but not so much as in many of the cookie-cutter mysteries on the market today. I will definitely be picking up the next books in the series to read in the near future."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"First, let me say that I live in downeast Maine where this story takes place. Sarah Graves' book is on the whole, an interesting read. She keeps the plot flowing at a good pace, and keeps the reader guessing untill the very end(unfortunately, the final solution didn't hold together too well for me.) Her details on Eastport itself are for the most part acurate, with only a bit of artistic licence taken. The biggest problem I found in the book, is that most of her main characters-financial gods, former Mafia people-have never lived, nor can I picture them ever living in Eastport. This is of corse something that no one would know unless they lived here, but it made the book very unrealistic for me(But I guess that's why they call it fiction). But for mystery lovers who arn't familiar with downeast Maine, &quot;The Dead Cat Bounce&quot; is a book well worth picking up, and, in spite of my criticisims, I look forward to reading Ms. Graves next Eastport novel(due in May '99)"},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"Normally I don't read many murder mysteries; however, after chatting with Ms. Graves on another reviewer's review of a different work of Ms. Graves, I decided to read at least one of her books and me being me, I decided to start at the beginning. Dead Cat Bounce is Ms. Graves initial forte with Jacobia Tiptree as the protagonist; it takes place in Eastport, Maine, interestingly Ms. Graves' hometown.Dead Cat Bounce was a 4 star book for me. Earlier I was thinking about calling it a 3.5 star book (rounding up to 4) but the last 100 pages were nicely done. I found Ms. Graves writing style results in quick chapters that were easy to digest in general, occasionally, a highly descriptive chapter required me to read it a couple of times due to the length of the descriptions. There are some interesting twists in the story, I was a little disappointed when Jacobia was talking with Wade about the White's finances. Jacobia divulged more information to Wade than we'd learned in the previous chapter (which her conversation with Wade was base upon). I believe Ms. Graves did it this way to prevent repeating information for the reader. I'd preferred it if Ms. Graves had Jacobia reflecting on previous information with Wade (much more convincing). Ms. Graves does a nice job of setting up the murder and leading the reader about. I'll also state that without reading her second book (yet), Ms. Graves does an excellent job of bringing together a nice small murder mystery team. This made for a nice pleasant read that bounces higher than a dead cat would. Btw, for those that are interested, Ms. Graves does an excellent job telling the local history of Eastport, Maine (at least from what I've dug up on Eastport, Maine) and does a nice job with her home renovation descriptions. She either has a lot of experience repairing old Maine houses or has access to those that do it for a living."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"An interesting debut with well developed characters. Jacobia (Jake)Tiptree and her teenage son, Sam, has left Manhattan and her overbearing ex-husband to relocate in an old house in a remote corner of Maine. When Threonody McIlwaine, a ruthless billionaire, is found dead in her storeroom, Jake is shocked by her friend Ellie's confession. Ellie asks Jake to help watch over her elderly parents. Jake agrees and doubting her neighbor's guilt starts to look into the killing. Soon she finds that McIlwaine's death will be little mourned. His latest young wife will lack for little, particularly a handsome &quot;cousin&quot; to console her. Ellie's father has been bankrupted by McIlwaine's disasterous and illegal financial advice. Jake draws on her own considerable financial skills and soon finds her questions have made her a target. The odd names can be disconcerting to the reader but this appears to a promising series."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"An interview with author Sarah Graves on National Public Radio prompted me to read this book. I am a murder mystery fan, and I love Maine and old houses so I figured this book couldn't miss for some light summer reading. I was wrong. The plot is improbable and the pace is slow; the books lumbers along. Characters are undeveloped, and, as another reviewer said, not particularly likeable--even the main character. Other books in the series may be better, but I am not likely to pick up another of them after reading this one."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"It has been about a year since Jacobia Tiptree and her teenage son left their townhouse in Manhattan's upper east side. The duo moved into an old house, needing tons of repair, in Eastport, Maine, a place about three hours from Bangor. The last thing Jake expected to see in this quaint village is a corpse. However, lying on the floor of her storeroom is a dead man with an ice pick sticking out from his skull. Jake's best friend Ellie White calls the part time police officer, George Valentine.The victim turns out to be Threnody McIlwane, a former native, who became a billionaire by operating as a notorious corporate raider. The death of someone as internationally known as Threnody leads to the world descending on this small hamlet. Ellie shockingly confesses to the crime, but Jake cannot believe that her pal could commit a murder. Jake begins her own inquiries, but has aroused the ire of someone, perhaps the real culprit, who warns the outsider to cease a! nd desist in her investigation or else.THE DEAD CAT BOUNCE is a fun to read New England regional who-done-it. Most of the characters have that intriguing Yankee flavor to them. Readers will find especially interesting the motivations of the transplanted New Yorker and the prime suspect. Sarah Graves has written a wonderful amateur sleuth tale that fans of the sub-genre will fully enjoy and want to see more novels starring Jake and company. This author's debut mystery novel is pure platinumHarriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"It is an excellent book I like anything written by Sarah Graves. It came on time and in excellent condtion. Would buy more books from this dealer."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"A friend recommended this series by Sarah Graves. It is indeed worth the time. She is a former hotshot Wall Streeter and moves to a small town in Maine, buys an old house and starts fixing. Then a problem: a dead man in her breezeway with an ice pick in his head. The story really gets going then to find out who, why, when and where. All the while, the main character, Jacobia (Jake) is making these comments aside that will leave you laughing. A definite page turner. My friend was right. This book is thoroughly enjoyable. I'm on the second of the series now and it, too is great. So many books, so little time..."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I felt like I got to know the people in Eastport, Maine. I loved the descriptions of the repair projects along with the description of the town and scenery. Jake is a likeable character and I felt I was solving the murder right along with her. I felt sorry for her son who went back and forth with his father about his future career. The beginning of the book was a little slow and at times the author took too long to describe the scene. The mystery had nice twists and turns and a few red herrings. I can see why this series is so successful. I enjoyed the romance, character, suspense and even the storms. I look forward to reading all of the books in this series."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"Having found that this book was the first in the series, after having read about 3 others, I enjoyed it just as much.

At least I now have the order of the books, so can continue on as they were written."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"This isn't the best book ever, but its certainly not the worst. Unfortunately she skimps on the details of the main characters and overdoes the descriptions of inanimate objects and physical locations. I wish she would've explained the interplay between the characters in the beginning - it would make things a lot easier to understand. Overall I thought the plot was too slow and dull to read, so I never actually made it through the whole book. But I can easily see how it may appeal to some readers."},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"Jacobia Tiptree came to Eastport, Maine looking for a quiet, safe life after years spent working in the cutthroat world of Wall Street, and after a nasty divorce and subsequently even nastier emotional tug-of-war with her brain surgeon ex-husband over their teen-aged son. Now young Sam and \\"Jake\\" are nearing their first spring in the money pit of a 200-year-old house she bought on a whim, and Jake, at least, has achieved some distance from Sam's father. They have both become part of Eastport, with Sam finding it the perfect place for a boy who's an academic disaster despite having two brilliant parents, but who's an absolute genius at doing what folks in remote Maine towns do best: Sam fixes things. Jake has spent the winter learning how deal with rehabilitating an old house, and in the process she has made local friends and even acquired a harbor pilot lover. They're happy. Until Jake and her closest local friend, her neighbor Ellie White, have to deal with a body turning up in Jake's shed.What follows furthers Jake's education in ways she might have preferred to stay ignorant. When Ellie confesses to the murder and even deliberately tries to incriminate herself, a puzzled \\"woman from away\\" launches into an investigation that uses all of her oddly assorted skills and powerful connections in the outside world. That investigation eventually turns hazardous to Jake, and to those around her, also. But she cannot stop. For even though Maine has no death penalty, Ellie may be facing that anyway; and besides, she did not kill anyone. And Jake does love to solve things, just as much as Sam loves to fix them.I'm leery of books set in Maine, because all too often they get it wrong even when Maine natives write them. Each part of my native state has its own culture, its own ways and its own peculiar language. But - as the offspring of two coastal born and reared Maine parents, who has spent stretches of my own life living in fishing villages (and all the rest in the infamous Capital District - you know, \\"Augusta\\"?) - Sarah Graves gets it exactly right. She uses the setting to provide texture as well as background for her story, and her characters might easily have stepped off a lobster boat or out of a small town restaurant or shop. I could swear that George Valentine used to show up every time my grandmother's \\"trailer\\" sitting in Aunt Eleanor's front yard had trouble with its furnace or plumbing!As for the mystery itself, I finished it at 1:45 a.m. today.

So I stumbled onto \\"cozy mysteries\\". Just enough meat to allow that full satisfied feel but not so much that I can't put it down to rescue an out of control science project. Sarah Graves Home Repair Homicide series fits in perfectly. You practically fall into the main character's life (In fact, while reading the first chapter, I had to check and make sure this was the first book in the series. I thought I was missing something.) The character's are real without that annoying perfection that creeps into a lot of lighter fiction. You enjoy spending a stolen half hour with them and when the mystery wraps up, you wonder whats next for Jake and Ellie. I'd like them for my neighbors.I do have two gripes. I've read a few of the books and though I read them in order, I sometimes felt like something was missing. Graves is good at not repeating every historic detail each time (something that gets very old in most mystery series) but sometimes I feel like her time line is off. In one book, it's July and in the next, six months have passed but it's only November? Maybe I read it wrong.The other gripe is even more minor. She continues to interrupt her own dialogue in strange places. A character will be speaking and Graves places the last word or two of her sentence after a phrase like \\"she waved her hand vaguely\\". For example, \\"I don't know,\\" she waved her hand vaguely,\\"Ellie.\\" I know. It's minor. After the first two books, my brain started automatically correcting for it and I don't notice it much any more.All in all, a great series to start on...especially if you're a stay at home mom in need of intellectual stimulation. (And as a bonus, you can learn from Jake's way of sneaking home repair into spare time...)"},{"Title":"The Dead Cat Bounce: A Home Repair is Homicide Mystery","review":"I've read many Sarah Graves mysteries and this is one of my favorites.

Jacobia's neighbor, Ellie has helped her settle into the town and the community. When Jacobia goes to check the storeroom, she finds a body on the floor. Next thing she knows, Ellie White has confessed to the crime, there's no bail for Ellie, George Valentine is trying to shore up her storeroom and floor to handle the police traffic without caving in. Ellie wants Jacobia's help but doesn't want to see her. Everyone hated the victim, Threnody McIlwaine, including Ellie's father and mother who just lost all the money they had on a stock deal McIlwaine tipped them to. The FBI look like they're steamrolling Ellie to jail, and maybe a death penalty, and Jacobia doesn't know what to do next.Once more we're afloat on a sea of clues. But these clues only make sense if you know a lot of the background and history of the people and the town. As readers we're in the same boat as Jacobia, who also didn't grow up in Eastport. We learn the ins and outs of the character's history as Jacobia learns it. As an Mainer in exile, I especially enjoy the bits of information that are dropped so casually into the background of the story that allow me to feel like I'm on a mini-vacation as well as helping vicariously to solve a murder.The characters are believable and, as usual, multi-faceted and hard to predict as are most people.

A stewardess, a beach bum, A freshly out of jail pot smoker(played very well by Dinero in the movie) a bondsman and the usual Samuel L. Jackson character who fits into almost every character that Tarantino has in his movies or creates on his own. Each character is drawn with a bold line of simplicity and, as in his earlier movies, the ending is never cut and dry. The screenplay brings you to the plot point where you think that you see teh ending then he spins you around and upside down until you are slightly confused but even more interested in the ending then he springs it on you and when the smoke clears you can see the creativity to his work.. all of his movies that he casts in or writes is barraged with ideas and characters and varieties of endings that keep you wondering what is this man going to come up with next.. an excellent read for the scriptically addicted and a muse see for anyoen who wants to know where movie directing is heading in the future."},{"Title":"Jackie Brown: A Quentin Tarantino ScreenPlay","review":"I liked Jackie Brown so much that I read the screenplay and Rum Punch.

Then he meets Jackie Browne.As she walks toward him from her cold confinement, compassion for her plight embraces him, not effusively, but tentatively. He is a professional bail bondsman, after all. But he wants to get to know her, and so he does. The intersection of their lives is arrived at from two quite distinct cultural lines. Yet they become friends, for both want it, mostly him. He even stops into a music store and buys a Motown sound, the Shawndells (sp?). That is great characterization, simply superb, for it is a real parsing out of the humanity even the most lonesome, the most calloused of us can at times feel for another, and rendered in the movie perfectly. They are basically decent people and it shows. That's just one of the things about this movie I like."},{"Title":"Honda CB750 1969-78 Gold Portfolio","review":"I ordered this portfolio and it is extremely informative. If you are planning to purchase an older cb750 then this book is for you. Most of the \\"K\\" models are reviewed and what the small changes were made from year to year.

Beginning with the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts of the Revolutionary war period, through the Civil War, W.W.I, and Vietnam eras, the author compiles a steady pattern of government assault on Constitutional restrictions whenever those restrictions become politically or militarily inconvenient. Of particular note in this regard, are the McCarran - Walter Act of the cold war era, aimed at resricting free flow of information and travel, and the notorious Palmer raids following W.W.I, aimed at curbing the rise of a socialist movement. Whether your politics are left, right or center, this historical record should be of interest. It shows pretty clearly how slender are these parchment-bound safeguards whenever established wealth and power feels threatened."},{"Title":"Freedom Under Fire: U.S. Civil Liberties in Times of War","review":"Forget those boring civics classes, forget those classes where American history's most important events were relegated to footnotes skipped over by the teacher. If Howard Zinn had not written \\"A People's History of the United States\\" Michael Linfield has written it for him.Linfield's compelling revealations of the US government's record of civil liberties violations throughout our relatively short, bloody, aggressive and imperialistic history documents how every real and contrived wartime scenario has been used by the rulers to eliminate civil liberties and impose a true Pax Americana domestically.Beginning with the American \\"Revolution\\" which appears to me to be less and less like a revolution and more and more like a contrived power and land grab by the greedy, not the needy. I believe that one could make a case for the fact that after their ascension to power, that American \\"revolutionaries\\" were as reactionary and oppressive as the power from whoom they had wrested control.Each wartime scenario shattters any illusion of goodness or democracy with one holds certain rulers. As Jim Morrison wrote, \\"No One Here gets Out Alive.\\" So, too, with the author. One comes swiftly to the conclusion that not one U.S. leader, either in declared wartime or between conflicts has really done anything to insure the civil liberties for which Americans fought and died on a myriad of foreign battlefields.Linfield has written American history as it is, not as, Rush Limbaugh might ask, \\"The Way Things Ought to Be.\\" This is indeed Mr. Wells' history, Howard Zin''s history, but not 10th grade American high schol history.I highly recommend reading Linfield's book, checking out the footnotes and the primary source documents. Keep the book handy next time some...patriot resembling a beached whale drenches those around him with his version of American history. Linfield's book will rock their world."},{"Title":"Hitching: Tales from the Byways and Superhighways","review":"Kirsty Brooks set out to write a book about hitchhiking. She got a car and headed out, looking for hikers to pick up.She found less than a dozen.So she went out and collected stories from all over the world of the strangest occurrences that have happened, from drink-driving mayors in France to hitchhiking in Japan, where the drivers will give you their umbrellas when you stop.It's a great read, interlaced with some wonderful picture-postcards, making the whole book a very attractive package."},{"Title":"Perversions of Justice: Indigenous Peoples and Anglo-american Law","review":"This guy is absolutely one of the best writers about the US Empire--he is a hammer, pounding away at crypto-fascistic policy and propaganda.Nearly everything that he's done is great--but this is by far his best work, synthesizing as it does a broad range of history, political science, critiques of race &amp; class, leftwing philosophy, and (of course) US &amp; international legal scholarhsip.Overall, the text reads as a collection of fairly tightly connected essays (you'll notice that he tends to build on points from earlier essays from the collection in the later texts)--and it builds to a crescendo in the stunning final essay (the wrong word for it, as it's about 100 pages, with nearly 600 footnotes).Inside are discussions of Russell Means &amp; AIM, the development of US law vis-a-vis native (and thus all foreign) &quot;sovereignty,&quot; genocide &amp; its attendent denial, what he memorably calls &quot;radioactive colonization,&quot; and a host of other items. Perhaps one of the best arguments is about the alleged &quot;right to conquest,&quot; which he traces through its varied history in the international legal arena. In this case, it's clear that despite many prohibitions to the contrary, Might tends to construct Right, and those with wealth, power, and arms often enough simply do as they will, all the while citing &quot;International Law &amp; Human Rights&quot; to support and protect their patently genocidal and fascistic endeavors.Highest Recommendation."},{"Title":"Perversions of Justice: Indigenous Peoples and Anglo-american Law","review":"There are few who have produced such an important collection of essays regarding the mistreatment of indigenous people. I just finished reading the chapter on \\"The Radioactive Colonization of Native North America.\\" It's a very sad episode that continues to this day, with the waste of our nuclear projects being put into weapons and dumped by the ton on the tribal people of Afghanistan and Iraq. The depleted uranium, and the mess that uranium mining and nuclear tests create effect not just native people, but all of us. It's estimated the 10,000 Americans have died from living downwind of the Nevada nuclear test sites. With the Bush administration planning to conduct more nuclear tests as they create a new \\"family\\" of nuclear weapons, Churchill's message is more important than ever. It's great that the elite establishment has brought so much attention to his work. In their effort to destroy and dismiss him, Churchill's books and ideas have come to the attention of tens of thousands of people.I don't know if Ward is an Indian or not, but the work of this \\"fake\\" Indian is more valuable than the work of fake cowboys like George Bush.We all have tribal roots, \\"Perversions of Justice\\" may inspire some of us to remember them."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Foaling: An Illustrated Guide for the Foaling Attendant (Howell Reference Books)","review":"Of the books I have read, I probably could have gotten by with only this one to guide me through the foaling process. Dr. Hayes has created a very well written book for anyone to read ... from the layman to others in the veterinary field. The book is quite well organized, with each section covering different crucial stages of foaling, from knowing when she's going to foal through the first 12 hours. Photographs are appropriately placed in order to educate the reader about what ever physical aspect of foaling, from signs, to birth positions, to milking the mare. Personally, I found the organization to be quite a nice touch. There are lists and charts at the end of the book to help you organize the information you've just read. Some issues aren't entirely talked about ... each veterinarian has their own opinions, and Dr. Hayes has her own about vaccines and worming and the such. As always, take the more medical aspects of foaling over with your own veterinarian and decide on what you feel is best."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Foaling: An Illustrated Guide for the Foaling Attendant (Howell Reference Books)","review":"First, this book is very well written and very, very informative.

I remembered reading about this particular dystocia in The Complete Book of Foaling and I grabbed the book and had my assistant read the instructions on how to correct the presentation to me while I carefully followed them.

When the foaling time came I knew what signs to look out for and was confident, with what I read, that I knew when and if the vet needed to be called out. There were sections covering what to look for in the foal several days following the birth so that if the foal was in trouble very little time would be wasted in calling the vet. I would recommend this book to any first-time broodmare or foal owners. Although I think no book will calm the nerves of an expectant horse owner, it will explain the process enough so that when the blessed event does occur you could more enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Foaling: An Illustrated Guide for the Foaling Attendant (Howell Reference Books)","review":"I got this book when I bought my first broodmare.

Thank you Dr. Karen Hayes for writing it. The book covers a single topic, and does it better than any of the other foaling guides I've read (and I've read quite a few). Those other foaling guides are on a bookshelf; this is the book that goes in the foaling kit! It has saved our farm from disaster on more than one occasion. Dr. Hayes clearly, calmly and concisely communicates the important facts and techniques the foaling attendant needs to know. The detailed diagrams make all the difference in illuminating exactly what is going on at each stage of parturition. Detailed descriptions of what's normal and what's not, techniques for resolving problems before they become critical, and advice on what to attempt yourself and when to call the vet are invaluable. You will find other fine books about breeding, mare care and foal care, but this is the best book on the actual process of protecting and caring for your mare when it's time to deliver her foal.

In my opinion, this book is the only one you need. Even having attended a few foalings, I am always looking to further my knowledge. I wish I had bought the book before my very first foaling! The author does discuss a LOT of the things that can go wrong, but I would rather be well prepared for an emergency that might never happen, than to pretend like nothing can go wrong. It has really good info about the signs that foaling is approaching. I read this book going into the '09 season and have re-read it every season since to refresh myself.

There is a significant difference from the initial edition. Some of the hatches have been renamed. If you ever had trouble locating that third PMD, it's gone. Color pictures of the mayflies still are included but along with the descriptions. There is additional discussion of Caddisflies, which is greatly expanded, as well as, Stoneflies, with patterns and hatch charts for both. The sections on Midges, Craneflies, Dragonflies, Aquatic Moths and Terrestials includes more information and additional patterns. The presentation is also enhanced by good quality paper and great color illustrations. This is what I had hoped for in a revised and updated edition."},{"Title":"Selective Trout.","review":"When this book came out it was controversial, as the authors advocated the idea that trout are more selective feeders than we thought, and that matching the hatch, more than presenting the fly, is so vital.To be successful, according to the authors, anglers must kick up some rocks and then use a small net to see what insects are in the stream. Guessing is no longer good enough.Also, the authors advocate that in slow water trout will prefer very small and/or no-hackle flies to bigger and/or hackled ones. (Smaller flies have trouble breaking through the surface film and are, therefore, more vulnerable than bigger flies.)To this day many anglers will argue against those theories, but to me what's so important about this book is that it changed my approach to fishing.(After reading this book I bought many size 22 to 26 midges.)The book is also a great hatching guide, and has a lot of information about how insects behave and how certain flies should be fished.While I'll never be as scientific of an angler as the authors, and while I'm not going to carry a portable fly-tying kit to a stream, any book that helps me think outside of my box deserves five stars.The illustrations, though not professionally drawn, are very helpful."},{"Title":"Selective Trout.","review":"I just received this book yesterday and am really thrilled with the overall appearance of the book and the fluid writing. The art work and photography are exceptional. The book covers almost all aspect of entomology one can think of that is useful to the fly fishing addicted. In depth discussion can be found on how to identify the various hatches, apparently clear and useful fly patterns and much more. This second edition is a huge expansion over the first, that in its own right is a great book also.My advice is to buy it now. I know I will get many hours of excellent reading, fly fishing and tying with what is between the two covers of this book!"},{"Title":"Selective Trout.","review":"I wish I could say I had read this book, but I really just dropped by to see how they handled the revision. The original edition could, arguably, have handled my review title. It was at once one of the most influential and controvercial books ever written on the subject. Influencial because it more or less kicked off the analytical scientific approach to fly fishing literature in the mid-seventies, and controvercial for everything from advocating no hackle dry flies, to short rods.There isn't anything new in fly fishing, or at least that's a safe premise. How they got all this stuff in one book so early is a mystery. But even if it wasn't all new - some say no hackles were the first dry flies for instance, hundreds of years ago - there are books and times that come together in a fresh way.Now can someone please tell me how they handled the revision, is it re-written, and re-thought, or just fact checked with some new photos? I couldn't tell by leafing through it at the local store."},{"Title":"Selective Trout.","review":"If you want to get into fly fishing, have kids, friends, or other family that are interested in it, or just need some tips this is the book for you.

With many examples and answers at the back. The many techniques for number work in this book would serve as a good starter or introduction to lessons in this subject. A good resource for teachers and parents. Smart children with an interest in speedy number crunching will find it beneficial too. A good book which is relatively easy to follow. However, be prepared to spend a few weeks to master the different techniques before you start showing off your new mental arithmetical skills!"},{"Title":"Speed Mathematics Using the Vedic System","review":"Speed Mathematics using the Vedic system makes learning basic mathematics more rewarding. The average pupil will be able to work out calculations such as 46X44, 95X95 and 116X114 mentally, often faster than a calculator. Pupils will understand how to work out squares,cubes, percentages,fractions,and equations with ease. Paper and pencil will still be required for most questions, but the speed and accuracy of calculations will improve significantly. This in turn motivates pupils to learn more. This book provides smart strategies for mastering basic Number work and Algebra. These two areas are the building blocks in mathematics.

This work is definitely a hagiography, but this is not the problem. Presidents deserve respect, if at times only by virtue of their office. The fact is that Mr. Clinton was a very controversial president, who did some very controversial things. Ms Warshaw fails to explain in a satisfactory manner why many Americans opposed his presidency. The entry on Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a prime example. For better or for worse, Justice Ginsburg is one of the most liberal members ever to grace the Supreme Court. Yet the author never once uses the word liberal, instead employing the term conservative in impressively creative ways to characterize her politics. The same applies to Jesse Helms. The reader is left with the impression that this is a man nobody could possibly vote for, yet he is still revered by many. Only the most politically astute readers will recognize the author's sleight-of-hand tactics. The author's agenda will be lost on this work's intended audience: students. Similar examples abound throughout this work. The real problem with this work is that the author goes beyond being respectful. The author goes beyond even hagiography. Ms Warshaw is engaged in nothing short of partisan advocacy. If today's young people become liberals or Democrats it should be because they read materials from a multiplicity of viewpoints and reached informed conclusions. It should not be because they were only presented with one point of view."},{"Title":"McSe Testprep SQL Server 6.5 Administration (Mcse Testprep Series)","review":"The book have a lot of exercises and be careful with the answers.

WHY was Paul focusing his TIME meter on that period? I didn't know.No excuse for me not being interested in that period of Roman history, but I wasn't. So I didn't know basics like who was Emperor post-Commodus (other than Constantine, who interested me not at all), nor about the Crisis of the Third Century, etc. This, despite having an original 1776 Gibbon, and the 1876 edition, AND Gibbon on 3.5\\" floppies (so you know how long I've had them) AND abridged Mommsen AND Cary, etc. for lo 20 years+. And, the Military Encyclopedia by Dupuy and Dupuy. To make my wilfull ignorance worse, I HEARD about SPQR for over 30 years from my pastor exegeting Ephesians. Yikes. End Confession.Big mistake. Now corrected, by surfing and surfing Google Books for the scholarship reading and reading and reading the books I have, and also getting this book by Williams, plus Bill Leadbetter's \\"Galerius and the Will of Diocletian\\", happily available on Kindle for rent or purchase.What does Williams bring to the table, since so much (mostly not in English) has been written on Diocletian, both in the past, and now?1. Williams is big-picture. He weaves together all the megatrends leading up to Diocletian, with a focus on the psychological impact the tumultous Crisis of the Third Century had on 'making' Diocletian.2. Williams avoids the pedantic trap of getting all wound up with the ongoing scholarly debates over the facts, personalities, and who-did-what-when, and instead just presents an overview.3. His overview is extremely incisive and insightful.4. Writing flow and focus on the psychological impact of the period on pagans and Christians alike, is tight, easy to follow and understand.In short, if you want ONE book to read on Diocletian and his times -- and you should, because doggone near everything about the Catholic Church is 'imported' from Diocletian -- pick this book. Then you can get into the windy tomes of the classic authors, for you will have the big picture, with all the right pieces to analyze in more detail. (There's another book printed in 1876, \\"The Persecution of Diocletian\\" by Arthur James Mason (available here at Amazon or Google Books), which is also helpful, but less so.)Williams' Chapters 12 and 13 help you see the reason for the Great Persecution of 303. As you might expect, there are always two sides to the story, and unfortunately my fellow Christians of the third and fourth century were a scurrilious lot, never above lying -- and of course THEIR version of the story is mainly what survives. So you have to look elsewhere for a balanced picture. Williams provides that balance. So on the one hand, the pagans themselves were tiring of a too-superficial relationship to 'the gods', so gradually came to seek a 'universal' God idea above the centuries of warring, capricious 'gods'. Even the philosophers got religious that way. On the other hand, some of this 'universal' move (really, toward the henotes of Plato's Philebus), was more pragmatically designed to compete with the in-your-face, hate-the-establishment apostate 'Christianity' (not much different from its counterparts today), where everyone else was somehow an untermensch.The Christians, for their part, were also coalescing, the centuries of schismatic warring gradually giving way to a very eclectic ROMAN STYLE (Diocletian-style) ecclesiastical expression. Williams thinks that ecclesiasm got underway in 200, but if you also buy Robert Lee Williams' \\"Bishop Lists\\" (no relation to Stephen, book is also here at Amazon, a gripping read, surprising for a doctoral thesis) -- you'll see that it was more a product of the 250's, aftermath of the Severans and persecution.THAT is why Paul's meter wryly says (direct trans from the Greek), 'to result in the Filling-Up-of-Times Dispensation; to sum up under One Head, All (trial) matters in Christ; all (trial) matters in heaven, and [all matters] on earth, via Him;' That last \\"Him\\" is syllable=AD 283, advent of Diocletian. Now I know why, from the pagan end: they were COALESCING. I didn't know that, before. (To see why from the Christian end, get the Robert Lee Williams Bishop Lists Book. Caution: neither Williams advocates anything about Bible or Paul. I'm drawing those conclusions from their books.)The rest, as they say, is history. Everything Diocletian crafted was adopted lock stock and barrel, right down to the terms, costuming, colors, and ceremonies -- by Constantine and the then-emergent, Catholic Church. The word 'catholic' wasn't used until the Severans, see the Robert Lee Williams 'Bishop Lists' book for that story. Stephen and Robert are not related, so far as I know.Stephen Williams explains that parallel in his penultimate chapter, 'Constantine's Completion'. Suggest you get both Williams' books, to see import; or, at least see my review of Robert Williams' 'Bishop Lists', here in Amazon, maybe to save time. Truly, so much of modern Western history derives from this changeover; and especially, Roman Catholic dogmas, institutions, and .. ahem, persecutions.Now, there are many points of contention about this period, still debated by scholars. When did Constantius and Galerius marry the Augusti daughters? Was Valeria Maximila really Diocletian's DAUGHTER's child? Why did Diocletian abdicate.. was it illness, part of a longstanding plan, or illness which occurred when he planned to retire anyway? And how strong was he, at that point? When did he really die? Was Galerius really as anti-Christian as painted, or was it more Diocletian? Did Galerius force Diocles to sponsor the persecutions, and then retire? Not to mention, the conflicting stories among the pagan or Christian writers of that distant time, re Maxentius, Maximinian, the marriage of Licinius and Constantia, Constantine's sister, and the aftermath of wars between the two new Augusti. Most perplexing still, is the account of what happened to Galerius' widow, Diocles' daughter, after Galerius died in 311. WHEN was the START of the '15 months' in Lactantius? Gibbon wondered about it, and so too everyone since.Stephen Williams navigates between the contentions, comes up with his own conclusions, provides good footnotes to show why. Leadbetter's 'Galerius and the Will of Diocletian', available here in Amazon, complains that Williams' book is not 'satisfactory'. I couldn't disagree more. Leadbetter's book reads like dissertation draft notes; he contradicts himself after presenting strawmen 'scholars' who he seeks to refute; read five pages of his writing, and you have to walk away from his book in frustration. Frankly, Leadbetter makes many unfounded assumptions which trail off into nowhere land, never presents a comprehensive picture of the time. But Williams DOES create a comprehensive sensible picture from the same data. Sure, you can quibble about some of the details, but you know where he gets them. That IS satisfactory.My quibbles are date corrections about when ecumenism got off the ground (should be the 250's), when Diocletian died (should be AD 316, see my Appendix II of my Ephesians1REPARSED.doc or htm, or its pdf version Eph1DecreeSyllables.pdf, all from brainout.net); also, Williams' book has annoying end notes, rather than the more convenient, footnotes; so you must flip pages back and forth to read). Footnotes are far easier on the reader. These are all minor complaints; sure wish my complaints about my own stuff, were so minor. :)And I sure wish Williams' book were on Kindle. It's worth reading, over and over, because his big-picture approach helps you realize that we learn nothing from history, so are condemned to repeat it. This period is indicative of a recurring trend in history, and its lessons go unlearnt.So yessiree, I'd heartily recommend Williams' book. Worth several times the price. I'll seek other stuff he's written, as a result!"},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"Like Williams' Theodosian work, this book is an easy read that more or less sums up what previous scholarship without new analysis. It's a good introduction to the period but not on par with biographies of other emperors such as Constantine and Julian."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"This is a well-written, fact-filled book that should be considered a must-read to any serious student of the Late Roman Empire. Diocletian has been given scant attention by Classical scholars but his stabilization of the Empire was vital for two reasons: it preserved the entire Empire for nearly 170 years after his retirement and laid the foundations for the Eastern Empire that survived until 1453 c.e.There is also great attention given to Diocletian's separation of himself as Emperor from the Roman Army and Roman politicians. Williams lucidly points out this is the beginning of Western Civilization's &quot;Divine Right of Kings,&quot; and the foundation of Medieval kingship. Diocletian established this separation order to secure his personal safety.Diocletian's retirement is also given considerable attention. His retirement palace at Split is discussed in some detail. Also, the attempt of Galerius and Maximian to drag him back into politics, which he completely refused. Finally, the rather sad depiction of him as a marginalized relic who had to ask old army friends for favors in order to help secure temporary safety for his family (who were eventually murdered).This is a great book but its great detail may overwhelm the arm-chair historian. Williams deserves many cudos for his work in bringing about the first English biography of Diocletian in some time."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"The first English language biography on Diocletion and a very well written one at that. Stephen Williams is not a professional Roman historian instead he is a professor of philosophy and therin lays the books strength. Williams writes for the enthusiastic Roman buff and the general reader. Instead of quoting ancient historians ad nauseum and going off on tangents he gets to the meat of the matter. How Diocletion and his fellow emperors were able to pull the empire back from total collapse. He gives detailed explanations as to what was occurring in the Empire during the 3rd Century and why. He isn't afraid to offer his own theories where our knowledge of events are sketchy and he always keeps the book moving along at a brisk pace. I especially enjoyed the final chapter where he covers the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. It's well written with a detailed description of what occurred and why. He also contrast the collapse of the West with the survival of the Eastern Empire. Wonderful book for the layman, student, and perhaps even the expert."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"I read this for my History of the Roman Empire class and found to be an excellent book. Williams has an exceptionally clear writing style that is very easy to follow. He uses both modern and classical sources to bring to life the reign of Diocletian, an Illyrian general who through sheer personality and military discipline was able to restore the old boundries of the Roman Empire. Williams' explanations of the economic reforms of Diocletian, as well as the restructuring of the old Roman provinces into military diocese that were able to contain the unromanized barbarians is the best explanation of these events I've read. I checked this book out from the library and I'm still considering buying a copy, I enjoyed it so much. If only all history books were this well written!"},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I came away from it with a radically new appreciation of Diocletian's contributions to preserving the Roman empire. The structural reforms set in motion by this soldier emporer laid the foundations not only for an empire that continued until the fall of Constantinople, but for a church whose triumph absolutely depended on them. The book left me wondering who the brains behind these important constitutional, governmental, economic and military reforms were. Obviously Diocletian must be credited with approving these innovations, and for seeing them solidly put in place. However, I doubt if the emperor, busy with beating back enemies on all frontiers, is solely responsible for such complex and far reaching reforms. Matthews ignores this aspect of Diocletian's reforms. I was turned off by the author's seeming flights of fancy regarding the inmost thoughts and motives of his hero. Matthews would have served this reviewer better by keeping to the facts and by extrapoliting from them without excessive creativity. This book is well written and researched. It is not an academic exercise, but a stimulating analysis of a man maligned by christians ever since, but to whom they owe the earthly glory of their church."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"I bought this book as an afterthought. I ordered the book on Septimius Severus,and something prompted me to get this one too. I must say, after trying to grind through the book on Severus, I picked this one up and flew right through it. It is well written, and easy to follow. It explains many questions I had about the later days of the Empire. I have since given it to my well read mother, and she enjoyed it as well. If you want to understand Constanine, and the start of the Roman Catholic Church, you must read about Diocletian.Diocletian was an amazing man. He was able to stabilize the Empire under the utmost strain. He really shouldnt have been successful, but through force of character, he was.He reminded me of George C. Marshall of all people. Strong, solid, wise and very well respected by all around him. A man so serious and mature, that all those around him stopped and listened. Only such a man could have done what he did.It also explains the persecution of Christians under his watch. A dark side of his rule. A very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"This book is an excellent overview of the life of one of the Roman Empire's greatest rulers. Williams explains how Diocletian emerged from the chaos of the late third century to pull the Empire back from the brink of disaster. Written in a crisp, clear style, it should interest general readers and scholars alike"},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"The calamitous third century almost saw the collapse of the Roman Empire. Not only did the emerging Sassanid Empire become a dominant threat, even capturing Antioch in the first offensive of Shaphur I, but to the north, the German tribes had coalesced into three major confederations, led by war-chiefs who recognized the potential booty that lay across the frontiers that stretched from the North to the Black Seas. As to internal politics, the Romans had not yet mastered the idea of imperial succession. Between Septimius Severus (who counseled that the soldiers should be taken care of and the rest forgotten) and Diocletian--a span of some 70 years, there were 26 emperors and pretenders to the purple. One died in captivity, one of the plague, one presumably of natural causes, two were killed in battle. The rest were murdered either the army or political rivals. A kind of anarchy became the permanent state of affairs. And the emperor faced with meeting a barbarian incursion, had to watch his back, as more often than not, a rival was prepared to initiate civil war.Diocletian, who assumed power on the death of Numerian, and then went on to confirm it by defeating in battle the latter's brother--another claimant to the purple--did indeed restore the Empire. Not such much by military action--he was a middling general--but by a genius for organization. Realizing that no one individual could respond to all the threats that surrounded the empire and still maintain stable rule, Diocletian instituted a number of power-sharing reforms which finally led to the concept of the tetrarchy--Four rulers, one for each corner of the realm. Two were \\"Augusti\\" who selected as their junior partners and successors, two \\"Caesars\\". This reorganization succeeded in stabilizing the frontiers, and eliminating potential civil wars. From this political reform, Diocletian went on to reorder the total fabric of the Roman state. But he did not restore it in its former guise. Rather, his reordering led to the autocratic, centralized, regimented empire which was to survive as the later Byzantine state.Although the tetrachy succeeded, it only did so because of Diocletian's personality and constant efforts to hold his fractious colleagues together. When he retired (the first Roman emperor ever to do so) the structure began falling apart again. Another cycle of civil wars ended with Constantine as sole ruler. Constantine consolidated many of Diocletian's reforms, thus buttressing the foundations of the Byzantine Empire.Diocletian's religious views, and policies with regard to the state religion and the upstart Christians are explored in some depth. It's possible that Constantine recognized that a religious revival, such as that fostered by Diocletian was essential to the stability of the state. But Constantine chose to lift up the Christians as this unifying force instead of backing the traditional gods of the Roman empire.All in all, an excellent, but not innovative account of a very difficult and complex time. Reads well, and is well documented. Useful appendices and a good bibliography."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 28 December 2012This is certainly one of the best biographies of a Roman Emperor that I have ever read, but it is also much more than that. It is also an account of the age of Diocletian - the late third and early fourth century - and a well-researched and unbiased account of his huge achievements and his few mistakes. In addition to being the first biography of Diocletian in English, it is also probably the best of all.One of the main merits of this book is to set Diocletian's record straight. This Emperor has been one of the most maligned and many of his achievements have been either minimized or \\"confiscated\\" by and attributed (wrongly) to Constantin. This was essentially the work of the early Christian authors (mostly bishops) who, understandably, never forgave Diocletian for persecuting the Christians. Even to this day, this is what most of those that have ever heard of him know him for.Another author mentioned this persecution as one of his \\"two significant mistakes\\". I beg to differ. Seen from a Roman Emperor's perspective, this was anything but a mistake: no Emperor at any time could tolerate to have some of his citizens refusing to swear the oath of fidelity or to have some of his soldiers refusing to fight on religious grounds. This was entirely unacceptable. In Roman eyes, it was in fact the cardinal sin against the State and Empire, whom the Emperor embodied according to Imperial ideology. It simply equated to high treason and warranted the death penalty. So Diocletian's reaction and harsh treatment of the Christians, which followed in the steps of a number of his predecessors, was both unsurprising and perfectly well-deserved. Historically, and within the context of his reign, his persecutions were probably much more limited and more efficient that they were subsequentely portrayed to be. That the Empire finally became Christian was entirely due to Constantin's political opportunism and this happened after Diocletian's death.As for Diocletian's achievements, they are numerous, starting with the army and the frontiers, which he re-established and re-fortified, and the Empire's finances, which were in a terrible state when he came to power. To achieve such a restoration, he had to mobilize all energies and resources and set up what was in effect a rigid, authoritarian command-and-control economy and dictatorship. He also had to rely on subordinates, hence his \\"invention\\" (no quite an invention because there had been a few precedents) of having two Augustus, and then two Augustus assisted by two younger Caesars which would eventually succeed their elders and each promote their own deputies. He was essentially a pragmatist, an excellent organizer and strategist (meaning that, within the limitations of his time, he always say the \\"big picture\\") and, above all, a man of duty that did whatever it took to do the job, however harsh the solution had to be. At times, he seems to be, in my eyes, a mature Octavius Augustus cast into the Third Century or the embodiement of some of a Roman's traditional \\"virtues\\" (we might say characters streaks). This was particularly true of his energy and his relentless.It is rather incorrect to state that he was unable to make his reforms outlast himself. Most of his reforms did outlast him and were even amplified by Constantin, who tried to take all the credit for them, such as those affecting the army, which was expanded, throughly reorganized and redeployed and the defense-in-depth system that Diocletian was one of the first to set up (see the Strate Diocletiana, for instance). This army and system managed to defend the Empire against all comers and despite multiple invasions for most of the 4th century and, when it failed (mainly in the West), this was not because it had been misconceived.However, there were huge limits (rather than \\"mistakes\\") to Diocletian's achievements. One was certainly the Edict of maximum prices, or rather the underlying belief that, provided you had the willpower and energy to do so, you could regulate and control. The other was that he did not recognize the inherent flaws in his Tetrarchic system or, to be more accurate, to what extent the whole system relied on his own person and his unchallenged supremacy. In a way, he didn't realize just how exceptional he was until, having peacefully resigned (and forced his colleague Maximin to do so with him!), he saw his system crumble and new civil wars erupt as the ambitions sons of his former colleagues (Constantin and Maxence) made their bid for power.Although certainly not a \\"nice and lovable\\" character, by the end of this book, I couldn't help feeling both sympathy and empathy for this exceptional Emperor who gave all he had to restore the greatness of ever-lasting Rome and who almost succeded. He was unfortunate enough to witness, before his death, a return of the harmful behaviors leading to civil wars and that he had tried so hard to suppress..."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"I like this book,gr8 analysis,i tried to search for the biography of the writer,but i couldn't find."},{"Title":"Diocletian and the Roman Recovery (Roman Imperial Biographies)","review":"Diocletian Needs recognition and I believe Kindle would be very helpful.I sell Diocletian Coins and his coins have started to literally disappeared.Ten years ago I could not give them away.Now that people read Diocletian's story with the Reformation of the Roman Empire he has gained more attention.COULD THE AUTHOR KINDLE DIOCLETIAN?"},{"Title":"The Post-Darwinian Controversies: A Study of the Protestant Struggle to Come to Terms with Darwin in Great Britain and America, 1870-1900","review":"James Moore's brilliant and magisterial examination of the so-called conflict between Religion and Science in Victorian Britain has been reprinted by CUP (Nov 2003) and I've just got my hands on a copy.

I think there's something on all types of beers, even some stuff on ciders and meads. Buy this book if you're starting out, you'll learn much of what you'll need to get going.

I went to the bookstore and checked this book out. Now, I am a novice when it comes to homebrewing, that's why I thought this book would be perfect for me. But after reading thru it I noticed that 80% of this book is written for the Intermediate to Advanced brewer. For somone like myself this book really is pretty useless. Yes it gives a listing of what to buy to start brewing but after a few pages of directions and some pictures (adults who are drinking while they are brewing) it ends. No substance at all. No follow-up. nothing. From here it goes directly onto an Intermediate section then to the Advanced sections. What a waste. Now I am sure Chuck Papazian is a nice guy and knows alot about the topic, it just that he doesn't concentrate enough on the Novice brewer. I NEVER brewed beer in my life. SO what do I need to do. Where do I buy this stuff? Ingredients? Supplies? A short list of supplies is given but how about better pictures? The repros of the supplies are horrible. No detail at all. Now this isn't Chuck's fault, it is the publisher. So in trying to keep the book under $15 they delte vital photos and the reader suffers for it. Definitely an overrated book. The book that I think is MUCH, MUCH better for the novice is &quot;Homebrewing for Dummies&quot;. Now this book actually gives more detailed information on the nuances of homebrewing.

It's a beer-making kit. I feel like a kid in a candy store all of a sudden. Sure, it's only big enough for 1 gallon at a time, but it's enough to make me into a homebrewer. I make two one-gallon batches and I'm hooked. It's like when you make your first batch of Mac+Cheese when you're 10 years old: The mysteries surrounding food prep disappear, but the end result is pretty bland at best, but it's still better because I made it!Enter my curiosity. I want to know everything. I visited the local homebrew supplier and bought a copy of this book. When I started reading, I realized one of two things would happen: I would become enlightened beyond my years, or I would go insane trying to get there.The knowledge and enlightenment from this book is like learning how division and addition combine to calculate \\"averages\\". Now you understand the \\"secrets\\" to things like \\"batting averages\\" and \\"free throw percentages\\". You can now read trading cards with confidence.Charlie explains how the different parts of the brew process (ingredient selection, boiling, fermenting, bottling, priming, etc.) combine to make beer. Now you understand the \\"secrets\\" to how the individual steps combine to make beer. You know the secrets of \\"good beer\\" and \\"cheap beer\\", opting to buy premium brands instead of the usual \\"mass-produced\\" beers.(You're not buying premium beer because you know why they taste better, you're buying premium beer because you need bottles that can be re-capped for your homebrew!)My friends are divided on whether I've become enlightened or gone totally insane, but they all agree the end result is worth it: my first 5-gallon batch of all-extract brew.Thanks Charlie!"},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"I baught Charles Papazian's book on homebrewing about 10 months ago. I have since brewed about 6 bathces of homebrew. In my opinion this book is priceless. Charles starts out telling the reader about how beer was probably invented(I've used this to impress my friends) then moves into the equipment you'll need to brew your first batch and the next thing you know your brewing. His instructions are very very easy to follow and the illustrations are great. Explanations on different types of yeast, hops and grains available to the homebrewer are great for refining your beer and creating a taste to fit just about anyones palate. I've since moved on to the section for intermediate homebrewers and am loving every last taste of it.I've started to keep my brewing a secret because once my friends find out I've brewed another batch of beer they all come knocking on my door for more.

While it will help you get your sea legs, much of the equipment has been updated since that time and many methods have been simplified and improved upon.While I wouldn't do without this book, you need The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing by Miller, David G also.

It is often included in brewing kits and covers brewing in a broad manor. Charlie's motto is to relax, don't worry, have a home brew. This is very good advice. Most of what we do while brewing can be done in many ways and the processes have a high tolerance for variations.The Complete Joy of Home Brewing is like three books in one. After some introductory material, history and such, there is a beginners guide, and intermediate guide and and advanced guide. The beginners guide gives you everything you need to brew your first beer. There is no reason to read the entire book before getting started. This is really nice because once you get the equipment you need you want to get started as soon as you can. The beginners section is only about 30 pages.In each section Charlie covers ingredients and equipment as well as how to use them in a more and more complete fashion as he moves from beginner to advanced coverage.Parts of this book seem a little dated but it is a good starting point."},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"I got interested in home brewing last fall ('03) and went to a shop that specializes in equipment and kits. From there, I wanted to get into learning more about the process and devining my own concoctions. This book is a recommended upgrade to their beginners kit and I purchased it later after brewing a kit or two. After reading this book, I am very confident that I know what to do to get the tastes out of the different breeds of hops and grain mixtures. This book actually goes a little further than I needed it to, as it goes into the chemical processes with the different ions in the water, and such as that. However, if you are a beginner brewer and want to delve into your own creations, this is where to go. It's a great work to set you on the right track. It has everything you WANT to know and some that you could probably care less about, but worth adding to the shelf if you enjoy the hobby."},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"I love this book!

Too little of the how to information was around. Charlie Papazian successfully puts the how to steps of the first batch in any ones hand and doesn't stop there. The ideas and concepts for the more in depth and complex brewers tasks are clearly introduced and illustrated.The book starts with &quot;your first batch&quot; and progresses through introducing steps, concepts, chemistry, and beer styles. The intermediate section covers each ingredient used in common (and some uncommon) beer recipes. The advanced brewing section intruduces a universe full of brewing chemistry and lore to learn about for the rest of ones life.There are many books that provide all the chemical reactions and detailed formulas needed to be a true brewmaster.

Relax. Don't worry. Have a homebrew..."},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"I purchased this book when I first began homebrewing about 7 years ago. I found it was very easy to read and Charlie's &quot;Don't worry, have a homebrew!&quot; attitude towards beer brewing took the fear out of brewing my first few batches of beer. His carefree approach is a &quot;180&quot; from Dave Miller's approach. I would actually suggest to a novice, if the cash is available, that you purchase and read both Papazian and Miller's books thoroughly before staring your first batch of beer. All the information may not sink in at first, but it only takes a few batches of beer and everything will make sense. They both contain good points on brewing your first beer.I would like to point out one step in Papazian's book that should be avoided at all levels of brewing, and that is, the aeration of the wort when it's hot. Please keep this in mind as you read this book. It will make sense after you read the first section for beginners. Papazian suggests, for simplicity sake, that you pour the 3 gallons of hot wort from your brew pot into a container that already contains 2 gallons of cold water. This is not a good practice at any level of brewing. Aeration of the wort is a two way street. Although necessary for the proper yeast life cycle necessary for the conversion of the sugars to alcohol and carbon dioxide, If you aerate the wort when it's too hot, or after the beer has began fermenting (which Charlie does warn you about), you could ruin your finished product. If you read the later chapters in the book, you'll find reference to wort chillers and chilling the wort quickly.Most books written to date suggest that you cool the beer to below 80 degrees F before aerating. This is what I practice, as do most of the other homebrewers that I keep in touch with. You don't have to buy an expensive copper or stainless steel wort chiller to accomplish this quick cooling of the wort. All you need is a bathtub filled with cold water. You can take your brewing pot straight from the stove to the tub and simply submerge it in the water for a few minutes (remember to keep the pot covered!). Hope this helps out, happy homebrewing. Also, you can get some very good info at the following site; www.skotrat.com. This is a private homebrewing site which contains lots of good info on homebrewing. Also, there is a live chat room there where you can ask questions and get some free technical info on starting your first brew."},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"When you first feel the desire to brew beer, and start looking into the process, it can seem pretty formidable. Walking into the homebrew store or visiting its website, and seeing all the ingredients and equipment, can be intimidating for the newcomer. Turning to the web, magazines and books for enlightenment, the first-timer can be intimidated by the sheer volume of brewing information floating around. Rather than throwing your hands up in confusion and walking away, buy this book.Papazian's motto is &quot;Relax, don't worry--have a homebrew!&quot; Rather than getting bogged down in the details of making perfect, contest-winning beers, Papazian focuses on the basic steps a homebrewer has to follow to make good beer. You can make something tasty and enjoyable with minimal equipment, malt extract and part of a weekend afternoon, and Papazian holds the brewer's hand through the entire process. Once you've nailed the basics--and it's not hard--the last part of the book teaches you how to advance to intermediate brewing without much additional hassle.Experienced brewers may find this book too basic for their needs. Beginning and intermediate brewers will find it invaluable."},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"I have a whopping 2.5 gals of surprisingly good brew in my logbook (that makes me a rank beginner, folks!). I bought this book because I wanted to improve my techniques and make better (but not necessarily more complex) beers. This book never let me down - it has everything and seems best suited for the beginner to novice brewers (because 99% of intermediate to advanced brewers have already read it!). This book is divided into 3 sections - beginner (all extract), intermediate (extract plus specialty grains), and advnced (all-grain). However, this doesn't completely describe the layout of the book. For instance, Papazian talks about brewing techniques and components of beer (and how they interact) in EACH section, but he delves deeper and deeper with each progressive section. Thus, he unravels the mysteries of beer at a comfortable pace and only to the degree to which the reader cares to explore. But perhaps the thing that makes Papazian's books so beloved by homebrewers is the perfect balance between technique and fun! Even when describing the most technical subject, Papazian never disguises his enthusiasm for and love of homebrewing. He never forgets to remind his readers to ENJOY what they're doing - no matter how technical it may be (oh, and Papazian is exceptionally knowledgeable about homebrewing). Papazian's enthusiasm has rubbed off on me and has ignited my curiosity. I recommend this book to ALL homebrewers who have not already read it. To those who are curious about homebrewing, look no further - BUY THIS BOOK! It's worth it. This is nearly unanimously THE best general treatise on the FUN of homebrewing! Try some of the recipes he includes - I did!Relax... Don't Worry... Have a Homebrew!"},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"After getting the desire to homebrew, and spending countless hours in the library reading various different books on homebrewing, I was becoming frustrated with the lack of information available . . .Then I stumbled across this book in a homebrew shop. It was EXACTLY what I needed as a first time homebrewer. I had no one to show me how to do it, but this book proved to be an excellent guide. It is a fun book to read, helps you to understand all the basics, and gives you more in-depth information later on if you want it.This book provided me with everything I needed in a simple-to-understand format, and answered all my questions. I've been brewing for 10 years now, and never needed to buy another homebrew instruction book. It even contains a good number of recipes from many different styles, and I've never found one I didn't like."},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"I started the home brewing hobby with Charlie's books and tried switching to Dave Miller's upon a friends recommendation. I'm now back to rereading the Papazian books that I have in my library. I think both authors are great in there own way, but Charlie by far is the more entertaining author of the two. I also feel that Charlie assumes nothing, meaning he explains everything in great detail. In reading Dave Miller's books, I sometimes got the feeling that he was assuming I already knew how to propagate yeast properly, or how crush grains to get the maximum yield out of them and so on.I also felt as though Miller's books lacked detail in certain areas and could have benefited from more information and pictures as well. Papazian does sometimes recommend bad habit forming advise in the early chapters of this book in the sack of keeping it simple, but later corrects himself leaving the choice up to the reader. I think this book is a &quot;must have&quot; for a beginning home brewer. Advanced home brewers, whether all grain or partial mash, may also find Charlie's writing entertaining and informative (just skip the first few chapters, because some of his recommendations may make the advanced brewer cringe!).The later chapters in this book have very good information on all aspects of brewing, from aeration to yeast propagation. I would recommend this book to anyone that doesn't have a copy of it in their home brewing library."},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"I got this book as part of a homebrewing kit a year ago. It is probably the best beginners book out there for brewing beer at home.

This is the A-Z homebrew bible.The theme: &quot;Relax, Don't Worry, Have a Hombrew!&quot;...and that is the essence of this book. The experienced brewer knows that homebrewing involves strict attention to detail, especially in the area of sanitation, and it can be easy to forget as you go through the process again and again that the _real_ purpose of brewing is to have fun. It's a scientific process, but the bottom line is to enjoy the experience from beginning to end and that is what this book is all about.For those who have always wanted to try homebrewing, but thought it would be too difficult or too expensive or too whatever... Get this book and start brewing. You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The complete joy of home brewing","review":"This is the best beer book around for beginners.

The simple step by step instructions make it seem &quot;Fool Proof.&quot; The book is good for reading straight through or searching for a specific answer when your in the midst of brewing a batch of beer. I found the section on kegging procedures and equipment helpful. There are also chapters of this books that focus on specific topics such as: Hops, Water, Yeast, Fermentation, and Sanitation.

It's still the one I refer to most often. Why? First, Papazian makes homebrewing simple and non-threatening. Second, he encourages experimentation. Lastly, his enthusiasm for this great hobby is unrelenting. Admittedly, the book is in need of some serious updating. From the 1970's illustrations to the more easily accessible ingredients (like liquid yeast and fresh hops that were hard to come by when the book was first written). It's too bad that he didn't spend his time improving *this* book instead of publishing his abysmal &quot;Home Brewer's Companion.&quot; But TNCJOHB makes you want to try homebrewing. And, as he shows you through extensive and easy recipes, you can make virtually any kind of beer you want and make them very well. After awhile, you may find you don't use it every time you brew, but now and again you'll still go back to it. Maybe for an idea. Maybe to tinker with a new recipe.

It is demeaning to those of us who are professionals in other fields. I would recommend just about anything written by Dave Miller, specifically his \\"Homebrewing Guide\\". Skip Papazian, there are far better books out there these days. BTW, the my first brew was an all grain oat stout that turned out quite well.

There were, however, at least three serious drawbacks. First, I was continually irritated by Rankin's lack of attention to accurate detail. For instance, as a former Army officer, I was intrigued by the wide-ranging array of information on all sorts of firearms in the opening pages. But later (p. 153 in the Little Brown mass market paperback edition of 2007), one of the dope dealers is described as carrying a .457 caliber pistol: no such weapon has ever been manufactured to my knowledge (although it's possible he meant Smith & Wesson Model 459, which is a nine mm, or roughly .38 caliber, weapon). I didn't take the trouble to try and sniff out other such lapses, but I'll bet they're lurking just beneath the surface, readily uncovered by, or even immediately apparent to, a discerning reader. Second, a considerable share of the dialogue is very implausible (e.g., the pub conversation between Hoffer and his policeman-on-the-take accomplice, Edmond, in the opening pages of chapter eleven). Real people don't talk like that. Period. And third, the detective, Hoffer, is supposed to be an American; his character, however, repeatedly uses English (totally non-American) references and even vernacular. Rankin may well be the best-selling current English mystery writer, but he's no John Buchan, or Ian Fleming, or John LeCarre, or Richard Stark, or Elmore Leonard, or Charlie Huston."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"British assassin Michael \\"Demolition Man\\" Weston is setting up for his next kill, London TV journalist Eleanor Ricks though he has no idea who employed his services. However, he also knows that American private investigator Hoffer is seeking Weston. In the States Weston wrongfully murdered the wrong young girl; the father has retained Hoffer to bring Weston back to Texas for Lone Star justice.Weston completes his mission successfully with his sniping hitting his victim's heart, but realizes something went wrong as the London police almost catch him for the Ricks kill as his explosive diversion failed.

Concluding that he must uncover the identity of his last employer, Weston follows clues that take him back to Texas where an illegal weapons dealer is arranging a big pay off even as the professional hitman knows high noon is coming soon.This is a reprint of an early Ian Rankin antihero thriller with no Rebus anywhere in sight. The exciting story line is at its complex best when Weston is stalking and being stalked simultaneously, but loses some of its suspense when the confrontation occurs. Fans of Ian Rankin will want to read this different type of thriller than his usual Rebus investigations.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"Very different than the Rebus novels. Fast paced and credible. Author can be very diverse, surprising he hasn't been all these years."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"Ian Rankin brings Scotland's underbelly to life. The use of characters and locales from previous books makes the plot and Rebus come to life"},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"This was a very good listen, over a period of about two weeks. The nine discs take quite a while to get through, and I feel the story would have been better if abridged slightly. Some elements are repeated, and other parts look like padding.The reading by Stephen Pacey is excellent. Stephen is best known for the character of Tarrant in the last two seasons of Blake's Seven, and his upper-crust officer's voice is employed throughout for narration and the voice of the story's lead character, an assassin. He deploys a variety of alternative voices and accents for the other characters, most of which are really effective. He only falls down with the one Jamaican accent, which thankfully isn't heard for long. The rest, American and English regional accents are enjoyable and prevent the novel from falling into the trap of being a mere reading. There are no sound effects, nor music, but this is acceptable, a good effort has been made with the production.The main character is a hired killer, one about whom we learn more and more as the story progresses. There is rather too much emphasis on the technical aspect of the shootings, with every gun used mentioned by name and described in detail. It sounds as though Rankin has done his research, but frankly, I'm not interested. I am interested in the characters. These he draws well, and manages to render almost all of them sympathetic. This makes for a realistic as well as an enjoyable listen. The depiction of technology now sounds very dated, with someone looking something up on the internet or a bulletin board being described as though it was the eighth wonder of the world. This doesn't matter though, it just sets the story firmly in the 1980s.The narration alternates between first person (the assassin) and third person, and this has the effect of making the reader (somewhat unusually) identify with the killer. This is a nice change, and much imagination is used in describing how a nice person can come by such an employment. The story follows a stereotypical American detective, much in the Philip Marlowe mould, chasing the English asassin through a series of locations, and this adds a little colour to the story.I would recommend this book to anyone goig on long car journeys, but beware, it isn't suitable for the under twelves!"},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"Reviewed by Stephanie Rollins for Reader Views (10/06)Ian Rankin is the Edgar Award winning author of \\"A Question of Blood.\\" Ian Rankin's \\"Bleeding Hearts\\" is a long, but well-written story. It takes place in many cities, including London and the United States. It is about a hit man of many different names. On a routine hit, the police immediately start tracking him. Who ratted on him? It could only be the middleman or the person who hired him.He travels to London to figure it all out. He takes Bel, the young daughter of his gun maker. Yet, the gun maker is known for being protective of Bel. The hit man describes Bel. \\"Bel's got short fair hair, eyes slightly slanted like a cat's, and a long straight nose. Her face looks like it's been polished.\\" I cannot help but to think that the gun maker was completely stupid to let his nave and pretty daughter go with this rogue. Will their partnership lead to sex? Even worse, will it lead to a relationship?\\"Bleeding Hearts\\" has a lot of dry, intelligent humor. To get through airport security with a knife the gunman asks them, \\"Since when did you get fat terrorists?\\" Some of the humor is a little bit politically incorrect. To explain the hit man's skill as a locksmith he explains, \\"I'm not the world's greatest locksmith, but any housing-project teenager could have been into the place in seconds.\\"Readers wanting a quick, easy-to-read book will not enjoy \\"Bleeding Hearts.\\" It has 374 pages of tremendous depth Rankin uses a lot of descriptive words to paint the pictures of the surroundings and the characters. The humor and the dialogue are dry and understated. It has tremendous detail.There is no doubt that Ian Rankin is a brilliant author. He is a Picasso of words. I believe his audience is limited to avid readers who are not necessarily looking for a mindless read. There is nothing superficial about \\"Bleeding Hearts.\\" It is like a hybrid of \\"Law and Order,\\" and \\"CSI,\\" on steroids.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"Ian Rankin has earned a high reputation for police procedurals injected with gritty realism; there's a stylish wry wit and a raw energy in Rankin's writing that has been likened by critics to rock and roll. His dissolute Inspector Rebus is a fine piece of work, walking the line none too steadily between Scottish organized crime, an increasingly cynical view of his colleagues, wavering personal ethics and the local pub.Bleeding Hearts departs from the Rebus series and offers up a bang and a twist right from the start: the narrator is a professional assassin, meticulously preparing for another in a long string of hits. He nails his target without a flinch, but the police land on his tail immediately. Michael Weston therefore sets off on a helter-skelter tour of the seedier side of London, rural Scotland, and on to New York, Texas and the Pacific Northwest in search of the person who has set him up or sold him out. To add to the suspense and interest, his footsteps are dogged all the way by an overweight, drug-addicted, hypochondriac American gumshoe who has made a career out of following Weston. Neither character is exactly lovable or multi-faceted, but part of the fascination of the book is discovering which of these reprehensible characters is worthy of the reader's sympathy. The long story writhes, wallows, jogs, and lags sometimes in reflection of the narrator's anger, flattened-affect, mania and fatigue; a nice case of function following form. I was impressed to find my native Seattle/Olympic Peninsula accurately depicted, but disappointed that the narration had so little feeling for the place. Oh well, that would be in line with the characters: sweat-stained, desperate road warriors, all.Overall: RWR (Recommend With Reservations). Very well plotted, original and more than decently written. This is a very violent novel -- lots of descriptions of weapons, beatings, blood, and little redeeming social value, but all pretty much expected and therefore not too horrifying. If you enjoy a gritty crime novel, you will like this book. I personally found all the gun stuff tedious, but I'm just like that."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"Whether or not Ian Rankin's John Rebus police procedurals or his stand-alone works are seen as \\"literary\\" is totally irrelevant to the elements that make all of them exciting, entertaining, often funny, well plotted and a cut above the ordinary. His ironic twists accelerate the pace and keep readers breathlessly carried along by the action. BLEEDING HEARTS is the newest thriller to appear in the United States --- it was published in England in 1994 under the pseudonym Jack Harvey. In it, we follow the trajectories of the lives of two men: an assassin of international repute, and a former NYPD cop now turned private eye who has vowed to track down the infamous killer and execute him.The story opens in a hotel bar in England where me meet the killer, Michael Weston, having a drink with a passing acquaintance. In his first-person narration he tells readers that his mark has only three more hours to live, while opining to his companion: \\"You know what it's like these days --- only the toughest are making it. No room for bleeding hearts though of course in my line of work bleeding hearts are the business.\\"Today his assignment is to shoot a woman who will be leaving a particular hotel, at a particular time, wearing a particular dress patterned in yellow and blue. He has no idea who she is and doesn't really care. Later, as the police show up at almost the precise second he pulls the trigger, he can't believe what has just transpired. How could they be here so quickly? he wonders. His ad-hoc plan to leave the scene is to call 999 and ask for an ambulance because, he tells them, he's \\"a severe hemophiliac\\" who has been involved in a terrible accident and his head is bleeding.Weston in fact is a hemophiliac, albeit a mild one, and this twist adds verisimilitude to the character that is more cerebral than physical. As happens in life, his illness is a curse and a blessing --- this time it is his means of escape and soon he is free. He now can ponder what went wrong; this was supposed to be an easy hit. His conclusion: he had to have been set up --- but by whom, and why?Weston must escape to safety and makes his way to an isolated farm where Max and his daughter Belle live. They deal in arms of every sort and sell to anyone with enough cash to pay for them. Weston needs their support and access to their cache. He rests a bit and plans an assault on a so-far phantom enemy.Weston has always worked through a middleman, the gunrunner Max. He never wanted to get \\"personally involved\\" with his victims or paymasters. Death is only the result of the job he has to do; it is a fact of life but not necessarily one he cares to analyze. He is very smart, very careful, very dedicated and very lethal. He looks like an average man of a certain age who is personable but reveals nothing about himself to anyone.Meanwhile, in Vine Street police station, Chief Inspector Bob Broome comes to the conclusion that Weston, dubbed the \\"Demolition Man,\\" is the shooter. But the police have no clear evidence to point to the real target. \\"The people on the [hotel] steps, that's another thing. We've got a journalist [dead], a secretary of state, and some senior guy from an East European embassy.\\"After a powwow with his detectives, Broome makes a call to the United States --- to Leo Hoffer, who ran his own detective agency. These days, Hoffer's only personal client is Robert Walkins, the father of a young woman who the Demolition Man killed in a freak accident, which so far was Weston's only miss. Walkins and Hoffer have been obsessed with finding the D-Man and killing him.Ian Rankin is one of those writers whose prose grabs the reader with the first line. From there it's a heady journey through a fast-paced, intelligent plotline, awash with characters who jump off the page and a climax that turns everything the reader was thinking upside down. BLEEDING HEARTS is not only a thriller about a sniper and the man who tracks him. It is also a story that is timely and raises issues of good and evil to a higher plane. Rankin wants the reader inside the heads of his anti-hero and his nemesis. Their thoughts, their rationalizations, their uncertainties, their fears and their destinies are central to understanding what motivates these people who do what they do. Readers are asked to \\"stand back\\" and judge for themselves how evil or good these men are. The supporting characters play no less a part in fleshing out the architecture of the book, and they inhabit the space, each with their own personalities and agendas, be they good or bad.BLEEDING HEARTS is a challenge to read. It is gritty and tough, but that's Rankin's trademark. All of his books explore the dark side of people's lives and the underbellies of space they inhabit --- but he balances that by shining a light into the hidden nooks and the shadowed crannies that ultimately override the bad guys. The body of work he has amassed speaks to his readability and storytelling prowess. And while loyal fans look forward to the next John Rebus installment, BLEEDING HEARTS is one of his best stand-alone novels and is certainly a keeper.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"This is the first American release for an early novel by British writer Ian Rankin, author of the award-winning \\"John Rebus\\" series of mysteries. Michael West is an assassin and when he is double crossed after murdering a journalist, he must go on the run with assistance from the daughter of an arms dealer to find out who set him up. He is chased by a drug-addled American private eye who will stop at nothing to take him down. Ranking throws in the kitchen sink on this one: cops, crooks, spies and cults all take part in the narrative with plenty of shoot 'em up action along the way. The ending is a little contrived, but the story works for the most part, and shows how talented a writer Rankin was even at this early stage."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"This is what used to be called a \\"rattling good yarn\\".It's a tale of a hired assassin, a crack-shot sniper, who travels the world, killing people for payment...a cold-blooded murderer who also happens to be a haemophiliac. Strangely enough, you find yourself empathising with this man as the story proceeds, which it does at a cracking pace. Michael Weston is hired by an unknown client to shoot a TV news journalist. He successsfully carries out his assignment but things start to go awry and he realises that he is being pursued by an old adversary, Leo Hohher, a former NY cop, now a private investigator. Michael visits Max Harrison, an old friend living deep in the country, to buy guns and ammunition and meets his daughter Bel- gorgeous and a crack shot. While Michael and Bel are off on an errand, unknown criminals enter the house and behead Max, leaving the body to be found by Bel and Michael. The chase takes them to the US where they connect with a weird and suspect religious cult whose leader has unidentifiable sources of income. Even though the hero of Bleeding Hearts is a thoroughly amoral character, one can't help but hope that he comes good in the end and survives the shoot-outs."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"I am so glad this wasn't the first Ian Rankin book I read. Otherwise, it would have been the last, and I never would have discovered his terrific Inspector Rebus stories. Rankin has the advantage on me with his Rebus novels because I don't know anything about Scotland, so whatever he says about that, I can believe. But, while reading Bleeding Hearts (which I chose not to finish), I kept thinking to myself, 'this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.' The American private eye somehow manages to get himself on British TV as a famous American private eye. Does that ever happen? Know any famous private eyes? And he says things to people like, 'I'm an American, and where I come from, we show hospitality to strangers.' Really? And he's from New York! I do admire Rankin's efforts to get America and Americans right, and appreciate how difficult that might be for someone from Scotland, but he fails time and again, leading me to finally put the book aside. It is a failed effort. That said, the Rebus mysteries are great."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"In a departure from his Inspector Rebus series, author Rankin pursues his taste for blood and the hunt (ie, \\"Blood Hunt,\\" \\"Witch Hunt,\\" \\"Let It Bleed,\\" etc.) with a new set of characters and a pseudonym (Jack Harvey) for Bleeding Heart's original publication in 1994. This exploration into new thriller territory for him was published that year in the U.K. and presents a rather clever variation in the killer-for-hire scenario--worth the reprint for a wider audience.Not only is Michael Weston a sniper assassin who commands the big bucks for his unerring heart shot (as opposed to the standard head shot) but he's also been branded the \\"Demolition Man\\" or \\"D-man\\" for his tactic of employing a bomb well placed and timed to divert his target and protectors before his fatal kill. And, differences from the norm don't stop there. Weston, a killing machine, is a hemophiliac, a bleeder.The job that sets this journey off is a contract on Eleanor Ricks, a TV reporter, as she emerges from a building in which she's conducted an interview. Curiously, he's been told by his anonymous employer what she'll be wearing so that he can spot his quarry in a crowd that includes more than one VIP. In fact, the nature of his employ and its aftermath raises questions that demand answers. Any one of those VIPs would have been the more likely target so, as the news stories postulate, could it have been a bad shot, a mistaken aim? Hit man Weston, of course, knows better. He doesn't do mistaken aims.But even he is wondering about this particular target. It's not his job to question such matters since it's only about the money and he gets plenty. But how did the contractor know what the victim would be wearing? And why did the police arrive at the scene so quickly that he almost didn't get away from his firing place? Was this a setup by an enemy? This sniper-assassin won't rest until he gets the answers. He might even have taken his last contract.Someone else is equally interested, though from an altogether different angle. Overweight but astute private detective Hoffer has been hunting Weston for years for an employer who will not forget the death of his daughter. The task to avenge her has been Hoffer's long term, well paid mission, and with this new killing new lines of inquiry open up. In fact, he's going to get as close as he ever has to closing his case, but the outcome will be anything but the predictable one.The dual chase takes Weston and Hoffer into a pursuit that covers a wide geographical area and many a misleading clue. In his jump from London to Texas and back to Yorkshire, Weston will change names and hook up with his old weapons dealer pal Max in Texas who always provides a lesson in exotic weaponry and ammo. Max's spunky and gorgeous daughter Bel (n&eacute;e Belinda) provides herself as a partner/companion in Weston's tracking of a pseudo-religious cult whose leader he suspects is his mystery contractor.There's enough here to keep the pace flowing and the bodies falling, while preserving the essential morality of the hit man as a character trait rather than a simple bargain-with-the-devil compromise. Rankin is obviously a thoughtful thriller creator who wants depth -- if a quirky variety of it -- for his heroes and anti-heroes. The twists and surprises come as much from the choices he makes as for the action dynamics he provides."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"It took me a long time to finish this book. When I thought about reading it, I found I thought the story was interesting and I wanted to know what would happen, but it just took effort to want to read it. I couldn't figure out why.That was until about halfway through the book and I realized I didn't like any of the characters and couldn't care less about what happened to them. That's what was holding me back.Bel was whiny, passive aggressive and naive to the point of my just wanting her killed off. Overall, I got the impression that Rankin could never make up his mind who she was supposed to be.Weston, the infamous D-Man, was a milquetoast. Without a sniper rifle, he came across as bumbling and weak. The great assissin barely knew how to use a pistol. That wasn't so bad. It could have been endearing under the right circumstances. But added to the fact that he was incapable of standing up to Bel and that she basically led him around by his nose, he was character I couldn't believe in. I would say that he was \\"whipped\\" if he hadn't been so apathetic about their relationship. He was pretty much apatehtic about everything. Even his interest in finding out who set him up came across as forced for the sake of the plot.Finally, there was Leo Hoffer, who took being the obnoxious New Yorker/American to new heights. Rankin's depiction of Hoffer as such was so over the top it seemed like parody. All of the Americans, except possibly Clancy, were caricatures. Hoffer had some \\"cute\\" quirks, but overall he was yet another character I felt should be killed off. And given his lack of use in the latter half of a novel, and looking back on it, contrived use in the earlier half, he probably could have been left out of the novel altogether.The ending, both that regarding the \\"big conspiracy\\" and who hired the D-Man, were anti-clamatic, contrived, somewhat illogical, and utterly disappointing. Not so much the resolution of the \\"conspiracy\\". That was a \\"who cares\\" moment. It was the answer to who hired Weston and why that was so disappointing.This is the second novel I've read by Rankin. Witch Hunt being the first. It's my second disappointment. I'm not sure I'll be picking up another by this author."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"This book is so bad in so many ways, starting with the concept of hit man as sympathetic protagonist and finishing with the pathetic ending that is supposed to show redemption. Along the way the plot goes downhill after a semi-gripping opening assassination, the action becomes ridiculous, and the relationship between Bel and the hit man that starts out creepy becomes predictable and annoying. Rankin's writing equals the triteness of his story.Rankin's Rebus series is mostly excellent, but this book is garbage compared to those novels. Did Rankin feel like he wanted to try writing something different, something edgy? Whatever the reason, this books is a failure. I only finished reading it so I can reach 100 books read this year (2011) as December ends."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer, that none of these characters are very likable. This was my first experience with Ian Rankin, after being told many times that I would love his writing [guess I should have started with a John Rebus story]. I never got into any of the characters, did not believe them or their motivations, and really struggled to care what happened to them. Really, the most interesting character is the woman who gets killed in the opening chapter. Finally, just gave up after about 150 pages, flipped to the back and read the last few chapters and the \\"twist\\" was what I expected. Blah."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"Every once in a while it's good to read a book about a sniper that seems to have touch of humanity. This is a sniper without a clear conscience and it added a refreshing element to the story. It was also new that this sniper was good at shooting, but he wasn't a walking superweapon without a rifle either, and was aware of it. Usually, these guys are portrayed as extreme killing machines with or without weapons, and at times there is nothing wrong with reading about characters like that. The fact that this guy wasn't, just provided a new perspective with this action plot. It was well written, the end wasn't predictable, and it provided enough testosterone driven combat that the book was never boring."},{"Title":"Bleeding Hearts","review":"Michael Weston -- if that's really his name -- is a craftsman at his job, which is killing people. Only once did he shoot the wrong person (a young girl) and that was a regrettable accident, but it's come back to haunt him. His current commission involves taking out a London journalist on the steps of her hotel, which he accomplishes, but the police are there suspiciously fast. Who sicced them on him? As he begins trying to track back to his employer for his own protection, he runs afoul of what appears to be a cult group with access to too much money and connections to the American spook underground. And then there's the publicity-hungry private detective who's been tracking him for years. The plot is nicely complicated and its resolution is based on a real occurrence. The characters are well drawn and the author maintains a frenetic pace that would make a good film."},{"Title":"Croatian","review":"I have all of the Croatian tapes on the market and none can compare to the Pimsleur tapes. Before getting this series I had despaired of ever learning this language. I was astonished at how quickly I have learned and retained the information presented here.I just returned from my third trip to Croatia. For the first time I was able to get the sense of conversations as well as communicate with some confidence. I only wish there was an intermediate level. The Pimsleur method is a remarkable approach to learning a language. It is the first language series that I have used that really lives up to its hype."},{"Title":"Croatian","review":"The Pimsleur Language Program gives the student a thorough grasp of basic vocabulary and expressions through an interesting style of memory work. Working through the tapes in chronological order truly does provide the best results, as each tape builds upon the one prior. Vocabulary and phrases from previous tapes are reviewed at varying intervals throughout the course to trigger the memory's alertness and focus.As the title of this review states, this set is most appropriate for travellers. It is also; however, an excellent introduction to the Croatian language for anyone with an interest in the language. The amount of knowlege contained in this course is somewhat limited: I found myself wishing for another few tapes to really 'complete' the course."},{"Title":"Croatian","review":"Truly, these tapes were wonderful. As a language teacher myself, I found it an eye-opening experience. Pimsleur has just the right length in his pauses for you to recall the right word or phrase. Its an excellent, easy way to learn a language. I would add, however, it really is for the beginner to gain a measure of small understanding for Croatian, not anywhere near fluency. Still, the pronunciation is quite good, according to a native speaker I know."},{"Title":"Croatian","review":"This is good place to start if you have absolutely no knowledge of the language. It boosts the listener to learn the language through application and it sticks in memory.Just repeat what is said on the tapes and your good to go.I would not recommend this to anyone who already has some knowledge of the language,but for the beginner it's a place to start."},{"Title":"Croatian","review":"The great strength of Pimsleur materials is due to the fact that because they work only on verbal skills, you are actually able to SPEAK and UNDERSTAND the target language when you've finished. This set is designed for the complete beginner, so if you already speak some Croatian it may be too elementary. Nevertheless, it's great for providing survival Croatian.(...)One more thing: I haven't had a chance to use the Croatian here with Bosnians. Whether you see Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian as dialects of one language or as individual languages in their own right is up to you, but the material presented here is probably generic and simple enough to communicate with people from virtually anywhere in the former Yugoslavia. Heh heh... I've already been complemented on my beautiful Serbian!!!"},{"Title":"Croatian","review":"I found the style and content to be very easy to follow. Maximum learning with minimal effort.

I was looking for a cookbook that was authentic and not watered down.

If you ever wanted to make \\"real\\" tamales. Get this book."},{"Title":"Food from My Heart: Cuisines of Mexico Remembered and Reimagined","review":"This wonderful cookbook is part history book ( of Zarela Martinez' family and experiences in Mexico) as well as being a great book full of wonderful recipes. These recipes are &quot;authenically Mexican&quot; as opposed to being an Americanized version of Mexican food (which is what you are liable to find here in America.) Her subsequent books on Oaxaca and Veracruz are also worth checking out."},{"Title":"Food from My Heart: Cuisines of Mexico Remembered and Reimagined","review":"Sitting in the kitchen windowseat near the stove, age 6, I learned to make white sauce by watching my mother prepare chicken a la king. That's how I felt on first reading Food From My Heart. Although Mexican cuisine had been my favorite since grad school (when I was blessed with a Chicana landlady who spoiled me entirely for store-bought tortillas)FFMY provided me a solid grounding in all the basics of la comida. I consider it the only Mexican cookbook anyone really needs.Just one example of Zarela's basic + creative approach: once you master fresh corn tortillas and creamy, tart-spicy Salsa de Tomatillo con Crema, she sets out Enchiladas de Cangrejo, combining these two with good crabmeat and queso. And you start thinking: this would work with chicken, or lobster, or a veggie mix. It's more than recipes, it's showing you the secret of good cooking: HOW to cook.Besides all that, even if you don't usually read cookbooks like novels, bet you will have this one on your bedside table a week or two! Just as her dishes combine distinct flavors, to produce a delicious harmony, the book's chapters layer family and national history, food culture and botany with the recipes themselves. The book could not have been better named, and along with the food itself, will find its way to your heart."},{"Title":"Food from My Heart: Cuisines of Mexico Remembered and Reimagined","review":"My fav cookbook of all time.

Even her MoM's book is fabuloso."},{"Title":"The earth (Life nature library)","review":"The 25 volume Life Nature series was a landmark in science and nature writing back in the early 60s. It was written at a time of heightened awareness of the importance of science education in the U.S. when the Russians beat us into space with Sputnik and also with Yuri Gagarin, the first man into space. Today with the Russians now emerging capitalists and the U.S. having won the Cold War, it's hard to imagine the anxiety and fear that those events inspired over here, along with the related concern that the Russians were also leading us in science and math education. And in fact, they were and oddly enough in some ways still do.This amazing series came out of that climate. With beautiful photo essays and extremely well written text by top science and nature writers there was nothing like it for the young reader at the time. It was also a time when companies like Time and Life were still powerhouses in the publishing industry and had the resources to undertake large projects like this. This volume by Arthur Beiser, a geology professor who could write for a lay audience, was one of my favorites. Although written before plate tectonics became accepted, it's still a fine introduction to many aspects of geology, including structural geology and landforms, the internal structure of the earth, historical geology, basic rocks and minerals, marine geology, vulcanology, and other topics. Although intended for younger readers at the time, don't let that mislead you as it assumes a level of scientific literacy that no longer exists these days even among adults in the U.S. anymore, as another reviewer here already observed."},{"Title":"The earth (Life nature library)","review":"The Earth is one of twenty-five volumes in the Life Nature Library. Published by Time-Life books in the 1960s, this series portrays the many aspects of the natural world. Though obviously dated (it was written before the coining of the term plate tectonics), The Earth is still a good, basic introduction to geology. Topics covered include the Earth in space, internal structure of the Earth, the atmosphere, earthquakes, erosion, fossils, types of rocks, geologic history, and the future of the Earth. The book also describes theories which attempt to explain natural climate change. I did like this book, but at times I felt as if I was reading one of my geology textbooks from college. Nevertheless, The Earth is an ideal book for one who desires a basic introduction to the many facets of our fascinating planet."},{"Title":"Child and Adolescent Treatment for Social Work Practice: A Relational Perspective for Beginning Clinicians","review":"A PROFESSOR @ MY POST-GRADUATE PROGRAM WRITTEN THIS BOOK, AND I THINK IT'S WORTH READING AND REALLY GREAT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS GETTING STARTING IN TREATMENT AND SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE."},{"Title":"Child and Adolescent Treatment for Social Work Practice: A Relational Perspective for Beginning Clinicians","review":"As a clinical social worker with institute training and who suprvises extensively beginning therapits, this book was a major disappointment.

This book is very informative and very simple to understand. Even my plastic surgeon was impressed with how well informed I was at my initial consult.

I've been researching this topic for two years and this book, &quot;Body Sculpture: Plastice Surgery For Men and Women&quot; is definetly the most valuable source of information I've come across. To anyone considering plastic surgery, buy this book and read it before your consult. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"BodySculpture: Plastic Surgery of the Body for Men and Women","review":"I have seen many books about plastic surgery on the shelves, but this one is my favorite. It has the most pictures of any of the books, and it gives me more information than any of the other ones.

I would recommend Bodysculpture to anyone who is interested in in-depth information on almost any procedure associated with plastic surgery."},{"Title":"BodySculpture: Plastic Surgery of the Body for Men and Women","review":"Body Sculpture is a wonderful resource for people interested in plastic surgery. It covers all of the important issues prospective patients need to be aware of. It is extremely important to be an educated patient. This book gives you the power to get involved and be aware of your choices. Dr. Engler does a great job in presenting the facts in an easy to read manner. I have a website designed to educate patients about plastic surgery so I'm always happy to see information of this quality become available to the public. Since I myself have had plastic surgery I can tell you how important it is to be informed. I encourage you to read this book if you are considering cosmetic surgery. The photos and the step by step information will give you a better understanding of what to expect before during and after surgery. Knowing the facts before you consider a consultation with a surgeon is always a good idea. I truly recommend this book!Nicole at Implantinfo.com"},{"Title":"BodySculpture: Plastic Surgery of the Body for Men and Women","review":"As someone who operates a popular and very informative breast implant web site and forum...I cannot recommend this book enough. Dr. Engler covers everything, including information on other plastic surgery techniques, such as liposuction, breast lifts, breast reduction, and tummy tucks. The complete history of breast implants is covered, as well as the types of implants available (saline and silicone), the silicone controversy, shapes of various implants, placement of the implants, possible risks and complications, as well as before and after photos. This book really has everything. You will learn what to expect at your consultation, to anesthesia, to what the neighbors will say.Plastic surgery is not something to be taken lightly. Much thought should go into the reasons WHY you want to have the surgery. This is covered in the book as well.Dr. Engler is a highly respected surgeon, and is a wonderful authoritative source on breast augmentation. If you are contemplating any of the procedures outlined in this book, I urge you to read this book."},{"Title":"BodySculpture: Plastic Surgery of the Body for Men and Women","review":"We are truly fortunate to live in a society where modern plastic and cosmetic surgery affords men and women desirous of affecting change to their face and body an astounding array of techniques which can yield magnificent results when performed by highly skilled surgeons. Unfortunately, most patients must decide which type of surgery is best suited for them during one or two brief pre-operative consultations - hardly confidence inspiring considering the results of cosmetic surgery are variable (depending on the technique employed) and permanent.Dr. Alan Engler has certainly helped to balance the equation between patient and physician by crafting an informative, yet easily understandable guide to the different approaches available for specific areas of the body and their expected results. His book is an immensely readable and fascinating guide into the world of modern cosmetic surgery packed with scientific knowledge, photographs, as well as invaluable helpful suggestions to assist patients through their post-operative recovery periods and subsequent adjustment to their improved appearance. The author demystifies the heretofore private domain of cosmetic surgery while writing with simultaneous wit and clarity, always encouraging us to understand today's specialized procedures and thoughtfully providing answers to our corresponding questions.I recommend this book for anyone considering undergoing cosmetic surgery for the first time as well as those who have already &quot;taken the plunge&quot; as an invaluable addition to their resource library.

Dr. Engler covers everything. From what to expect before, during &amp; after surgery to the emotional aspect of undergoing plastic surgery. Each procedure (breast augmentation, breast reduction, liposuction and tummy tucks) is explained thoroughly, yet in easy to understand layman&#65533;s terms. He details what you&#65533;ll get from a consult and all your options, to how to prepare for surgery and what transpires during surgery. He lists the risks of each surgery and what to expect when recovering and he does not sugar coat! Bravo!The book includes lots of before and afters of each surgery, which is a great reference if you are planning on surgery or even if you are only contemplating surgery.Dr. Engler is a graduate of Yale and is a ABPS board-certified plastic surgeon (the ONLY plastic surgery board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties).

It was ok, but some of the stories were a little silly."},{"Title":"Shadows and Cypress: Southern Ghost Stories","review":"I love to read peoples accounts of local legends, ghost stories or folktales where the author doesn't give his or her own spin but merely relates the story as told. This book gives you a rare chance to do just that. \\"Shadows and Cypress\\" brings together 187 short ghost stories that the author collected with the help of his students, and from the WPA folklore collections.People need to know, this book is different from most ghost story books written today...Most ghost books are full of stories that have been re-written and dramatized by the author and there's usually a satisfying explanation for the haunting. Brown presents these stories exactly as they were told; \\"warts n' all.\\" Here there's often no reason for a haunting, someone just relates a scary experience they had. These stories rarely obey any \\"rules of literature\\" either -- information one might expect at the beginning may be at the end of the story, however the person decides to include it. The stories can be quite short at times, a page, half-page or a mere ten lines in one case, and often the original dialect is preserved.This is one of the most scholarly books of ghost tales you will read - there are extensive annotations with motifs noted, such as \\"headless ghost,\\" \\"ghost with lantern,\\" etc. There's a helpful bibliography with notes by the author about what to expect from similar books.This isn't a book designed to scare you (although a few of the tales are creepy) this book exists primarily to preserve the storytelling tradition in the South. All of that said I can't think of a drawback with this book, except that it may not be what some people are looking for.Other books in the oral tradition with stories that haven't been re-written are:--W. K. McNeil's \\"Ghost Stories from the American South\\"-Alan Brown's \\"The Face in the Window and Other Alabama Ghostlore\\"-Ray Browne's \\"A Night with the Hants\\"-William Montell's \\"Ghosts across Kentucky\\" and \\"Haunted Houses and Family Ghosts of Kentucky\\""},{"Title":"Shadows and Cypress: Southern Ghost Stories","review":"Great book!

Modern readers (and producers) often interpret it as a proto-hippie propaganda piece: control-freak Pentheus gets his comeuppance from the god of wine and dance, Dionysus. But it's far more complex than that: Dionysus is a force of nature and not a human being, and the revenge he takes on Pentheus' family is (by human standards) cruelly disproportionate to the offense. I've seen the play done as everything from a &quot;Hair&quot;-influenced musical to a flamenco performance (which was surprisingly effective!), and I feel it still hasn't given up all its secrets.Mahon's rendition is memorable: his language spans a range of tones and emotions, from irony and wry humor to the beautifully expressed choruses and the pathos of the final scene, and this conveys the &quot;feel&quot; of the play far better than the usual all-too-dignified &quot;exact&quot; translations. His anachronisms are annoying at times, and he can't resist the occasional Irish touch (e.g., he uses &quot;ceili&quot; to describe the Maenads' dances). Also, I have doubts about the stageworthiness of his musical suggestions (everything from folk to rock 'n' roll), but he leaves the director a lot of latitude. I feel that Mahon's language would work well on the stage, which isn't true of all poet-playwrights! All in all, this is a well-written work, and a pleasure to read, too."},{"Title":"Frommer's Florida's Best-Loved Driving Tours","review":"I've lived in the beautiful state of Florida for 36 years and this book is one of the best tour guides I've seen for people who love to drive as much as I do.

Krishnamurti Commentaries on Living 3rd Series","review":"When I set out to read J. Krishnamurti I wasn't expecting to read a primer on philophical counseling or logotherapy - but that's what these \\"commentaries\\" really are.Each chapter opens with a rich description of nature: of note is the fact that the descriptions are very non-interpretive; the voice of the narrator is almost abscent - input/output, no interpretive filter. Then, there is a break and a \\"commentary\\" begins. Typically with the intimate \\"there were three (or five, or two, or six) of us in the room.\\" The guests seeks Krishnamurti's advice, a piece of wisdom to deal with the problems of living.The problems are \\"diagnosed\\" and the cure - of nonduality - is offered. Once again, of note is the structure of the \\"commentary\\" in which the seekers' thoughts are in direct speech, in quotations, but Krishnamurti's responses are merely the exposition - without the quotation marks - a kind of continued description of the nature, with Krishnamurti's logotherapeutic interventions stylistically merging with the zen-ish descriptions of nature.The resulting effect is a kind of play on Subject and Object where the nature and Krishnamurti's voice are one and the seekers are akin to the objects of Krishnamurti's own consciousness (which, of course, they are from the first-person perspective) passing by down the river of time.Pavel Somov, Ph.D., Author of \\"Eating the Moment: 141 Mindful Practices to Overcome Overeating One Meal at a Time\\" (New Harbinger, 2008)[...]"},{"Title":"The Feng Shui of Gardening","review":"While this book was very short on useful feng shui information from a FS consultant's point of view, it was extremely entertaining in other ways.

Waring emphasizes key elements including the importance of representing all the forces of nature (wood, fire, earth, metal and water) and allowing them to play against and with each other to create a positive flow of Chi.While the directionally-challenged among us may be frustrated with Waring's initial attempts to interpret the \\"facing\\" direction of our homes and gardens (the front is not always where your door is!), the chapters on fragrant flowers, trees, and bamboos, with their select lists and descriptions of plants, puts the reader back into the feng shui state of mind.Waring has a clear understanding of the feng shui concepts and presents them here in a compact, easy-to-reference book that can be used to create a brand-new garden or to simply adapt your current garden to include feng shui principles."},{"Title":"Indigenous American Women: Decolonization, Empowerment, Activism (Contemporary Indigenous Issues)","review":"The author has put forth a fine compilation of subjects which will challenge both those outside of Native America and within it's ranks to open their eyes to some harsh realities and true strengths of American Indian women.

It also ups the suspension really well, making me very curious to see what happens in the later comics. I did notice, though, that parts of the story are lost to you if you don't understand a fable reference, as I didn't in one section. You really have to be well-versed in the good old stories to get the full experience while reading these. In my notes, I write: \\"How are the wolf & Snow White not like Bella & Edward? Oh yeah, Snow White actually HAS a brain.\\" which I completely will stick with. I love the two of them together, perfecting imperfection.Rating: 5/5"},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"\\"Fables: Storybook Love\\" is the 3rd Volume in Vertigo's collected works of Bill Willingham's faerie-tale deconstruction comics series. Unlike the previous 2 volumes, Storybook Love, functions as a compilation of 4 stand alone tales that expands just slightly on the established main storyline. The variety of art style and stories provide a nice mix and reading through this book was both pleasant and fairly quick. Highly recommended for fans of the series."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"Excellent comic book series by VErtigo.It is a must, if you want to continue with the Fables saga."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This third Fables trade paperback collects issues #11-18 of the Bill Willingham series. I'll presume anyone reading this is already familiar with the series and direct those unfamiliar to reviews for the excellent Volume 1 and 2 TPBs. For new fans, the first two pages of Volume 3 feature capsules of the main characters and summaries of the first two story arcs.The two-part caper \\"A Sharp Operation\\", penciled by Lan Medina, shows a tabloid journalist about to expose the secrets of Fabletown. The title story arc, penciled by Bryan Talbot, spans issues #14-17 and focuses on Bluebeard's and Goldilocks' deadly conspiracy against Bigby and Snow. Both of these plotlines feature outstanding development of the characters from the first ten issues.This TPB is bookended by a pair of lesser one-shots featuring (respectively) Jack in the post Civil War American South and a flashback to the legend of the Lilliputians. The artwork in the former includes some finely detailed scenes but that of the latter tended toward the cartoonish. Overall, the cover price offers good value for an eight issue collection, especially considering Amazon's discount."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This third volume in the excellent FABLES series is even better than the first two. The primary storyline picks up whereAnimal Farmleft off, with Snow White recovering from her normally life-ending wound and Goldilocks on the run. All seems to be peaceful after the episode at the Farm, until a nosey journalist shows up threatening to reveal what he guesses to be the Fables' colony of vampires. From there, the pace of the story remains very intense, with accomplished and attempted murders, coerced and freely-given sex flings, and high drama throughout. There are also two background stories included in this volume: An explicit tale of Jack's exploits during the Civil War, and A more fairy tale-like story of the beginnings of Smalltown.All of the stories presented here are very entertaining, making this book a hard one to put down. Only one high profile Fable is introduced here. Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) plays a prominent role in the efforts to silence the misguided reporter, and is sure to have a place in future tales. Prince Charming plays a major role in this one, developing some surprisingly large ambitions that will unfold in upcoming issues. The title of this volume comes primarily from the strange relationship between Bigby and Snow, but could loosely connect with any of the individual stories within. My advice, take this one slowly to make it last. You'll be tempted to read it all in one sitting, but delaying gratification will prolong your experience and heighten your enjoyment. Remember, there are only 13 Fables titles to date, you don't want to rush through them too quickly."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"I worried a bit over the rating to give this volume in Bill Willingham's FABLES series. If judged by other volumes in the series, it would probably merit a 4 star rating. But judged by the vast majority of comics and graphic novels, it easily deserves 5 stars. So, 5 stars it is.As other reviewers have noted, this collects four separate stories of unequal length. The longest by far gives the title to the book, \\"Storybook Love.\\" This is a fun story entirely on its own merits, but it also sets up major changes in the books to come.I can certainly recommend this book in the series, but I especially recommend the series as a whole. And it isn't just fun. I have read Grimms' Fairy Tales and much of Calvino's ITALIAN FOLKTALES, but I frequently find myself scurrying off to find out who this or that character in the story is. Definitely one of the finest comics series around."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"The Fables story continues in this volume and it is a great read. The art continues to look great. This is the collection of issues #11-18.In this volume Bluebeard has finally came up with a plan to rid himself of Bigby and Snow White involving Goldilocks, fromFables Vol. 2: Animal Farm, the two and up making it out much to Bluebeard's dismay and the volume ends with a nice twist.

It's a slight step down from what I've already read and the next volume, but not much of one. Still is great stuff."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This is the third book in the graphic novel collections of Bill Willingham's Fables. As such, it features great artwork and a riveting story. The denizens of Fabletown, refugees fairy tale characters living in New York City, are threatened with exposure by a journalist who has been researching them for some time. With Snow White still on the mend, the protection of Fabletown falls to Bigby, Bluebeard, and Prince Charming. This brings into conflict two of the most ambitious men in Fabletown: Prince Charming and Bluebeard. The rest of the story focuses on their political machinations, which will have a big impact on Snow and Bigby's \\"relationship\\".If you enjoyed the first two Fable stories you will not be disappointed with Storybook Love."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"The premise of this wonderful series is to rewrite and expand the world of fairy tales. They characters of which has entered our world fleeing a great evil. Lost of fun, smart and witty, typical american style illustrations for the most part, but nice. Some similarities of premise to the Sand Man series, but not quite as inventive or as extensively research and deep. Start at #1 for the best read."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"Bill Willingham, Fables: Storybook Love (Vertigo, 2004)The Fables series gets Storybook Love for its third book, and it runs through four complete stories. \\"Storybook Love\\" is the longest of them, and the one that's actually integrated with the series. The others are one-offs concerning Jack (of the beanstalk fame), the Lilliputians, and Bigby and co. trying to stop a misguided journalist from exposing the inhabitants of the building as vampires.In \\"Storybook Love,\\" Bluebeard gets the idea that it would be a fine thing were he to take over the leadership of the New York contingent. (Where he gets the idea would be a spoiler.) In order to help his plan along, he drugs Bigby and Snow and sends them packing-- literally; they wake up from the mind-control drug camped out in the foothills of the Cascade mountains... and they're not alone.The Fables books are a wonderful thing, they are. The stories are delightfully twisted, constantly referencing the fairytales whence these characters spring, and blending a good deal of darkness into the general absurdity (the \\"suggested for mature readers\\" tag is to be taken seriously here); folks who aren't attached to fairytales via an unhealthy level of nostalgia will likely get a real kick out of the cleverness. Definitely recommended. ***"},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This was a great volume with a bunch of short stories all tied in together. Very fast read.

Love the Adversary story arc and issues that focus on Snow and Bigby."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"Bill Willingham's Fables series is an absolute blast. Instead of simply revisiting the unique and interesting world he has created from \\"storybook legends\\" from all around the world, he's turned it into an organic enterprise. Things happen in the books. People change and characters die. Even eternal characters that have been around hundreds of years. Willingham isn't a one-note storyteller either. He doesn't just write adventure. He writes the stuff of fairy tale: adventure, whimsy, loss, mystery, etc. And he does it at a pace that leaves readers breathless.In the third volume of Bill Willingham's excellent series Fables, the writer presents readers with four stories instead of one. The last two graphic novel collects have each covered on arc, a murder mystery and a threat of war. Storybook Love presents three stories that spin entirely around love - lustful and temporary and troubled - and one that fits into the category with a little shoving.The first offering is about Jack, the one who climbed the Beanstalk and seems forever determined to get himself into trouble. Set during the troubled years of the Civil War and shortly thereafter, \\"Bag O' Bones\\" is a wonderfully American tale of Death being bested - and of the morbid yet hilarious consequences of the grim specter being taken off the playing field. Especially at a time of war. This was never an actual fairy tale, but it should have been. Willingham just has that wonderful touch of making the things he does seem real.\\"A Two-Part Caper\\" is a caper story that involves Sleeping Beauty. It seems that every time she pricks her finger in the mortal world, everybody around her goes to sleep and thorn bushes start growing everywhere. That has become a problem because the Fables have to keep a low profile and away from the prying eyes of the mortals. However, just letting readers know that these obstacles remain in the way of the Fables is awesome when you start thinking about all the problems some of the characters in storybook legend had.Things spin out of control in this story when a human reporters confronts Bigby Wolf, the Fables's one-man police unit, and tells him he's about to go public with a story about the Fables. Apparently he's noticed that the Fables live several hundred years. Of course, being human, the man is convinced they're all vampires. Although that isn't the truth, Bigby knows that he can't allow the man to start a stampede of attention.The resulting cover-up and frame job on the reporter is simply amazing and shows Willingham's versatility as a writer. I was in stitches when I read the lengths everyone went to in order to preserve their secret, and I loved the tension that built up between Bigby and Bluebeard, which only foreshadowed the graphic novel's next arc.\\"Storybook Love\\" concentrates on the coup that Bluebeard and returning fave villain Goldilocks initiate to get Bigby and Snow White out of the way so they can take over. The back-and-forth play throughout the plot is a perfect thriller and perfect escapism. Readers get a broader look at the whole world, and the fact that much of the interest focuses on the emerging relationship between Bigby and Snow, though no one knows for sure which path that's going to take.The action sequences in the story are very well drawn and accentuate the pacing. The fact that Bigby's father was the North Wind and that he can still blow down houses (and forests) came out of nowhere but fits perfectly with what we've learned about the character. I loved the Mouse Police (Mounted Police) and would love to see them in action again (though there was a significant loss in this story). And Bluebeard's fight with Prince Charming is wonderful, although it sets up more shenanigans that will be shortly forthcoming.The final story \\"Barleycorn Bride\\" is different. The art is markedly different but suited the tale well enough. And again Willingham shows his remarkable chameleon writing gifts as he crafts a story that truly could have been a fairy tale.I'm loving this series. I only regret that I discovered it so late, but at least now there are a lot of graphic novels at the local library to catch up with."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"Following on from FABLES: LEGENDS IN EXILE and FABLES: ANIMAL FARM, here's the third volume compiled from the series. In it Boy Blue falls for Red Riding Hood while fighting the Adversary's minions; a stupid journalist thinks he can unmask the residents of Fabletown for the vampires he thinks they are; an evil plot has surprising consequences for Bigby Wolf and Snow White; and we find out about Barleycorn Brides.And that's just for starters. The consequences of some of the things that happen here will, as they always do in these tales, through what follows later. It also deals with the further interaction between the crazed revolutionary Goldilocks and Snow Whit, who, as we may remember from ANIMAL FARM, has a bone to pick with Goldie.The pace continues unabated, with the story-lines mostly interleaved and hanging together; though Boy Blue's adventures are 'historical' (but need to be told, so we understand what happens in the next volume: FABLES: MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS), and the Barelycorn Brides snippet appears to bear only a slight connection to anything going on in the main-line story thread. There's some serious violence and blood, plus some sex; people die; journalists get their due desserts, as does a fable, long overdue for the dispensing of justice; Bigby and Snow do some serious bonding in the wilderness.Nice pace, engaging tales and, though happy endings are far off or maybe will never come, there is a good deal of overt and suppressed romance.Full marks, as always.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP"},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This volume collects issues 11-16 of the monthly comics. The first and last issues each tell self-contained stories tangential to the main Fable world. The central two-thirds of this book moves the general story arc along with the precision of a physics lesson: as the pressures increase within this little community, the situations heat up.Prince Charming is charming only in name - his womanizing takes a notably non-mythical turn. Goldilocks still dates out of her species (not that I have anything against other species, mind you, but I'm not sure I'd want my sister to marry one). Briar Rose takes a nap. Snow White and Bigby end up on a hot date - neither has memories from it, but one has something else.The Fable mythos updates many of our childhood fairy tales, in a world of distant warfare and urban exile. If you've followed the story since volume 1 of the collections, you'll know that my plot hints say just about nothing - there's always another twist to the creativity that brings these characters to new life. The artwork doesn't blaze new trails and people looking for BamPow super heroes will find only a little, very little, to cling to. The art team is strong and competent, though, and the scripting creates characters that you really want to like (or to dislike, trust your judgement). Also - I'm not sure this is wholly a good thing - the series grows on you. I'll be back for more, and in proper story order for once in my life.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"Continuing the &quot;Fables&quot; saga, this book brings together two story arcs (one involving a &quot;Mundy&quot; reporter who thinks he's uncovered the Fables' real nature, the other throwing Snow White and Bigby Wolf together) with some shorter, one-issue stories. One is about Jack, the trickster, who gets in over his head during the Civil War after fighting for the Confederacy, and the other introduces us to &quot;Smalltown,&quot; the community of Lilliputian exiles.The stories are, as always, good, but be warned: these comics may be about fairy-tale people, but this is not meant for children---there are scenes involving nudity and other &quot;adult&quot; subjects. That said, it's quite good and well worth the money."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This volume is separated in distinct sections and stories compared to the first two. This destroyed the fluidity and made it hard to follow.When the volume started, it reminds me of Supernatural with the soul trading. I was pretty amused. And it got super intense and exciting when a reporter tried to expose the fables. I love how some of the fables characters had a heist to prevent the exposure to happen, but it felt short. To me it was a silly kind of heist, nothing that made you stop breathing. You know what everyone is going to be save and sound. But the plot was pretty interesting.I do have to say that I am not a fan of the character Snow White. Every time she appeared in the volume, it was just politics, politics, blah, blah, blah. Boring! But as the story moved on, I hated her less, perhaps it was because she became more human to me. When Snow and Mr. Wolfe was in the forest, it reminded me of Twilight mix with the action of The Hunger Game. I wanted more! I was screaming in my head to \\"run, run, run\\", and \\"awwwww\\". It definitely left me wanting to read more to see how this \\"relationship\\" turns out.I enjoyed the last section of the distinct section about SmallTown. The drawings were more cartoon than comics. It was very rustic and less defined, kind of like children's picture books. I was a little lost from the transition because I didn't understand how this story was connected to the previous one. It seemed like who ever created this volume just put this story in to fill in the space. :S But I did enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"A story focusing on the ramifications of the attack on Snow White by Goldilocks, in the main.That main arc is bookended by two stand-alone issues, one of Jack Horner and his time from the civil war, and the last is Bigby Wolf recounting a story about little Fables and the quest for barleycorn girls.The important story involves, Goldilocks, Bluebeard, Prince Charming, who is proving himself a bit of a spymaster, and a plot to have Bigby and Snow killed.Quite good again, as Fables continues to be well done, particularly as the whole fair tale character thing is not something I am disposed to like in the main, but this urban transportation of these characters is good stuff.For Big Bad Wolf fans, there is some gold awaiting."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"Unlike in the first two volumes of Fables, there is no single story arc in this one. Instead we get four tales of different lengths that help fill in the Fables world.In \\"Bag o' Bones\\" Jack the Giant Killer has allied with the South in the Civil War. Once fortunes turn against the South, Jack winds up having adventures involving the Devil, Death, and a beautiful cursed Southern Belle.In \\"a Two-Part Caper\\" a reporter contacts Bigby to let him know that he knows his secret. He has discovered the colony of immortals and is convinced that they are vampires. Bigby, with the help of Sleeping Beauty, Bluebeard, the Frog Prince, Prince Charming and Boy Blue, makes a late night raid to ensure their secret is kept.In \\"Storybook Love\\", the longest story in the collection, Bigby and Snow become targets and are removed from Fabletown, Prince Charming squares off against Bluebeard, a villain returns, unforseen repercussions arise, and Charming decides to look into running for mayor.Bigby tells The Frog Prince the story of \\"Barleycorn Bride\\" wherein John Barleycorn must help the rest of the refugee Lilliputians find brides their own size.The tales in this volume are well-done. The first and last help fill in some of the history while the middle two move the modern story along very nicely. Another very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"In the third volume of Bill Willingham's great Fables, we are treated to multiple storyarcs. Two one-shots, a two part caper, and a four part revenge story make up the plotlines of Storybook Love, which is the best volume yet.Starting with Bag of Bones, we see some things that Jack of the Tales has done to earn his trickster reputation. In an attempt to get rich, he intended to marry a southern belle and would win her over by joining the Confederates in the Civil War. Though, as we all know, the war didn't turn out the way he expected it to. After the war, he ran into a (possibly demonic) man whom he bamboozled in a card game. Using a magic sack won from the man, Jack went as far as to prevent death, with some rather, um, graphic results.In the caper story, we are introduced to Briar Rose, popularly known as Sleeping Beauty, who is still victim to the curse whenever she gets a pricked finger. When a reporter claims that he has figured out the fables' secret (he believes them to be vampires), he warns Sheriff Bigby Wolf that he is going to publish and unless they don't want any input, he had better give him an interview. Wolf refuses, and plans a scheme to discredit the journalist. Using Boy Blue, Jack, Bluebeard, Prince Charming, and Briar Rose, they knock out the entire building, using Briar Rose's curse, and proceed with their plan. The plan is nothing one would ever see in a storybook; it involves blackmail and murder threats. Wolf is ruthless to the man, and it ends with a rogue fable taking care of things his own way.Storybook Love is somewhat of a followup to Animal Farm. Goldilocks, an insane militant is still on the run from Snow White and Bigby Wolf, and it turns out that none other than Bluebeard is hiding her (for a price of course, which at the time is quite lewd). Still angry with Wolf for the way Wolf treated him in the caper, Bluebeard gives Goldilocks the means to take out Snow and Wolf. Bluebeard magically hypnotizes the pair and sends them off on a camping trip from which he thinks they will never return. After they wake up, they soon are running for their lives from Goldilocks, which is still hard for Snow White, because she is still using a cane from the incident in Animal Farm. While in the woods, Snow and Bigby are able to get to know each other better. The story ends with two great twists; one of which involves Snow White beginning to shed her image of an ice queen.Finally, in Barleycorn Bridge, Wolf tells Flycatcher the story of Smalltown, a community at the Farm. It was founded by the Liliputian army (Liliputians are the tiny people from Gulliver's Travels) after they escaped from the Adversary's armies in the Homelands. Since the army was made up of only men, they immediately realized that they had a problem; without women their size, they couldn't procreate or find love. A liliputian and his bird go on an adventure back to the Homelands to solve the problem.Fables continues its wonderful subversive nature. The stories are both humorous and horrific. Goldilocks is an insane girl who likes interspecies flings, and who, towards the end, ends up looking pretty grisly. Prince Charming is a jerk who can sway women due to his impressive looks, but becomes a bigger burden than he's worth. And Pinnochio, well his role in the story is better left unspoiled. Willingham does an excellent job of telling stories with such famous characters, but doing them with his own unique twists."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"I liked the first two volumes of \\"Fables,\\" but felt some of the characterization was a bit uneven as Willingham developed his characters and the world of Fabletown. In this volume, there is one sequence that advances the main story arc and further develops the characters of Snow White, Bigby Wolf, and Prince Charming, and three other stories which stand on their own. I felt the characters were all much more real in this volume, and the setting more solid.The main story (which advances the series' overall plot) features the return of Goldilocks, whose appearance always seems to guarantee a bloodbath, and develops the relationship between Snow White and Bigby Wolf. Bigby becomes a much more interesting character in this story, starting to become more than just a \\"Wolverine\\" knockoff. Prince Charming also takes a minor but significant role in this story, and surprisingly, also becomes much more interesting, as we see that he can be more than just a manipulative cad.One of the secondary stories is about a muckraking journalist who discovers the Fables' secret and threatens to expose them. It introduces Briar Rose, aka \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" and also stars Bigby Wolf, Prince Charming, and Bluebeard.The other two secondary stories are more traditional fairy tales that have nothing to do with the main story arc, but flesh out the characters and world of the Fables. One is set during the Civil War and stars Jack of the Tales as his usual scoundrel self. The other tells of how the Lilliputians came to our world and joined the other Fables on The Farm."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"Sometimes, authors don't know what they have. I'm sure the creators of classic fables like Little Red Riding Hood and Snow white never thought the villain of one and the protagonist of the other would ever find love, but author Bill Willingham finds a way to make it work in this intelligent and beautifully illustrated story arc.The fables, exiled from their home world, live in Manhattan and exist as a fractured community, faced with the mundane (they call normal human Mundys) and the fantastical (Beauty's Beast turning beastial in appearance whenever she's mad at him), all under the watchful and creative eye of Willingham.Reading this (or the other two excellent collections), one gets the feeling Willingham has done a lot of research into the original fables and not the Disneyized versions we have come to know. Literary buffs, academics, those who like a good laugh and anyone who wanted to know what happened after they lived happily ever after should pick this up. Beware, however, that this is not for children. Let them grow up with Disney and they'll be very entertained when they're old enough to read this."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This series is one of the better things in the comic world since the Sandman series ended and Batman storylines seem to be regressing to the \\"wam\\" \\"pow\\" era... More please Mr Willingham"},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"I really like this series. The tongue-in-cheek nature of some of the characters juxtaposed with the dead-real nature of others mixed with the fantasy of near-immportal characters from Western fables (both well-known and, now, lesser-known) living in the city of NY is a great idea. The good artwork and coloring is just an added bonus."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"In this marvelous and engaging series of funnybook stories collected here, Bigby Wolf (also known as the Big Bad) attempts to romance the ever-elusive Snow White while Prince Charming (having divorced Snow White, Briar Rose, and Cinderella) kills Bluebeard and a homicidal Goldilocks is on the lam. Throw in the Mouse Police that never sleep, the Lilliputians and Thumbelina, and a flying monkey serving temporarily as a mayor and what a fun, rollicking romp through archetypes and the collective unconsciousness. Just some of the best comics reading around, but as others have mentioned elsewhere, this isn't Disney and these aren't the sweet and sticky fairy story characters the unwitting might suspect."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"This is the third book in the Fables series. Unlike the first two books this one is comprised of four separate tales. This installment does an excellent job of filling in some background while still moving the main story along.The first installment tells about Jack the Giant killer and his love of a cursed southern belle. The second talks about Bigby Wolf dealing with a reporter who thinks he's discovered the secret of Fabletown. The third is the longest and progresses the story the furthest; this one is about Goldilocks trying to kill Snow White and Bigby. The fourth is about Jack and the Beanstalk.All of the stories are engaging and interesting. The third (Storybook Love) about Snow White and Bigby ends on a total cliffhanger that had me dying to know what would happen next. The illustration is in keeping with previous book; although the fourth story didn't have as detailed artwork as the three that came before it.This book was another engaging, humorous, and interesting set of Fabletown tales. I am absolutely hooked on this series and excited to read the 4th book, March of the Wooden Soldiers. The world continues to gain complexity and I am always surprised by the fables that pop up in the storylines. It is fun to try and figure out who is from which fable/fairy tale.Overall an excellent installment to this series. I am eager to find out what happens next. It was great to get background on some of the characters as well as have the story progress. This is definitely an adult graphic novel; there is nudity and violence. Fans of fairy tales, humorous urban fantasy, or just fantasy graphic novels in general should make sure to check out this series."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"The premise of Fables is that certain characters from fairy tales, nursery rhymes, and classic children's literature are living sub rosa in New York, either in Manhattan, if they look human, or upstate on The Farm, if they would attract undue attention in the Big Apple. Why are they in Mundania? They had to flee their respective Homelands as these were conquered by a merciless Adversary who only offers two options: surrender to die. (The Adversary's identity is revealed eventually.) But some escaped through portals.The cover of the first volume, Legends in Exile, shows Snow White in running shoes racing to catch a subway crowded with characters, including Beauty and the Beast, Bluebeard, Prince Charming, and a Flying Monkey. This first story arc is a tribute to film noir, with a humanized Big Bad Wolf as the sheriff, called on by a frantic Jack to solve the murder of his girlfriend, Rose Red. Since Rose is her estranged sister, a distraught Snow White involves herself in the investigation. The seductive but impecunious Prince Charming also shows up, which raises Bigby Wolf's hackles, because his own nostrils are wide open for Snow White.Animal Farm introduces the wilder elements, as Snow White runs for her life from an uprising of disgruntled Fables. When Reynard the Fox isn't making the moves on her, Shere Khan is trying to make a meal of her. A murderous, gun-toting Communist Goldilocks leads the rebellion.Storybook Love brings the Bigby Wolf-Snow White story arc to a crisis, while Bluebeard and Goldilocks connive to take over Fabletown.In volume four, March of the Wooden Soldiers, Fabletown is threatened with exposure by an observant journalist, and it becomes apparent that the Adversary plans to bring the war to Fabletown. The rest of the series divides between following the Snow White-Bigby Wolf saga, and the unfolding epic of the war for the Homelands, in which a most unlikely hero emerges. Along the way are background material stories, such as Mowgli's mission to win Bagheera's freedom and visit to the Arabian Nights realm to win allies in the war against the Adversary. Jack goes to Hollywood to make himself the most popular, and thereby the most powerful of all Fables. That's a funny storyline. There is considerable humor throughout, and more character development than any review can summarize. At the same time, some segments are R-rated for graphic sex and/or violence. All the stories are magnificently written by Willingham, and the many illustrators include Lan Medina, Alex Maleev, Mark Buckinham, and Steve Leiahola - who makes the Snow Queen look fine. (He did a lot of work on the X-Men in the Chris Claremont days.)This is the ongoing graphic novel series to look for when you have reread Watchmen enough times to memorize it. I simply cannot say enough good things about it. With 12 volumes in print, and more are on the way (Yes!), it is one of the treasures of comicdom."},{"Title":"Fables Vol. 3: Storybook Love","review":"I don't know why it took me this long to get on board the FABLES bandwagon. For years now, left and right, everyone's been pimping this series to me. Now, count me converted. I finally read a FABLES trade paperback, and, it turns out, everyone's right. This is some of the best reading currently being produced in comic book-dom, and I got straight-away hooked. FABLES: STORYBOOK LOVE happens to be the third volume, and is so good I just had to say stuff about it.Some background: Once upon a time, some terrible, terrible thing called the Adversary went on an all-out bloody invasion of the fairy tale kingdoms, causing now suddenly deposed magical creatures, these \\"fables,\\" to flee to far distances in search of sanctuary. The refugees escaped into our world and were able to make a home of sorts. And, so, today, in a nondescript nook of New York City sits Fabletown. Ah, but if the regular Joes only knew...And, by the way, those fairy tale creatures who couldn't pass for humans instead while their days away in a concealed place called the Farm, in upstate New York. As you may imagine, being forced to live in seclusion tends to foster unrest. SeeFables Vol. 2: Animal Farm.Even though FABLES boasts an ensemble cast, it's not surprising that the most noteworthy characters are Snow White, who is Fabletown's no-nonsense deputy mayor, and Bigby Wolf, Fabletown's reformed and resident sheriff. In fact, at the back end ofFables Vol. 1: Legends in Exile, Bill Willingham's great prose short story - which focused on the Big Bad Wolf as he was in the olden days and how he first met Snow White - not only put the finishing touch to a wonderful read, but made me start really rooting for something to blossom between these two. Anyway, with that romantic regard in mind, things kind of come to a head in this third volume.FABLES, Vol. 3: STORYBOOK LOVE reprints issues #11-18 of the series. Things start off with \\"Bag o' Bones,\\" a fun, homespun-flavored story of Jack Horner set during the Civil War era, including that time he ends up playing cards with the crafty debbil. I haven't yet checked out JACK OF FABLES, the spin-off comic, yet it's pretty evident that Jack Horner is one of those likable rogues. To quote Willingham himself: \\"Jack is basically all of the Jacks who have ever appeared in fairy tales, folklore, nursery rhymes and old folk ballads.\\" So Jack's been a busy, busy cad.Next is a two-parter. Issues #12 & 13 tell of an overly-curious journalist who, believing that Fabletown is a hotbed of vampires, plans to publish an expose. But dummy makes the mistake of telling Bigby about it. Bigby and his fable cohorts concoct a pretty clever scheme to foil the guy. A mostly lighthearted caper, with a grim ending.Then comes the meat of this volume, the four-part \\"Storybook Love.\\" Goldilocks (the villainess in FABLES Vol. 2: ANIMAL FARM) works in concert with Lord Bluebeard to once and for all get rid of Snow White and Bigby. Their shenanigans involve the ensorcelling of Snow and Bigby and sending them off into the wilds, with the notion of then murdering them. It doesn't work, and this story arc culminates in a discovery which binds Snow and Bigby closer (the particulars of which actually end up royally ticking Snow off). Plus, Lord Bluebeard and that insufferably good-looking wastrel, Prince Charming, dabble in friendly, and then not-so-friendly, fencing.Finally, in \\"Barleycorn Brides,\\" Bigby narrates to Flycatcher the origin of Smalltown's traditional rite of passage. It's cute.I wasn't too sure, going in, whether Bill Willingham would be able to pull this off, but he does, and brilliantly. He gathers all these characters - drawn from all walks of folklore and mythology - and manages to place them into one cohesive continuity. More, Willingham lends character development and a dose of realism to these fantastical elements. I've liked Willingham since back in his days with THE ELEMENTALS, and it's nice to see he hasn't lost his storytelling skills (and lest folks forget, dude can also draw). And, naturally, part of the fun is in placing the lesser known characters (Did you know that Bufkin, the flying blue monkey originates from the Oz books?). Mark Buckingham and Steve Leialoha's artwork, by the way, perfectly complements Willingham's great writing and whimsy and humor. I dig the way they draw Bigby Wolf. Not to mention, I could waste long moments staring at James Jean's expressive covers.FABLES is published under DC Comic's Vertigo label and is intended for mature audiences. These issues are laced with profanity and occasional nudity, so you maybe shouldn't hand these out to the young 'uns. But for those older types who relish urban fantasy and reading stories by Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, FABLES hits the spot. This series is marked by the unexpected, by its intrigues and grotesqueries and topsy-turvies, where the Big Bad Wolf is a hero and Goldilocks is a psychopath, and the Frog Prince is a janitor. And, for these expatriated fables, is there a happily ever after?Not if Bill Willingham has anything to say about it (and he does)."},{"Title":"Bloodless Shadow","review":"THis is a \\"first\\" for this author, and I always fear that the quality will drop over time, particularly after the publisher (and the public) start putting the pressure on to get books written. THis is a particularly well-written book, and my only hesitation in giving this 5 stars is that the lead detective is an angry, unhappy, and troubled person (not unusual in a certain genre of mysteries -- think Rankin, for example), and after a while, it got to be a bit much.Samantha (Sam) Falconer is a London-based private detective who is a retired Judo world champion. She has a bad relationship with her mother and does her best to ignore her stepfather (her father was in the SAS and killed when she was 4 -- or so she was told). Sam's gay brother, who teaches at Oxford, is the only bright spot. He refers a client to her, a psychoanalyst in Oxford whose wife has disappeared -- he is dissatisfied with police efforts and wants Sam to find out what happened to her. Meanwhile, Sam gets a note -- ostensibly from her father, saying he will be in contact with her. If that weren't enough, she's dealing with the psychologically impact of having discovered a dead child in a previous assignment. And did I mention other threatening events happening to Sam, but she's unsure who is threatening her and how dangerous they really are?Heavy stuff indeed. But this was a mystery I could hardly wait to get back to -- well plotted and well written. I only wish it had been a little less gloomy, particularly by the end. I think Europeans are less averse to books filled with existential angst than most Americans are."},{"Title":"Bloodless Shadow","review":"I picked up this book to read this afternoon and finished it a few hours later having not been able to put it down. It is a really terrific story with a very compelling lead character. Sam Falconer is a flawed heroine and extremely compelling. The mystery itself was good, but most of the drama was in Sam's life as she dealt with her ghosts. I look forward to reading Victoria Blake's next novel."},{"Title":"Bloodless Shadow","review":"I intrigued by the book originally by the fact that Sam Falconer the protagonist is a Judo champion and I train martial arts, as I got further into the book I was really impressed with the writers work."},{"Title":"Bloodless Shadow","review":"it's also pretty good.

It has gotten me hooked on mysteries and I can't wait to read Valerie Wolzien's other books. If you like mysteries, you'll love this book. The main character Susan Henshaw is great, too. The story was easy reading and it kept me on the edge of my seat...I didn't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"A Star-Spangled Murder","review":"Several years ago, after reading the first two books in this series, I swore I'd never read this author again. However, several reviews that said her later works improved made me give it another try with this book. I'm glad I didn't invest any further time or money with her.This book is pure garbage. A man is killed and no one seems to care very much. The houseguests sit around the living room making plans to go out on the town. The victim's brother decides to join them with no thought for his three small children (the victim's step-children) until his neighbor, a woman he's met about five minutes earlier, offers to take care of them. He and his wife then go about their business without a second thought, only remembering to check on the kids when Susan shows up to stick her nose into more business that isn't hers...even when their oldest child goes missing.The local &quot;police person&quot; treats Susan like her deputy, sharing case information and basically allowing her to run the investigation...even going so far as to tell others beforehand that they should answer any questions Susan asks them, whatever they may be.The ending was so confusing that after reading it twice, I still have no idea where half of this stuff came from. And that's one of the biggest problems I had with this author the first time around -- she keeps &quot;secrets,&quot; only throwing out information when she's trying to wrap things up. Susan finds something on the floor that turns out to be a clue...but we don't find out until after the mystery is solved what this item was. She goes to talk to people who're only identified as &quot;the woman Susan went to talk to.&quot; People who've never met her before confide things to her like she's their best friend. It's totally unbelievable.Add all this to the fact that Susan is a totally unlikeable character, and there's nothing redeeming about this book, or this series, at all."},{"Title":"A Star-Spangled Murder","review":"Bookflap Description- Susan Henshaw and her family have been coming to their summerhouse in Maine for years, but when neighbor Humphrey Taylor is found bludgeoned to death in her living room, Susan's relaxing holiday goes out with the tide...Somebody in the small town committed murder-and in between making potatoe salad, watching the July 4th parade, and dodging firecrackers, Susan means to find out who.Susan and her friend, Kathleen, arrive at her summer home in Maine before the rest of the family comes up. Upon reaching her house, she finds some odd things. The gate at her driveway is locked, the shutters are only half taken down, the house isn't prepared, and the boathouse is still completely shut even though she hired a new caretaker who was to be sure that the house was ready for Susan. Since they arrived late Susan and Kathleen decide to just go to bed, but morning will begin their July 4th troubles.They wake up to find a dead body in one of the living room chairs that is still covered. The victim is Humphrey Taylor, the new husband of Susan's neighbor Tricia Taylor. From then on Susan is on the case trying to figure out who the murderer is who left a body in her home.I found the whole plot from there very odd. Kathleen and Susan are helping the police chief solve the mystery and do most of the work while Janet, the chief, does little to nothing. Susan and Kathleen tell Tricia that her husband is dead. Shouldn't the police do that? Then Tricia's 3 daughters are sent to Susan's house to be taken care of when Susan is a complete stranger to the Taylors. The oldest of the 3 daughters, Titania, then leaves a not saying she is hiding and for Susan to watch her dog. The police start a search party but her parents aren't even mentioned in this part of the plot. Wouldn't parents want to be involved if their child had gone missing?? The plot is absurd and it was hard to maintain my suspension of disbelief for long. As I read, I just kept asking myself WTH is going on? Where are the parents and police? Why is no one but Susan and Kathleen doing anything? It was all very frustrating! I will admit that I have never read this author before and maybe the plot would make more sense if I had read books earlier in the series but going on just what I read, this was not such a good plot.The writing syle itself was very confusing. It seemed to jump around a bit and there were a lot of non-sequitors. I found myself having to re-read several paragraphs because I didn't understand what was going on or what was said. This is never a problem for me when I am reading a cozy mystery. I am surprised that the style was so sloppy when the series seems to be so popular. However, I have never read the series and maybe I would feel differently if I read it from the beginning of the series.The characters themselves were good. The main character was developed well enough for a first time reader to understand what kind of person Susan is and the rest of the characters were new and nicely developed. A few of the side characters added some humor and a little bit of depth to the story but most of them were really not needed.The conclusion was completely confusing. How Susan came to all of her conclusions was absolutely unknown to me. There were very few clues left for the reader to figure it out. The solution to the crime was very complex. I read the ending twice to make sure that I understood. Basically, for a cozy mystery, this took way to much work for me to read. When I read a cozy, I think of a nice, quick, easy, funny read. This just had too much. It seemed that the author tried too hard or didn't really have her story straight in her head and just wrote randomly. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone really and I only read it because it matched a challenge for a book club. I don't think I will continue with this series. 2 stars."},{"Title":"A Star-Spangled Murder","review":"A good read and an enjoyable entry in the Susan Henshaw series, but not worth the $15.00 price being charged here."},{"Title":"A Star-Spangled Murder","review":"Susan Henshaw and her friend Kathleen Gordon decide to spend their 4th of July at Susan's summer house in Maine.

I've ordered a new copy and can't wait until it arrives. K&amp;M will retain a place of honor on my software shelf (far away from the chair)! I just hope I can get the spare time to really enjpy it soon!"},{"Title":"Knights and Merchants","review":"I love Real-time strategy. I read mixed reviews on this game and thought it sounded interesting and worth spending a few hours on.There are some wonderful elments, including:1. I love the inter-connectivity of the buildings in the city. I love the dependence of one good to produce another, then another, and so forth. (Example: To build a bowman you need a suit of leather armor, a longbow, and a recruit. To get the recruit, you train him in the schoolhouse for 1 gold. To get a gold, you need a metallurgist to produce it from gold ore and coal ore, which come from a gold mine and a coal mine, respectively. For the longbow, you need two timbers, which comes when a sawmill takes the raw timber from a woodcutter's shack and cuts it. Leather armor has similar requirements from different buildings working together). Everything is very interconnected and very fun.2. The graphics are very fun (and funny) to watch the townmembers doing their jobs. The sound is really neat as well, as you can hear everything happening when your screen is looking at the town (houses being built, horses in the stables, anvils being struck, trees being chopped down, etc) and it gets softer as you move your field of vision outward. It gives it a very active and immersive feel when you are in the town and when you look elsewhwere it feels like you are leaving to go into the woods! Very well done on both graphics and sound.3. Very addictive when you first start playing it. The town-building is thoroughly entertaining and keeps you involved for a pretty good stretch of time.And now for the things that make it a 2 instead of a 4 or 5:1. Combat control is not good. It is hard to get your units to attack, as they will walk around randomly after you have instructed them to attack an enemy and often the enemy kills your soldier while he is walking around for no apparent reason. The AI on units is awful! Sometimes your soldiers attack enemy units who approach and sometimes they will allow the enemy to walk up to them, past them, even fight them without attacking back! Too often you click for your unit to attack and they do nothing. Once your units are involved in attacking, you cannot bring them back. This is bad if you realize the enemy force is too big, they have a tactical advantage, etc. Once you click on attack, your units are committed to be there until they are dead or they have killed the enemy squad. This makes it difficult to change tactics once you have engaged. Very frustrating.The combat element of the game in the weakest part of the game, and unfortunately critical in solving every mission I played.EXAMPLE from my own experience in the game that illustrates many of the problems:During one mission, I had an enemy archer standing in the middle of my town, IN THE MIDDLE OF A SQAUD OF MY OWN ARCHERS, shooting my units while nobody attacked him. I did not see the archer sneak in to town, and my own archers did not shoot him when he approached. The enemy archer walked past a solid line of my archers, to the point that my archers moved to let him through, and started shooting at my townspeople. The only way I became aware of it is because I checked on the tannery and found an enemy archers in town shooting away. When I noticed him, I ordered my archers to attack him and they shifted positions around him but did not fire on him. Thinking it was a range issue, I moved the units away and ordered them to attack. My squad moved back around the enemy archer and continued to do nothing. I could not control my townspeople to keep them away and they continued to die while the archer kept shooting them! I created another archer in the barracks, moved him down to the enemy, and this archer shot the bad guy! Very frustrating lack of combat control and a very frustrating example (of many) of why it made the game frustrating.3. Some elements of the game are just too slow and you will almost assuredly find yourself waiting for periods of time. If I want to build a new building, I need to build the road first, which means I lay out where the road goes, then wait for serfs to brings stones to the laborers to complete the road. If you lay out three different buildings, you need to build three different roads to the buildings, and ALL UNFINISHED ROADS MUST BE COMPLETED before laborers will start work on buildings. Too often you are waiting for a road to be finished before you can do anything else. You have no control over townspeople either. I cannot manually tell a serf to bring gold to the schoolhouse if needed. Instead, I have to wait until that comes up on their queue of tasks. Once you start to get a large city, you will find yourself waiting for serfs more than anything else. Even if you have an excess of serfs, you will wait for them to complete tasks for 5-10 minutes sometimes. Very frustrating.4. Did I mention how poor the AI is? The enemy would not be difficult to defeat in battle because of the poor AI, except for the poor combat control mentioned above.BOTTOM LINE: The game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL, but a few elements made it just too frustrating for me. THe town building section is super fun, and the game would be a 5 if combat wasn't required. Since combat is integral to the game, it brings the overall score down and makes the flaws in the town stand out."},{"Title":"Knights and Merchants","review":"Well, I first found this game about 2 years ago, and it's such a fun and yet aggravating game to play. Be forewarned, do NOT attempt to play this game unless you have several hours of free time available, preferably multiple blocks of several hours of free time. The game is so completely absorbing that six hours can disappear without you ever realizing it. You play several scenarios, each one adding in new units and new buildings, so you can slowly develop your use of these items. Unfortunately, the opposition seems to have access to all of these items right from the start, so sometimes things feel a little lopsided. But if you're clever and pay attention, you can prevail.My only complaint is that everything depends on your serfs doing what they're supposed to do, and they seem to have the collective IQ of a box of rocks. I don't know how many hours I've spent literally screaming at my computer (like they can hear me... duh!) because something is going wrong because the serfs are off doing something completely stupid instead of what I want them to be doing.Altogether an incredible game, and I hope that eventually there will be a sequel."},{"Title":"Knights and Merchants","review":"This is one of the best games I've played. Besides the fact that it is very realistic when it comes to food production and building it is very funny just to see the small workers do thier job. Compared to Warcraft and Starcraft this is outstanding in this sector. When it comes to battle there are some thing that could be changed. The strategic is great, pikemen shuold only attack knights and so on, but feeding the troops not the better part of this game. If youre planning a big attack, which is very fun to plan, with 100 - 150 soldiers, it is hard, not to say impossible, to get food to the troops before the attack and run the village at the same time. But I can live with it. I have completed all the 20 missions twice, so it is possible to do attacks in spite of this. The key is just to fill your barrack with recruits and weapons and then train all the soldiers in a matter of minutes. Then you might not have to feed them at all before the attack. Now, back to the subjekt; This is a really good game and I'm looking for Knights and Merchants II. (If there already is such game please mail me and tell me where to find it)!!!"},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"I read all the Nevil Shute oeuvre more than fifty years ago, but his writing is just as fresh and compelling today. The tension of an epic journey through wartime France, with a growing collection of chance-met children in danger, is maintained throughout, with thoroughly believable characters and a constant excitement of scene and incident. This really is a classic of the period."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"Pied Piper is one of Nevil Shute's greatest novels. He is a master storyteller. I am widely-read, and he will always be my very favorite author. Shute takes \\"ordinary people,\\" who you wouldn't give a second thought to if you passed them on the street or even exchanged pleasantries with, and reveals the remarkable substance of their lives (and by extension everyone's.) He is best-known for On the Beach, although in my opinion A Town Like Alice, once titled The Legacy, is his greatest epic tale. I have read all of Mr. Shute's books and have never been disappointed. Unfortunately, they are not easy to find. Do yourself a favor and read Pied Piper. You may well find Nevil Shute to be YOUR all-time favorite author for the very best of reasons."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"I read this book in high school in the 70's and enjoyed the book. Recently saw another book by Nevil Shute and decided to reread this exciting book.The book takes place on the brink of WWII in France and is strongly flavored with period langage and geography. It was a fast read and I just wanted to keep reading just to know where the adventure was going to lead.I have already loaned the book to one person and two more are waiting to read it.It was good to read an older treasure."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"I have lost count of how many times I've read this story in the past 40 years. It makes me cry, every time. A perfectly crafted story, it pulls on your heart strings with the simplistic and honest representations of grief as experienced by the children and an old man caught up in war. It draws the reader into their daily dilemmas, juxtaposing the simple routines of children to the horror of being a refuge of war where there is obviously only one right, if costly, decision to be made - day after day. This was exactly Shute's intent. Although released in 1942, the Pied Piper's target audience was the USA. The purpose was to encourage the USA to join the Allies, to make the right decision for the children."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"So glad I read this one. I'd been looking forward to it for a long time and it didn't disappoint. Time and patience have their own roles in this story. Patience is rewarded, time keeps marching on and taking time to hear a story is rewarded best of all."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"This isn't really a World War II story, but a story about people. A very good read, hard to find in vintage editions, a bargain from Vintage Classics with a very attractive cover."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"This is a very well written story that shows how amidst war and destruction there are still people who can keep their humanity. The author also demonstrates that advanced age is no barrier to good deeds and perilous undertakings."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"It always amazes me how Shute can pack so much detail about characters in so short a book. He is a wonderful story teller because I am still thinking of this (and many of his other) book three years after reading it."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"The author takes a commonplace occurance - an old man on vacation in Switzerland - and walks the reader through war-torn Europe. The basic premise that an old man can rescue so many children and do so unintentionally is an amazing mechanism for a tension-filled plot. This book should be re-published"},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"G'day - Pied Piper, or any other book written by Neville Shue would make it into my top 10! Neville Shute would have to be one of the most influential Australian writers during the fourties and fifties. Works such as &quot;On The Beach&quot;, a great story of the end of the world which was later made in a Hollywood film starring Ava Gardiner. Pied Piper, Trustee From The Tool Room, In The Wet, A Town Like Alice, Marazan, So Distained, Requiem For A WREN and Beyond The Black Stump are but some examples of Shute's superior and refreshingly simple story telling technique - Cheers, Dave Aikman"},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"SO pleased that Shute's work is now available on Kindle.This is one of my favorite books by this author. An older Englishman is caught in France in WWII just as the Germans invade, and ends up rescuing several children while trying to get out. This is a tale of quiet actions, heroism through perseverance and endurance, not violent dramatics. This grandfather - as with so many of Shute's fabulous characters - does the amazing, while thinking that anyone else would do the same.Two things were especially noteworthy: First, an American author probably would have romaticized the children more. Secondly, I found the psychology employed by the Germans when dealing with the French citizens at the time of the invasion very interesting. It was an aspect I had never read before.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"Pied Piper offers relief from what I find are increasingly monotonous contemporary novels. Tired of ostentatious similes, twenty to a page? Not in the mood for multiple voices, all ending up sounding the same? Hoping to see children portrayed as children, not disguised adults only designed to prove the writer's dexterity? This novel, written clearly and elegantly, is for you. If for once we have a historical novel about WWII that rings true, it is because it was written during WWII, 1942 specifically.Shute's classic takes an English pensioner on a fishing holiday in France in 1940 and has him struggle his way back through the defeated country. To make things more difficult, the old gentleman, Howard, finds himself responsible for a disparate group of young children, all victims to the exodus: the panicked, mass flight from the advancing German armies that took place in May and June of that year. By train, by bus, on foot, forced to the slow pace their respective ages dictate, Howard and his wards become increasingly desperate to make it to the coast. Yes, this is propaganda literature: what else could it be at the date of writing? But it is subtle and human propaganda, eschewing for example the stereotypes of German brute and traitorous French. This is an honest novel, able to portray the drama of war without resorting to violence and gore. It is also a deeply felt book, full of understated emotion. The tale, following an old-fashioned narrative format, is told from a London club two years later, so that one knows from the outset that our protagonist will escape, and yet the story needs no cheap thrills to engross its reader until the end. Pier Piper well deserves having been put back in print.One last comment. I would have given the book five stars were it not for a surprising historical mistake, on page 221. This mentions the government of Vichy, which is contrasted with Gaullism. The problem is that the action takes place in June, and the French government only decided to move to Vichy on 1 July 1940. Also there was little chance for the novel's heroine to speak of de Gaulle at this point - having noted neither his famous June 18 appeal or Petain's earlier declaration of an armistice - let alone a yet inexistent political current known as Gaullism. Nevertheless, the novel is good at describing, so far as I can tell based on books and documentaries, the chaotic physical and psychological condition of France in the defeat."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"My aunt gave this book to me as a gift following one of her trips to England in the late '70s or early '80s. At the time, the only book by Nevil Shute I had read was \\"On the Beach,\\" so I certainly wasn't expecting this highly enjoyable WWII novel with an interesting twist. No armies dueling it out in this book--instead, an old man with a heart condition trying to lead an ever-growing group of children to safety in England, with little or no assistance. That book has been read to tatters now, but my more-than-dog-eared copy will have to do unless an audio edition is released, and I'll surely read the damaged edition a few more times. The characters are every bit as memorable as the ones in \\"On the Beach,\\" and this book has only a few depressing moments, when the resourceful old fellow in charge appears on the verge of playing out."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"Pied Piper was made into one of my favorite movies. The book is just as good. An elderly fisherman who has lost his son becomes an escort for a group of Jewish children in France just before the war. It is a simple gentle tale I enjoyed 50 years ago and still enjoy reading to my middle school class. Heroes during the war were often unlikely people and this is the tale of one of them. It was Shutes second best book after A Town like Alice to me. Buy and enjoy"},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"I enjoyed this Nevil Shute novel about as well as I have all his other books I've read. I've read a majority of his novels, and these all have had rich and interesting characters. I enjoyed Pied Piper, and my personal favorite is Trustee From the Toolroom. If you're a reader and you haven't read any of his work, you owe it to yourself to dive right in. Other than an English idiom or two that may take a second or two to digest, I predict you'll enjoy Shute's stories, characters, and writing style."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"I have been a Nevil Shute fan for a long time.

In the last two years I have read most of his other ~20 books - very hard to find. I am considering republishing some of them in my small press.

By the time his adventures are through he has a dozen children that he is taking to England, including an SS officer's son. Riveting! (Recently published in paperback in Europe).

I have searched for &quot;Sliderule&quot; his autobiography and cannot find it."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"In college I went to a used book store to buy Shute's &quot;On the Beach&quot;. They didn't have it, so I bought &quot;Pied Piper&quot; as a consolation. I've read it three times since. Tremendous novel. An aeronautical engineer by training, Shute was a gifted storyteller and writer. Piper is well paced, has many stories within the story of bringing the children back to England - a man coping with old age, feelings of uselessness, the loss of a son; the formation of a deep friendship with the woman his son left behind, and so forth. Shute hits on the timeless themes of courage, fortitude, self-sacrifice, forgiveness etc. without ever coming close to being maudlin. There are no unnecessary speeches from men standing on a hilltop talking about &quot;what it's all for&quot;. As John Howard says, while in custody, to the German officer who tells him he must be a very brave man, &quot;No, not a brave man. Just a very old one.&quot;For the record, I think it was made into a movie twice. Once with Monty Wooley playing Howard and then again for television - mid eighties, perhaps - with Peter O'Toole playing the role. Still, as the story is so marvelous, it should be done again for the big screen. Considering Anthony Hopkins's performance in &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (which was superior to the entertaining but far less nuanced Hannibal Lecter), I think he would be perfect to play Howard, putting the perfect cap on his career."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"Nevil Shute describes the surroundings and characters with such detail it is hard not to see exactly what he wants the reader to imagine. Unlike any other book I have read, I was entranced. I have always been intriqued by stories about WWII, and this is a good one. When elderly Englishman takes a holiday in France trying to get over his sons death, he finds himself the leader of a band of children trying to escape the German invasion.I was amazed that the movie has not been put on VHS or DVD. The movie follows the book fairly closely. Monty Woolley plays the elderly man, and Roddy McDowall and Anne Baxter play two of the children. Otto Preminger is a German Major. Made in 1942 it is both dramatic and comedic. I highly recommend you try to catch it on TV."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"Nevil Shute's love of humanity and storytelling ability are displayed at their best in this deceptively slow-starting tale of escape from the Nazis in early World War II. An elderly Englishman becomes the improbable -- but utterly believable -- guardian of a group of children trying to reach England from France ahead of the advancing Germans.There are no wild action scenes, no gunshots in the night, none of the trappings of the contemporary suspense novel. But there is tension in large doses as Shute draws the reader in to his tale with careful portraits of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they simply have no choice. Even minor characters come alive with Shute's vivid writing. All in all, this is one of the most satisfying books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"I was so taken by the humanity and love shown by the old man in Pied Piper. He accepted the children as they came--his own kin, the urchins, the abandoned German child... I also liked the realism in the book. War was horrible. It struck the good, the bad, guilty and innocent. The grandfather figure did his best to shield the children from unnecessarily awful realities and explained those he couldn't.You should read this. I hope they reprint, but if not, your local library will have it."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"Nevil Shute wrote stories about regular people thrown into extraordinary circumstances. He doesn't seem to attract much attention in college literature classes, perhaps because he writes about ordinary people. It's a shame because every book of Shute's is a great read. His characters will remain with you long after you've read the book. This tale of a grieving father who became a true hero is one of his best."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"I first read this book as a child when, identifying with the children who could have been my compeers, I saw the movie at least five times. I loved the book then, and I love it now. The story is simply told, from the point of view of an elderly Englishman, whom we first meet in his London club during the Blitz. Too exhausted to move to a shelter, he begins to tell his tale to a stranger, who has also decided to sit out the raid, while the Luftwaffe's incendiary bombs fall closer and closer. The old man's story unfolds slowly as tells of a fishing holiday in the Jura--the mountains that border France and Switzerland--in the early months of 1939. The story may, in fact, unfold a bit too slowly for some modern readers who have been exposed to the terse squibs that proliferate novels nowadays, but Nevil Shute is such a skillful storyteller that he draws the reader almost unawares into the narrative, rather in the manner of an expert angler reeling in his fish.Even though I know the story well, I could not put the book down until the very end. I was, after all these years, inextricably hooked."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"Neville Shute is a master of flashback. Who would think that this old man - who didn't even speak French -was capable of herding a dozen children out of wartime Europe? The author draws the reader into his story slowly, making this near-implausible adventure all the more believable by its every-day storytelling. The only recent novelist who comes close to this unique style is Mark Halprin, in his &quot;Soldier of the Great War&quot;. Reading Shute reminded me of the paucity of really great story tellers among popular novelists."},{"Title":"Pied Piper","review":"&quot;The Pied Piper&quot; is a gripping and human story of evacuation of lost children during WW II. I am surprised that Amazon.com does not have more Neville Shut books. There are a number in print in Europe. He is of course famous for &quot;On the Beach&quot; (book and movie) and &quot;Town Like Alice&quot; (book and TV Movie). These books led me to Pied Piper and many other Neville Shute Norway books in the last few years. I believe they would sell very well today.

Shares with many other novels the preposterous notion that some Nazis were humane and thoughtful (I'm thinking of Steinbeck's &quot;The Moon is Down&quot; for one), but I don't hold that against the work. We would all do exactly the same things the old man did to save the children, so there develops a great sympathy for him during the course of the reading. And the book is squeaky clean, one that provides some welcome relief from the current onslaught of, say, two females having sex in the toilet stall in &quot;Bright Lights, Big City.&quot; We're way far away from that here.

Trying to incorporate beans into my diet for health reasons, I was tired of the same old recipes again and again. This book was one of the better that I ordered. I only give it 4 stars because there are no pictures. However, what impressed me was that most of the recipes are low fat. Also, there is a great diversity of ideas, including soups, appetizers, dips, salads, main dishes, side dishes, etc. One is not limited to eating beans only as a main course. It also does not limit the recipes to dishes made exclusively of beans, but dishes that include beans.I recommend it to anyone who is just trying to eat healthier, vegetarians who must eat beans for protein or those who just enjoy the flavor and texture of beans."},{"Title":"The Instant Bean","review":"I agree with the other reviewer, pictures would have been great. Other than that, it is a great book. I borrowed this from the library, thinking I could copy down a recipe or two, but liked so many I decided to purchase it on amazon. I was well worth it! There is a section where it talks about the health benefits of beans, and I think it is something everyone should read. As a former nurse, I saw too many people try to change health issues with pills before even trying to change their diet. Beans are cheap and easy to make, and great for you. Sometimes, changing your diet for the better doesn't mean staying away from certain foods, sometimes it means adding in something new! This book has so many recipes, its easy. The sandwich spreads are great, I make them and use it 50/50 with mayo when making sandwiches for the kids(baby steps!) The soups are really good, too. With my own cream based soup recipes,I have started using pureed cannelini beans with a bit of cream, rather than all cream, and it works great. Get this book and it will inspire you to use beans in everyday cooking instead of just using them in chili."},{"Title":"The Circus Stealers","review":"This one is far from Keeler's best, but also fairly far from his worst. He did not expect it could ever be published in English, as a 1960 letter (reproduced) indicates... it was assembled entirely for a Spanish-market edition.There is no murder mystery to be solved, and almost no suspense. The only \\"mystery\\" that Keeler continually brings up is the method devised by the wicked circus magician, DiValo, to prevent circus owner MacWhorter from sending back husky employees to find and rescue driver Rance Holly if he and his new circus wagon do not turn up before a certain moment... a method not revealed until about 115 pages in. Otherwise there is little or no suspense, and no action or event to keep the reader reading. Suspense does build up when a collection of local vultures shows up with evil intent, set on by rival circus owner Wolf Gladish, who hopes to use a preposterous legal/financial snaffle MacWhorter has gotten himself into in order to seize the circus.Needless to say, our hero Rance eludes the trap set up by DiValo, and makes a spectacular arrival with the funds needed to save the circus' bacon once again... this situation is the standard overarching plot device in the circus series.Dropped dead into the midst of the novel is an awful short story, \\"Spangles,\\" by Keeler's wife Hazel. It can be skipped since it is totally disconnected in all ways from the novel that surrounds it.At about 163 pages this is a fairly slender and insubstantial Keeler work, but it does show a bit of the hard-core craziness that is Harry's trademark."},{"Title":"The Girl in the Moon Circle","review":"Fiction from the Pacific Islands is not widely known, as indeed most of the islands are not widely known. Many Pacific works retain the feel of oral accounts (as would be expected from previously non-literate societies) rather than pieces of prepared written fiction and this adds to their appeal and authenticity. The Girl in the Moon Circle, for example, is Samoa observed through the eyes of 10 year old Samoana intercalated with Polynesian legends and poems and littered with un-translated Samoan phrases. There is no coherent structure or recognisable plot. Although the narrator is a child, the language appropriately minimalist, and many of the observations typically those of a young girl - having TV for the first time, church, friends and family, crushes on boys - she also strays into a number of themes that are distinctly adult: incest, alcohol and domestic violence, adults interfering with children, children having children, and many of the unsavoury scourges of Polynesian (and other) societies. The fact that they are related with a wide-eyed innocence makes them all the more disturbing. This book is a compelling and frank (because it is a 10 year old narrating) look at a conservative society in transition by a member of the generation that will experience the greatest changes.Although the story is followed by an interview with the author, it could however have done with a glossary. I was able to guess a few of the words because I have some knowledge of Tahitian, a distantly-related Polynesian language, but endless incomprehensible phrases serve only to give the reader an unhappy feeling of exclusion."},{"Title":"The Girl in the Moon Circle","review":"Short writings that tell the experiences of a Samoan girls,that Pacifc life isn't all what it seems. read where we once belonged next."},{"Title":"The Girl in the Moon Circle","review":"Although this book is about a 10 year old Samoan girl the subjects the author explores are adult. The book is dark and deals with sexual issues and family violence. I'm not saying the book is without merit. It would surely have a place when studying modern polynesian cultures as an adult, but I think buyers should know that it is inappropriate for children."},{"Title":"The physics and chemistry of surfaces,","review":"Very good book.

As the author said, if someone killed a cat by feeding it nothing but lettuce due to ignorance, people would be shocked and angry. It happens to fish all the time.

I found it particularly useful for answering very basic questions such as exactly how do you get a new aquarium to cycle and how do you know when it has completed a cycle. I also found the information extremely easy to follow (good illustrations and diagrams). The one drawback would be in the how to treat diseases section. The book does generally describe basic treatments but isn't detailed enough. For instance, my betta had fin rot and the book listed a saline bath as a possible treament. But there were no instructions on how to make a saline bath.

Unfortunately for her, the hit man believes in her alleged powers and,fearing that her next vision might lead to his conviction, takes steps to see that there is no next vision. In the second novelette, a stage hypnotist regularly seduces his therapy patients by depicting himself as their husband or lover in a past life. And he gets away with it, for a while. Americans might have a problem with the concept o a stage hypnotist becoming a superstar. But it has happened in other countries such as Australia and Canada, in which the author toured with three such concert hypnotists."},{"Title":"HP-11C (Calculator) Owner's Handbook and Problem Solving Guide","review":"After many years of owning my calculator, my book was a bound version and began to fall apart.

Later I found out that the local salesperson had cheated me, by telling me that a CD version was not available. Actually, the CD version is much cheaper, almost 1/20th the price, and easier to use. However, you don't get the same sense of satisfaction from the CD version.These books are beautifully crafted (I have an edition bound in leather, and edged in gold) and are a joy to behold and refer to. They take up a lot of shelf space though, and it's a bit cumbersome to locate information, especially now that we are all so used to clicking across an ocean of cross-references. Nevertheless, there is a special charm to rummaging through these books, and I have spent many leisurely afternoons flipping through them. I have also picked up many useful items of information at times, for use in my work. The illustrations, and drawings are simply superb. The entries are written with a nice flow, neither too technical, nor too verbose. However, you must keep in mind that this product is primarily designed for school students, and may not be useful for any serious work.The only worries that I have are about the reliability of information. For instance, I found that a river in Arunachal Pradesh (India) has been named wrongly, and the people of the region do not recognise the name at all. Similarly, in the entry related to Lord Shri Ram, worshipped by millions of Hindus, there is no mention that he is viewed as divinity by Hindus. This obviously raises doubts whether information related to other cultures or topics is also erroneous.This kind of errors could be on account of the selection of biased writers (I saw Mr. K.N. Pannikar on the advisory board), or it could be on account of simple errors that anyone could make. Unfortunately, the problem is compounded by the non-responsive attitude of World Book editors. For instance, I wrote to them a couple of time on e-mail, pointing out these discrepancies, but there was no response.Overall, a beautifully crafted product, one that you will love to own. I only wish that the information in between the binding was as reliable as the binding itself!"},{"Title":"The Turning Tide","review":"A large portion of the book has limited shelf life, i.e., he expresses deep disappointment in the election of Bill Clinton (in his FIRST term) and strongly implies that he will be defeated in the next election.

What makes it so are two things: detail and duality. The book works on two levels, with one level being a very realistically drawn portrait of the lives of the shepherds of England's Yorkshire dales, and the other being a interlocking tale of two men, one good and the other evil, and their dogs, also good and evil, respectively.What really kicks this story up a notch from the usual dog story is the depth of the good-and-evil theme, with the point being that in even the best of men there are weaknesses, and that in even the worst of men there are strengths.A thinking man's dog story, and a parable of tolerance far ahead of its time.Note: The dialogue is written in the vernacular of the place and time (late nineteenth century England), and is not always easy to wade through. It's well worth doing so, however."},{"Title":"Bob Son of Battle","review":"I've read all of the usual classic dog stories, ie, Lassie Come Home,Call of the Wild (a personal favorite), White Fang and most of the Albert Payson Terhune books (Lad, A Dog etc). As you may surmise, dogs have been a close part of my life (for over 60 years). I saw the movie (Thunder in the Valley) based on this book, Bob, Son of Battle in 1947 when it was first released. The movie struck home because of the theme which roughly paralled this book and I never forgot it. I had the book in my library as a young boy and tried to read it several times but could not wade thru or understand some of the dialect so I never finished it then. I recently obtained a copy of the book and can say that this is one of the very best novels I have read. It is more than a tale of two men and their shepherd dogs or good vs. evil. The character of Adam MacAdam is more than that of a mean (or even evil) man. The description of MacAdam as he says goodbye to his dying wife will show that. And later in life, his soliloquoy to his fellow shepherders about his loneliness, the alienation from his son, his isolation, the loss of the coveted Dalesman cup etc. gives some insight to his feelings. The very last sentence of the the last page of the book stopped me in my tracks."},{"Title":"Bob Son of Battle","review":"Bob, Son of Battle is an old-fashioned tale, very enjoyable on a literal level, that rises to nearly epic proportions when examined as a character study. A story of shepherds and their dogs in northern England in the late nineteenth century, this book paints a fine portrait of faithful, skillful Bob and his gentle master, James Moore, but where the author truly shines is in his portrayal of Moore's and Bob's antagonists, the crotchety Adam M'Adam and his evil-tempered Red Wull. A book worth reading for its portrait of a century-old culture; of sheepdogs, their work, and the thrilling annual quest for the Dale Cup; and of a pitiful old man who is more complex than he at first seems."},{"Title":"Bob Son of Battle","review":"I love any book about dogs and have read pretty much anything I could find. I grew up reading the Terhune \\"Lad\\" series, Lassie, etc. and later I got involved in the Project Gutenberg project and started looking for dog books that were in the public domain that could be included, including some early Terhune books,Beautiful Joe,Greyfriars Bobby, etc. That's how I cam across Bob, Son of Battle. I was put off at first by the English dialect that it is written in, but soon became engrossed in what I soon realized was not so much a dog story, as one about a man and the failed relationship with his son. It is one of the best books I've read that explores the complexity of personality and how there is good and bad in all of us, but how easily things can unbalance to the wrong side. How difficult it can be sometimes for parents and children to communicate well. There are scenes in this book that really stay with you for the emotional impact they have.

You'll like it.&quot; I perused the cover, emblazoned with some fairly typical sci-fi soldier, and, humoring him, asked what it was about.&quot;It's about soldiers,&quot; he said. &quot;They fight, then they have sex, then they do drugs, then they fight some more.&quot; Encouraging. Nonetheless, I accepted the book and read it. In short, War Games, by Karl Hansen and Kenneth Paul Rogers, is one of the most lurid, powerful works of science fiction I have ever read, a mutant cross between Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, with a solid dose of S&amp;M and narcotics abuse thrown in for good measure.The 1981 novel was followed four years later by Dream Games, which was written by Hansen alone. War Games is far superior to Dream Games as a military science fiction novel. However, the latter book explores the workings of Hansen's universe in greater depth and provides answers to questions posed in the earlier work. Dream Games ends with a separatist invasion armada ringing Earth and preparing to launch a crushing attack -- bleak yes, but also inviting a sequel. A sequel that to date has not been forthcoming.From a gaming point of view, especially that of role-playing, Hansen's books are ideal in that throughout them they describe a broad variety of weapons, armor, equipment, augmentations, and genetically manufactured races, and clearly delineate the socio-political and military environments his protagonists inhabit. Of course, the books are damned from a role-playing point of view, in that many parents would undoubtedly become upset if they knew just what sort of books their kid's new game was based on. (Remember all the flak D&amp;D has gotten, especially in the '80s?) Nonetheless, those of us who have both read Hansen and played TSR's Star Frontiers cannot fail to notice uncanny similarities between the arsenals of the books and the game.Since reading War Games and Dream Games, I have continued to search for other works by Karl Hansen, but from what I can tell he only wrote those two. I have always wondered what happened to him, and sometimes entertain the notion that the righteous citizens of whatever town he lived in decided that burning him in effigy just wouldn't be good enough ... To my knowledge, the only other thing Kenneth Paul Rogers has written is some true crime book (which I have not read) about a convicted rapist-murderer. Maybe that would shed some light on the whole Hansen-Rogers disappearing act. And maybe I don't want to know.--By Michael J.

Cynthia Copeland Lewis' writing style is very clear and direct, making it an enjoyable and easy read. The information inside is very to-the-point for first time mothers, especially if you're afraid or unsure of how life will change once that baby comes into your life.What really sets this book apart from so many others I've read is that it's focus is not on the baby, but rather on YOU, the new mother. Ms. Lewis writes with great sincerity and understanding about how your life will change, about your relationships with others, including your husband.

The author did an excellent job of holding my interest in a morbid subject, I'll admit I'm hooked on true crime, but this is surprisingly good. Some tc books are dull dry, and boring but not this one. It's more like a fictional thriller but the sad fact is it's true. It was published in 1990, and I got on the 'net to see what happened to this innocent faced young man who harbored a horrible compulsion to mutilate children before he graduated to murder. It's been almost 20 years since he committed his gruesome crimes and I won't tell you the ending but I highly reccomend it to true crime buffs."},{"Title":"A Need to Kill: Final Justice","review":"A review of A NEED TO KILL (ANTK) by Mark Pettit:In 1983 in a period of three months in Bellevue, NE, a mentally ill 20 year old serviceman named John Joubert abducted and killed two boys, Danny Joe Eberle, age 13, and Chris Walden, age 12. As a child Joubert was small and weak and an outcast. He was confused about his sexuality and may never have had sexual relations with anyone. His killing of these boys, as well as of another boy in Maine, was obviously the result of his repressed homosexuality, though it is not clear that Joubert was fully aware of it.What IS clear is that anyone who is even remotely interested in a compelling and well written book will stay far far away from ANTK.The book states that Mark Petit, a TV newsman, spent 3 years investigating Joubert's crimes and that the investigation included 6 interviews with Joubert. Well, I'm here to tell you that, from a literary point of view, those were 3 years wasted. ANTK is mercifully less than 200 pages long, but only 40 or so of those pages actually have anything to do with Joubert, and only about 25 of those deal with what might have been actually interesting information about how Joubert became what he was.What the reader DOES get in the book is:1. Physical and social descriptions of every agent involved in the searches for the boys; 2. Continual reminders that winters in Nebraska are cold. Everyone in this book is continually shivering - what with their poplin lined hoodies (or whatever) insufficient against the brutal temperatures. I kept wondering why, since they all lived there, they were apparently incapable of buying appropriate clothing;3. Every emotion felt by anyone in town from the boys' families to the cops to total strangers. I in no way wish to disparage the feelings of the boys' families who did indeed suffer the ultimate tragedy, but since their feelings are obvious, it is really not necessary to write about them repetitively and interminably. And the cops, of course, thought to a man that this could have been one of their own kids. This is also an obvious thought, so I see no reason for Pettit to have noted it individually for each lawman other than to increase his word count; and4. Remarkably unintelligent writing.I believe that the best true crime is written reportorially - Jack Olsen and Lowell Cauffiel are two examples. They are solid investigators and intelligent professional writers whose application of those skills produce fascinating and highly readable books for literate adults. Pettit possesses none of the above qualities. ANTK reads, rather than as an in depth true crime account, like a bad novel, one written for the lowest common denominator of readers. As I noted Pettit is a TV newsman, and what he's done here is basically produce a puff piece feature from what could be an interesting actual news series.Pettit uses people's thoughts and conversation, much of which is ludicrous and none of which he has any actual way of knowing occurred, to move the narrative. As an example, \\"Soon after the Eberles returned home, the phone rang. Judy snatched up the receiver. 'Hello!'\\" This is how I personally would have expected her to answer the phone. I found this kind of writing juvenile and irritating. It is a constant throughout the book.\\"Shortly after returning home Judy began to receive calls from Danny's customers,\\" would seem to have taken care of two-thirds of page 23.And, \\"I may be an expert in predicting criminal behavior, Ressler thought wryly, but I'd do well to stay out of weather forecasting.\\" Did Ressler actually think that? And if so, did he do so wryly? It just seems unlikely.We also have just plain strange writing:FBI agent John Evans calls to ask his boss, Herb Hawkins, if it's okay to stay on the case:\\"What do you want to do, John,\\" Hawkins asked. \\"You tell me.\\"\\"We have no choice, Herb. We've got to stay with it.\\"Hawkins did not question Evans's judgement, and his next words were not spoken in anger: \\"Don't leave Bellevue until you solve it.\\"There is nothing in any of that that would lead anyone to remotely think Hawkins was angry and it's just weird that Pettit writes it in.We learn that \\"Gently he eased himself down onto the bed, which jiggled under his weight.\\" And \\"Joubert shut off the engine, which jiggled slightly, then was still.\\" How any of this is relevant, if accurate, which is doubtful, is unclear, though I did find it unusual that Petit seems attuned to what I'd call an excessive number of seemingly unrelated instances of eastern Nebraska jiggling. Has ANYONE ever described his engine as \\"jiggling\\"?\\"Chris Walden...did not know, nor did he care that he was only two miles from a television station that would soon be broadcasting news of his disappearance\\" Since Chris had just been abducted by a stranger, all of this is likely true. On the other hand, why it is of any interest and why it should be considered anything but third rate filler is a mystery.And as a final example, out of many possible, one of Joubert's stabbing victims in Maine, when she was first cut, \\"...heard a sound like a knife being thrust into the earth.\\" I think we all know that sound.ANTK is as far from being even decent true crime as it gets. Pettit has taken a tragic and potentially interesting story and turned it into lightweight soap opera. Although it is a complete waste of time, at least I was able to read the whole thing in only 3 hours, mainly because I could skim 75% of it and miss nothing. I did finish it though to find out how it ended, failing to realize that it could not end since there was neither a definable beginning or middle. Highly recommended for 8th and 9th graders who don't much like to read."},{"Title":"A Need to Kill: Final Justice","review":"I found this book very intriguing!

Her father is young (45, I think) and probably has what we now call Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease. I know that because now I am the one watching my dad be taken by the monster.

(Wow, that makes me feel old!) It has always been a place of enchantment, peacefulness, and breathtaking beauty for me. I remember laying out in the meadow watching the firefall in the early 60's (back before we were so environmentally aware of the damage it did to the meadows). I remember the feeding of the bears at the \\"dump\\" at the end of the valley (also before we realized the harm this caused). But there was much of the history I didn't realize.This book covers the plans for the Glacier Point tramway, the building of the Wawona Tunnel, Logging operations, the first automobile travel, stagecoach hold-ups, the tunnel trees and more! It was easy reading and had tons of great old photos. If you find yourself being drawn back to the Valley year after year I think you will find this book to be entertaining, charming and will give you the feel of \\"knowing\\" Yosemite even better."},{"Title":"The Day the Bubble Bursts: How to Profit from the Coming Property Slump","review":"This book is all about timing real estate cycles ... and how housing booms are followed by slumps, which are followed by busts, which are followed by upturns.What makes this book ao interesting is that it is written by a very experienced (and smart) real estate investor from New Zealand, where the housing markets have been extremely cyclical for the past 50 years.Olly Newland (about 55 years old or so) has personally bought and sold real estate through the up and down swings in the New Zealand real estate market. He gives you first-hand information on how the cycles play out, how the psychology develops, the risks associated with different types of properties, how to prepare yourself, and how investors who ignore the cycles get rich and go broke over and over again.Being a 2nd generation builder/developer with 35 years of first-hand experience myself, I can tell you that this author tells the story of changing real estate cycles exactly the way it is. He is definitely no real estate perma-bull, nor is he a perma-bear. With bias, Olly Newland recognizes the changing cycles for what they are: inevitable and periodic.An additional plus is that the book is clear and easy to read - which is always a sign of superior understanding.For those of you who want to know how the the coming housing downturn is likely to develop - which I think is especially important for those of you who haven't personally experienced a real estate downcycle or two - I recommend that you read what Olly Newland has to say.When it comes to identifying changing real estate cycles and how to make money from them, Olly is like a wise uncle - and you've be wise to listen and learn from him.Robert CampbellAuthor of \\"Timing the Real Estate Market\\""},{"Title":"The Day the Bubble Bursts: How to Profit from the Coming Property Slump","review":"This is a quick reading book that has an easy going narrative style.

I was intrigued by the restrained, simple, and succinct character of the poems for two reasons. First, they reminded me opf poetry I knew: of the work of Charles Reznikoff, in particular, and of his fellow-objectivist poets, Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, and W.C. Williams. I later learned, of course, that Niedecker knew these writers, and was close to them. She was particularly close to Louis Zukofsky, with whom she carried on a forty year correspondence and had a brief affair.I was also intrigued when I learned that Lorine Niedecker spent most of her life in the small town of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, which is approximately mid-way between Milwaukee and Madison. She lived on a small island called Black Hawk Island outside the town where her family rented cabins and fished. Much of her life was spent in poverty and for several years she was employed scrubbing floors in the local hospital. Most of the poets with whom Niedecker was associated lived in New York City. Although she visited New York City and spent time with Zukofsky, for the most part she learned and practiced her art by herself.I was familiar with Fort Atkinson because I lived for a short time in my early 20's in Jefferson, Wisconsin, an even smaller town just adjacent to Fort Atkinson. I was there briefly in the early 1970's, just after Niedecker's death (She lived in Milwaukee at the time.) and I don't remember hearing anything about her. Today the town of Fort Atkinson and the local library where Niedecker worked for a time are active in preserving her memory. I was moved to discover the work of this outstanding modernist poet who lived in obsurity in an area with which I was familiar.I was grateful to find this collected edition of Niedecker's works edited by Jenny Penberthy, Professor of English at Capilano College, Vancouver. Ms. Penberthy has also edited a recently-published collection of letters between Niedecker and Zukofsky together with a book of critical essays: \\"Lorine Niedecker: Woman and Poet\\". This collected edition of Niedecker's poetry is attractively put togther, includes good notes and a listing of Niedecker's published volumes, and begins with an informative introduction by Ms. Penberthy to Niedecker's life and work. The poems are arranged chronologically. The book includes Niedecker's early efforts and also includes some important prose and radio pieces, including the short work \\"Switchboard Girl\\" and a radio adaption of Faulkner's \\"As I lay dying.\\" Ms. Penberthy has done a great service in making Niedecker's work available.Much of Niedecker's early work was as a folk-poet. In 1946, she published a collection of 80 short poems called \\"New Goose\\", which was based on the rhythms of the Mother Goose nursery rhymes. These poems describe life in rural Wisconsin and show a strong sense of political activism -- in common with Zukofsky. They point to the injustices and hardships Niedecker found in war, the Depression, and a capitalist economy. A subsequent collection of early poems was titled \\"For Paul\\", named after Zukofsky's young son, and featuring meditations on music, art, and the world of nature.Niedecker's later poetry becomes much more spare and formal. She tended to write short poems, in five lines with irregular feet. She was influenced by Haiku and by Chinese poetry aw well as by her fellow-objectivists. These poems are autobiographical, and include many scenes of life on Black Hawk Island. The longest of these poems is titled \\"Paean to Place\\". Later poems also describe the Lake Superior area around Sault Ste. Marie which Niedecker visited with her husband whom she married late in life. She also grew increasingly interested in historical themes and wrote poetry about Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Adlai Stevenson, and Charles Darwin, among others. These poems integrate extensively quotations from their subjects into the text of the poems.Niedecker's poems include irony, reflection, and a deep sense of place. They show a person who had learned to be alone with herself. Here is a short untitled poem by Niedecker (p. 157) which I hope will encourage you to read more.\\"The death of my poor fatherleaves debtsand two small houses.To settle this estatea thousand fees arise--I enrich the law.Before my own death is certified,recorded, final judgementjudgedTaxes taxedI shall own a bookof old Chinese poemsand binocularsto probe the rivertrees.\\"This is a collection of the works of an American poet who deserves to be read and remembered."},{"Title":"Lorine Niedecker: Collected Works","review":"Let me tell you about Lorine Niedecker. She did not apologize for being born. This volume--far exceeding the much derided previous collected \\"From This Condensery\\"--represents the very best of Twentieth Century American poetry, let there be no doubt. More than just poems that echo Dickinson, Zukovsky, Williams, and who else, \\"Collected Works\\" will now surely stand as one of the cornerstones of American poetry, thanks to the hard work of editor Jenny Penberthy. The best of these poems--\\"Darwin\\" and \\"Paen to Place\\", among others--are beautiful distillations of the real. And other pieces, such as the radio plays, show great, surreal humor. Lorine from Ft. Atkinson is one the best."},{"Title":"Lorine Niedecker: Collected Works","review":"This is the definitive Niedecker. If you love poetry, you owe it to yourself to read Niedecker. Her influences run from surrealism, to Objectivism, to Haiku. Niedecker is an American original as distinctive in her way as Dickinson was in hers. We are in Jenny Penberthy's debt for bringing Niedecker's work to the attention of 21st Century readers."},{"Title":"Lorine Niedecker: Collected Works","review":"The other reviews here are better, but I just needed to tell you how much this book changed my view of words, writing... all that stuff. Or even more than that. After reading her poems, I went outside and things just looked different. Don't worry about what you do or don't know, these are really worth reading."},{"Title":"Lorine Niedecker: Collected Works","review":"Lorine Niedecker was virtually unknown in her lifetime. She died in 1970, leaving a body of work of which only a portion was published. She has been compared to Emily Dickinson because of the brevity and clarity of her poems. There are very few long ones. But there is an undercurrent of dry humour and a feeling for rhyme and assonance that is quite different to Dickinson. These poems are wonderfully compressed-every word is loaded with intent. To quote: \\"it took me a lifetime/to weep/a deep/trickle\\". She fills them with the kind of domestic detail you don't usually find in poems - cupboards, plumbing and oil stoves, as well as her proximity to nature (she lived in a cabin on a marshy island that for a long time had no running water or electricity). Most of her life's work is collected here - a life compressed, a fascinating life and personality. I didn't put it down."},{"Title":"A thousand miles up the Nile","review":"I've been looking for an in-print edition of this book for a long time. My one disappointment with it is that it seems to be incomplete.The narrative ends abruptly at the end of Chapter XIII, titled \\"Philae to Korosko\\". It's obvious that this isn't the end of the book. Very disappointing to come so far and suddenly find one's self teetering on the brink of a literary precipice with nothing ahead! Miss Edwards makes it clear throughout her narrative that her journey goes as far as Aboo-Simbel, but this reprint doesn't go there.In the preface she writes \\"It will be seen by those who do not weary of my companionship before reaching the eighteenth Chapter, that I had the great good fortune to be one of a party, which, in the month of February 1874, discovered and excavated an extremely interesting group of ruins at Aboo-Simbel in Nubia. If an apology were needed for the writing of another book about the Nile, this circumstance would alone furnish sufficient reason for the production of the present volumes.\\"This leads me to believe that several chapters, at least Chapters 14 thru 18, are missing from this reprint. I can find no mention of a second volume or any explanation for the omission of the material referenced in the preface.Leaving that criticism aside, A Thousand Miles Up the Nile is a delight to read. Amelia Edwards is an engaging travel guide who provides a vivid picture of life in 19th-century Egypt and many colorful descriptions of the personalities she encounters. She also proves to be an excellent historian as she describes the ancient ruins she and her travel party encounter as they sail up the Nile on their dahabeeyah the \\"Philae\\". I thoroughly enjoyed every word of the text; however, as I read I continually lamented that there are no illustrations. A glossary and pronunciation guide would also have been helpful. This gem of a travel classic cries out to be updated in a new, annotated and illustrated edition!Recommended to anyone who enjoys 19th-century travel literature, Egyptian antiquities, or Elizabeth Peters' superlative mystery series featuring the redoubtable Victorian Egyptology sleuth Amelia Peabody Emerson."},{"Title":"A thousand miles up the Nile","review":"Another review claims that \\"A Thousand Miles up the Nile\\" has neither all of its pages nor all of its illustrations.

Amelia Edwards conveys her enthusiasm for Egyptian antiquities in a charming narrative that made this reader wish he could have been along for the voyage. Seeing the ruins through her eyes is as close as the modern traveller can come to experiencing the wonders of Egypt in a time when anyone with a shovel could dig for relics. Even readers without previous interest in Egyptology will become fascinated by the subject as they follow Amelia's jouney up the Nile, but be advised that people in Victorian times had much longer attention spans and much better vocabularies than the current norm. A dictionary and Google Earth will contribute greatly to the enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"A thousand miles up the Nile","review":"I ordered this book for Christmas and have not yet read it completely. The style is Victorian, but quite enjoyable if sometimes a little long winded. However for anyone who has sailed up the Nile or spent time in Thebes, Abu Simbal etc., it has a charm and acuteness of observation which will inevitably bring back memories and sharpen them in a pleasant and thought provoking fashion. The biggest disappointment of the book is the manner of its printing which has resulted in numerous spelling errors, horrible layout and no index. Perhaps this edition is better than never reading the book, but the complete absence of illustrations and maps (that are present in the original) together with the numerous errors cheapen it almost to the point where it is not worth buying. First, try to find an original edition, failing that, buy this version just to appreciate how much more balanced the Victorians were both as travelers and book publishers than we are today."},{"Title":"A thousand miles up the Nile","review":"My copy of this book, purchased through Amazon is a beautiful old hardcover by David McKay, Publisher; Philadelphia. it contains a preface to the Second Edition.

It has an interactive table of contents (a big plus) and the original illustrations in their right places in the text. The editors have clearly taken some care over these points. But the proof reading is slipshod. The very first line of the book refers to \\"table-d'hdtes\\" (sic), and there are many other similar errors. The introductory pages contain all kinds of scribbled notes from the library copy from which this book was evidently scanned as well as a lot of blank pages. The tabulation of the Egyptian dynasties in the appendices is a mess. This is really well below the quality of production that Kindle readers are entitled to expect from editors who ask them to pay for out-of-copyright books, and I hope that a new corrected edition can be issued."},{"Title":"A thousand miles up the Nile","review":"This account of Egypt and the Nile is wonderfully descriptive and in-depth.

It may thus seem strange that this 1896 sequel - like Tom Sawyer Abroad, its 1894 predecessor - is now almost obscure. The truth is that this is not entirely undeserved. Huck Finn is a masterpiece of world literature, and anyone expecting this to be anywhere near its level will be sorely disappointed. It lacks the more famous work's seriousness and ambitiousness, making it inevitably minor. However, it is quite interesting on its own minor terms; this means it is not great literature or even pretending to be. However, like nearly everything else Twain wrote, it is eminently readable, very entertaining, and sometimes funny. Fans of Twain's lighter work will love it, and there is something for all to appreciate it. The book is notable for taking the series and its characters in surprising new directions, bringing in some rather dark events and making Tom an unlikely detective hero. Though not a great literary work in other respects, it performs surprisingly well in the latter area. Those eager for more adventures from Tom, Huck, and Jim will certainly warm to it. Like the book that bears his name, this is narrated by Huck with all his delightfully provincial grammar and spelling; \\"prostitution\\" for \\"prosecution\\" in the court scene is my laugh aloud favorite. His navet&eacute; and ignorance also come into play in skillfully unprecedented ways.Like most of Twain, this book can be read and enjoyed on several levels. Most simply and obviously, it is a rollicking, picaresque adventure of the sort later classed as Young Adult or Juvenile. It is notably entertaining and quite humorous even in this limited sense. While far from politically correct by current standards, it can easily be enjoyed by the very young as well as those of all ages who will take it on its own terms. In this sense it is very much like Tom Sawyer Abroad and, indeed, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, not least in returning to the latter's rural South.It also differs significantly from Tom Sawyer Abroad in obvious ways. First and most clearly, as the title shows, it is a detective story of the kind then wildly popular; this was after all when Sherlock Holmes was a sensation. Those who, like me, love such stories can appreciate it simply on this level. It is set up like a typical one with a murder mystery and has exciting elements such as a false confession, a dramatic courtroom scene, a climactic discovery, etc. - and, of course, eventual justice. Seeing all this play out is exciting, and Twain milks it for all it is worth. Unlike most of his works, this is filled with literary devices conventionally used for entertainment value, especially in modern popular fiction: foreshadowing, suspense, dramatic irony, etc. The revelation and ending are in particular highly wrought. Anyone who likes blazing stories of this sort, particularly detective ones, will enjoy and appreciate this and find the book well worth reading for it alone.The discerning can see more, even if no one can see greatness. Though less savagely biting than later work, this is vintage Twain satire in many ways. Detective fiction itself is the target, but Twain's burlesque is gentle; we feel he lightly pokes fun at something he himself enjoys - not least because his satire could be far more bitter. He has some fun at the expense of the genre's conventions, using them in slightly exaggerated fashion to show how superficial they can sometimes be. What may seem exaggeration if read straight comes into play here: melodrama, implausibility, clich&eacute;s, etc. This is where Huck's navet&eacute; and ignorance are important. Many, perhaps even most, readers will be able to deduce some - or even all - of the ostensibly revelatory events, turning what would normally be suspense into dramatic irony. Those who miss the satire may think of these as defects, but those who see what Twain is doing will know they are intentional knocks at a) provincial Southern ignorance, and b) detective fiction conventions. Even simply moving from popular detective settings - i.e., Victorian England - to Twain's rural South makes the genre seem slightly ridiculous. However, that the book itself it can still be enjoyable with shows that the genre can as well. Indeed, Twain's satire is so subtle that many, perhaps especially detective fiction fans, will not even notice it - with whatever ambiguous result. As for those who dislike the genre, they may well like the book significantly more - indeed, may think it a riot. Twain at any rate did not cut off his satirical take on the genre here, returning several years later with the novella \\"A Double-Barreled Detective Story,\\" which drops Tom and Huck but actually has Holmes(!) and is significantly more biting.Tom Sawyer, Detective is thus quite a strange book - a light-hearted satire that most will not get and that many will likely enjoy for the very reasons Twain tries to mock. Its canonical status depends on how well one thinks he succeeds here. No one could put it with his great work. It is quite short - about one hundred pages - and can be read quickly and easily. That said, it will certainly delight fans of the associated stories and characters. The story itself is better than Tom Sawyer Abroad, arguably even better than The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; it has more plot than either, and characterization is strong. Conversely, there is significantly less humor, especially in the dialogue, except for those unusually alive to the satire. All told, it is a worthy edition to the series and to Twain generally even if only hard-core fans, especially those who treasure the associated works, should read it in the end. He hardly wrote anything not worth reading, but this should be one of the last stops. It is a pleasant read even if the fact that it has survived more than a century has more to do with Twain's name and his better works than inherent quality. This is surprisingly enjoyable proof that he was ever-readable even when far from this best."},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer, detective (Companion library)","review":"Unlike what might happen with a lesser-known sequel, this tale does not disappoint. Twain's descriptions through the eyes of Huck Finn are rich and believable. The adventure takes twists and is fun to read. I especially enjoyed the boys' perspective and the influence of the supernatural and the macabre on the mystery--as only boys with keen imaginations can bring to an adventure. Also, the story's basis on a true event made it the more entertaining. Just as satisfying as Tom Sawyer or the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, this is a short and pleasant read."},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer, detective (Companion library)","review":"Most people are familiar with Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but did you know that there were a couple of other sequels? One was Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894), and the other is this short novel in which Tom Sawyer attempts to solve a mysterious murder, as narrated by Huck Finn. It is a satire of the immensely popular detective novels of the time.Tom's Uncle Silas, a preacher in Arkansas, is doing poorly because a rich neighbor, Brace Dunlap, wants to marry Tom's cousin Benny, and she said no, so Brace is trying to stir up trouble for Silas, who hires Brace's no account brother Jubiter to work for him in an attempt to smooth things out, although Silas and Jubiter are constantly arguing. Aunt Polly sends Tom and Huck on a steamboat down the Mississippi to help cheer Silas and his family up. On the boat, they meet Jake Dunlap, Jubiter's long lost twin brother who had become a criminal and was assumed to have been killed many years before. He and two other men have robbed a diamond store in St. Louis, and he has sneaked off with the diamonds, but the other two men followed him on to the boat, so he is now trying to escape them. His plan is to go home to his brothers and pretend to be a deaf-mute.On the day Tom and Huck arrive, Jubiter Dunlap disappears. He later turns up dead, Uncle Silas is accused of killing him, and there is a trial. Will Tom be able to save his uncle from hanging? We did this as a family read aloud, and everyone enjoyed it. In the \\"Dover Evergreen Classics\\" edition, the word \\"nig*er\\" is replaced by \\"Negro.\\" I had to do a little further editing because of some common euphemisms and a few instances of taking the Lord's name in vain.

It is kind of a 19th Century syndicalist or anarchist argument that Leon Trotsky or his counter part in the anarchy movement might make it an intellectuals argument and that did not square in any fundamental sense in my view with the kind of wretched little character that Lee Harvey Oswald was. There had to be something direct and emotional to move this man to murder. \\"This indicates a complete lack of understanding by Reston of Oswald's thinking. Oswald was NOT stupid. He had a relatively high IQ. Evelyn Segal, the child psychologist who dealt with Oswald's truancy problem when he lived in New York as a child confirms this. Yes, he was dyslexic and he a problem both in applying himself to studies in school and to expressing himself in writing, but he was well read in Marxist theory, he learned to speak Russian, he gave talks on his time in Russia at a Jesuit Seminary near New Orleans that made his hosts believe he had a college education, and highly educated people like those who were in the Russian expatriate community in Dallas found him to be very well informed and motivated poltically. He participated in a radio debate in New Orleans with anti-communist activists. He also clearly expressed himself to these people and others that there was no point in \\"reforming the system\\"...only violence would end the oppression of American Capitalism as he saw it. He initially put this into action with his failed attempt to kill the extremist General Walker months before November 22, 1963.In a sense Oswald was ahead of his time. He had much in common with the international terrorists of al-Qaeda who carried out the 9/11 attacks or the Red Brigades Terrorists in Germany in the 1970's who viewed their acts of \\"revolutionary terror\\" as the prelude to the overthrow of the capitalist system. He didn't shoot Kennedy out of some sort of personal grudge...he was known to have made comments sympathetic to the President. His killing of the President was \\"nothing personal\\", but was intended as a \\"gift\\" to Fidel Castro and the Cuban people as a reprisal against the attempts the US CIA (under the direct supervision of Attorney General Robert Kennedy as part of the Agency's \\"Operation Mongoose\\") to overthrow Castro's regime and the possible liquidation of Castro himself. It must be remembered that Oswald visting the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City several weeks before November 22, 1963 and Oswald showed the Cubans newspapers clippings and other evidence of his activities in support of the Communist Cuban regime. This is where the motive for Oswald's deeds are to be found, not in some sort of infantile grudge....after all, would Oswald really have thought it worth while to go to prison or possibly be killed simply out of a desire to get even with Connally for a bureaucratic decision made under his name as Secretary of the Navy? Or would he be prepared for such an act out of a desire to commit a world-shaking revolutionary upheaval?"},{"Title":"Stress Free Children's Parties","review":"This is an absolutely excellent book on telling you exactly what to do and how and also WHEN in order to have a knock-out totally amazing party for your children.

You really get a feel for how different the situation can be viewed through these three lenses...and for the courage required to present it in innovative and subjective prose not typical of acceptable scholarly &quot;social science.&quot;I found myself put off a bit by what I perceived to be a steady note of defensiveness throughout the book, a tone that felt partly assertive and partly self-justificatory, even in those places where the author emphasized that feminist writers of social science need not accept the academic standards of their male colleagues and critics. &quot;We don't need no stinking postmodern graybearded men,&quot; it seemed to say in different ways. At times the sarcasm directed at these critics was quite open, and it distracted me from the excellent content of the author's arguments.I would ask male readers of this book, which I recommend for its fine critiques of the postmodern anthropological tendency to condemn all field research as oppressive colonialism, to bear in mind its context: namely, thousands of years of patriarchy which we've yet to see any end to, particularly in academia. And to reflect that we can't dismiss such books as mere axe-grinding, political or otherwise, because while entirely personal bitterness ought to be dealt with personally, this sort affects half of us directly and the other half through collective complicity.

Although Wolf makes a fanciful case that Taiwanese women's identities are obliterated by not using their names, she herself appropriated the work of the Taiwanese woman who did the research on a woman who was judged to be crazy rather than possessed by any deity and obliterated the name of the researcher.Wolf's ignorance extends beyond ignorance of the language her subjects spoke (Holo/Hokkien) to ignorance about basic anthropological conceptions (terms of address in contrast to terms used in reference to a person, spirit mediums in contrast to shamans). There are no shamans in Taiwan. There are spirit mediums. Previous literature documented that some Taiwanese spirit mediums were female.Wolf did not gather any data on Taiwanese criteria for recognizing true spirit possession, but even her inadequate 30-year-old fieldnotes provide ample material contradicting the &quot;conclusions&quot; (actually, a priori beliefs about female victimization) she presented.Instead of criticizing postmodernists, a better tactic, given her failures of scholarship and ethnography, would be to embrace it and abandon empirical claims altogether."},{"Title":"A Thrice-Told Tale: Feminism, Postmodernism, and Ethnographic Responsibility","review":"Book was in great condition when received.

This is a needed book for those in midlife who have not up to this point been diligently building their wealth and now need more aggressive strategies than those in their younger years who have time (and compounding interest) on their side.Wealth does not just happen. You create it. You need strategies and you need to take action.

Live within your means and invest the rest in bonds, stocks, and real estate. For the adventurous, some advise starting a business.For me, I don't need to be told that I need to spend less than I earn. That is so obvious I don't understand why I need to pay someone else money to hear that.I just don't know how useful some of the advice in this book can be with children. For example, with respect to my child's education, do I shortchange him now or pay the piper later when he can't fend for himself because he can't do simple algebra?To me, I believe it is more important to give a stable family life.

Michael Masterson filled his book with lots of meat and little fluff. He was able to keep away from being a cheerleader and concentrated on time management as a tool for success.

The book reads more like a conversation with a Mentor than a writing from a stuffy Wall Street guru with numbers advice - like some other publications do. With a language that's easy to understand and examples for the 'average person', Masterson takes a very real approach to the 5 \\"W\\"s of Wealth. Most importantly, he lets the reader know early on that being wealthy most likely won't happen overnight, but it can happen - within a realistic timeframe. He also shows how your own personal involvement affects that timeframe. A 5 - star read; I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"I found this book slightly disappointing, having read so many 5 star raving reviews of it. It is a worthwhile read, for sure. To me, the book was more of a \\"how I succeeded\\" book than I was expecting. He is very specific in recommending those things that have done well for him. He offers many strategies for making more money doing specific types of (high paying) jobs, investing in real estate, and starting or financing small businesses. There is good advice in there, and I think it is worth reading for that, since Mr. Masterson is very successful, and whose example to follow but someone successful?The book's pitfalls to me center around specific investing advice. For instance, he recommends not investing much in the stock market because of its volatility, and talks about how much he likes investing in bonds, since if you hold them to completion you know what you are getting. This is true, but does not consider the effects of inflation, which makes that steady income worth less (whereas stock valuations and dividends tend to keep up with inflation). This is a perfect example where you have to realize he is telling you what has worked for him, but may not be the best advice for many (although I agree with him the stock market is currently overvalued). He also seems to contradict himself when he uses the stock market's historical average of 10% returns to claim you need a net worth of 10 times your living expenses to retire (or 12 times if you're more conservative). In one breath he is poo-pooing the stock market as an investment, then using its average returns in his retirement calculations.I also wish he didn't refer to real estate investing as \\"flipping\\" real estate. All the advice he gives about real estate is sound, explaining rents need to be able to cover your mortgage payments, and that today we're in a housing bubble (here in San Diego it's a bubble bath!). Then later he estimates an average ROI of 25% from real estate investing. Again, after inflation is taken into account, I doubt this to be an accurate figure (even taking into account the leverage involved) in today's already-too-pricey environment. Personally, I believe there will be many people losing a lot of money (read: bankruptcy) in real estate over the next five years. I kind of wish Mr. Masterson hadn't used the term \\"flipping\\" houses, as I expect it to be a term that in five years will be looked back on with regret and disbelief, just like \\"day-trading\\" is today five years after the Nasdaq crash.I've spent a lot of time here explaining my negative comments. I do think he has presented a good way one could get wealthy - one that has been proven, which is even better. So I would say read intently his wealth building strategies, but double-check the math on your own."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"Masterson, a self-made millionaire, puts forth a logical approach for building wealth. He believes that a person, who is willing to put in the effort and time, can amass wealth in a period of 7 to 15 years. I think that timing is a bit optimistic, but even if it takes 20 to 25 years, the end result is still the same - financial independence, more freedom and tranquility. Masterson believes one's primary goal is to accumulate enough capital to generate passive income to pay for life's necessities.This 271-page book is divided into only six detailed chapters. Each one explains one of the six steps to achieving wealth, which are:1. Face the facts - you won't get rich saving 10% or more in your pension plan or getting measly salary increases.2. Plan to become wealthy - This is occurs one step at a time and requires planning.3. Develop specific wealthy habits - work hard, good a what they do, are extraordinary savers, pay themselves first4. Radically increase your income - to the tune of 25% to 150%5. Get rich while you sleep - by receiving passive income6. Retire early - to live the lifestyle you wantMasterson provides specific examples of each of his six steps, as well as personal experiences and appropriate stories. It all seems very real and makes a lot of sense. He mentions that an individual has to make getting rich a priority and be willing to focus his/her energies on building wealth. He also covers the need to have a detailed short-term and long-term written action plan with specific goals.The author suggests that everyone choose specific lifetime goals; calculate their retirement income needs based upon an analysis of assets and liabilities, and lifestyle requirements. He then recommends that individuals prepare wealth building goals, health goals, personal relationship goals, and personal growth and development goals. These goals should be set for daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes. He is a strong believer in time management and suggests managing time in 15-minute increments so that multiple goals can be worked on during the day.Masterson believes that real estate can provide significant income and spends time covering how to invest in real estate and what the income should look like. Although he does mention investing in the stock market, he only invests 2% of his money in it. He is reluctant to plunk down a chunk of his money in stocks because they are too risky for him. Obviously, looking back the stock market's devastation during 2000-2002 and the real estate market's appreciation during that time period, his advice seems right on the mark.He feels the stock market is a very difficult place to make money, and that investors should tread lightly there. For those who invest, he strongly urges them to cut losses at a specific level (25% for him), and use stop loss orders and trailing stops to protect profits. He does not recommend investing in the market unless you have at least $100,000 to invest.He is a strong believer in investing a sizable portion of income in side businesses and local real estate to build wealth over time. He prefers investing in income generating real estate, buying rental properties, and buying fixed income investments - holding bonds to maturity to avoid any principal losses due to rising interest rates.Overall, Masterson does a masterful job of explaining the steps necessary to accrue wealth and enjoy life. For those who believe that investing in the stock market is a critical element in the process, as I do, I recommend a newly published book by Paul Merriman titled \\"Live it Up without Outliving Your Money\\" which provides a conservative way to build a highly diversified portfolio that has outperformed the market with less risk."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"Author clearly has a strong understanding about how to build wealth long-term through focused habits and methodology of thinking, but stay away from his \\"stock investment\\" advice and his retirement withdrawal strategies - they're very misinformed.

The author misses the boat here big-time - dangerously so.Advice: Buy the Book for its foundational principles of wealth building and his excellent assessment of real estate investing, but completely ignore Chapter 5's discussion on stock picking and double the amount you will need for retirement. All his advice will be flushed down the toilet if you follow those parts of the book. Instead, substitute those sections with the book, \\"The Four Pillars of Investing\\" by William Bernstein.

His book is an amalgam of motivational philosophy derived from Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie and his own experience mixed with wealth building advice. It's all good but becoming an aggressive salesman/superstar employee isn't a panacea for everyone. For example is a fast food worker supposed to suddenly build a better taco? Would a janitor give the floor a super duper shine? Of course the author doesn't really have working folks in mind. This book and others of it's kind is really meant for dissatisfied yuppies. Furthermore the implied suggestion of making friends with those that have what a person wants and needs to get ahead strikes me as mercenary and false.

In a very kind way he shares with you that if you are 25 and follow the millionaire next door strategies you will indeed grow wealthy...and you will. But if you are 40...or 50 you haven't got a chance beginning with those strategies today.Masterson then eliminates the should be obvious but never is...fact that wealth doesn't happen on accident. You'll need to plan and do. (More rare human behavior)More good advice (it's all pretty much good advice in this book by the way) then he comes to the point. Do something that will make you rich. Doctor, dentist, engineer: You don't have to be in business. Pretty much everyone else needs to be in an entrepreneurial venture. And of course this is the only viable option for building wealth for the 40 plus who isn't one of those professions (or like them).He shares some useful tips about passive income and indeed that is WHERE it IS all at in wealth building.

I highly value his approach and agree that many methods do work. Upon learning that Mr. Masterson is writing a book, I was very eager to read it. The Automatic Wealth starts great. The first half of the book is full of valuable insights. It gives many examples from the everyday life and first of all many examples how actual people, including the Author enjoyed results of the Automatic Wealth. The tension is high until Mr. Masterson starts to go into details. The high energy that emanated from the first pages, suddenly is gone. It felt like air getting out of a tyre. The energy in the book got so low that I had to force myself to read to the end. I am not sure if it was a change of focus on Mr. Masterson's side, or was it because the examples and advice are exclusively for an American reader. Or maybe it is because I was reading the Automatic Wealth after finishing Jack Canfield's \\"The Success Principles\\" and Harv Eker's \\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind\\". Both books are written by people who similarily \\"walk the talk\\". Their great value is that the message is valid for any reader, no matter where she/he may live.

Masterson is firmly in the second category.

Concentrate on one single thing that you want to do first. Save money and have self-discipline. Lastly, look for income generating investments that do the work for you. Overall, this is a quality book worth reading. I would avoid however solely concentrating on getting rich all the time -- you might become a Scrooge.

I've ready almost every self-help financial book around and this is on the top ten. Although it's not categorized as a self-help book, it's more of a redirection for me than starting from scratch. Let me explain: Most authors spell out the same stuff when it comes to personal finance, building a business, or making money. Most of them never have done what they are preaching.Michael has... bottom line. You are learning from the lessons of a multimillionaire who communicates very well and engages you throughout the book with antecdotes of success and failures, as well as giving you inspiration along the way.Must read, a must buy for Christmas...Mike Wannerwww.mikewanner.com"},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"I learned one thing from this book. That is that I have wasted the last 25 years of my life in a technical career. Why? Because it is not and never was a financially valued position. It was not a marketing or sales position. Now he tells me?!The other thing I learned was that if you did not start to save large amounts of money in your twenties or invested heavily in real estate you've got problems ahead. For a copywriter and businessman. Michael is very focused on buying, fixing, and selling property. I expected more. I expected more and better \\"how tos\\". Sure, I could invest in and take Michael copywriter home study course. I could then become a famous, rich, much in demand copywriter doing freelance work for his company (I guess that is now beneath him) or some other publsihing company. Not my cup of tea, as it were.

And it wasn't because of my own concepts of automatic success that I promote in my books, nor was it because I have been his student in his copywriting and wealth development courses.It was because of the quality of his writing, and his level-headed, straight to the point approach to making more money than you probably ever imagined. He gives many vignettes in his book, examples of people he has known, and shows what has worked for them -and what hasn't worked.And he gives a number of vehicles to building your own wealth, many of which are surprisingly easy to implement. From real estate, direct mail, the stock market, consulting, marketing and more, he gives many examples of how to get there.More importantly, he reveals the secrets of motivation, attitude, conscientiousness, drive, persistence and structuring your life around the creation of success. He knows what he is talking about - as a self-made millionaire, he has built multiple financial empires.It is a good read, filled with ideas and inspiration.I highly recommend it.Dr. Ron Dalrymple/Psychologist/Coach/Author of The Inner Manager/www.deogenesis.com"},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"Many of the other reviews give in depth information about this book, so I won't get in to too many specifics. What I will say, though, is that if all the guru books out there are rated as 4 or 5 stars, this book - which offers real, practical advice on improving one's life - should be rated 10 stars.In this book, Masterson offers practical, achievable steps to build one's wealth automatically. One thing I noticed right away is that this is not a guru book that advises you to quit your job to buy real estate and start businesses. Instead, early parts of the book emphasize the importance of becoming an invaluable employee. Masterson suggests several ways of doing this. He also includes some tips about improving one's productivity - at work or elsewhere - that I found to be immensely valuable. Once you've become an invaluable employee, he then advises you to develop a financially valued skill and reinvest your income is other wealth-building tools.And in the end, Masterson gives tips for a happy, meaningful, and fulfilling life. Achieving a high level of wealth is part of the story; wealth is what frees you to live life with purpose and meaning.The bottom line: Make room on your shelf for this book."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"As an up and coming Freelance Copywriter, a student of American Writers & Artist Institute and one of over 400,000 daily readers of Early To Rise, I'm sure my review of this book could be viewed as slightly bias.The point I'd like to make is this: because of ETR I not only became a student of AWAI I also started heading in the direction this book points you to approximately 9 months BEFORE it came out. What I've read of the book makes me realize that everything I've decided to do differently in my life has and will make a difference. I know I'm finally on the right track PLUS I'm dealing with someone I can relate to.My opinion: In Automatic Wealth, Mr. Masterson has brought together all the pieces of the jig saw puzzle of success which portrays a picture worth framing, hanging on the wall and focusing on every morning before jumping into life.

From the perspective of a marketer myself, this is a great book. Almost everyone in the world know the best way to make money of ALL time is selling. And it is a skill you can LEARN. Just like anything else.People tend to do things they say they won't do. While you may feel that it is not necessary for Michael to state the obvius (ie: save, not spend more than what we earn) many still spend more than they earn. Especially when you have the plastics \\"given\\" by Uncle Mastercard or Auntie Visa.It is a good reminder for everyone and Michael has done a great job at that.From my opinion, Michael titled the book as Automatic Wealth because anything that is automatic has to be \\"kick-started\\" first. Illustrate it this way. Say your fully automatic washing machine, you need to switch it on first to let the electricity connect to the machine through a set of wiring and then, and only then, your fully automatic washing machine runs perfectly.Of course, the machine's purpose is to wash clean clothes or whatever it is possible to wash in that machine.Adding a detergent will help the process to produce better, cleaner laundries.I know it might sound a bit lame. So let's \\"apply\\" that to current situation.In order to achieve wealth (automatically) you need to know where is the \\"switch\\" to turn on. Michael gives you that switch in the 6 power steps.The \\"electricity\\" comes from you, the reader to make sure you can connect to the \\"machine\\" (tools to wealthier life).And you, the reader will setup a \\"wiring\\" to connect the \\"machine\\" and the \\"electricity\\" and adding up \\"detergent\\" -- the skills you need to polish.I am soo sorry if you could not understand my lame attempt to make you understand. But from my 5 year research, Jay Abraham will NOT jeopardize his own career and reputation by endorsing a lowsy or shoddy product.I've only known Michael from ETR for few months already and those months are PROFITABLE for me.Some people just don't understand when successful person tells you how he or she enjoys life without worries AFTER the smart and hard work has been done.Anyone who wants to read this book should do follow-up research to get in the know of what's working now. Specifically what's profitable right now. Michael has given a core principle to do it and you can find it inside the book if you really study it.Overall, it's a good book to read.

I agree with him. But he has just rubbished the entire marketing industry that he lauds in the first part of the book as a great place to make a highly paid career. It apparently does not occur to him that there is a big contradiction between the sales and marketing people who get paid megabucks for pumping products up beyond their real value and the truly skilled workers who create \\"real value\\" and get paid jack all.

Next, the difference between the rich and everyone else is customers. If you don't have customers of some kind, it is unlikely that you'll retire early with $2 million in the bank earning interest.Unlike most money books, Michael details how to move forward on most fronts.

Many, many practical guidelines.I study it daily and will do so until I have put the recommended plan into action.The Best!!"},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"A while back, I read and thoroughly enjoyed Michael Masterson's Automatic Wealth For Grads. I found it to be a very good personal finance and life skills book for people who are within three years or so of college graduation, but the value of the advice decreases greatly if you fall outside of that time frame.What I didn't know at the time is that Automatic Wealth For Grads is actually a spin-off of an earlier, more general personal finance book, Automatic Wealth, so when I came across the original book, I knew immediately that I wanted to read it and give it a thorough review.I found it to have the same engaging mix of personal finance and life skills advice as Automatic Wealth For Grads, quite readable and interesting. But is the advice compelling and unique enough to make Automatic Wealth a read for everyone? Let's dig in and find out.Automatic Wealth is broken down into \\"six steps for financial independence,\\" as stated on the cover.Step 1: Recognizing RealityMasterson says right off that many people delude themselves into thinking that their financial picture is actually more rosy than it actually is, and the result of that is that people often don't see the financial danger they're in, nor do they adequately plan for the future.Several solutions for pulling off the rose-colored glasses are offered here. First of all, one should calculate their net worth, as the raw numbers provide the most accurate picture of where you're really at, not where you trick yourself into believing you're at. Next, spend some time figuring out your \\"number\\", or the exact amount you will need to retire. Given both of these values, you can start to see what you'll need to do to get from here to there, which means you can begin defining and working towards some long term goals, whether they be retirement oriented or otherwise.Step 2: Plan to Become WealthyYou know where you're at and you know where you want to be. How do you get there? The key, actually, is in how you set the goals themselves - the more specific your goal, the easier it becomes to get there because it's easier to pull out small pieces that you can wrap your hands around. In other words, take your long term goals and break them down into medium term goals, then break those down into short term goals and microgoals.Let me give you an example in my own life. I have a long term goal of being debt free. This breaks down into two intermediate term goals: the elimination of my student loans and the elimination of my mortgage. Then, I can break the student loan elimination down into short term goals associated with large chunks of my student loan: eliminating one of them and three instances of eliminating $7,000 worth of the debt - each of those can be done in a year. From here, they become microgoals: I need to pay off $150 in student loan debt each week, and I can get there by trimming fat from my spending by doing things by not buying any lattes this week or resisting the urge to buy a Wii game - in other words, microgoals.Step 3: Develop Wealthy HabitsA while back, I wrote a very critical review of The Secret in which I stated that \\"the secret to having everything you want is simply figuring out what you actually want and working to get there.\\" From that perspective, you can imagine how pleased I was to find that Masterson wholly agrees, and it comes through loud and clear in this chapter with the first subheading shouting in big, bold letters It's Not About Thinking... It's About Doing.The chapter goes on to define eight habits of highly successful wealth builders:1. They work hard.2. They are good at what they do.3. They have multiple streams of income.4. They live in (relatively) inexpensive homes.5. Thye are moderate in their spending.6. They are extraordinary in their saving.7. They pay themselves first.8. They count their money.These are basically the same exact habits outlined in The Millionaire Next Door: you don't get rich by buying Lexuses and extravagant houses, you get rich by working hard at something you're good at and not wasting your money. A good chunk of this chapter is actually devoted to frugality, which will perhaps surprise and alienate some readers, but definitely legitimized the book in my eyes, as frugality has been a big part of my financial turnaround.Step 4: Radically Increase Your Personal IncomeHere, Masterson focuses on career advice, stating in no uncertain terms that the only real way to get ahead is to bust your tail, but to make that work pay off you need to make sure that the right important people know about it. One big suggestion he offers is giving regular status reports to people who have power to give you significant raises and promotions, but in those reports focus on the accomplishments of the project as a whole and give most of the credit to the team that helps you do it.From there, Masterson suggests becoming a consultant (so you can make stronger salary demands and work more independently) and then eventually starting a side business or two, both of which I agree with depending on the exact situation. He does highlight the idea of using real estate investment as a side business, which I'm not strong on, but he recovers with much stronger investment advice in the next chapter.Step 5: Get Richer While You SleepThe fifth step revolves around building a diversified investment portfolio, offering some basic investment advice that's worth reading through. However, I find that if you're seriously looking at investing, you're much better off getting a fuller picture on how to invest from a book like The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing.If there's one flaw in Masterson's writing (and it's a flaw that also crops up in Automatic Wealth For Grads), it's that he's very much caught up in the absurd returns generated by the housing bubble in 2002 to 2006. Because of that, he strongly encourages people to jump into real estate investing, particularly housing investing, even making some risky moves to get in. Obviously, this was a bit on the aggressive side and is a great example of why it makes more sense to turn to a more well-rounded strategy like the one in the Bogleheads' book.Step 6: Retire EarlyThe last chapter, interestingly, continues the investment theme, but turns much more conservative, looking at how one should invest as they move close to retirement - and into retirement. The investing strategies here are much more sensible than the ones in the previous chapters, but again, it makes more sense to get thorough investing advice from another source.Buy or Don't Buy?Automatic Wealth is a very strong food for thought book, and the first four steps make for excellent reading - Masterson excels at showing you how to evaluate your situation and put yourself in the best possible state to really ramp up your income. However, he's much weaker at dispensing investment advice.So, for that reason, this is well worth reading for almost anyone, but only for the non-investment advice. For investment advice, I really would look elsewhere to a complementary book, something like The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing. If you're looking for strict investment advice or information on how to dig out of debt, this really isn't the right book for you."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"This is a GOOD book, not a GREAT book. If you've never read anything about wealth building theory then you'll love this book. Otherwise, you'll find the same old rehashed material sliced and diced a dozen different ways in no less than 278 pages that seem to drone on endlessly.As far as theory goes, you could do worse. The basics are all there. But the author could have easily told this story in half the space. You're not likely to learn anything new, unless you haven't been around the block yet. And you just might reinforce a few old ideas. But the content falls far short of the promise of the title, \\"Automatic Wealth\\".And the six steps to financial independence? You can get as much reading Consumer Reports. It's a shame because I was hoping, even rooting for the author to give the reader more. There's nothing I love more than to give a glowing, enthusiastic review of books that truly help people change their lives - either personally for financially. This book does neither.If you have a young adult just about to graduate from college, make this book a gift. He or she is likely to learn a great deal. Ideally, the young tike will put a few of the concepts to practice (maybe patterned after YOUR example)?Otherwise, look elsewhere for more realistic advice."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"This is an excellent planning treatise on how to develop wealthincrementally.

The acquisitionis worth the price charged for serious students of wealth creation and maintenance."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"My rating of the book is 4 stars because I am avid reader of early to rise and had been exposed to many of the concepts Michael Masterson details in the book before.I would say about 50% of the book is stuff you would have already read in the newsletter and the other 50% provides a more in depth look at the ideas Masterson believes most passionately in such as investing in real estate to boost your wealth.I still think the book is worth reading if you subscribe to the newsletter because exposing yourself to the ideas presented more than once is certainly not a waste of time.If you are not an Early to Rise reader and are looking for some practical and implementable wealth building advice the book is worth 5 stars because it presents a detailed system that has worked to make many people financially independent.While I do not disagree with Masterson's advice regarding stocks especially since he makes it clear in the book he has a written a how to guide of the principles that worked for him. I do think he missed the boat on one very beneficial way to invest in stocks in your wealth building activities, via your 401(k).If you have a 401(k) available to you to invest in and you focus on investing in a way that seeks to minimize loss as opposed to maximizing gain I think it is a very practical way to maintain liquidity and still put your money to work building wealth while taking full advantage of a nice tax break and a \\"free\\" salary increase if your employer offers a match.I base this on my own current experience. I am currently working a full time job while starting a side business and I prefer spending my time on that as opposed to learning about and investing in real estate.With just a few hours a month I have been able to do well enough with the options in my 401(K)plan to outperform a portfolio of just bonds by 5 - 10%. The reason I mention this is that I was exposed to all of the advisors I rely upon in early to rise and as expected they provide excellent advice on how to make the stock market work for you.I think listing these advisors in the part of the book were he mentions that he knows some people who are able to beat the market would have been helpful for those people who would want to invest a certain portion of their money in stocks to maximize their salary and reduce their taxes because of a situation similar to mine.This is a minor grievance however and overall the book is well worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"Although becoming wealthy in America is not and easy task, the steps outlined in this book give the reader a great place to start. All too often, a book is purchased with the hopes of a \\"magic formula\\" that will make the reader rich in a week. Not the case. This book shows how to turn dreams into achieveable goals, and expects the reader to take action on the advice being offered. Following the steps in the book has led to more doors of opportunity opening for me, as well as a new mindset that has allowed me to seize opportunities that I would have never seen had I not changed my way of thinking.

I couldn't wait to read it,then I had to force myself to finish it.I am sorry I paid for the book, go to the library and invest the money you save."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"After noticing the online controversy about this author (on Google there are extensive threads with dismissive criticism and hints about a possible scam), I gave this book the benefit of the doubt, trying to see it in the context of 2005, when it was written. While I am impressed by the author's predictions (now a fact) of the crash in real estate values and the stock market, I am somewhat underwhelmed by the largely banal, marginally helpful \\"advice\\", derived mostly from common sense and well-known postulates, such as - try to rise early, eat a balanced diet, become financially independent, plan to become wealthy, write down your goals, start saving today, spend moderately etc. Mostly it all leads to the author's suggestion/recommendation steering you to learn financial skills not so much from reading certain books, but instead by enrolling in the seminars of the Agora Learning Institute, which the author seems to be affiliated with. For the first 68 pages (out of 271) of this book, the author numerous times urges the reader to \\"turn the page\\" in order to see the (presumably eye-opening) advice which is coming to you (tension builds, the reader gets conditioned to believe that some shattering revelations will unfold......and so on). Whether the author's suggestions of ways to accumulate wealth (flipping houses??) are all feasible, whether the author's claims (to have amassed many millions and have owned dozens of businesses) are all true, is beyond the point, but, in my opinion, this book doesn't offer a wealth of practical advice, beyond lots of hearsay, some cautionary trivia about how Mike Tyson foolishly spent his entire fortune, and the (actually pretty wise) advice to buy the best mattress one can possibly afford, thus saving your back from years of discomfort. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"This is a good, balanced view on how to become financially successful (i.e., able to retire without excessive financial worry) in 7 to 15 years. No BS: He talks about the steps to take, and doesn't BS the amount of hard work it will take. But Masterson does more or less give us the formula for REASONABLE financial success. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"I just finished reading Automatic Wealth, and I have to say, I love this book. Most of the books I have read about building wealth fall into two basic categories. (1) The best way to achieve wealth is to get a better yield on your investments or (2) You should scrimp and save your pennies, and forty years from now you'll be a millionaire.The problem with the first category of books is that even the very best investment minds are not making more than 20% average long-term investment returns. So most people are much better off to focus on safe 8-12% returns, and spend their time finding ways to earn their wealth. Masterson is no stranger to investing though, and he does touch on a number of ways to leverage your investments safely. The problem with the second category of books is that most people don't have forty years to wait. Masterson certainly suggests that you maximize savings, but he offers a much better plan than the usual 40 years of sacrifice.The difference with this book is the author's emphasis on finding (or creating) work that you love. It's not surprising that most best-selling financial books don't talk about making more money. After all, suggesting that people work more may not be the best way to sell books. But the truth is that work doesn't have to be work. It can be a whole lot of fun when you're doing something that you love.And that's where this book shines. The author shows you exactly what you have to do to start a side business... or make the business you own more profitable... or make yourself more valuable to the business you work for. In other words he provides a blueprint for making more money.There are hundreds of great ideas, entertaining stories, and valuable lessons in this book, and it reads like candid advice from a trusted friend. In this case, the friend is a millionaire many times over. I, for one, am listening."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"The author suggests such foolishness as 'flipping houses' and volunteering free overtime to get 'in' with your employer. The author is the only one getting rich from this mess."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"In this book, Masterson outlines the six steps you need to take to achieve financial independence:Recognizing realityPlanning to become wealthyDeveloping wealthy habitsHow to radically increase your personal incomeGetting richer while you sleepHow to retire earlyUnlike a lot of books on building wealth, what's outlined in this book won't take you 40 years to do. In fact, Masterson's plan is based on a seven year cycle, which is perfect for those who are nearing retirement and don't have a lot to retire on.His advice is practical, and he actually shows you how to figure out how to determine how much money you need in order to retire comfortably. Getting to where you want to be won't be easy, but it is possible if you follow this book.There are tons of tips throughout the book to show you how to change your direction and get to where you want to be. This isn't like a lot of books like \\"The Secret\\", where you are taught that all you have to do is start thinking positive. This book is practical; it shows you what to do. It also points out something I have known for some time: pessimistic people get rich and optimistic people get rich.True wealth, including money is about having the right mindset, but the amount of money you have has absolutely nothing to do with you being happy. You may have millions and still be miserable. You may have nothing and be deliriously happy.Masterson shows that changing your mindset will help you achieve happiness, but just being happy won't help you get rich financially. To have more than enough money to take care of your financial needs, you need a plan, and you need to take action and make good decisions.Masterson shows you how to do all of those things while reducing your risk so you don't lose your shirt in the process of building wealth.I highly recommend this book for anyone whether you have anything to retire on or not. It will change the way you think, but more importantly, it will give you an actionable plan to achieve your financial goals.Jinger Jarrett, Author,Cashing in on Online Business: Internet Marketing to GO!"},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"The problem with most financial books is they are basically unrealistic. They tell you to save, save, save and invest your money and in 30 to 40 years you'll be a millionaire. Don't get me wrong. I think this system will work for those individuals who can do it. But how many people in the real world can do it?(Ecspecially if they are a family raising kids and making less than $50,000 a year, and that describes the average family!)What I love about Michael Masterson's book is he tells the average person that if you truly want to be financially rich, the first thing you're going to have to do is raise your income, and then he shows the reader actual, specific steps to do just that! By increasing your income and creating little side businesses that generate income streams, the goal is to get the reader to $150k a year and beyond. And he shows you how to do it! Then once a person is making that kind of money they can start investing it. Michael shows you the best way to do that as well.Folks, being in sales and marketing myself, I know what Michael is talking about works. It truly is a book that can take you from broke to financial independence within 7 to 15 years, maybe sooner. And along the way you'll start making a nice juicy income and enjoying life.Of course you could go back to doing what those other financial gurus tell you to do--invest and wait thirty to forty years to get your reward! Congratulations! You're the richest person in the cemetary!"},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"The world is filled with get-rich schemes and early retirement plans. Michael Masterson's book stands out because it blends common-sense advice with savvy investment strategies and a healthy dose of reality. Using personal stories and instructive examples, Masterson provides reality-based insights about achieving financial independence. The chapters on wealth-producing habits and investment diversification are especially helpful, although the multiple sections on real estate investments make the book slightly repetitive. It might have benefited from tighter editing. This is a lively book with helpful suggestions and examples about generating wealth and achieving financial independence. We recommend it to those who seek a healthier income statement, early retirement or both."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"I really enjoyed the way Michael writes. He goes into great detail and there is a lot of information here.His plans are pretty clear, where are you now (not always fun to find out your finances are not in good shape).Then he shifts to help you with your wealth tips and strategies. Then it boils down to disiplined wealthy habits. He shows how it can all come together for you.The steps are inspiring and doable, although its better to start as young as possible. He gives you a plan, you have the desire and disipline, then you take action.. and...wow...the skys the limit.It's good to find a book that is not all fluff. Work your plan and you create a great future."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"There is little or no chance anyone over 40 will be able to aquire wealth and retire early simply by investing in stocks and bonds. Conventional investing is based on what Masterson calls the \\"million dollar myth\\" -- otherwise known as the miracle of compound interest.That myth is behind most of the popular wealth building books out there, from Richard Bach to Suzie Ormand (?) to the Millionaire Next Door Series. Compound interest works, but it takes a long, long time. Most of those books use figures based on a 40-year wealth building cycle.As Masterson says, \\"Who has 40 years to wait? And even if you have 40 years, who wants to wait that long?\\"Masterson's method is designed to create wealth (i.e., financial independence) in 3 to 15 years. It's a solid, senisble combination of drammatically boosting your income (at work and on the side) and taking advantage of the best leveraged investment in the world: real estate.It's not get-rich-quick, but it's a lot quicker than 40 years. It's not without work, but it doesn't take a genius.I know people who have become wealthy by following his advice. I've become wealthy following his methods too.There are tons of bad books out there on money and a few good ones. This is definitely one of the good ones. More importantly, if I were going to give my child only one book on wealth building, it would be this because of how true, honest and useful it is."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"I've been an avid reader of the author's daily ETR newsletter, and I can tell you, he's one of the most persuasive writers I've ever read. I certainly would never have picked up a book with a title like this, but I bought it because I've learned to trust Masterson's judgment. Day after day, his words make sense and move readers to action.His book is extremely helpful for women, especially mothers who step out of the work force to focus on raising their families a few years. Masterson believes it's not years and years of so-so experience that make a person successful; it's acquiring a needed set of skills, learning to excel in those skills, and having integrity.This is a book you can carry around and read anytime you have a minute. It's filled with powerful stories that energize you and show you that success comes to those who don't give up. Masterson's not afraid to share his failures and what he learned from them, and we can all glean from his \\"Ready, Fire, Aim\\" experiences.Here's a list of THE TOP TEN THINGS YOU WON'T HEAR MICHAEL MASTERSON SAY:1. The main characteristic of successful people is that they enjoy sleeping in late.2. Watching a few hours of TV every night is a great way to spend your time (year after year after year...).3. If you don't like your present job or income, stick it out and spend the rest of your time entertaining yourself.4. Complaining is the best way to get what you want.5. The quickest way to become successful is to close yourself off from the world and work alone.6. It's best to surround yourself with people who are pessimists.7. If you're not financially independent by the time you're 40, it's too late. You'll never make it.8. Don't bother saying thank you to people who help you. They're too busy to notice anyway.9. When you make new friends, it's okay to let go of your old ones.10. Busy, successful people don't have time to read fiction or exercise.All this to say, thanks for taking the time to write this book, Mr. Masterson. The wisest man who ever lived had this to say, \\"Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper\\" (Proverbs 13:4 NLT)."},{"Title":"Automatic Wealth: The Six Steps to Financial Independence","review":"This is a useful book for anyone who feels their finances need an overhaul ! It is pitched at people who may have a little money saved already so I found that slightly disillusioning as I was hoping for a bit of advice on the fastest was towards getting rid of the last of my debts ! That aside however, it has some good tips for when one finally has some money to save/invest ! The thing that I liked about it was the fact that the author focuses on the important things is life as well - family, relationships, leaving the world a better place than you found it etc ! He defines wealth as being rich in love and health as well as money ! The info on tax etc is U.S. specific so if you live outside the U.S. you will need another source for that info.

Otherwise stick to reading the books currently available on the subject.A review is supposed to focus on the tapes content. This is difficlut at best because the first tape in the six tape series was poor audio quality and the third tape was entirely blank! Even so, I found some interesting pointers and techniques that were beneficial, for example never use the words &quot;Friendly Stranger&quot; in your induction, etc. Tapes include history, induction techniques and other aspects of hypnosis. Other parts of the tapes were well done and many times humorous. However, if I didn't have so much windshield time, I would have been better off reading material on the subject instead of listening. My recommendation is this is a buy only if 1.) You can't get enough about Hypnosis, and 2.) You have excess time in the car and 3.) You love listening to self help tapes.

Some of the sayings make a lot of sense once you figure out the real meaning."},{"Title":"The Sayings of Confucius","review":"Confucius is considered one of the preeminent thinker and social reformer of the traditional Chinese society. He lived in the sixth and fifth centuries BC, roughly around the same time as many other classical thinkers and religious figures. The philosophical system that was built around his many pronouncements is known as Confucianism, and it has remained one of the most important schools of thought in China and the surrounding civilizations until the present time.This translation of some of the more prominent saying of Confucius dates from 1909. Consequently the language is a bit dated, but essentially it is very clear and easy to understand. The transcription of the Chinese names, however, is very different from the one that is currently in use, so this book may not be the best source for scholarly or research projects. However, if you are interested in just getting the flavor of Confucian philosophy this is an excellent and very accessible resource. The Kindle edition is very well formatted, with hyperlinked references and footnotes.As far as the actual sayings are concerned, in my humble opinion they vary greatly in their wisdom and stylistic quality. There are many that seem trite; others are just more flowery statements about some common sensical ideas, but there are also few real gems that are worth pondering and thinking about. The themes of most of the sayings include personal and governmental morality, social order, common courtesy, moderation in all things, justice and sincerity. Some of the sayings are very hard to extricate from the situations in which they were originally said, while many others are universally applicable. This very general set of precepts and a world outlook that was not based in some higher metaphysics are probably some of the reasons why Confucian thought has remained very flexible and adaptable to many times and places. If nothing else, this short book provides a good opportunity for the modern Western reader to gain the basic familiarity with the Confucius and his ideas."},{"Title":"The Sayings of Confucius","review":"I am still reading this book on my kindle and find it every intersting. I have heard the \\"Confucius said\\" all my life but never really knew much about him. This book tells about his life, his students and the things the Master taught his students. I would recomend it for all who are interrested in the religion he taught as well as his belief."},{"Title":"The Sayings of Confucius","review":"This is the translation by Leonard A. Lyall, from 1909. As such, it uses the older Wade-Giles romanization. I prefer Ames & Rosemont from more recent translations, but this is very representative of its turn-of-the-20th-century type."},{"Title":"The Sayings of Confucius","review":"The truth, scholars emphasize, is the truth, no matter what its source, even if the speaker is of a different race, religion, sex, or culture. This being true, people should pay attention to The Sayings of Confucius.Confucius was born in 550 BCE. The Jesuits who carried his teachings to Europe called him Confucius, although his name was K'ung Fu-tzu. This book's introduction describes his turbulent time and the people and rulers of the period. It was a time when the country was broken into independent empires, each virtually powerless. Confucius held some government positions, but spent his later years in study and teaching, and gained many disciples. He studied history with the hope that he could find a way to help his people and country, and wrote books called Book of History and Spring and Autumn, and edited Book of Poetry. He died in 479 BCE at age 71.Confucius did not write The Sayings of Confucius. Some scholars think that it was composed by a disciple of his based on what his teacher actually said. However, there are passages that speak of events long after his death. The general consensus is that the book was composed by students or admirers around 400 BCE. The following are a sample of sayings:* Smooth words and fawning looks are seldom found with love.* Put faithfulness and truth first; have no friends unlike thyself; be not ashamed to mend thy ways.* A gentleman that does not seek to eat his fill...may be said to love learning.* Not to be known is no sorrow. My sorrow is not knowing men.* A gentleman puts words into action first, and follows them with words.* Learning without thought is naught; thought without learning is dangerous.* To know what we know, and know what we do not know, is wisdom.Not all of the sayings are wise; some are trite. There is some repetition of thoughts told with different words. Some thoughts are difficult to understand. But these facts should not stop people from reading the book and gainig new ideas."},{"Title":"The Sayings of Confucius","review":"Very good read but like many aspects of Confucius, you have to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate (or even understand) what he's saying. I've been studying Chinese culture for many years and even I have to step back and take breath sometimes. Still, in today's hectic world? It's a good break and puts you in a different state.

I seem to recall that Jennifer Lopez was set to produce and star in the movie version of \\"Dirty Girls Social Club\\" and wonder if something went wrong and she created an enemy in the author, for the character was vapid and, clearly, unflattering. With the former business relationship between the two I question why she feels this hatred towards her and how she was allowed to move forward with this \\"fictional\\" portrait!Again, the book does not profess to be more than it is, a Latin version of Chick-Lit, and it succeeds in creating a fast-moving plot with love stories, tragedies, etc. that I was excited to finish."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"If you have never read any of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez's books, do not start with this one. Her first two books are good reads, with characters that you feel for and like. There isn't one character in this book that I liked. The lead is a superficial, whiny brat with a crush."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I absolutely loved \\"Dirty Girls Social Club\\" and I liked her second book as well. I have mixed feelings about this new one but over all I liked it. Personally I didn't care for Milan. I just couldn't believe she just let herself be abused by all, especially the overbearing mother and father and of course Ricky.I really enjoyed how some of the celebrity storylines mirrored the real Bennifer story. Alisa herself said in her blog (which has now been pulled) that the Jill character was based on many different celebrities especially J-LO. I don't particularly care for Jennifer Lopez and whether some of the things have really happened or not, that is besides the point. This book was entertaining. Chick lit is meant to be entertaining, not bring about world peace."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I won't say the book was horrible, because it wasn't; nor will I say it was boring, because on the contrary, it kept me interested, but I will say that it had many faults. For one, the writing seemed a bit \\"young\\", similar to junior high and high school writing, and not that there's anything wrong with that, but I was expecting a more elaborate and mature sense of writing style, since the writer has written more than just one book. Also, the dialogue seemed so unreal. Yes, I know, it's a fictional story, but there was nothing to relate to, but also little fantasy to have fun with, and what I mean by that is that the characters were very underdeveloped, and many of the individual story lines seemed incomplete. At the end, I felt that I needed to read more, to feel I read a whole story. By the way, the book had many typos."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I was surprised by many of the things other reviews mentioned: bad grammar, poor continuity, and the blatant trashing of barely disguised celebrities. The J.Lo/Ben/Jen Garner triangle was the most obvious, but what was shocking to me were some of the side stories, such as the two characters meant to describe Thalia and Tommy Mattola. For any Latina who watches novelas and loves her Thalia songs, this was incredibly shocking. The public sexual encounter between then two made them look like low-class, debased, drug-addicted perverts. I didn't know what to think! How could Alisa publish something like this? If it were completely false, wouldn't they have sued her? If it was accurate in any way, then who has the Mexican public been adoring for years???This on top of the naivete of Ricky's wife, Jill's cruelty and manipulation, Ricky's complete lack of talent (which, if Ricky were based on Marc Anthony is far from true), Milan's utter stupidity and complete lack of self-esteem (which she then seems to grow out of nowhere towards the end of the book), and the behaviour of all of the celebrities mentioned ('Jill's ex -Ben, obviously- and his love for gay love trysts, Jill's desire for rough, dirty, [...] sex)... all of this was too much... it sank to the levels of semi-hard porn...The main character was so weak and gullible. I really don't recommend this book to anyone, even if they like reading tabloid magazines."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I can't believe this book only has three stars! This was a blast to read! I want to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"This is not my favorite book by her. I love The Dirty Girls Social Club. This however wasn't her best effort in my opinion. It could have been better just not sure how."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"This is the first book I've read that is written by this author and I was apprehensive at first. The back synopsis seemed a little flighty and contrived and I was wary of it being too predictable. In the end, it turned out to be funny and somewhat sweet. Yes, it was a bit much sometimes especially with the Jill Sanchez character, but still it kept my attention. A good vacation/beach read."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"If you want a book that reminds you of a tabloid magazine, this is it. If you want something that removes you from your daily life, this is it. I enjoyed this book for the simple fact that it was a mindless and easy read. It's not a novel by any means, but a quick read."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I've read all three of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez and greatly enjoyed the first two. To me this latest book was a poor retelling of the latest tabloid news. While I enjoyed the cleaver dialog and loved the characters, the plot left something to be desired.From the very beginning you could tell who was going to match up with whom. I realize that's to be expected with this type of book, but there were situations that were very contrived which forced characters together.It was also very clear exactly which stars she was basing her story off of. It was as if she hadn't been able to think of her own plot and thought she could use the tabloids to provide it. Thinking no one would notice if she just changed their names.I was also disappointed with the ending. It felt as though the author suddenly knew she had to wrap it up and ended up rushing to bring all her story lines together.Generally Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez writing is enjoyable to read. However frequently her descriptions / introductions of characters remind me too much of a high school English students attempt at writing a novel.If you liked her other novels, you'll probably enjoy this one. Just don't expect it to be as good as the first 2."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I think Make Him Look Good is Alisa Valdes Rodriguez's best book yet. I liked the first two books a lot to begin with, but I feel Alisa's style and pace as an author are really where they should be now. Fast, witty, funny, with several laugh out loud observations on la vida.The thing I wasn't sure about was why she hates J.Lo so much. The character of Jill Sanchez was horrible, and had no human side to her (nearly every other narrating character did). From her name to her outfit descriptions to her perfume campaign (body-shaped bottle) and the title of her album (\\"Born Again\\" in the novel -vs- \\"Rebirth\\" in real life), I wondered-- what happened between these two ladies so that so much rage could be expressed in a book? You could very safely imagine J.Lo for the part of Jill, only because of the huge body of 'evidence' Alisa gives us to convince her that's who she's writing about.I love Alisa's books because they are like passports into more glamourous scenes... people have money or connections, people dress well, people are in the entertainment industry. I also like the narrators in them, they have strong voices and are very easy to relate to. Even though I didn't understand the J.Lo hatred and all the obsession with \\"dandole por detras\\", I still enjoyed this book for all its sharp, smart, good qualities and recommend it as a book you'll be hooked on right away."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I do not recommend this book. However, if you must read it then do yourself a favor and check it out of the library!The author's unoriginal ideas, poorly written style, underdeveloped characters and numerous grammatical errors make it confusing, uninspired and silly.It is embarrassing that the author is being crowned one of the nations Top 25 Hispanics. She is a horrible writer, and not very inspirational.I also found it amusing that because being \\"Latina\\" is so hot right now that publishers have to create a writer where there is no substance. A character in her book that is a \\"phony\\" musician is named Ricky Bascayne. Apparently Ricky is a pretty boy who pretends to sing and write, but the real singer and writer is his friend Matthew. Valdes-Rodriguez is definitely the \\"Ricky Bascayne\\" of the book publishing world. With one exception - there is no Matthew that is the crowing glory writer. Valdes-Rodriguez cannot write and her publishers do not have editors to edit her material. What an embarrassment to Latina authors that can write!Finally, US magazine, Star magazine and other tartlet publications should sue Valdes-Rodriguez and her publishers for Valdes pulling Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck stories out of the tabloids and making them central characters in her book. They accomplished this creative feat by slightly changing their names. What an embarrassment!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Set in sultry Miami, this story features an ensemble cast of six women who are connected through their relationships with Latin pop star Ricky Biscayne. This humorous chick lit novel isn't completely lighthearted, as the characters deal with teenage pregnancy, discrimination, drugs, adultery, and more. Not for the faint of heart, the flamboyant Make Him Look Good occasionally goes into explicit detail."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I would not let anyone in H.S. and definitely not in grade school read this book. Many inappropriate and unnecessary scenes. Thought I was reading the magazines at the grocery store."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I bought this book for a book club read and while I did not enjoy the book, it arrived in great condition and quickly."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Overall, the story is a good story. I started to, imaginitively, fall in love with Milan. However, I lost that imaginative feeling after reading several chapters, or I should say, after several breaks... the book does not contain chapters, the author uses paragraph breaks to direct the reader to another segment in the story...I got lost on the first break and it took me a while to realize I was reading about some other character. The transition from one segment to another was much better after the first break.It was after the third break that I decided I needed to buckle my safety seatbelt, not that I was reading while riding, but I had to prepare for a rough and reckless drive by the author. I lost my imaginative love for Milan after the first encounter with the sexual contents.I am of the opinion that the sexual encounters with Ricky Biscayne not only cheapened the story, but if I had been imaginatively falling in love with Milan, those encounters turned me off. The author did not intimately or delicately develop the various sexual encounters throughout the story. In fact, they appeared to be childish, infantile and amateurish at best. I considered the consensual sex consensual rapes. This is more so with the sexual encounters Milan had with Matthew. What could have been a beautiful love and sex relationship between Milan and Matthew became a consensual rape as well.Do I suggest reading the book? Yes, but buckle your seatbelt and be ready for a rough reckless drive."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I don't really understand a lot of the reviews on this book here. I also read the author's first two books, but I enjoyed this one just as much as the others. It kept my attention the whole way through, and I loved the change or narrators because it kept the story from getting stale. My only complaint was that I didn't really like the main character Milan, but the whole book was not from her perspective, and because it was well written and fun, it didn't really matter. Like I said I'm a little confused, but if someone read the author's previous books, and liked them, but is scared off by the reviews on here, I would say give it a chance. I'm definitely glad I didn't read the reviews on here beforehand, because I probably wouldn't have read Make Him Look Good."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"This book had a few too many narrators - it was hard to keep track sometimes - but the breathy, tell-all style and tabloid-esque plot line kept me turning pages. Milan is the down-to-earth heroine who finds herself in an unfamiliar, pretentious world when, through a stroke of luck, she becomes the publicist for Latino music sensation Ricky Biscayne. The story follows the music/model/celebrity scene in Miami, focusing on Ricky, Jill Sanchez (obviously modeled on Jennifer Lopez), Ricky's Eastern European model wife Jasminka, and Milan's sister Geneva, who is opening a new hotspot, Club G.Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez writes with a wicked sense of humor about a scene she obviously knows well (or has researched carefully) and her snappy, direct style of telling a story is as engaging as ever. Sometimes the diamond-encrusted milieu of the novel was a little too frivolous for my taste, but Milan (most of the time) keeps it real.Sprinkled throughout is commentary on gender, race and class issues, keeping the book from descending into total fluff.I thought this book was better than Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez's second novel, and although it was sometimes a little too busy, it was basically on par with her first novel. If you enjoyed her other two books, you would probably like this one."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"This book had me until the end. I couldn't wait to see what would become of all the characters....minus Jill...personally, I wanted her to die right from the start. The ending was a little disapointing and left me feeling unsatisfied because you don't know what happens to the rest of the characters. I wanted to know who would get married, stay together, how certain money amounts were spent, what happened! Maybe they'll be a sequel, I dont know. I read it on a plane, and it passed the time nicely. This isn't my usual book tastes, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Oh my, this was probably the one of worst pieces of fiction I have read in a while, and definitely the worst book I've read of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez. I am so flustered, I just don't know what to say. I've read Ms. Valdes-Rodriguez's other two novels -- Dirty Girls Social Club and Playing With Boys -- and could not put those books down. However, this one? I had to force myself to keep reading it was so bad. From the overexaggerated characters (the ultra-obsessed groupie Milan, the eternally vain, shallow characters of Ricky and Jill, the uber-innocence of Jasminka) to the overbearing plot and numerous subplots, it was hard to get into this book. This is the first time that I didn't relate to the protagonist (Milan) in a novel.While there were some delightful punches of humor, mostly provided by Milan's narration, and Milan and Geneva's fiesty mom, overall Make Him Look Good made me feel bad. Really bad. For starters, there were glaring inconsistencies throughout the novel, including one where Milan pops a Ricky Biscayne tape into the tape deck while driving, but a few sentences later and a few miles down the road, Milan is listening to a Ricky Biscayne CD?!?!What stood out with me most is the fact that Ms. Valdes-Rodriguez's personal vendetta against Jennifer Lopez (aka Jill Sanchez) almost overtook the whole premise of the book! By the end of the book, it is no secret that the author has an axe (or two, or three, or fifty) to grind with Lopez (and for what reason, I don't know). The paralells and the digs were endless...down to the JSan (JLo anyone?) clothing and accessory line and recollection of the romance with rapper D-Kitty (P. Diddy). Many an author have characters based on their own personal antagonists in their real lives, but with enough creativity and level of disguise, the average reader wouldn't know. But this one? Jill Sanchez? Please."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"It's somehow comforting to know that ethnic chick-lit can be as vapid and annoying as the typical mainstream variety. One good example of this is Alisa Valdes-Rodrieguez's \\"Make Him Look Good,\\" a hideously inept satire on celebrity and self-absorbed males.Chubby, fangirlish Milan is president of an online fanclub for Ricky Biscayne, a sexy crossover singer; so when her chic, urbane sister Geneva offers to get her a meeting -- then a job -- with Ricky, she jumps at the chance. Suddenly she's his new publicist, hobnobbing with the rich and famous -- and a convenient sex partner.But Ricky's life is swarming with women -- his fragile, newly pregnant supermodel wife Jasminka, his disapproving mom, an ex-girlfriend who bore his daughter as a teenager, and man-hungry A-lister Jill Sanchez. When Ricky disgraces and lies to the various women, they band together to revenge themselves on him and the cunning Jill.I love soapy chick-lit as much as the next person, but \\"Make Him Look Good\\" is almost offensive in its thinly-veiled, smug attitude. Instead of satirizing and condemning sleazy stars, celebrity-worship and marital cheating -- as it seems to at first -- it lingers on them like a lustful cameraman.Valdes-Rodrieguez seems more interested in lingering on Miami chic clubs, A-list housing and clothing than on plot. She also apparently gets tired of certain storylines -- Geneva stealing Milan's past boyfriends is awkwardly dismissed with \\"oh... I was wrong, sorry.\\" The climax is the height of the hilarity, with a \\"surprise\\" expose with the media that is more fantasy than Harry Potter, and written with campy ineptitude.The characters aren't so great either -- our heroine Milan is a pitiful, spineless girl who lives in a fantasy world, and sleeps with a pregnant woman's husband without remorse. Why should we care about her? The other characters are \\"types\\" rather than people: sexy successful sister, arrogant and sexist Latin guy, fragile child-woman from war-torn country, vaguely butch firewoman and feisty teen.The only really amusing aspect of this book is the affair between Jill and Ricky (also known as Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony), along with the fictional counterparts of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner. Jill is so nasty, conniving, cunning and manipulative that she's funny in a campy way, even if it's an easy stab.\\"Make Him Look Good\\" doesn't make anyone in it look good, let alone Alisa Valdes-Rodrieguez. This vapid chick-lit book aspires to be a soapy guilty pleasure, but the only guilt is in reading it to the end."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I bought this book after reading the author's first two novels. The first two were great, this one was barely ok. The materialism and brand-name dropping is gratuitous and distracting. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped. Some characters -- Jill Sanchez, for one -- are so clearly based on real-life celebrities that there is no originality to their story. And the main character and narrator, while initially sympathetic, later becomes almost unbearably naive and annoying. I love high-end fashion, I love South Beach, and I subscribe to US Weekly. And even I thought this novel overdid it.However, there are some bright spots -- a short chapter told from the perspective of a cat was amazingly written. Some of the romances are touching. And the plot is interesting, even though the climax and ending seemed a little farfetched. Hopefully the author's next offering will have more originality and substance, and less flash."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Generally speaking, I love Alisa's writing style, and enjoy the larger-than-life plot lines and crazy fantasy endings -that's the POINT of chick-lit, right? Make Him Look Good has some great character exploration, and I really get the feeling the Alisa connects with the idea that even chick-lit characters deserve some depth.But, Alisa, get yourself a better editor! The unevenness of the writing, and the internal inconsistencies should have been caught by the editor, not by your fans.My bone to pick with this is that Ricky's immigrant Serbian wife \\"thinks with an accent!\\" As a writer who constantly harps on the issues of Latinas being underestimated, I was shocked and saddened to see you treat this particularly sensitive and accessible character with the same racist attitude you complain about. I've read all of your books, and in none of them does a Latina express her thoughts in less than perfect language.Half of my family are recent immigrants from the Eastern bloc, so perhaps I am particularly sensitive to this, but Jasminka deserved better, and to represent this character in this way was a slam to those who struggle to learn this language and adapt to a whole new way of life at the same time.You know better, so you should have done better.And this will be the last Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez book I will buy."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I loved her first two novels and expected much more out of this one. The blatant references to JLo (\\"JSan\\"? Really?) were unoriginal, the characters were weak and boring, the storyline itself was completely transparent. Don't waste your time or money on this book. Check it out from the library if you \\"must\\" read it, or check out one of her first two for a better read."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"As a fan of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, I had high expectations for \\"Make Him Look Good\\". It turned out to be a sore disappointment. Though it had its interesting moments, this book got to the point of being almost painful to keep reading. The writing was unimpressive, the plot completely over-the-top (even moreso than \\"Dirty Girls\\"), and the author included sexual situations that were crass and unnecessary to the story. Characters were recognizable as parodies of Marc Anthony, Dayanara Torres, Jennifer Lopez, Tommy Matola, and Thalia. I'm not sure what Rodriguez has against these celebs, but wow. You know, on second hand, maybe you should read this book, just to see what I'm talking about. Piece of advice though: borrow it from a friend or the library. It's truly not worth your money."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I was so surprised, and not in a good way.I really enjoyed her first book. The second, not so much but still I thought that she was funny, sharp, created characters that were a little more then one diamensional, etc.But this - I was unprepared for the bomb that is this book. I am suprised that her publisher did not shoot this idea/outline down before it turned into a book.I am surprised that someone who showed so much promise with her first book is now seemingly a one trick pony. I expected so much more."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I loved Valdes-Rodriguez's \\"Dirty Girls Social Club\\"...it wasn't perfect but it had soul. Since then both her following books haven't impressed me much.Make Him Look Good is filled with one too many characters, as much as I'd like to know everybody's story it gets kind of annoying. The characters don't warm up to you as much, some I cared about, some I very happily skipped. They were all pretty much cookie cutter predictable characters. The story was also equally predictable. The most unbelievable was the way the end shaped up.It's a pass-time type of a read as long as your expectations are low!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I'm still 20 pages away from finishing this book and I dread picking it up everytime.I read Alisa's first 2 books and loved them. I waited patiently for \\"Make Him Look Good\\". I was stupid enough to pay full price. I wish I would've just checked it out from the library.The plot and character development is poor. Too many characters, not enough time to develop them. The story lines seemed rushed. Milan goes from frumpy, sad little pathetic homebody to an even sadder, more pathetic \\"starlet\\" in a matter of pages. And we're supposed to believe that she's going to go from sleeping with Ricky Biscayne to having a meaningful relationship with Mattew in just a matter of pages. I hate this character.The only character I have enjoyed is Geneva. And unfortunately Alisa is so obsessed with trashing JLo (\\"Jill Sanchez\\") that she misses a great opportunity to develop a deeper, more meaningful character.The dialogue between the characters is shallow and hollow. Leaving little room for one to really become lost in the storyline.I'm so disappointed. Read Alisa's other 2 books (\\"Playing With Boys\\" is her best one, IMO). But skip this one. It's not worth it."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Let me begin by saying that I've read Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez's other books, and that I truly enjoyed them. Dirty Girls Social Club was a fun read and Playing with Boys had substance and emotional depth that made it even more enjoyable than the first.If you've read either of those books, don't pick up this one. It is shallow, it is vapid, and worst of all, it is poorly put together. The characters are not likable, with some being so transparently modeled after current tabloid celebrities that it is embarrassing to read (Jill Sanchez, known as JSan, with her music and acting careers and fashion and perfume lines based on the fame of her big backside, engaged to a slightly less famous and starstruck White actor, dallying with her machista Latin pop star ex as he's about to do a crossover breakthrough and then dropping in a couple of paragraphs about her dangerous relationship with the rapper D-Kitty and the gang shoot out she had to reveal she witnessed, since the gun was found under her carseat? Jennifer Lopez should sue!).The worst part about this book is the editing, however. On one page a drugged out novela starlet is named Analisa, on the next she is Analicia...in the same sentence a shirt is sleeveless and has short sleeves...the purported protagonist describes in detail a capri pants and tank top outfit she dresses in on the way to work, and is wearing a black suit and lacy camisole when she gets there...and the list goes on and on.If the publisher couldn't get someone to reign in the high school quality writing in this one - giving the feeling it was rushed to print to capitalize on the success of the previous two - at the very least they could've assigned an editor with a modicum of attention to detail and a modest control of syntax and grammar to polish it.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"She did it again! I love Alisa Valdez-Rodriguez's books. This one was slow to get my interest but once I was in, I was in rapture. I love her descriptions of Jill Sanchez; they remind me of some famous Latina \\"star\\" who should be known for her behind and her gaping hole in her being that is her talent. I found myself cracking up as I read the book and wanting desperately to ask the author some questions about inspirations.I would recommend the book to people who want to laugh and enjoy a good story."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"If you are a fan of Alisa Valdes-Rodriquez, then you know what you are in for. If you haven't read her work, this is a fun, can't put down kind of book. I love that she mixes Spanish in her writing and I am always learning something new everytime I read her books. Read this one and read her other books too!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Yes, my review is helpful. I am offended that 4 people dismissed my opinion. Eff it. As a college student, I read a lot of books during the year, sometimes you need to read something that's entertaining. This is not the book that you will have a revelation, it is the book that you read to have a good time. You don't fall in love with the main character, because she drives you crazy with her pathetic infatuation with the singer. She finally wises up and the story ties everything together fantastically by the end. In my opinion, Valdes-Rodriguez books are like watching a good romance-comedy. A good romance comedy is charming, funny and small touches of depth, without getting too serious. If you want depth, read Toni Morrison. In fact, this book was so entertaining, I read it throughout my vacation in Puerto Rico. Great book."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I really enjoyed this book and thought it was a fun read - akin to a Popsicle on a sweltering summer day. It's fun and let's your imagination really run wild on what the Fabulous Life in Miami consists of.As a writer, Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, is the modern girl's voice on life, love and the pursuit of happiness. And that's ALL modern girls - regardless of age, race and socio-economic background. She writes of the HUMAN experience. Don't be suprised if you can relate darlings!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"The newest installment from Latina super-author Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez will not dissapoint her fans. Her dialogue is snappy, her narration fun and descriptive. My only issue with this book is that the Jill Sanchez (JSan, if you will), Jack and Lara relationship so closely mirrors Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner that I began to wonder if they could sue for defamation of character. Alisa doesn't try to hide the fact that Jill is J. Lo: from her famous assets, to her perfume line to the disasterous live performance with her amor, it is obvious who Jill is supposed to be. It takes the reader a bit out of the story, but does not detract from the novel overall.A great, fun book. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"As always, I enjoyed reading Alisa's books. They are easy and fun to read!!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I had a great time with Alisa's book. What I love most about her books is always her effective use of characterization. Each character is well developed. Even if you left out the tags you can tell which character is \\"on stage\\". They come to life as you read. I always feel at the end of Alisa's books that I know these people. I love some (charaters), hate others which means she's pulled me into the story and made me interact. That's always great when an author can do that!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I personally love this novel.I'm a young adult and almost same age as Milan, can't say I relate to her but its fun read. I feel in love with the characters, I wish I would find my Matthew! I finish reading this book last night I woke up today thinking about it and going back to my favorite pages. I can't seem to get this book off my mind. Great, fun book for young adults who rather read a book then magazines."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"This is a cautionary tale. Beware of worshiping a celebrity or someone in your personal life who in reality doesn't measure up to whom you think they are.I think the author was willing to give up a little bit of character development for the sake of raising issues, such as child adoption, divorce, bigotry, and obsession.Basically, I enjoyed the book a lot."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Make Him Look Good is a juicy pageturner that will sweep you away into a fantasy world of celebrity life. I'm a busy mom and put everything on hold so I could finish this book in one week - it was that captivating. Yes, it has the whole entertaining behind-the-tabloid aspect, but what you should know is it also is very deep and layered when it comes to the stories and emotions of the characters. There is one passage towards the end of the book (with the point-of-view of cat!) that had me sobbing so much, there are splotches on my pages! Thank you, Alisa for another fabulous book. It was worth the wait!!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Hollywood tactics of beauty, fashion, celebrities, and endless lust. Make Him Look Good by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez consists of all of this Hollywood hype. This dreamy tale of a young woman named Milan goes through her life of coming from a nerdy unpopular Ricky Biscayne, the hottest Latino singer around, crazed fan to his personal assistant while trying to become his lover at the same time. This story has many individual characters in it that all intertwine together with the lustful interest and objective of Ricky Biscayne. Rodriguez uses many literary tactics to lure the reader into the Hollywood setting of popularity, fashion, love, lust, and individualism.Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez wrote this book with the intent for it to be in the category of adult fiction. However, a young adult and/or teenager can also enjoy this book as well as understand the plot. The setting and plot of this book can be easily related to by a teenager through their fantastical dreams of meeting their favorite celebrity and becoming close with them, by a young adult wit their dreams of having their dream job that they love to attend to every day, and to an adult with their adult affairs and private social lives with the opposite sex.Make Him Look Good by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez is an excellent book that is recommended with great reference. This book is very thrilling, emotional, and a fantastic read when there is plenty time on hand that you want to occupy with a Hollywood read."},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez what a great book. I have enjoyed this just much as The Dirty Girls Social Club, and Playing with Boys. I live in Miami and this book is too much. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"I usually shy away from anything depicted as a certain cultural fiction (this one labeled as \\"Hispanic\\") but was pleasantly surpised at how wrapped up in the story I got. It is definately more about women maturing and coming of age- a universal topic we can all relate to. I enjoyed all the different voices- it kept me interested and was similar to Judith Krantz novels in it's richness of character and plot development. I will definately be recommending her as a must read author for my all-caucasion book club!"},{"Title":"Make Him Look Good","review":"Looking forward to reading Haters- Ms Rodriguez has already stated that Make Him Look Good wasn't her best literary effort yet."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"These books are very different from other books Weis has written. I like to think it's because he/she was left on their own and didn't have a co-writter.They are simply brilliant. I adore them. They do mirror starwars in some ways, but to me these charachters are completly different.I can't really think of a good way to explain it, I myself am not a very good writter. These books are DEEP and wonderful.I read them when 20 and now 7 years later i think I have read them each atleast 5 times. I simply adore these books."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"I have read this series at least four times. I continue to pick up Weis's books (and putting them back down after a few chapters) hoping to find one that draws me in the way this book did. No clear cut always right hero or villain in this book and I loved the mixture of old relics and traditions with spacecraft. I knew it had to come to an end but I wish there were someway to come back to this series."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"This review encompasses the entire trilogy, not just the first book.This series has been my favorite read since I read the first book at 13. The couple of years I had to wait before the second book came out was agony, and again with the third book. The characters are incredibly well written, and their interactions are what make this series so great. If you like plausible characters, and a well written world, you will love this book. I've read some of the other books Margaret Weis has written with other authors, and I honestly think she does far better writing alone. Her character's come across much clearer, and the tragedy is far more moving. The plot and theme is pretty much the same as everything else she's written, but her style really shines here.There are two reasons I find that cause people to be disappointed with this series. These are 1) This book is not \\"hard\\" sf. In fact, I would categorize it as \\"Science Fantasy\\". If you are looking for a book that has lots of plausible theories and a scientific grounding, you may be disappointed. It's focus is on the characters and the story, not techy gadgets. And 2) this series is definately inspired by Star Wars. If you're looking for something that doesn't make you think of another story, this is not it.That said, even if you fall into one of these categories I would still suggest you try it. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"I love this series. I bpught it some time in November and have just started on King's Sacrifice. King's Test is a nice start. The best part of all the books, as well as the first, is the internal conflicts of Derek and Maigrey. Most of what kept me reading this book until late at night was trying to figure out just who the bad guy was. i quickly learned that its not that simple. I see how in one moment a good friend becomes a great enemy, and vice versa, then back agian. The turmoil is nonstop. The only real problems are the references to ancient Earth mythology and literature. There is a complete lack of references to anything &quot;modern&quot;, save that of the Revolution. There's also the whole similarity to Star Wars. Some of the roles can be easily matched between this series and the Trilogy. Tusk= Han Solo, Sagan=Vader, Abdiel=Palpatine, the list goes on.

I had no idea this book was aimed at young adults; if it wasn't aimed at a young adult audience I would have to say Margaret Weis's prose were unfit for consumption.It has been stated in various reviews that this story is similar to that of Star Wars, what most people haven't added was this book is a poor attempt at capturing the feel and excitement that Star Wars offered. For me this novel is nothing more than a rip-off of a good story.

Weis &amp; Hickman have struck gold with this novel. The world they have created is rich in intrigue, with hero's and villans. But I think what I loved about this is that the character you empathise most with is the tragic villan - Derek Sagan. The love story behind Sagan and Maigray is amazing, in this book we only get to touch the surface of the betrayal that has doomed them both. But they are very real people - with flaws and mistakes, even the hero's are flawed - Dion is selfish and at times childish. He has the Starfire blood and as such has the legacy of self indulgence that doomed his family.

I would say that if a person likes a lot of internal strugle, gore, philosiphy (there is a line from &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; at the begining of every section, and quotes from various well known novels and poems at the begining of each chapter, not to metion the philosiphy that is writen into the story itself), but dosen't need a lot of action, then they would probably like this book."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"this book isn't that great, in comparison to other margret weis,( and tracy hickman) books; this one is bad. but the next three books in the series get consecutively better. so read it just so you can read the next three."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"The Lost King is the first book of Margaret Weis' &quot;Star of the Guardians&quot; trilogy. In this novel, Weis recounts mankind's continual struggle with the most appropriate form of government: republic or monarchy.The galaxy has survived a short &quot;reign of terror&quot; where the monarchy is overthrown, the ruling class annihilated, and a president (and would-be dictator, named appropriately Peter Robes) installed.In the previous regime, genetically enhanced humans called Guardians are trained to power to protect and preserve the galaxy and monarchy. One of their own betrays his king and country to remove the weak monarchy. Now, decades later, disenchanted with the new rule of law, he searches for the scion of the royal house to be used for his own puppet rule.Weis has constructed a believable political web. All of her &quot;evil&quot; characters have rationales for their actions and believe that they are doing good. They are so convincing that I couldn't decide whether I wanted them to fail or not.Look for some interesting technological/biological weapons such as the Guardians' &quot;bloodsword&quot; which has five needles in the hilt. When grasping the hilt, the needles break the skin and a specialized virus is injected into the wielder's bloodstream. If the swordbearer is not a Guardian, he/she dies soon after. Else, the Guardian receives enhanced abilities and shielding.Although I haven't yet read books 2 &amp; 3 (King's Test and King's Sacrifice), this was a very strong start to the story.Only difficulty is finding the books as they have been out of print for several years. Most difficult to locate was book two."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"This book is kind of like a fable hidden in a great sci-fi/galactic fantasy book. The author shows the reader how pride and hunger for power make us completely different people, and have the potential to ruin your life. If you buy this, buy the other 3 books: King's Test (good) King's Sacrifice (very good) Ghost Legion (great)"},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"WOW! What a story. With enough plot twists and detailed and developed characters, this story really envelops you into its many pages. Unlike other Science - Fiction that I have read, this book did not just have some main character trying to save the world while escaping from hundreds of aliens who are constantly fireing at you.This novel, and this series is intrigueing. There is no real main character, but it focuses on mainly Dion Starfire. He grows up on a planet called Syrac Seven with his mentor Platus Morianna. One day, Dion is sent away to go with a mercenary and his hilarious computer to escape a Warlord. Before Dion leaves, he sees his mentor, Platus struck down by the Warlord. Dion manages to escape with the mercenary while the Warlord is after him. The Warlord has his own personal ambitions.It's a great story, that will enprint a memory on you forever. The characters are memorable. It blends, serious situations, comdey, emotion at the highest level and a sense of thought.One of the best series from Margaret Weis that I have ever read. Keep it up, we love your work!I am also recommending: The Death Gate Cycle, by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. It is as good as this series!"},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"I have read this series many times, and each time it is a different journey (much like Sagan listening to a fugue of Bach, I pick out different lines each time that I follow throughout, usually unintentionally). For me, the core of this book is not about the &quot;sci-fi&quot; elements (which there are few) or even the fantasy elements, but rather the emotional journeys and relationships between the books characters. It seems that Weis was more concerned with portraying how people deal with the ideas of fate and destiny; the emotions that they feel when confronted with life; the love and hatred felt between confused and blurred boundries; and how the choices a person makes shapes their destiny, whether they know it or not.I am about 3/4 the way through &quot;The Lost King&quot; right now, and the book is affecting me in a different way than before. I have read the series 4 times previous to this, and each time I take away something new and different. For me, they are not just books, but sacred works of literature."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"I really owe a debt of thanks to Margeret Weis for writing these books. Seven years ago I was like most teenagers in the world today, my interests pretty much consisted soley of TV. I would occasionally go to the library and take out books, usually hard science science-fiction books. One day in there I saw The Lost King and decided to take it out. That's the day that I'm able to point back and say that I began my journey in literature.The book is great! The series is great! It starts out very Star Warsyish and then takes over and draws you in. I've read the series countless times since then. I've read a thousand other books since these. It all comes back to these books. I'd be a very different person if I hadn't found them.If you haven't read them yet... please do. It's just a superb story."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"This is a very powerful series of books.

Until now I only know the German version, but as for I watch my favourite movies only in original version, I believe the original books even are *better* than them.

This barely qualifies as sf: the tech and &quot;science&quot; are, for the main, horribly thought-out; the society portrayed is dominated by the echoes of Western civilization (Plato, etc.).But the series (I've read this trilogy plus _Ghost Legion_), the above notwithstanding, is *fun*...once you stop expecting *real* science. Its true strength is in the relationships between characters: Derek Sagan, ambitious...and alone; Maigrey Morianna, tormented by a lost past and her sundered relationship with Sagan; Dion Starfire, the &quot;lost king,&quot; who has a ways to go before achieving adulthood, let alone kinghood; the mercenary Tusk and his wisecracking computer XJ. It's a space opera with battles and romance and plots galore. Read, let go of science, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"These books basicly flow from a similar template to \\"Star Wars\\". Sagan is Darth Vader. The guardians are the Jedi. Etc Etc... If you like that sort of story, you will really enjoy these novels. Don't be fooled by descriptions of this series as a \\"trilogy\\". I myself have FOUR novels. They consist of \\"King's Sacrifice\\" (book one), \\"King's Test\\" (book two), \\"The Lost King\\" (book three), and \\"Ghost Legion\\" (book four). I am unaware of any other Star of the Guardians novels.Comparisons to other pulp science fiction asside, the best part of these novels is that Weis does a fantastic job of fleshing out the personalities of her characters. Sagan is often conflicted in his desire for power and his regret at his roll in the downfall of the monarchy. Dion Starfire is young, and often careless. Seeminly easily manipulated by the people around him, he has to grow into his roll as a ruler of the galaxy. A roll he doesn't really seem to want. The Lady Maigrey is a former lover of Sagan's and now his bitterest foe. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.It has been many years since I've read this series, but I still keep the books in my collection and fully intend to read them again some day. I recommend them to anyone who loves galaxy spanning adventure backed by political intrigue and deep believable characters."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"My my, if Sagan were a real man, who could resist him? What a great bunch of characters Ms Weis has drawn. Interestingly enough, the two who are supposed to be ancilliary charaters (Maigrey and Sagan)steal the show.

As I always say on panels at Science Fiction conventions, this is the greatest story I've ever read. Set in a different time and place, the Guardians, an elite group of royal servants, protect a young king while he matures to assume the role he was always destined to fulfill. Dion Starfire, mentored for years by a peace loving poet, finds himself thrown into the world of WarLord Derek Sagan, the ruthless leader of the Guardians in a kingdom thrown into ruins by a malevolent revolution.Sagan wants the boy for his own designs. Lady Maigrey wants to protect young Dion. A host of magnificently designed characters come into focus as the tale moves forward. Some of them want the throne. Others want the young king dead. Only the combined efforts of the Guardians, or the descendants of the Guardians can protect Dion. As he grows into manhood, the tempestuous teenager rebels against everyone, and even against his own desire to be king.This book will grab you from the first paragraph, I promise you.

My father actually showed this series to me, and when I looked at it, I was like 'I dont like sci fi novels, I just like fantasy'. Of course thats just the gist of what I said lol. I really didnt want to read it but trust me when I say, that would have been a big mistake. I was desperate because sometimes when I have nothing to read I go a little crazy. Anyway enough about me=) What I have to say about this book is that its the best I have ever read, seriously, im not exaggerating. This novel is actually 'galatic fantasy' (heh) and I hope authors keep expanding on this genre that Weis made=). There's so much I want to say about this novel, I just cant get it all straight. First off, I dont know if any other author has done this before, but I loved how she used quotes as her titles of chapters. It really made you think. After I would read a chapter, I would try and see how the quote was used. I have always hated it when a title of a chapter tells you what happens before you read it and this just solves that problem. Another thing I liked was how original it was. I was getting tired of all those novels where there's just one main bad guy and a group of good guys who save the day. In this novel those roles are always switching. If you want to read something refreshing and new, read this! Also, the way the characters are portrayed, you find them so believeable! Like, some of the main characters are supposed to be genetically superior from normal people, and Weis makes you believe this because they do seem like their on some kind of higher level all their own. I cant really explain it, you should really just read it to see for yourself. You might be interested to know though that the 3rd novel in the series was actually written first and then the 1st and 2nd. I havent read the 4th , which was written after the 2nd, because some authors tend to get worse the more they write (running out of ideas). But I want to know if the 4th is as good as the others, if someone could just write it here I would appreciate it. Of course this is Weis im talking about so I really shoudnt be asking=). Anyway, I could go on and on but I just wanted to make the point that you should read this!! =)"},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"In my mind, The Lost King is Weis' finest novel. It is, by turns, intellectual, engaging, and moving. The futuristic world she describes is well thought out and is populated by appropriately complex characters. Simply brilliant."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"Oh my, this is bad! Mind you, Margaret Weis is a brilliant writer, and this book is very well written, but IMHO (and please notice that this is just MY opinion, others may beg to differ) this one comes way too close to Star Wars (SW)! Let me give you three examples: First: You have a must-be-overthrown galactic republic (led by an evil man in robes) and a must-be-reestablished galactic kingdom. Exactly as in SW except that in SW it's the republic that's &quot;good&quot;. Second: You have a lost boy, his heritage unknown to him, brought up on a remote planet, and who is actually the one who can save the galaxy from evil tyranny. Anyone say Luke Skywalker? And third: You have the &quot;Blood Royal&quot;, a selected few who possess extraordinary powers enabling them to control other people in certain ways. Also, these guys have special swords that shine and buzz when turned on! I, for one, have certainly met such a bunch before! Furthermore, the warlord, Mr. Derek Sagan, reminds me a little too much of a certain person, who's clad in black and has breathing problems. This Derek Sagan thing does, however, change as the story progrsesses (a change that, to me, is rather peculiar, though!), and the presence of SW-similarities dwindles later in the series.Another annoying point was the recurring references to certain great writers and thinkers and the like of the past (those made by the characters in the book and hence NOT the ones prior to each chapter). I take it these 4 Star of the Guardians books are supposed to take place far into the future. Maybe even thousands of years have passed - mankind has after all colonized several planets, and something great is bound to have been achieved. But apparently no great books have been written and no new, daring philosophies have been made. At least none we hear of! &quot;20th century&quot;-persons are mentioned every now and again, but never any from the 25th or the 28th centuries. Come on! Some books of importance must have been written in that time!Neither does the plot offer anything new. It's not bad, I've just seen it too many times before: Evil must be defeated - good must prevail. There are no twists in this particular version of that good old story, just a straight (slightly boring) line.This is definitely NOT Margaret Weis standard! Usually what she writes is damn good, we all know what she's capable of writing both on her own and together with Hickman, Perrin or Baldwin. And that is why I can only give this book (and the entire series for that matter) one star, even though it's well written with juicy descriptions of the environments.But again, this is after all just my opinion ...."},{"Title":"The Lost King (Star of the Guardians, Vol 1)","review":"Maybe you'll enjoy this book, but I certainly didn't.I got it at a used book sale for a quarter, and I wouldn't buy it again. It feels like a blatant Star Wars rip off that's poorly executed. My housemates and I passed it around and laughed at how bad it was.I picked it up because I've enjoyed other work by Weis, but I couldn't even finish this one.Folks have different tastes. If you're thinking of buying this book, read the first few pages on the \\"Look Inside\\" feature. Had I taken the time to do that at the bookstore, I'd have saved a quarter.

I read \\"The Lost King\\" for the first time in two decades and, frankly, it did not age well.Weis is, as always, a solid craftswoman of sentences and paragraphs. She is usually a fine creator of fantastic worlds and sympathetic characters--but she floundered badly in this series.Here's the plot. There was once a virtuous old order guarded by noble knights with mystic abilities who use swords to defend the galactic order. The villains, led by a fallen knight, overthrow the old order. One of the knights protects a young man who has the same ability as the knights while the fallen knight looks for him. Throw in sassy mouthed computers and a gruff smuggler....Wait a moment, where have we heard this before? Yep. Margaret Weis, one of the leading fantasy writers in America over the last three decades....shamelessly ripped off Star Wars.There are some differences. In Star Wars, the good guys want a republic while the bad guys want an unelected central power. Weis has the good guys defending monarchy and the bad guys backing a republic in \\"Star of the Guardians.\\" Weis has read enough and works that into the story--and references to Christianity and Plato and other thinkers are some of the better parts of the book. Weis is a strong writer--and that does help the book but it certainly does not redeem it.One other problem. We've heard something else before in this book. According to the \\"good guys\\" in this book, the best form of government, instead of government of the people, is to be ruled by an unelected central power who will call upon supermen bred to improve the gene pool. Wait, where have we heard this before? Yep. The \\"good guys\\" are agreeing with the likes of Himmler and Alfred Rosenberg and a host of other German leaders in the 1930s. This book is both shameless in its unoriginality and horrifying in its message.

As for the future world she developes I agree is quite good, it is, however, an almost exact copy of Star Wars (you only have to read about the bloodsword or XJ).To make it short, I'll only say, for all of you Weis fans that, like me, absolutely had to read this book: There are librareis, (and may Amazon forgive me.)"},{"Title":"Black Ice","review":"This book is a wonderful example of what you can do when you put your mind to it.

They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.\\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :DIt's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book. However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it. For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental. The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious. The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others. As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth. Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy. Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness. While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women. We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip. We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered. The recording is just a bit flat. The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie. The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text. Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale. But I found this recording a bit disappointing. My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read this book as a kid, and loved it. However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version. I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book. The longer version is definitely better.This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son. I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted. Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain). They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.It doesn't sound very exciting does it? Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing. Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways. Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones. I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy. Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters. We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children. She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer. I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within. I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\""},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is a story about four sisters who live with their mother. I thought it was a great story because it is really easy to figure out what they are doing in a jiff. The best part of this book is that it shows the characters have feelings and emotions that are throughtout the whole story. The story explains to me what it was like to live back in the older days. Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters? Read Little Women and get into the story. I think the best rating for this book is four and a half stars. It needed a little more happiness towards the end.

Recently I sat down in excited anticipation to read this story to my ten-year-old daughter, only to have both of us fall asleep in record time. Poor Ms. Alcott's stories have fallen on the sword of the sparkling fast-paced prose of the likes of J.K. Rowling and the modern poetic stories of such authors as Alice Walker. Little Women is the story of four New England daughters of a father away fighting in the American Civil War. Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read. I'm sorry to admit that my old friend is collecting dust on the shelf, but the world is full of great books of our time just waiting to be read in substitution."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Bought this book for my friend, who recently became a 4th grade teacher, to keep in her classroom for her students to read. I fell in love with Little Women when I was about that age and wanted this new generation of kids to have access to the classics and learn to love them as much as I do."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women, being one of the classics of American literature, is not surprising to be said one of the best books I have ever read. The story revolves around the home life of four close sisters and two strong, moral parents. As Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up, their adventures and mishaps provide examples for any reader of all ages. As they grow up, they struggle with many ideas. First, they are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they want to be bad. Second, as they grow up, they confront different types of relationships with boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marraige. Finally, two of the most important ideas in the novel are dreams and work. The girls spend their childhoods and adult lives trying to balance the two and fulfill both necessities. Also, throughout the book, society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is portrayed to give the reader a strong sense of what it was like to be living during the 19th century. The book gives the reader some mportant guidance to people in similar circumstances in their adolescent years. The novel motivates positive decision making, looks past materialism, teaches morales, and shows us the importance of real happiness."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read. The book is printed on quality paper and beautiful cover. There is also a bookmark incorporated into the binding to keep your place.

It far surpassed what I had expected in terms of paper, binding, etc. I am so happy we got this book, and the price was more than reasonable for what we received!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This edition of LITTLE WOMEN is great! First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang. Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book Little Women is a heart-warming story. It is one I would read more than once. I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys. I chose it because I had seen the movie and i heard that the book was one you can't go your life without reading,so I went to my school library and checked it out.This book is about four sisters growing up during the 1800's. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself. I hope you don't have anywhere to be because once you start reading this book you can't put it down. I recomend this book for girls of any age, young or old I am sure you will enjoy.WARNING:THIS BOOK CAN MAKE YOU LATE!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women was our reading selection for October 2002. We thought this timeless classic story of four sisters was wholesome and heartwarming.This coming of age story that was inspired by the author's real life family teaches family values and morals. Each of the girls have their own set of problems but through love and understand they learn the lessons of life.All of us agree that the character were well written and the story is one that will stay in your heart long after you have read the same page. A few of us have read the many times and we all highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book is heart-warming and inspiring. It is the story of a family of four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, their friend Laurie, and their search for their &quot;castles in the air.&quot; The girls go through life trying to follow the example of their good and generous parents. They correct their faults by listening to, learning from, and teaching each other and the people around them. Each person chooses a different path to try and get their wishes or &quot;castles in the air,&quot; as the four March girls call them. The eldest sister, Meg, wishes for first a house full of luxurious things and a lot of money. She then also would like a good husband and healthy children. By the end of part one of the book, Meg is well on her way to getting her wish. However, her priorities seem to switch places. Beth is the &quot;pet&quot; of the family and she deserves it. She is a shy, sweet girl who only opens up to those she trusts. She is the third child and is very attatched to her older sister Jo. Beth's castle in the air is only to live quietly and to take care of those around her. God grants her wish.Amy is the youngest March sister. She has artistic talent and so understandably her wish is to be an artist. Amy tries her best to improve herself and be a lady of society. Her hard work and good sense reward her in the end. Jo is the second eldest sister and the most unique. She doesn't care what others think, except for her family and a few special friends. Jo is stubborn, quick-tempered, and blunt. However, she is also kind, forgiving, and full of passion. She learns her lessons the hard way, but tries to catch others and save them the fall. Jo's dream is to support herself and her family by doing what she loves best, writing.Laurie, or Teddy as Jo calls him, is the neighbor and life long friend. The girls, especially Jo, teach him to get over his bashfulness and help him to grow into a fine young man. He struggles, but this is a hopeful book, and he wins his battle. He also wishes to love and be loved by one of the March sisters. All of the charachters do end up getting their castles in the air. It is very enjoyable to read how their wishes change throughout the book. Little Women is a fantastic novel. It is full of smart lessons and important morals. I especially enjoy how the story tells the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone. I like how the book is hopeful and am inspired to try and correct my faults and go out in search for my own &quot;castles in the air.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy.

Treasure it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. As someone who never had a sister, I closed this book wishing dearly that I had. Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended. It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike. I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based.I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This story takes place mostly at the March's house and the Laurence house which is important because it gives the reader an idea of how the each live and helps the reader understand them better.This book is mostly about four sisters named Margaret, Josephine, Elizabeth and Amy March,their mother Marmee March, Theodore Laurence, Mr. Laurence, they are always helping each other and others in need and are happy the way they are and will always be friends, are always thoughtful, truthful, and use manners even when talking to each other and others and even though they have very few money they still enjoy their lives and Mr.Laurence enjoys the company of them at his house, even though the Laurence's are wealthy the girls him and his grandson the same way they treat each other with respect and tells about their lives.In my opinion this is the best book I've Ever read ! I think this is an educational book because it teaches that money isn't everything that's better to be happy the way you are and you don't need money to be happy and you can be happy by helping people and that you should respect elders and others.I would recommend this book because it's educational and a good book to read when bored or just want to read a book or read an interesting book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best.

I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring \\"1800's\\" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, \\"what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?\\" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is \\"boring!\\" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a mature mind and enjoys reading classic style books."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The rating is for THIS edition of the book, feminist ideologue Elaine Showalter's genital revisionism blots the text everywhere. Nor is the theme concerned with the &quot;tension between social responsibility &amp; individual and artistic freedom&quot; except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with &quot;group identities&quot; who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility &amp; intellectual standards. Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to &quot;re-frame&quot; &quot;de-construct&quot; and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture.

There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The words are so crowded.

What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters. Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.Data:There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war.

Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Would you do anything for them? That's how it is for Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. They are not perfect but great sisters. They all are different, they are strongly bonded together, always their for each other, just like normal sisters.The main characters Meg, the oldest of the four, was sixteen and very beautiful, Jo, the second oldest, was fifteen, tall, thin, and has light brown hair, Beth, was called rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl, and was thirteen, Amy, the most important person to her dad life, the youngest. Some main characters emotions are happy, sad,/ baby time, dieing time, war time, and peace time.The background into the relationships among the four characters are, four sisters, the sisters who have a great relationships among each share in between the four of them. A summarize of the plot in the story would be four sisters and they are going throw, a dad in the war, it's hard to watch the four girls Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up and move on with their live.A hint about the resolution of the plot, I would say a few years later the girls are grown up and someone comes home and then the family is all back together but one know everyone is going to be happy. The genre that I was reading was historical fiction. This book is part of a series, the little men which Louisa May Alcott also wrote. My opinion towards the book would be for the writer to make more books just like little women because the book was very interesting, my reaction on the book were sad, happy, terrified, and cry full. The interesting theme is love, I would recommend this book to children ages, 12 and up and I would also recommend the book to young adults, because the book is very enjoying."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Wouldn't it be fun to live in the early 1900's?

It is, afterall, written during a different period.

Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us.......that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use....that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times....that we can create magic if we write from the heart....that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times....that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\""},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read this as a young girl and love it even today.

Even as an adult, this is still a wonderful, touching story, and is a refreshing breath of fresh air in a world that's become increasingly jaded."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"\\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.\\"Everyone is no doubt familiar this opening line. It comes from Little Women, the beloved classic of the four young March girls. Meet sixteen-year-old Meg, the plump and matronly oldest sister; Jo, the awkward and rambunctious tomboy; Amy, the spoiled and artistic blond; and Beth, the quiet and reserved youngest sister. With their father away at war, the girls grow up under the watchful eye of Marmee.Of course, the March family is not perfect, which is why we love them. Meg succumbs to vanity a party when she borrows a dress that is far too stiff with a train that is far too long. She also fears during dances that her earrings will fall off. Jo refuses to forgive her sister Amy for an act of vengeance, until a skating disaster reunites them. Amy receives the strap at school for ignoring a rule about candy. And Beth loses a beloved bird during a disastrous week when the girls experiment with idleness. Even the one who most often instills moral guidance, Mrs. March, admits that it's taken her over forty years to only partially cure her anger.While the entire family is creative, Jo is the writer amongst them. This is my main reason for liking her best. We're both always reading. Jo likes to receive books as presents, is most attracted to homes where the owners have libraries, and typically cites examples from literature to prove her points. We're also both always writing. Jo writes plays and contributes news to the family newsletter. She loves sharing stories about what happens in her life. I also most identify with her habit of getting herself into scrapes.Despite the absence of their father, the family is close knit. The Marches sing together. They help the needy, even to the point of giving up their Christmas breakfast to help a starving family. Not being rich themselves, they produce their own plays and a family newspaper for entertainment. Under the moral direction of their mother, they also learn many life lessons. I embraced many of the principles myself such as refusing to let the sun go down on my anger. Little Women continues to be one of my favorite girl books."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a coming of age tale chonicling the lives of the March Sisters.

I recommend reading this book for all children, \\"growing\\" empathy for the opposite sex for boys as well as providing models for girls. It is an essential addition to the libraries of children's depts of public libraries, elementary and junior high schools, and a supplemental text for undergraduate courses in Victorian literature.

I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life.

(Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!JANA"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love. The novel chronicles the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, during the time of the civil war.Each girl has her own unique characteristics and traits which Ms. Alcott does a brilliant job bringing each of them to life. Meg, the oldest, womanly, beautiful and proper; Jo, the author and tomboy; Beth, the frail gentle caring soul; and Amy, the youngest, the vain artist.Each of the girls lean on each other for support while their father is away at war and their mother taking care of the sick. The girls entertain each other by putting on plays in their attic that Jo has written. The girls also befriend their neighbor, Laurie, who falls in love with Jo.Throughout the years the girls experience Meg's courtship and marriage to Laurie's tutor, John; Beth's sickness and brush with death; Amy's venture overseas to study and travel with Aunt March; and Jo's travel to New York to \\"escape\\" and further her passion for writing. It is there that Jo meets Fridrich.This classic novel of home, family and love, inspired by the author's own life, will linger in your heart long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly.

There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Why give your child an adaptation of a classic?The original book IS a classic because it's that good, but it's not intended to be an easy reader. There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing. Or if you really insist on exposing them to the story before they can read it, let them see one of the film versions first--they were all pretty good."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The story line is quite excellent, I love the words the Louisa uses! Such variety! In this book are triumphs and failures, love and loss. Overall an astounding book - I would read it again in a heart beat."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is one of my most favorite books which i love re-reading once in a few years.What makes this one a timeless classic is that it never grows old despite the story taking place more than a century ago. Why? Because we can always relate to the characters.My 12-year-old daughter, who is a modern child of the modern world, loves the book as much as her mom. We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not. Sadly, those were still the times when women did not have many choices, but it did not stop them following their dreams (especially Jo).This book also teaches us to be grateful for the opportunities we have today--the ones that the little women did not have."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I decided to reread Little Women before reading the Pulitzer Prize-winning March by Geraldine Brook, which is written from the viewpoint of the family's father, off serving as a Chaplain during the Civil War.As always happens, as I read a favorite children's book as an adult, I find things that I love to be reminded of, but also notice how many life messages simply slipped past me during the early reading. There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

The print is quite small, due to the book's small size, but the binding is nice for a four dollar book, and my younger sister (for whom I purchased the book) is enjoying her forays into the innocent fun-filled world of Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy.

This edition only goes up to the chapter titled \\"Aunt March Settles the Question.\\" This is because this is the Chrysalis, which is a UK company. In general, the UK publishes Louisa May Alcott's books separately as \\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives.\\" However, in the US both parts of the story have usually been published as one volume entitled \\"Little Women.\\"Otherwise, the story is wonderful and follows four girls in their trials and tribulations. Certainly one can read this book only and get a good story. However, parents who are getting this for their children should also look into purchasing \\"Good Wives\\" or at least getting a US version with both books included. The book is printed on thicker paper than typical paperbacks and has interior color illustrations (watercolor, I think).

Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together.

I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person.
