I have at last kept my promise.' In Ireland, 1951, the young June Goulding took up a position as midwife in a home for unmarried mothers run by the Sacred Heart nuns. What she witnessed there was to haunt her for the next fifty years. It was a place of secrets, lies and cruelty. A place where women picked grass by hand and tarred roads whilst heavily pregnant. Where they were denied any contact with the outside world; denied basic medical treatment and abused for their 'sins'; where, after the birth, they were forced into hard labour in the convent for three years. But worst of all was that the young women were expected to raise their babies during these three years so that they could then be sold - given up for adoption in exchange for a donation to the nuns. Shocked by the nuns' inhumane treatment of the frightened young women, June risked her job to bring some light into their dark lives. June's memoir tells the story of twelve women's experiences in this home and of the hardships they endured, but also the kindness she offered them, and the hope she was able to bring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xa9rT2N9yS8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirit in Nature: Teaching Judaism and Ecology on the Trail","description":"Examine the beauty and wonder of nature--through Jewish eyes. Divided into six chapters--including Trees: The Torah of Life, Opening Our Eyes to Miracles, and Ma'ariv Aravim: Blessing the Night--Spirit in Nature's 27 activities are designed to enhance environmental awareness from a Jewish perspective. Through these activities, hikers of all ages will come alive to the miracle of God's creations. They focus on the marvels of nature: hosts of tiny creatures living in the soil, the rainbow of colors embellishing fields and trees and stones, the intricate interdependence of plants and animals. Each discovery celebrates the divine spark that exists within every living creature and every object found in the natural world. Building on Jewish sources and Jewish tradition, Spirit in Nature fosters respect for flora, fauna, and natural phenomena and shows how to sanctify them with the appropriate prayer, such as the blessing recited upon seeing a rainbow or upon smelling a fragrant plant. This pioneering work will awaken hikers to the wisdom of Jewish tradition in its dedication to safeguarding and preserving the bounty of God's creation. An index highlighting the connection between key Jewish values and the environment makes Spirit in Nature an effective classroom tool.

The phenomenon of friendship is universal and elemental. Friends, after all, are the family we choose. But what makes these bonds not just pleasant but essential, and how do they affect our bodies and our minds? In Friendship, science journalist Lydia Denworth takes us in search of friendship s biological, psychological, and evolutionary foundations. She finds friendship to be as old as early life on the African savannas when tribes of people grew large enough for individuals to seek fulfillment of their social needs outside their immediate families. Denworth sees this urge to connect reflected in primates, too, taking us to a monkey sanctuary in Puerto Rico and a baboon colony in Kenya to examine social bonds that offer insight into our own. She meets scientists at the frontiers of brain and genetics research and discovers that friendship is reflected in our brain waves, our genomes, and our cardiovascular and immune systems; its opposite, loneliness, can kill. At long last, social connection is recognized as critical to wellness and longevity. With insight and warmth, Denworth weaves past and present, field biology and neuroscience, to show how our bodies and minds are designed for friendship across life stages, the processes by which healthy social bonds are developed and maintained, and how friendship is changing in the age of social media. Blending compelling science, storytelling, and a grand evolutionary perspective, Denworth delineates the essential role that cooperation and companionship play in creating human (and nonhuman) societies. Friendship illuminates the vital aspects of friendship, both visible and invisible, and offers a refreshingly optimistic vision of human nature. It is a clarion call for putting positive relationships at the center of our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8yCfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lady for Ransom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gogdJQAACAAJ&dq=The+Lady+for+Ransom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Rain Forest (We Can Read about Nature!)","description":"Provides a business principle that applies strategies and practices extracted from nature, showing how a company can become, like nature, an intricate living system that integrates competing interests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ELcaHKy-NY4C&dq=In+the+Rain+Forest+(We+Can+Read+about+Nature!)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music in western civilization","description":"\\"Music in Western Civilization, Media Update combines superior scholarship with pedagogy that helps students master the difficult and exhaustive material covered in the music history course.

However, it is a book about a significant turn-around of a middle-level administration of justice in one Protestant denomination and it does offer hope that other like administrations might be able to experience a better and more effective existence. Everyone's experience is unique and therefore cannot be replicated. However, the implementation of foundational all-encompassing principles, the development of new strategies, and the performance of specific tactics that are successful in one situation does offer hope to others that their modeling of the principles, adapting the strategies, and creating specific tactics to fit their context can bring change. \\"This book is a gutsy look at denominational life, leadership and vision, and offers new paradigms for the local church, middle judicatories and national denominational life. A must-read for anyone interested in bringing renewal to the local church and our denomination. Clearly, Borden has hit the bull's-eye with regard not only to our denomination's needs but also how renewal begins in the local church.\\" - ABE News Foreword to Hit the Bullseye by Leith Anderson July 2003 \\"Some look at things that are, and ask why. I dream of things that never were and ask why not?\\" -- George Bernard Shaw There are approximately 400,000 churches in the United States and the vast majority of them belong to denominations. Some are healthy, vibrant, and growing. Most are tired, struggling, not growing, and don t know what to do. Plenty of critics and cynics take surveys, analyze data, and write books about what is wrong with the churches of America. As if following the theology of Chicken Little they are convinced that the sky is falling and there is little we can do except seek cover. Proposals for renewal often are offered by theorists who tell practitioners what to do but have never actually done it themselves. What if? What if there was a way to help declining churches to grow? What if we could teach pastors how to lead their congregations to spiritual renewal? What if thousands of churches changed from maintenance to mission? What if a movement began with 200 churches that grew to 200,000 churches? What if millions of unchurched people came into lasting relationships with Jesus Christ and the church? What if the denominations of America with all of their people, property, and potential became the epicenter of this spiritual earthquake that became known as the Great Awakening of the 21st Century? Maybe all this sounds too good to be true. Well, it has already begun. Centered in the earthquake zone of northern California, the American Baptist Churches of the West have demonstrated that a plateaued and declining region of mainline congregations can become a model of healthy and growing congregations. They have overcome the usual excuses that  our churches are too small,   we have too many older people and congregations,  and  property here is too expensive.  They followed a powerful formula of biblical strategies, courageous leadership, and much hard work. What is most amazing is that the turnaround took less than five years. Why not? Here is the dream. Denominational leaders, executive ministers, bishops, district superintendents, regional directors, seminary teachers, pastors, and lay leaders will discover what God has done in northern California and say,  Why not here?   With a few creative adaptations we can do the same thing in our denomination and in our churches.  They will start small and multiply. They will risk their traditions, finances, staff, and jobs. They will respond to misunderstanding with teaching and take criticism with grace. Then there will be one successful church transformation new vision, new faith, new people, and new excitement. One will become ten and ten will become one hundred. Church by church, region by region, denomination by denomination a true reformation will bring a great new era to the people and churches of our generation. It can be done. It has been done. This is a dream of the way things can be. Be among those who say,  Why not? Let s do it!

With particular focus on Plato, this book is an in-depth study of the contentious dialogue in classical political philosophy. In the late archaic and classical periods, two major traditions of philosophical and political thought developed. One tradition was associated with the Presocratic mechanistic materialistic philosophers and the Sophists. The second tradition, beginning with Pythagoras, gained full expression in the collected dialogues of Plato. Both of these philosophic traditions challenged the long established Greek mythico/religious tradition associated with Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and others. This study examines the dynamic dialogue involving these three traditions, which present competing and conflicting world views. It concludes that Plato's dialogues, taken together, quintessentially embody the mainstream dialogue or trialogue, as it could be called, in Greek political thought. This book also makes the case that the three major traditions of Greek political thought set the stage for the future dialogue of Western political philosophy even to this day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ROwGV92D63IC&dq=Socrates+(Doubleday+anchor+books,+A+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr Chase's Recipes or Information for Everybody an Invaluable Collection of About Eight Hundred Practical Recipies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Charleston ghosts","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Allyn & Bacon Guide to Writing (Brief 2nd Edition)","description":"This handbook is unique in linking for students the skills of critical thinking, reading, and writing - in the composition classroom and throughout the curriculum.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QeYIHO5DaGMC&dq=The+Allyn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legacy: A family history and genealogical record of the Wood, Mallory, Miles, Kenney, and related families","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lcbRHAAACAAJ&dq=Legacy:+A+family+history+and+genealogical+record+of+the+Wood,+Mallory,+Miles,+Kenney,+and+related+families&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Defend Humane Ideals: Substitutes for Objectivity","description":"One of the principal moral and psychological problems of our time is whether humane ideals can be defended. Loss of faith in the objectivity of ethics has encouraged a sense of hopelessness. The notion that no ideal is better than any other, that a humane commitment has no rational advantage over Nietzsche's contempt for ordinary people, has been accused of leaving our civilization without self-confidence or a purpose. James R. Flynn rejects attempts to salvage ethical objectivity as futile and counterproductive. Instead, he uses philosophical analysis to demonstrate the relevance of logic and evidence to moral debate. He then uses modern social science to refute racists, Social Darwinists, Nietzsche, and the meritocracy thesis of The Bell Curve. Flynn concludes that the great post-Enlightenment project-justice for all races and classes, the reduction of inequality, and the abolition of privilege-retains its moral dignity and relevance. A professor emeritus at the University of Otago, New Zealand, James R. Flynn is the author of Asian Americans: Achievement beyond IQ and Race, IQ, and Jensen. He has been profiled in Scientific American, and his research has been reviewed in Nature and Newsweek.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6TktDwAAQBAJ&dq=How+to+Defend+Humane+Ideals:+Substitutes+for+Objectivity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicago's Maxwell Street (IL) (Images of America)","description":"Presents a collection of photographs that depict the history of Maxwell Street in Chicago.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ayos853SlBUC&dq=Chicago%27s+Maxwell+Street+(IL)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Who Love Sex: An Inquiry into the Expanding Spirit of Women's Erotic Experience","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Looking for Andrew Mccarthy","description":"The third novel by the Sunday times bestselling author of Amanda s Wedding","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cI8YrevL8C0C&dq=Looking+for+Andrew+Mccarthy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grave Undertaking","description":"\\"[A] first-rate installment in an excellent series.\\"  Booklist Barry Clayton has left the Charlotte police force to manage his ailing father's funeral home in the peace and quiet of the Appalachian mountains. But Buryin' Barry is an undertaker with a problem he keeps finding unwanted business. Moving a grave on a snowy mountainside should be routine. No funeral, no procession, no grieving widow to console. Routine until Barry unearths an unexpected intruder, a skeleton lying atop the original occupant. A bullet hole in the skull piques his ex-cop curiosity; the photograph of his girlfriend Susan Miller in the murdered man's wallet makes the case very personal. Suddenly, Barry's life is turned upside down, as Susan becomes the prime suspect. Joining forces with his pal Sheriff Tommy Lee Wadkins, Barry sets out to find the real killer. But a terrible secret had been buried in that mountain grave and one murder is only the down payment someone is willing to pay to keep it hidden. Barry is torn between discovering the solution to the crime and uncovering a part of Susan's past that could destroy their relationship. When the killer strikes again, Barry learns that even more is at stake. In a duel of deceit and misdirection, one thing becomes crystal clear. Barry's grave undertaking could very well lead to his own funeral.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TuEpLg_No6EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Georgia Automobile Insurance Law - Including Tort Law with Forms - 2007 Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zPmuvgEACAAJ&dq=Georgia+Automobile+Insurance+Law+-+Including+Tort+Law+with+Forms+-+2007+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Do Men Have Nipples?","description":"Setting the record straight on folk remedies, traditional cures, and medical myths, an entertaining but informative medical reference furnishes informative answers to such questions as Do microwaves cause cancer?, Is sperm nutritious?, Is it bad to crack your knuckles?, and more.

This is very much a living tradition, and many of the motifs and gods mentioned in early sources are still evoked in the lore of contemporary Mexico and Guatemala. Professor Taube discusses the different sources for Aztec and Maya myths. The Aztec empire began less than 200 years before the Spanish conquest, and our knowledge of their mythology derives primarily from native colonial documents and manuscripts commissioned by the Spanish. The Maya mythology is far older, and our knowledge of it comes mainly from native manuscripts of the Classic period, over 600 years before the Spanish conquest. Drawing on these sources as well as nineteenth- and twentieth-century excavations and research, including the interpretation of the codices and the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing, the author discusses, among other things, the Popol Vuh myths of the Maya, the flood myth of Northern Yucatan, and the Aztec creation myths.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r4zYyu6e7eMC&dq=Aztec+and+Maya+Myths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science","description":"Become a master of audio.

The country, once secular, is now thrown back into an orthodoxy that threatens to tear it apart. The United States and Russia go on high alert, with warships heading to the Middle East. The region becomes a powder keg, waiting to explode. Caught up in the revolution are a British helicopter company and its pilots. The oil fields of Iran need helicopters to ferry workers and administrators, and when the main US aviation company pulls out of Iran fearing what might come next, S-G Helicopters steps in to fill the void. Soon they realize that they, too, must leave or risk losing all their machines to whomever takes control of the country. The company risks bankruptcy if that happens which would ruin Andrew Gallavan and reveal that the company is actually owned by a secret Hong Kongbased consortium: Noble House, controlled by the Struan family. Caught in between is his son, Scot, a pilot in Iran who must help save his father s company, but also the other pilots and their families. In a risky move, the pilots concoct a plan to get their choppers out of Iran. But will they be able to escape a country crumbling around them before it s too late? A rich panoply of characters brings to life the events of forty years ago, events that even now have ramifications throughout the Middle East and beyond. Fast-paced and full of action and intrigue, Whirlwind is an intricately plotted and detailed tale of war, love, and the ingenuity of the human spirit, told by James Clavell, the unparalleled master of historical fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5FNuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mysticism in religion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gYQoAAAAYAAJ&dq=Mysticism+in+religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A HISTORY OF THE CHURCH IN ENGLAND 3RD EDITION","description":"History of the Church in England","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6PwyEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+HISTORY+OF+THE+CHURCH+IN+ENGLAND+3RD+EDITION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barron's ACT, 2007-2008 with CD-ROM (Barron's ACT (W/CD))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Genesis: Volume 1 (Daily Study Bible (Westminster Hardcover))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Writing and Difference","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Golden fleece","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Understanding Audio: Getting the Most Out of Your Project or Professional Recording Studio","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Portable Conrad: 2 (Viking portable library, P33)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Low-Carb Meals in Minutes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Great Lakes Trees & Wildflowers: An Introduction to Familiar Species (Regional Nature Guides)","description":"Of Michigan's great wealth of natural resources, few have been more important in the past or are more highly valued today than our forests and the trees which compose them.

William Randolph Hearst, known to his staff as the Chief, was a brilliant business strategist and a man of prodigious appetites. By the 1930s, he controlled the largest publishing empire in the United States, including twenty-eight newspapers, the Cosmopolitan Picture Studio, radio stations, and thirteen magazines. He quickly learned how to use this media stronghold to achieve unprecedented political power. The son of a gold miner, Hearst underwent a public metamorphosis from Harvard dropout to political kingmaker; from outspoken populist to opponent of the New Deal; and from citizen to congressman. In The Chief, David Nasaw presents an intimate portrait of the man famously characterized in the classic film Citizen Kane. With unprecedented access to Hearst s personal and business papers, Nasaw details Heart s relationship with his wife Millicent and his romance with Marion Davies; his interactions with Hitler, Mussolini, Churchill, and every American president from Grover Cleveland to Franklin Roosevelt; and his acquaintance with movie giants such as Louis B.

In a first prose translation, Professors Mignani and Di Cesare succeed in conveying the vitality and sly humor of the original. The poem consists of a loosely unified series of fourteen amorous adventures of the Archpriest of Hita, interlaced with debates, fabliaux, fables, and exempla. Ruiz suggests that while man ought to seek buen amor (true love, or love of God), he is prone to loco amor, or worldly love. The Book proposes to show human folly so that men may be forewarned of the bad and choose the good. The episodes related in the stanzas and in songs in various lyrical styles parody such conventions as courtly love, epic battle, or church ritual. Ruiz was clearly fascinated by the concrete, as well as the allegorical, for his episodes have dates and actual settings, and popular speech is incorporated into his verses. In their introduction, the translators survey the major scholarly studies of the poem and offer their own critical reading of it. Their annotated bibliography and notes to the translation will be useful to students as well as scholars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-n-mAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Book+of+Good+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deception (Baron Novels)","description":"The complete revamping of Catherine Coulter's 1983 Signet Regency, An Intimate Deception, led to this: a full-bodied historical romance with a new beginning and a new ending.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRM8yrTe5KMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cops: The Men and Women Behind the Badge","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Vermont (America the Beautiful, Second)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"3d Game Programming All in One","description":"3D GAME PROGRAMMING ALL IN ONE, THIRD EDITION is perfect for anyone interested in learning the skills and processes involved in making 3D games.

Writing the Trail continues in this vein by providing a comparative literary analysis of five frontier narratives---Susan Magoffin s Down the Santa Fe Trail and into Mexico, Sarah Royce s A Frontier Lady, Louise Clappe s The Shirley Letters, Eliza Farnham s California, In-doors and Out, and Lydia Spencer Lane s I Married a Soldier---to explore the ways in which women s responses to the western environment differed from men s. Throughout their very different journeys---from an eighteen-year-old bride and self-styled  wandering princess  on the Santa Fe Trail, to the mining camps of northern California, to garrison life in the Southwest---these women moved out of their traditional positions as objects of masculine culture. Initially disoriented, they soon began the complex process of assimilating to a new environment, changing views of power and authority, and making homes in wilderness conditions. Because critics tend to consider nineteenth-century women s writings as confirmations of home and stability, they overlook aspects of women s textualizations of themselves that are dynamic and contingent on movement through space. As the narratives in Writing the Trail illustrate, women s frontier writings depict geographical, spiritual, and psychological movement. By tracing the journeys of Magoffin, Royce, Clappe, Farnham, and Lane, readers are exposed to the subversive strength of travel writing and come to a new understanding of gender roles on the nineteenth-century frontier.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NWHCsg2IuE8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anarquia","description":"Hedy Lamarr and Wernher von Braun join Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, John Dos Passos, Ayn Rand, and a host of others who populate Linaweaver and Hastings' universe in the alternate history Spanish Civil War universe of \\"Anarquma.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWOtPQAACAAJ&dq=Anarquia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Major League Baseball 2002 Day-To-Day Calendar","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kbZqU_Ib8K4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of Korea (The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations)","description":"Chronicles the history of Korea, from prehistoric and medieval times through its conflicts with Japan and the twentieth-century creation of a North and South Korea.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=h4WhAna6dlMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the rise and influence of the spirit of rationalism in Europe","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Understanding Realism (Understanding the Moving Image)","description":"In a world, in which camcorders and CCTV are witness to our every move and Big Brother and The Blair Witch Project are phenomenally popular and widely imitated, the divide between reality and liction has become increasingly blurred.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bGr8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 95 Exam Cram: The First and Last Book You'll Need to Read Before You Take the New Certification Exam for Windows 95!","description":"Providing a special Exam Cram Sheet with tips, acronyms, and memory joggers that readers can take with them to the exam, this book serves as a complement to study guides for Exam #70-078: Implementing and Supporting Proxy Server 2.

Exploring the themes begun in his first book, The Other Man Was Me, Campo extends the search for identity into new realms of fantasy and physicality. He travels inwardly to the most intimate spaces of the imagination where sexuality and gender collide and where life crosses into death. Whether facing a frenetic hospital emergency room to assess a patient critically ill with AIDS, or breathing in the quiet of his mother's closet, Campo proposes with these poems an alternative means of healing and exposes the extent to which words themselves may be the most vital working parts of our bodies. The secret truths in What the Body Told, as the title implies, are already within each of us; in these vivid and provocative poems, Rafael Campo gives them a voice. Lost in the Hospital It's not that I don't like the hospital. Those small bouquets of flowers, pert and brave. The smell of antiseptic cleansers. The ill, so wistful in their rooms, so true. My friend, the one who's dying, took me out To where the patients go to smoke, IV's And oxygen tanks attached to them-- A tiny patio for skeletons. We shared A cigaratte, which was delicious but Too brief. I held his hand; it felt Like someone's keys. How beautiful it was, The sunlight pointing down at us, as if We were important, full of life, unbound.

To be out in the open where fish are; to watch them at their great business of living; to see them in the water or out of the water; to fish for them, and even to hook them and have them get away-all this is wonderfully worthwhile-wonderfully better worthwhile than merely to catch and keep the stiffening fading body of one of the most beautiful forms of life. Gifford Pinchot, twice governor of Pennsylvania and America s premier fisherman presents twenty-three personal experiences in story form. From the mountain streams of Pennsylvania to the scented isles of the South Seas, the author weaves a magic web of angling enchantment.

The contributors use feminist and historical perspectives to illustrate how place, understood as both social context and geographic setting, shaped nursing identities and practices. Many nurses found place both liberating and constraining ? often simultaneously. Paying attention to place also situates these nurses and their work within larger historical themes of nation-building, war, and political change.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bMdfCJX97fsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Life and Travels: An Anthology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HZnKcQAACAAJ&dq=My+Life+and+Travels:+An+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Writing the College Application Essay: The Key to Acceptance at the College of Your Choice (HarperResource book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of the Islamic peoples (Capricorn books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Van Gogh in Space: Infinity City - Book 1","description":"What would happen if the famous 19th century artist VINCENT VAN GOGH found himself in a far future world -- an amazing world built within a black hole?

First published in 1979 to critical acclaim, winning the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Gnostic Gospels has continued to grow in reputation and influence over the past two decades. It is now widely recognized as one of the most brilliant and accessible histories of early Christian spirituality published in our time. In 1945 an Egyptian peasant unearthed what proved to be the Gnostic Gospels, thirteen papyrus volumes that expounded a radically different view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from that of the New Testament. In this spellbinding book, renowned religious scholar Elaine Pagels elucidates the mysteries and meanings of these sacred texts both in the world of the first Christians and in the context of Christianity today. With insight and passion, Pagels explores a remarkable range of recently discovered gospels, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, to show how a variety of  Christianities  emerged at a time of extraordinary spiritual upheaval. Some Christians questioned the need for clergy and church doctrine, and taught that the divine could be discovered through spiritual search. Many others, like Buddhists and Hindus, sought enlightenment and access to God within. Such explorations raised questions: Was the resurrection to be understood symbolically and not literally? Was God to be envisioned only in masculine form, or feminine as well? Was martyrdom a necessary or worthy expression of faith? These early Christians dared to ask questions that orthodox Christians later suppressed and their explorations led to profoundly different visions of Jesus and his message. Brilliant, provocative, and stunning in its implications, The Gnostic Gospels is a radical, eloquent reconsideration of the origins of the Christian faith.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BWvxehGJ6Q0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saying Grace","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Just Listen 'N Learn French Plus","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Birnbaum 2001 Walt Disney World: Expert Advice from the Inside Source (Birnbaums Walt Disney World, 2001)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aftershocks (Colonization, Book 3)","description":" ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE SERIES OF ALTERNATIVE HISTORY NOVELS EVER WRITTEN.

The only recorded history of this company is now available in a deluxe 10  x 10 , 128-page hardbound book from Heimburger House Publishing Company and written by Marietta resident Richard L. Hillman. The amazing archives of its historic records allows for a complete description of this fascinating company. From the first engine that rolled out of the Glover shops in 1902 to the removal of the last steam locomotive from the plant in 1995, Glover Machine Works followed the rise and fall of the lumbering and mining industries of the South. Although Glover locomotive production never rivaled companies such as Alco or Baldwin, Glover provided as many as 200 small steam locomotives in several gauges to a variety of companies in a dozen states and the same number of foreign countries, mostly in the Caribbean and South America. Learn about the various wheel arrangements, weights, tractive efforts and gauges as you step back in time with each page. The Glover plant turned out 0-4-0s, 0-4-2s, 0-4-4s, 0-6-0s, 0-6-2s, 0-6-4s, 2-6-0s, 2-8-0s and 4-6-0s in eight different gauges including 24 , 36  and standard gauge. By 1930, the firm had expanded into other types of industrial products to fill the locomotive void, and left the locomotive business to others. This book proudly features many of the glass plate negatives that were retained by Glover in the plant archives where hundreds of original documents, catalogs and photographs were stored for many years. The Eastman Kodak Company helped supply materials in producing the Glover archive photographs. Lavishly illustrated with 230 pictures and many builder s photos, this book contains eight chapters and a locomotive roster, a photo gallery illustrating the locomotives and a chapter entitled Puzzle Pages. The Glover Machine Works, now dissolved and the plant torn down, continues to evoke memories of small, distinctive steam engines that made their way mostly into the South s stone and marble quarries and lumbering operations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d0YdPQAACAAJ&dq=Glover+Steam+Locomotives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Space Calculated in Seconds","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When Tigers Fight: The Story of the Sino-Japanese War, 1937-1945","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qF8UAQAAIAAJ&dq=When+Tigers+Fight:+The+Story+of+the+Sino-Japanese+War,+1937-1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poland and Germany : a reply to Congressman B.

Colin Bird examines the assumption, held both by liberals and by their strongest critics, that the values and ideals of the liberal political tradition cohere around a distinctively 'individualist' conception of the relation between individuals, society and the state. He concludes that the formula of 'liberal individualism' conceals fundamental conflicts between liberal views of these relations, conflicts that neither liberals nor their critics have adequately recognized. His interesting and provocative study develops a powerful criticism of the libertarian forms of 'liberal individualism' which have risen to prominence, and suggests that by taking this term for granted, theorists have exaggerated the unity and integrity of liberal political ideals and limited our perception of the issues they raise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1JQDQ0SYNnYC&dq=The+Myth+of+Liberal+Individualism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America--and What We Can Do About It","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ? An impassioned clarion call to return to the traditional values that served generations of civil rights heroes in order to overcome the obstacles faced by black Americans today  Written in the tradition of DuBois and King, Enough is an impressively powerful and courageous book.  David J. Garrow, Pulitzer Prizewinning author of Bearing the Cross Half a century after brave Americans took to the streets to raise the bar of opportunity for all races, Juan Williams writes that too many black Americans are in crisis caught in a twisted hip-hop culture, dropping out of school, ending up in jail, having babies when they are not ready to be parents, and falling to the bottom in twenty-first-century global economic competition. Williams makes the case that while there is still racism, it is way past time for black Americans to open their eyes to the  culture of failure  that exists within their community. He raises the banner of proud black traditional values self-help, strong families, and belief in God that sustained black people through generations of oppression and flowered in the exhilarating promise of the modern civil rights movement. Williams asks what happened to keeping our eyes on the prize by proving the case for equality with black excellence and achievement. Reinforcing his incisive observations with solid research and alarming statistical data, Williams offers a concrete plan for overcoming the obstacles that now stand in the way of African Americans  full participation in the nation s freedom and prosperity. Certain to be widely discussed and vehemently debated, Enough is a bold, perceptive, solution-based look at African American life, culture, and politics today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D2LjLL8YYXUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rev.

Covering every Sunday of the three-year liturgical cycle, as well as Christmas Day, Epiphany, and Ascension Day, the readings are arranged in canonical order so as to be of use to all preachers.

As the only child of the Prince Regent and Caroline of Brunswick, Princess Charlotte of Wales (1796-1817) was the heiress presumptive to the throne. Her parents  marriage had already broken up by the time she was born. She had a difficult childhood and a turbulent adolescence, but she was popular with the public, who looked to her to restore the good name of the monarchy. When she broke off her engagement to a Dutch prince, her father put her under virtual imprisonment, and she endured a period of profound unhappiness. But she held out for the freedom to choose her husband, and when she married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, she finally achieved contentment. Her happiness was cruelly cut short when she died in childbirth at the age of twenty-one, only eighteen months later. A shocked nation went into mourning for its  people s princess,  the queen who never was.  This perspicacious study of Charlotte s short life is superb.

Of the world's 100 largest economies, fifty-one are now corporations, only forty-nine are nation-states. The sales of General Motors and Ford are greater than the GDP (gross domestic product) of the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, and Wal-Mart now has a turnover higher than the revenues of most of the states of Eastern Europe. Yet few of us are fully aware of the growing dominance of big business: newspapers continue to place news of the actions of governments on the front page, with business news relegated to the inside pages. But do governments really have more influence over our lives than businesses? Do the parties for which we vote have any real freedom of choice in their actions? Already sparking intense debate in England and on the Continent, The Silent Takeover provides a new and startling take on the way we live now and who really governs us. The widely acclaimed young socio-economist Noreena Hertz brilliantly and passionately reveals how corporations across the world manipulate and pressure governments by means both legal and illegal; how protest, be it in the form of the protesters of Seattle and Genoa or the boycotting of genetically altered foods, is often becoming a more effective political weapon than the ballot-box; and how corporations in many parts of the world are taking over from the state responsibility for everything from providing technology for schools to healthcare for the community. While the activities of business, frequently under pressure from the media and the consuming public, can range from the beneficial to the pernicious, neither public protest nor corporate power is in any way democratic. What is the fate of democracy in the world of the silent takeover? The Silent Takeover asks us to recognize the growing contradictions of a world divided between haves and have-nots, of gated communities next to ghettos, of extreme poverty and unbelievable riches. In the face of these unacceptable extremes, Noreena Hertz outlines a new agenda to revitalize politics and renew democracy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGZ6N7iJwMAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ernest Holmes: His Life and Times","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pUesAAAACAAJ&dq=Ernest+Holmes:+His+Life+and+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey to the South: A Calabrian Homecoming","description":"Ever since Annie got together with Ciccio, his Calabrian family have spoken of their homeland as an earthly paradise, of wild nights dancing the tarantella, of almond milk sold fresh from roadside stalls, of honey cakes and amaro made from wild liquorice roots...

Yet some men are born to dare, and Halliburton was one these. NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER was Halliburton s third book and contains a knapsack full of that adventurer s gold dreams brought to reality by the alchemy of his courage and daring. The book details how Halliburton set off for Latin America in search of adventure, and find it he did. He dived to the bottom of the Mayan Well of Death, from which hundreds of skeletons had been dredged, then swam fifty miles down the length of the Panama Canal. Not content, he climbed to the crest of Mexico s lofty Mount Popocatepetl, twice, and roamed over the infamous Devil s Island. Yet his most amazing adventure occurred when he had himself marooned on the same island which had once held Robinson Crusoe captive.  Somewhere a lizard stirred the leaves...Furtively I looked about me, realizing that in the darkness the boa-constrictors would be abroad creeping forth from the ancient tombs and slinking down the leafy avenues,  Halliburton wrote.

Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case. It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the \\"soul of pampered self-absorption\\"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YjxITJFUDhoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval Tapestry Designs (International Design Library)","description":"\\"A Barbara Holdridge book\\"--P.

With over 7,000 entries, it is a one-volume irreplaceable reference work book for the student, teacher, general consumer and real-estate, financial and law professionals. This completed book-which includes a preface; a table of contents, a Spanish index and two appendixes is designed to satisfy the need of the enormous Hispanic bilingual market for accurate English definitions and Spanish translations. This book has no competitors. In English, the closest competitor is Barron's \\"Dictionary of Real Estate Terms,\\" but that is available only in English. The only bilingual book currently available, \\"Bienes Raices\\": An English-Spanish Real Estate Dictionary (Dearborn 1996), defines in ungrammatical Spanish only 800 terms (in 130 pages), compared to more than 3,000 terms in The Bilingual Real Estate Bridge (in over 500 single-spaced manuscript pages, 350,475 words). Under the entry for damages in The Bilingual Real Estate Bridge, for instance, all nine types of damages are listed, under the entry for lease, all lease terms (from absolute net to triple-net) are listed, under quitclaim all grants and conveyances are listed. There is a growing need in the real estate and financial community for a simple way to translate technical real-estate terms for the Hispanic population, not only in the United States but in Canada as well. The Spanish Index makes the book useful for speakers of both languages, English speaking only and Spanish-speaking only and extends the market to all of Latin America and Spain. According to the 2000 U.S. CensusBureau, the Hispanic population now comprises 12.4% of the U. S. Population. It is projected that Hispanic purchasing power will reach 650 billion in 2006, and over two million Hispanic have some form of college education. This translated into a burgeoning real estate market and means that a reference book like The Bilingual Real Estate Bridge is long overdue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9pahAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Bilingual+Real+Estate+Bridge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Moment for Me","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"HOW TO TALK TO PRACTICALLY ANYONE ABOUT PRACTICALLY ANYTHING","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Anthroposophy in Everyday Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mary Baker Eddy: The years of trial","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Magic Moments in Florence","description":"Consists of sketches and drawings the author made on successive trips to Florence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nIQnAgAACAAJ&dq=Magic+Moments+in+Florence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Bennet's least favorite daughter.

It was the ancestor of most of the important laces that have since been made in Europe, and surviving specimens are the treasured possessions of the great museums of the world. Federico Vinciolo is one of the masters within this art. A leading Venetian designer, he was summoned in France to the court of Henry II, probably by Catherine de Medici, where he had the monopoly on manufacturing lace neck ruffs. In 1587 Vinciolo published a collection of his best patterns and designs, Les singuliers et nouveaux pourtraicts, which went through more than a dozen printings in France and Italy. It remains one of the basic books in the history of lace. For the modern needleworker who wishes to recapture the charm of this antique lace, Vinciolo's book offers 98 plates of fine patterns and designs in various techniques: needlepoint, darned netting, point coup , counted thread work, and others. These include geometric forms, exuberant treatment of classical motives, Italian and Levantine designs, and mush else that the modern worker, able to pick out a pattern, can re-create. Most of this material is nowhere else available. Vinciolo's designs are also of interest to the graphic artist who wishes delicate yet forceful textile images.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g2sWAwAAQBAJ&dq=Renaissance+Patterns+for+Lace,+Embroidery+and+Needlepoint+(Dover+Knitting,+Crochet,+Tatting,+Lace)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men Against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America, 1827-1908","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Yellowstone Faithful","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shotokan's Secret: The Hidden Truth Behind Karate's Fighting Origins","description":"Learn how the hard-style karate that became shotokan took shape in 19th century Okinawa as an embattled king with an unarmed force of bodyguards faced an armed invasion from overseas.

A man ahead of his time, Japanese college professor Masao Takashimaya of Kyoto had a passion for modern ideas that was as strong as his wife s belief in ancient traditions. His eighteen-year-old daughter, Hiroko, torn between her mother s traditions and her father s wishes, boarded the SS Nagoya Maru to come to California for an education and to make her father proud. It was August 1941. From the ship, she went to the Palo Alto home of her uncle, Takeo, and his family. To Hiroko, California was a different world. Her cousins had become more American than Japanese. And much to Hiroko s surprise, Peter Jenkins, her uncle s assistant at Stanford, became an unexpected link between her old world and her new. On December 7, Pearl Harbor is bombed by the Japanese. Within hours, war is declared and suddenly Hiroko has become an enemy in a foreign land. On February 19, Executive Order 9066 is signed by President Roosevelt, giving the military the power to remove the Japanese from their communities at will. Takeo and his family are given ten days to sell their home, give up their jobs, and report to a relocation center, along with thousands of other Japanese and Japanese Americans, to face their destinies there. Families are divided, people are forced to abandon their homes, their businesses, their freedom, and their lives. Danielle Steel portrays not only the human cost of that terrible time in history, but also the remarkable courage of a people whose honor and dignity transcended the chaos that surrounded them.

Along the way, Weinberger explores Franklin's ribald humor, usually ignored or toned down by historians and critics, and shows it to be charming - and philosophic.\\".","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A7rtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Benjamin+Franklin,+Politician:+The+Mask+and+the+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruddy Gore (Phryne Fisher Mysteries)","description":"\\"The appeal of this story is the glimpse it provides into the 1920s theater world and the opportunity it affords to observe Phryne and Lin Chung's romance from its inception.\\"  Booklist Running late to the Hinkler gala performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore, Phryne Fisher meets some thugs in a dark alley and handles them convincingly before they can ruin her silver dress. Phryne then finds that she has rescued the handsome Lin Chung and his grandmother and is briefly mistaken for a deity. Denying divinity but accepting cognac, she later continues safely to the theatre. But the unexpected continues as the performance is interrupted by a most bizarre death onstage.

Drawn backstage and onstage, Phryne must solve an old murder, find a new murderer and of course, banish the theatre's ghost who seems likely to kill again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0AaBDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aberrant: Teragen","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Interaction Effects in Multiple Regression (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Birder's Bible: The Ultimate Bird Watching Reference Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Nantucket Diary of Ned Rorem, 1973-1985","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Remote depossession","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lvl_PQAACAAJ&dq=Remote+depossession&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children's Bedtime Treasury","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Whispers from an Empty Coffin","description":"A testament to American veterans past and present, and what began as a simple family tree project, evolved this true-life tale of an 'ordinary' man's extraordinary life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8kGIAAAACAAJ&dq=Whispers+from+an+Empty+Coffin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The master mariner, book 2: Darken ship : the unfinished novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"John Walkenbach's Favorite Excel Tips & Tricks","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Miss Silver Comes to Stay","description":"The British governess-turned-sleuth visits a small village hiding big secrets in this  timelessly charming  cozy mystery series (Charlotte MacLeod).

Rutherford brings England s New Forest to life  (The Seattle Times) in this companion to the critically acclaimed Sarum From the time of the Norman Conquest to the present day, the New Forest, along England s southern coast, has remained an almost mythical place. It is here that Saxon and Norman kings rode forth with their hunting parties, and where William the Conqueror s son Rufus was mysteriously killed. The mighty oaks of the forest were used to build the ships for Admiral Nelson s navy, and the fishermen who lived in Christchurch and Lymington helped Sir Francis Drake fight off the Spanish Armada. The New Forest is the perfect backdrop for the families who people this epic story. The feuds, wars, loyalties, and passions of many hundreds of years reach their climax in a crime that shatters the decorous society of Bath in the days of Jane Austen, whose family lived on the edge of the Forest. Edward Rutherfurd is a master storyteller whose sense of place and character both fictional and historical is at its most vibrant in The Forest.

David Hackworth, author of About Face). In November 1965, some 450 men of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. They were the first major engagements between the US Army and the People s Army of Vietnam. How these Americans persevered sacrificing themselves for their comrades and never giving up creates a vivid portrait of war at its most devastating and inspiring. Lt. Gen. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting interviewed hundreds of men who fought in the battle, including the North Vietnamese commanders. Their poignant account rises above the ordeal it chronicles to depict men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have once found unimaginable.

Jason  . Josephson-Storm argues that as broad cultural history goes, this narrative is wrong, as attempts to suppress magic have failed more often than they have succeeded. Even the human sciences have been more enchanted than is commonly supposed. But that raises the question: How did a magical, spiritualist, mesmerized Europe ever convince itself that it was disenchanted? Josephson-Storm traces the history of the myth of disenchantment in the births of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, folklore, psychoanalysis, and religious studies. Ironically, the myth of mythless modernity formed at the very time that Britain, France, and Germany were in the midst of occult and spiritualist revivals. Indeed, Josephson-Storm argues, these disciplines  founding figures were not only aware of, but profoundly enmeshed in, the occult milieu; and it was specifically in response to this burgeoning culture of spirits and magic that they produced notions of a disenchanted world. By providing a novel history of the human sciences and their connection to esotericism, The Myth of Disenchantment dispatches with most widely held accounts of modernity and its break from the premodern past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j5UtDwAAQBAJ&dq=Disenchantment,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rocko and Spanky Have Company","description":"Rocko and Spanky, twin sock monkeys, get ready for a visit from their mother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M7KhFLni-BMC&dq=Rocko+and+Spanky+Have+Company&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walk on the Wild Side","description":"New Orleans in the 1930s is the seamy world of lost and lovelorn Dove Linkhorn and Kitty Twist, of their lust and violence, and of their toughness and survival","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=abo0A-o8QUYC&dq=Walk+on+the+Wild+Side&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kinnick: The man and the legend","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T7mXGAAACAAJ&dq=Kinnick:+The+man+and+the+legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The War on Our Freedoms: Civil Liberties in an Age of Terrorism","description":"In each generation, for different reasons, America witnesses a tug of war between the instinct to suppress and the instinct for openness. Today, with the perception of a mortal threat from terrorists, the instinct to suppress is in the ascendancy. Part of the reason for this is the trauma that our country experienced on September 11, 2001, and part of the reason is that the people who are in charge of our government are inclined to use the suppression of information as a management strategy. Rather than waiting ten or fifteen years to point out what's wrong with the current rush to limit civil liberties in the name of \\"national security,\\" these essays by top thinkers, scholars, journalists, and historians lift the veil on what is happening and why the implications are dangerous and disturbing and ultimately destructive of American values and ideals. Without our even being aware, the judiciary is being undermined, the press is being intimidated, racial profiling is rampant, and our privacy is being invaded.

Many will be caught up in the vortex of a conflagration so great that they very well may be destroyed. Few believers - if any at all - are spiritually prepared for such a devastating ordeal. Gene Edwards raises a new standard of conduct for Christians who find themselves in such a crisis, and points them to a way out . . . unscarred.

But is the new approach of the Trump administration military disengagement coupled with unquestioning support for key allies--Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia the way forward? In this edited volume, noted experts on the region lay out a better long-term strategy for protecting U.S. interests in the Middle East. The authors articulate a vision that is both self-interested and carefully tailored to the unique dynamics of the increasingly divergent sub-regions in the Middle East, including North Africa, the Sunni Arab bloc of Egypt and Persian Gulf states, and the increasingly chaotic Levant. The book argues that the most effective way to pursue and protect U.S. interests is unlikely to involve the same alliance-centric approach that has been the basis of Washington s policy since the 1990s. Instead, the United States should adopt a nimbler and less military-dominant strategy that relies on a diversified set of partners and a determination to establish priorities for American interests and the use of resources, both financial and military. In essence, the book calls for a new post-Obama and post-Trump approach to the region that reflects the fact that U.S. interests are changing and likely will continue to change. The book offers a fresh perspective in advance of the 2020 presidential election.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UXGMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The amphibians","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Killigrew and the North-West Passage (Killigrew series)","description":"Maritime action in the frozen Arctic 1852: It would be one of the most famous rescue missions ever attempted.

Taking a fresh approach to one of the most divisive political issues of our time, David Guti rrez explores the ways that nearly a century of steady immigration from Mexico has shaped ethnic politics in California and Texas, the two largest U.S. border states. Drawing on an extensive body of primary and secondary sources, Guti rrez focuses on the complex ways that their pattern of immigration influenced Mexican Americans' sense of social and cultural identity and, as a consequence, their politics. He challenges the most cherished American myths about U.S. immigration policy, pointing out that, contrary to rhetoric about \\"alien invasions,\\" U.S. government and regional business interests have actively recruited Mexican and other foreign workers for over a century, thus helping to establish and perpetuate the flow of immigrants into the United States. In addition, Guti rrez offers a new interpretation of the debate over assimilation and multiculturalism in American society. Rejecting the notion of the melting pot, he explores the ways that ethnic Mexicans have resisted assimilation and fought to create a cultural space for themselves in distinctive ethnic communities throughout the southwestern United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DaQwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Walls+and+Mirrors:+Mexican+Americans,+Mexican+Immigrants,+and+the+Politics+of+Ethnicity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stalker: Death Run","description":"The third book in the series featuring Jason Stalker, special investigator of serial killings.

Yet, Robert Warrior argues, nonfiction has been the primary form used by American Indians in developing a relationship with the written word, one that reaches back much further in Native history and culture. Focusing on autobiographical writings and critical essays, as well as communally authored and political documents, The People and the Word explores how the Native tradition of nonfiction has both encompassed and dissected Native experiences. Warrior begins by tracing a history of American Indian writing from the eighteenth century to the late twentieth century, then considers four particular moments: Pequot intellectual William Apess s autobiographical writings from the 1820s and 1830s; the Osage Constitution of 1881; narratives from American Indian student experiences, including accounts of boarding school in the late 1880s; and modern Kiowa writer N. Scott Momaday s essay  The Man Made of Words,  penned during the politically charged 1970s. Warrior s discussion of Apess s work looks unflinchingly at his unconventional life and death; he recognizes resistance to assimilation in the products of the student print shop at the Santee Normal Training School; and in the Osage Constitution, as well as in Momaday s writing, Warrior sees reflections of their turbulent times as well as guidance for our own. Taking a cue from Momaday s essay, which gives voice to an imaginary female ancestor, Ko-Sahn, Warrior applies both critical skills and literary imagination to the texts. In doing so, The People and the Word provides a rich foundation for Native intellectuals  critical work, deeply entwined with their unique experiences. Robert Warrior is professor of English and Native American studies at the University of Oklahoma. He is author of Tribal Secrets: Recovering American Indian Intellectual Traditions (Minnesota, 1994) and coauthor, with Paul Chaat Smith, of Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZkhIAna_F7wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaiian Coral Reef Coloring (Naturencyclopedia Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bookmark Mania (Craft Book) (No. 50)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mantram Handbook","description":"The mantram, or mantra, is a short, powerful, spiritual formula from the world s great traditions, repeated silently in the mind, anytime, anywhere.

Indeed, the magazine's vision of sexual liberation, high living, and \\"the good life\\" came to define mainstream images of postwar life. In exploring the history of America's most widely read and influential men's magazine, Elizabeth Fraterrigo hones in on the values, style, and gender formulations put forth in its pages and how they gained widespread currency in American culture. She shows that for Hugh Hefner, the \\"good life\\" meant the freedom to choose a lifestyle, and the one he promoted was the \\"playboy life,\\" in which expensive goods and sexually available women were plentiful, obligations were few, and if one worked hard enough, one could enjoy abundant leisure and consumption. In support of this view, Playboy attacked early marriage, traditional gender arrangements, and sanctions against premarital sex, challenging the conservatism of family-centered postwar society. And despite the magazine's ups and downs, significant features of this \\"playboy life\\" have become engrained in American society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eVnPQEJkLRMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music Makes Memories: The Pilgrimage","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Four Year Colleges 2004, Guide to (Peterson's Four Year Colleges)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Riven: The Sequel to Myst: The Official Strategy Guide (Secrets of the Games Series)","description":"This strategy guide offers hints to solving the puzzles of Riven, as well as maps which provide a step-by-step path through Riven","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S0mQhg9-RG8C&dq=Riven:+The+Sequel+to+Myst:+The+Official+Strategy+Guide+(Secrets+of+the+Games+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Falling Leaves of Ivy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"World Factbook, 2001","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chosen by Fate: Life and Death Inside Death Row Records","description":"Looks at the violent business practices and history of Death Row Records, from the inside perspective of the bodyguard of rap artist Snoop Doggy Dogg","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gp-fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Chosen+by+Fate:+Life+and+Death+Inside+Death+Row+Records&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Party Book: 1001 Creative Ideas for Fun Parties","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tai Chi Made Easy: A Step-By-Step Guide to Health and Relaxation","description":"Learn this ancient art form and its health benefits.

In order to convey the full complexity of American political thought during this era, Kuehne provides an exhaustive study of the Massachusetts Congregationalist clergy, one of the founding's most politically influential, but often overlooked, groups. Because Congregationalism was the established religion of the time, the Congregational church functioned as the spiritual and political center of each parish. The Sunday worship services were the primary social activity of the parish and the most effective means of disseminating news and education throughout the colony. The minister was usually the most educated and visible person in the parish and, as such, held a position of considerable influence, which was often used for political purposes. Examining sermons from 1760 to 1790, Kuehne details the transformation of the ministers' thought and provides unique insight into the intellectual and religious roots of the American founding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_2BAAAAMAAJ&dq=Massachusetts+Congregationalist+Political+Thought,+1760-1790:+The+Design+of+Heaven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlantic Fury","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Indian removal;: The emigration of the Five civilized tribes of Indians (The civilization of the American Indian)","description":"Studies the means by which the nineteenth-century white man uprooted the Southern Indians and pushed them Westward","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L8ZOg03I0s0C&dq=Indian+removal%3B:+The+emigration+of+the+Five+civilized+tribes+of+Indians+(The+civilization+of+the+American+Indian)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brazilian Jujutsu: Side-Mount Techniques","description":"Detailing over 100 moves through photographic sequences and detailed captions, this volume uses Moreira's \\"sequential teaching\\" style to delineate the network of options available to combatants dealing with side-mount situations.

True to his contrarian style, Hitchens is both admiring and aggressive, sympathetic yet critical, taking true measure of his subject as hero and problem. Answering both the detractors and the false claimants, Hitchens tears down the fa?ade of sainthood erected by the hagiographers and rebuts the critics point by point. He examines Orwell and his perspectives on fascism, empire, feminism, and Englishness, as well as his outlook on America, a country and culture toward which he exhibited much ambivalence. Whether thinking about empires or dictators, race or class, nationalism or popular culture, Orwell's moral outlook remains indispensable in a world that has undergone vast changes in the seven decades since his death. Combining the best of Hitchens' polemical punch and intellectual elegance in a tightly woven and subtle argument, this book addresses not only why Orwell matters today, but how he will continue to matter in a future, uncertain world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=viPLBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horace and Morris Join the Chorus (but what about Dolores?)

As a member of the generation of planners following Camillo Sitte and preceding the emergence of the modern planners of the 1920s, Unwin considered planning a design-based discipline rather than a purely technical one. He believed that artistic and practical criteria were mutually supportive and carried this out in his work by creating plans that represented a unity of art, science, and technology. Unwin is perhaps the greatest figure of the Garden City movement, which has had a tremendous impact on planning in both Europe and the United States. Although Town Planning has become the bible of neo-traditionalist planners, this book is not a nostalgic view of past planning ideas; rather, it is a useful, forward-looking book that holds valuable lessons for today's planners. Its insightful critical analyses of many towns throughout Europe and the United States are accompanied by photographs, plans, drawings, and six foldout maps. This reprint of Town Planning in Practice includes a new preface by Andres Duany and an introduction by Walter Creese.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1F5UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Town+planning+in+practice%3B:+An+introduction+to+the+art+of+designing+cities+and+suburbs,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Negative","description":"Release the negative thoughts and feelings that are weighing you down with #1 New York Times bestselling author and Lakewood Church pastor Joel Osteen. It's easy to go through life holding on to things that are weighing you down. Guilt. Resentment. Doubt. Worry. The problem is when you allow these things in, they're taking up space for the good things that should be there. Imagine your life is like a container. You were created to be filled with joy, peace, confidence, creativity. But if you allow worry, shame, and other negativity in, it pushes out good thoughts. Life is too short to go through it with negative things holding you down. The Scripture says, \\"Give no place to the enemy.\\" Give no place to worry. Give no place to bitterness. You control what's in your container. You control what you think about, what you choose to allow in. Every morning when you wake up, you need to empty out anything negative from the day before. Empty Out the Negative will help you disregard the ridiculing voices in your head and instead hear God and his grace.

Probably not very satisfactory to the critics. The most disgruntled among them will just have to get that time-machine and go back and ask that bright-eyed young twenty-year-old kid about his work.

Ledeen's new book also visits every country in the Near East and describes the terrorist cancers in each. Among many revelations that will attract wide attention: *How the terror network survived the loss of its main sponsor, the Soviet Union. *How the FBI learned from a KGB defector--twenty years before Osama's bin Laden's murderous assault--of the existance of Arab terrorist sleeper networks inside the United States. *How moralistic guidelines straight-jacketed the FBI from even collecting a file of newspaper clippings on known terror groups operating in America. *How the internal culture of the CIA, and severe limitations on its ability to operate, blinded us to the growth of terror networks.

Jenn Shapland s celebrated debut is both question and answer: an immersive, surprising exploration of one of America s most beloved writers, alongside a genre-defying examination of identity, queerness, memory, obsession, and love. Shapland is a graduate student when she first uncovers letters written to Carson McCullers by a woman named Annemarie. Though Shapland recognizes herself in the letters, which are intimate and unabashed in their feelings, she does not see McCullers as history has portrayed her. Her curiosity gives way to fixation, not just with this newly discovered side of McCullers s life, but with how we tell queer love stories. Why, Shapland asks, are the stories of women paved over by others  narratives? What happens when constant revision is required of queer women trying to navigate and self-actualize in straight spaces? And what might the tracing of McCullers s life her history, her secrets, her legacy reveal to Shapland about herself? In smart, illuminating prose, Shapland interweaves her own story with McCullers s to create a vital new portrait of one of our nation s greatest literary treasures, and shows us how the writers we love and the stories we tell about ourselves make us who we are.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5R3CDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cabbages and kings,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Legends of Safed","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=24W3jgEACAAJ&dq=Legends+of+Safed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A crowd of voices","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n36YAAAACAAJ&dq=A+crowd+of+voices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Nationality (Oxford Political Theory)","description":"Nationalism is a dominating force in contemporary politics, but political philosophers have been markedly reluctant to discuss, let alone endorse, nationalist ideas. In this book David Miller defends the principle of nationality. He argues that national identities are valid sources of personal identity; that we are justified in recognizing special obligations to our co-nationals; that nations have good grounds for wanting to be politically self-determining; but that recognizing the claims of nationality does not entail suppressing other sources of personal identity, such as ethnicity. Finally, he considers the claim that national identities are dissolving in the late twentieth century. This timely and provocative book offers the most compelling defence to date of nationality from a radical perspective. Series description Oxford Political Theory presents the best new work in contemporary political theory. It is intended to be broad in scope, including original contributions to political philosophy, and also work in applied political theory.

Shows how artists, inventors, and innovators carry the gene necessary for the future survival of humanity ? Explains why children with the Edison gene are so often mislabeled in public schools as having a disorder ? 10,000 sold in hardcover since August 2003 Thomas Edison was expelled from school for behavior that today would label him as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but his mother understood how to salvage his self-esteem and prepare him for a lifetime of success. In The Edison Gene Thom Hartmann shows that the creativity, impulsiveness, and distractibility that are characteristic of ADHD are not signs of a disorder at all, but instead are components of a highly adaptive skill set utilized by our hunting and gathering ancestors. These characteristics have been critical to the survival and development of our modern civilization and will be vital as humanity faces new challenges in the future. Hartmann, creator of the  hunter versus farmer  theory of ADHD, examines the latest discoveries confirming the existence of an ADHD gene and the global catastrophe 40,000 years ago that triggered its development. Citing examples of significant innovators in our modern era, he argues that the children who possess the  Edison gene  have neurology that is wired to give them brilliant success as innovators, inventors, explorers, and entrepreneurs. He offers concrete strategies for helping Edison-gene children reach their full potential and shows that rather than being  problems,  such children are a vital gift to our society and the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ECJOPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Edison+Gene:+ADHD+and+the+Gift+of+the+Hunter+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evagrius of Pontus: The Greek Ascetic Corpus (Oxford Early Christian Studies)","description":"Evagrius of Pontus (c.345-399) was one of the most prominent figures among the monks of the desert settlements of Nitria, Sketis, and Kellia in Lower Egypt. Through the course of his ascetic writings he formulated a systematic presentation of the teaching of the semi-eremitic monks of these settlements. The works of Evagrius had a profound influence on Eastern Orthodox monastic teaching and passed to the West through the writings of John Cassian (c.365-435). This is the first complete English translation of Evagrius' Greek ascetic writings, based on modern critical editions, where available, and, where they are not, on collations of the principal manuscripts. Two appendices provide variant readings for the Greek texts and the complete text of the long recension of Eulogios.

From the kindergartners arguing on the playground to the world powers storing up technologically advanced weapons, we clearly struggle to coexist peacefully with each other. Yet for all our efforts to generate peace between people, we often overlook the importance of finding peace within ourselves. Though we long for this inner peace, our world full of war, famine, bank collapses, pandemics, and day-to-day struggles has discouraged us from even trying to find it. In his new book, Finding Inner Peace During Troubled Times, author William Moss shows readers that inner peace is indeed attainable in the person and presence of Jesus. As a high-powered businessman and a key political decision-maker, Moss has faced his share of daily distractions. For over a decade, he has studied and practiced the lost art of Christian meditation. \\"I believe God wants us to find peace and will show us the way, if we are willing to accept it. But for many, the peace of God is elusive. They are not sure how to accept it or where to begin in their pursuit of it,\\" says Moss. \\"There are many difficulties, distractions, and hardships that stand in the way of our inner peace. Sometimes these are due to our circumstances. Other times it is our sin or the attitudes of our hearts that stand between us and the inner peace we crave. Through prayer and meditation we can transcend all the distractions and difficulties of our days if we live by the Spirit and put God s love and presence first.\\" Many believers are wary of any form of meditation because of its association with Eastern religions. These Christians might be surprised to learn that meditation was regarded as a key spiritual discipline throughout church history. Eastern meditation focuses on emptying the mind completely. Christians find inner peace by filling their minds with scripture and with the presence of the Holy Spirit. Another fundamental difference is the motivation behind the meditation. Peace, like life, is a gift from God that is for His glory and it is meant to be shared. For those who are in Christ, meditation is not about practicing the kind of self-focus that precludes people from being involved in the solutions of the many problems that confront them. It is communion with God through the Holy Spirit. It is letting go of anger, worry, and fear and taking on the loving, serving character of Christ instead. Finding Inner Peace During Troubled Times uses key scriptures to demonstrate God s gift of peace to every believer. This slender book encourages readers to be intentional about pursuing that peace, even including a simple, step-by-step example of Christian meditation. \\"With the constant stream of media, noise, commitments, conflicts, and other distractions, you will not likely find times of quiet, stillness, and spiritual reflection unless you plan them, unless you pursue meditation as a discipline,\\" states Moss. \\"The key to inner peace and a fulfilled life is one that is grounded in Christian mediation.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-HviQgAACAAJ&dq=Know+Peace+in+Troubled+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Streamliner: Postwar Years","description":"When World War II came to an end in 1945, America was on the verge of an unprecedented economic boom that carried over to its vast rail transportation system.

Aging is not a mysterious metaphysical phenomenon. Aging happens in the particulars. Your arteries become clogged. Your arthritis flares up. Age is not just a chronological measurement; it's the rate at which the primary internal guardians of health--your cardiovascular and immune systems--decline. While your chronological age is fixed, your biological age may be years older--or younger--depending on a combination of factors. RealAge offers a revolutionary, systematic program that calculates the aging effect of more than 100 different health behaviors--ranging from diet and medication to stress control and chronic smoking--and enables you to assess your own biological age. Most important, it shows you how to design a specific path to improving or reversing your own aging trajectory. Developed by Dr. Michael F. Roizen, chair of anesthesia and critical care at the University of Chicago and preventive gerontologist, along with four other scientists, the RealAge program is based on cutting-edge scientific research. Dr. Roizen and his team have pored over 25,000 medical studies, evaluating what they tell us about aging and what they tell us about the prevention of aging.In RealAge, they present the complete results of their analysis for the first time. Each chapter covers a broad health topic--for example, how the right vitamins and supplements, exercise, or diet can be used to control how your genes affect you--and calculates the RealAge advantage you will gain by adopting a specific behavior. Charts, fact sheets, and tests give you specific choices to make and describe benefits to be gained so you can measure your success. Suggested behavior changes are rated in order of difficulty so you can decide whether the result is worth the effort. Ultimately, this program is about maintaining your health. The better condition you are in, the better prepared you will be to fight the factors that age you. RealAge demonstrates that you can have more control over the aging process. It makes science simple and its promise is irresistible: You may live as young at seventy as you did at forty-four. Remeber your high school reunion? Even though everyone was the same chronological age, people no longer looked the same. Some wore the years well, staying young and exuberant despite the passage of time, whereas others looked as if they had aged ten years more than everyone else--and probably had. Did you know that: Financial stress can make your RealAge two to thirty-two years older? The difference between having the ideal blood pressure 115/76--and high blood pressure--higher than 140/90--can make a RealAge difference of more than twenty years? A tablet of aspirin a day can make your RealAge 1.9 years younger? Flossing daily and seeing a dentist and dental hygienist every six months can make your RealAge 6.4 years younger? In RealAge you will discover many other easy-to-institute Age Reduction Strategies that will enable you to live longer and younger.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OFfJm4j8tPYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Faulkner's Speech of acceptance upon the award of the Nobel prize for literature: Delivered in Stockholm, 10th December 1950","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-eOIRAAACAAJ&dq=William+Faulkner%27s+Speech+of+acceptance+upon+the+award+of+the+Nobel+prize+for+literature:+Delivered+in+Stockholm,+10th+December+1950&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monkey (Penguin Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"El Nino in History: Storming Through the Ages","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Religions of China: The World As a Living System","description":"The guiding themes of Chinese religion as it is actually lived!

This series employs sophisticated methods resulting in original contributions that depict the reality of the people behind the Hebrew Bible and interprets these scholarly insights for a wide variety of readers. Individually and collectively, these books will expand our vision of the culture and society of ancient Israel, thereby generating new appreciation for its impact up to the present.Patrick Miller investigates the role religion played in an expanding circle of influences in ancient Israel: the family, village, tribe, and nation-state. He situates Israel's religion in context where a variety of social forces affected beliefs, and where popular cults openly competed with the \\"official\\" religion. Miller makes extensive use of both epigraphic and artefactual evidence as he deftly probes the complexities of Iron Age culture and society and their enduring significance for people today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JBhY9BQ7hIQC&dq=The+religion+of+Ancient+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overnight Alibi (Silhouette Intimate Moments, No 848)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Be Your Own Contractor and Save Thousands","description":"In this completely updated and totally revised second edition, you will learn how to choose a site, draw up construction time line and flow charts, apply for consturction loans, obtain essential insurance information, buy plans, find and negotiate with subcontractors, and comply with building code, inspection, and permit requirements.

The Everlasting, a quadruple love story spanning two millennia, is no less than the story of love itself its frustrations and thrills, its blunders and transcendent glories. Meraviglioso.\\" Nathaniel Rich, author of King Zeno From a supremely talented author comes this brilliant and inventive literary work of historical fiction, set in Rome in four different centuries, that explores love in all its various incarnations and ponders elemental questions of good and evil, obedience and free will that connect four unforgettable lives . Spanning two thousand years, The Everlasting follows four characters whose struggles resonate across the centuries: an early Christian child martyr; a medieval monk on crypt duty in a church; a Medici princess of Moorish descent; and a contemporary field biologist conducting an illicit affair. Outsiders to a city layered and dense with history, this quartet separated by time grapple with the physicality of bodies, the necessity for sacrifice, and the power of love to sustain and challenge faith. Their small rebellions are witnessed and provoked by an omniscient, time-traveling Satan who, though incorporeal, nonetheless suffers from a heart in search of repair. As their dramas unfold amid the brick, marble, and ghosts of Rome, they each must decide what it means to be good. Twelve-year old Prisca defiles the scrolls of her father s library. Felix, a holy man, watches his friend s body decay and is reminded of the first boy he loved passionately. Giulia de  Medici, a beauty with dark skin and limitless wealth, wants to deliver herself from her unborn child. Tom, an American biologist studying the lives of the smallest creatures, cannot pinpoint when his own marriage began to die. As each of these conflicted people struggles with forces they cannot control, their circumstances raise a profound and timeless question at the heart of faith: What is our duty to each other, and what will God forgive? Moving back through time from today (The Wilderness) to the Renaissance (The City) to the Middle Ages (The Grave) and finally to Rome under Marcus Aurelius (The Paradise), Tom, Guilia, Felix, and Prisca search and suffer for love in the eternal city, made vivid and familiar as they reappear in each century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i6qcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rocky Mountains: Wilderness Reflections","description":"A photographic portrait of the Rocky Mountains depicts the beauty of the landscape from New Mexico to the Yukon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=upcFAAAACAAJ&dq=Rocky+Mountains:+Wilderness+Reflections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daily strength for daily needs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Delicious Food for a Healthy Heart","description":"Cook with your heart FOR your heart!

While other ex-slaves and many poor whites became trapped in the exploitative sharecropping system, these independence-seeking individuals settled on pockets of unclaimed land that had been deemed too poor for farming and turned them into successful family farms. In these self-sufficient rural communities, often known as \\"freedom colonies,\\" African Americans created a refuge from the discrimination and violence that routinely limited the opportunities of blacks in the Jim Crow South. Freedom Colonies is the first book to tell the story of these independent African American settlements. Thad Sitton and James Conrad focus on communities in Texas, where blacks achieved a higher percentage of land ownership than in any other state of the Deep South. The authors draw on a vast reservoir of ex-slave narratives, oral histories, written memoirs, and public records to describe how the freedom colonies formed and to recreate the lifeways of African Americans who made their living by farming or in skilled trades such as milling and blacksmithing. They also uncover the forces that led to the decline of the communities from the 1930s onward, including economic hard times and the greed of whites who found legal and illegal means of taking black-owned land. And they visit some of the remaining communities to discover how their independent way of life endures into the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O_v9DAAAQBAJ&dq=Freedom+Colonies:+Independent+Black+Texans+in+the+Time+of+Jim+Crow+(Jack+and+Doris+Smothers+Series+in+Texas+History,+Life,+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sixth Phase","description":"This \\"novel of contagion and collapse is also the story of love s unlikely survival in the most hostile conditions  (Karen Russell, bestselling author of Swamplandia!) from the National Book Award-nominated author of The Book of Aron. In a tiny settlement on the west coast of Greenland, 11-year-old Aleq and his best friend, frequent trespassers at a mining site exposed to mountains of long-buried and thawing permafrost, carry what they pick up back into their village, and from there Shepard's harrowing and deeply moving story follows Aleq, one of the few survivors of the initial outbreak, through his identification and radical isolation as the likely index patient. While he shoulders both a crushing guilt for what he may have done and the hopes of a world looking for answers, we also meet two Epidemic Intelligence Service investigators dispatched from the CDC--Jeannine, an epidemiologist and daughter of Algerian immigrants, and Danice, an M.D. and lab wonk. As they attempt to head off the cataclysm, Jeannine--moving from the Greeland hospital overwhelmed with the first patients to a Level 4 high-security facility in the Rocky Mountains--does what she can to sustain Aleq. Both a chamber piece of multiple intimate perspectives and a more omniscient glimpse into the megastructures (political, cultural, and biological) that inform such a disaster, the novel reminds us of the crucial bonds that form in the midst of catastrophe, as a child and several hypereducated adults learn what it means to provide adequate support for those they love. In the process, they celebrate the precious worlds they might lose, and help to shape others that may survive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=auv4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War in the shadows: Bougainville 1944-45","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qyjBHAAACAAJ&dq=War+in+the+shadows:+Bougainville+1944-45&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coming through the Fire: Surviving Race and Place in America","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot","description":"Front and center, America!

Having already written two memoirs of his survival at Auschwitz, Levi knew there was still more left untold. Collected in this book are stray vignettes of fifteen individuals Levi met during his imprisonment. Whether it was the young Romani man who smuggled a creased photo of his bride past the camp guards or the starving prisoner who still insisted on fasting on Yom Kippur, the memory of these individuals stayed with Levi for long after. They represent for him  bizarre, marginal moments of reprieve.  Neither simple heroes nor victims, but people who never lost sight of their humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering. Written with the author s signature humility and intelligence, Moments of Reprieve shines with lyricism and insight. Nearly forty years after their publication, Levi s words remain as beautiful as they are necessary. Along with Elie Wiesel and Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi is remembered as one of the most powerful and perceptive writers on the Holocaust and the Jewish experience during World War II. This is an essential book both for students and literary readers. Reading Primo Levi is a lesson in the resiliency of the human spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u90nDwAAQBAJ&dq=Moments+of+Reprieve:+A+Memoir+of+Auschwitz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strike and Hold : A Memoir of the 82d Airborne in World War II","description":"This fast-moving memoir of T.

The huge distances these highly migratory creatures cover and the depths they dive mean we catch only the merest glimpses of their lives as they break the surface of the water.

They were also a key forum in which elements of American culture were represented, contested, and inverted. This book focuses specifically on the construction of the Mormon villain as rapist, murderer, and Turk in anti-Mormon melodramas. These melodramas illustrated a particularly religious world-view that dominated American life and promoted the sexually conservative ideals of the cult of true womanhood. They also examined the limits of honorable violence, and suggested the whiteness of national ethnicity. In investigating the relationship between theatre, popular literature, political rhetoric, and religious fervor, Megan Sanborn Jones reveals how anti-Mormon melodramas created a space for audiences to imagine a unified American identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=seiSAgAAQBAJ&dq=That+I+may+know+Him%3B:+The+morning+watch+texts+with+appropriate+selections,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decorating for Christmas: 70 Themed Craft Projects to Decorate Your Home","description":"Tartan, toyland, Scandinvavian, Victorian, and country themes are used to coordinate Christmas projects, including door wreaths, table centerpieces, and tree ornaments","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SRVDAAAACAAJ&dq=Decorating+for+Christmas:+70+Themed+Craft+Projects+to+Decorate+Your+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Synagogue","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Catholicism: The Story of Catholic Christianity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"History of Warfare: The Renaissance at War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dark Fire (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 6)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Av21MgAACAAJ&dq=Dark+Fire+(The+Carpathians+(Dark)+Series,+Book+6)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lighting By Design","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stretton Smith's 4t Prosperity Program","description":"For many of us, the search for the true self begins and ends with God.

Starting with Euclid's Elements, the book connects topics in Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry in an intentional and meaningful way, with historical context. The line and the circle are the principal characters driving the narrative. In every geometry considered which include spherical, hyperbolic, and taxicab, as well as finite affine and projective geometries these two objects are analyzed and highlighted. Along the way, the reader contemplates fundamental questions such as: What is a straight line? What does parallel mean? What is distance? What is area? There is a strong focus on axiomatic structures throughout the text. While Euclid is a constant inspiration and the Elements is repeatedly revisited with substantial coverage of Books I, II, III, IV, and VI, non-Euclidean geometries are introduced very early to give the reader perspective on questions of axiomatics. Rounding out the thorough coverage of axiomatics are concluding chapters on transformations and constructibility. The book is compulsively readable with great attention paid to the historical narrative and hundreds of attractive problems.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CmuBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Working Across Cultures","description":"A guide to adapting and thriving within unfamiliar cultural settings challenges the notion that professional life interacts with culture only at the etiquette level, distinguishing between rule-based and relationship-based cultures while considering the roles of such factors as competition, security, and lifestyle.

Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war, an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior, and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past.

N. T. Wright argues that every world view must explain seven  signposts,  indicators inherent to humanity: Justice, Spirituality, Relationships, Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and Power. If we do not live up to these ideals, our societies and individual lives become unbalanced, creating anger and frustration negative emotions that divide us from ourselves and from God, he contends. Using the Gospel of John as his source, Wright shows how Christianity defines each signpost and illuminates why we so often see them as being \\"broken\\" and unattainable. Drawing on the wisdom of the Gospels, Wright explains why these signposts are fractured and damaged and how Christianity provides the vision, guidance, and hope for making them whole once again, ultimately healing ourselves and our world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5jvLDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Symbols of Africa","description":"From masks to the symbolic script of the Ashanti, symbols play an important role in all aspects of African life.

It, however, retained its links with naval aviation with aircraft carriers frequently exercising off the coast. In the latter part of the decade Auxiliary Air Force squadrons were formed at Edinburgh and Glasgow manned by civilians. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany, the RAF responded by building new airfields or re-opening former First World War sites. They included armament practice camps at Evanton and West Freugh where pilots could practice their skills in bombing and firing their weapons. RAF flying boats also visited various coastal locations around Scotland in the years leading up to the War. The inter-war services also saw the development of scheduled airline services within the country. They were, however, not between major towns but linked remote islands with major towns of the mainland. An air ambulance service was also created to serve isolated communities. All of these developments are covered as well as private flying and gliding.

In addition, key illustrations are reproduced for guidance. A brief bibliography of reference material is appended to each chapter. The bibliographic material includes those references that I consider critical to my remarks. No claim is made of topical or bibliographic completeness. This monograph also is intended as a brief summary of depositional processes, Holocene sediments, ancient counterparts of depositional environments, and examples of oil- and gas-bearing stratigraphic traps in five depositional environments. This summary is intended to complement lecture and reading courses dealing with sedimentology, depositional systems, sedimentary facies, sedimentary environments, sandstone diagenesis, and sedimentary modelling as a predictive tool for exploration. The student is cautioned, however, that this monograph is merely an introduction and summary overview of the subject. More complete treatments appear in standard textbooks. Sedimentology has changed and advanced over the past twenty-five years, in part because the American oil industry needed to make predictions about the occurrence of the harder-to-find stratigraphic traps. In addition, the development of plate-tectonic theory, and supportive data from the Deep Sea Drilling Project, have caused sedimentology to change from an essentially descriptive science to a mature, predictive science. The 1960s and 1970s in particular witnessed an explosion of new insights and understanding of how sediments are deposited, and how sedimentary rocks are formed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0oEJBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder at The Washington Tribune: A Capital Crimes Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Black Rush","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My First Dictionary","description":"Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, Pinocchio, and many other Disney favorites make learning fun for beginning readers, in an ingenious reference that offers rhyming definitions of 497 words, all illustrated in color with the familiar Disney characters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I7SUdvV4ofIC&dq=My+First+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Spanish - Advanced","description":"Millions of people worldwide have discovered the value of Instant Immersion?, the most effective program available for learning to speak a foreign language quickly.

But the Reconstruction, marked by the continued strong hatred and hostility between liberated African Americans and angry Ku Klux Klan members, was hardly a time of reconciliation for the South. This work deals with the Reconstruction-era Ku Klux Klan, a paramilitary group with political aims that used violence and intimidation to achieve its goals. It addresses exclusively the Klans activities in York County, South Carolina, during the years 1865-1877. It clarifies some misconceptions about the Reconstruction Klan and disentangles it from later organizations that used the same name. There are no reports of its burning crosses or persecuting Jews and Catholics and it has no connection to the Klan that appeared in the early part of the twentieth century or todays counterpart that marches under the Confederate flag. Throughout the Reconstruction, blacks and whites tried to out-shout each other in the new era of conversation, and, as shown in this work, made little progress in understanding, or trying to understand, each other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SHbV-7EyNUYC&dq=The+Reconstruction+Ku+Klux+Klan+in+York+County,+South+Carolina,+1865-1877&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maskerade (Discworld Novels)","description":"'There's a kind of magic in masks.

Wilson present some of the most exciting emergent scholarship in American literary and cultural studies of the  long  nineteenth century. Featuring eleven essays from senior scholars across the discipline, the book responds to recent critical challenges to the boundaries, both spatial and temporal, that have traditionally organized scholarship within the field. The volume considers these recent challenges to be aftershocks of earlier revolutions in content and method, and it seeks ways of inhabiting and amplifying the ongoing unsettledness of the field. Written by scholars primarily working in the  minor  fields of critical race and ethnic studies, feminist and gender studies, labor studies, and queer/sexuality studies, the essays share a minoritarian critical orientation. Minoritarian criticism, as an aesthetic, political, and ethical project, is dedicated to finding new connections and possibilities within extant frameworks. Unsettled States seeks to demonstrate how the goals of minoritarian critique may be actualized without automatic recourse to a predetermined  minor  location, subject, or critical approach. Its contributors work to develop practices of reading an  American literature  in motion, identifying nodes of inquiry attuned to the rhythms of a field that is always on the move.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjUUCgAAQBAJ&dq=Banana+Wars:+Inner+History+of+American+Empire,+1900-34&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betrayed (Clan MacKenzie Triology)","description":"From the New York Times bestselling, award-winning author of Chieftain, this dazzling novel set in Scotland and tidewater Virginia brings Arnette Lamb s Clan MacKenzie series to a spectacular conclusion.

With a focus on three male protagonists living in very distinct urban areas of Cape Town, this comparative ethnography shows that men s struggles to become invulnerable increase vulnerability. Through an analysis of masculinities as social assemblages, the study shows how affective health problems are tied to modern individualism rather than African  tradition  that has become a clich  in Eurocentric gender studies. Affective health is conceptualized as a balancing act between autonomy and connectivity that after colonialism and apartheid has become compromised through the imperative of self-reliance. This book provides a rare perspective on young men s vulnerability in everyday life that may affect the reader and spark discussion about how masculinities in relationships shape physical and psychological health. Moreover, it shows how men change in the face of distress in ways that may look different than global health and gender-transformative approaches envision. Thick descriptions of actual events over the life course make the study accessible to both graduate and undergraduate students in the social sciences. Contributing to current debates on mental health and masculinity, this volume will be of interest to scholars from various disciplines including anthropology, gender studies, African studies, psychology, and global health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RODaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thirty Years War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Memories: Clark Thompson Lightfoot, January 7, 1930-January 13, 1951","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KlwjGwAACAAJ&dq=Memories:+Clark+Thompson+Lightfoot,+January+7,+1930-January+13,+1951&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nothing Risque, Nothing Gained: Ribald Riddles, Lascivious Limericks, Carnal Corn, and Other Good, Clean Dirty Fun","description":"\\"This unique encyclopedia treats the concepts, persons, themes, and media of 20th-century American humor and humor studies.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, something unique happened in the quiet little town on the west coast of Florida known as Homosassa. The best fly anglers in the world Lefty Kreh, Stu Apte, Ted Williams, Tom Evans, Billy Pate and others all gathered together to chase the same Holy Grail: The world record for the world s most glamorous and sought-after fly rod species, the tarpon. The anglers would meet each morning for breakfast. They would compete out on the water during the day, eat dinner together at night, socialize and party. Some harder than others. The world record fell nearly every year. But records weren t the only things that were broken. Hooks, lines, rods, reels, hearts and marriages didn t survive, either. The egos involved made the atmosphere electric. The difficulty of the quest made it legitimate. The drugs and romantic entaglements that were swept in with the tide would finally make it all veer out of control. It was a confluence of people and place that had never happened before in the world of fishing and will never happen again. It was a collision of the top anglers and the top species of fish which would lead to smashed lives for nearly all involved, man and fish alike. In Lords of the Fly, Burke, an obsessed tarpon fly angler himself, delves into this incredible moment. He examines the growing popularity of the tarpon, an amazing fish has been around for 50 million years, can live to 80 years old and can grow to 300 pounds in weight. It is a massive, leaping, bullet train of a fish. When hooked in shallow water, it produces  immediate unreality,  as the late poet and tarpon obsessive, Richard Brautigan, once described it.

The SD, Abwehr, Gestapo, and many other units of the German intelligence operations were feared and hated, with good reason. This is the thrilling story of their ascent and demise. Hitler's Espionage Machine examines in detail the history of each unit-its formation, the missions it carried out, and its importance in the war as a whole. It explores the myths that have grown up around the agencies, including the rumors that many of them are still active. It exposes the competition between the German agencies for Hitler's favor, and analyzes the effect this had on intelligence collection and dissemination, with particular focus on the notorious rivalry between the SS and the Abwehr. Chapters discuss the foreign operations and counterintelligence methods of the Abwehr, the central military intelligence service; the brutal methods of the Sicherheitdienst (SD), the Nazi Party's inner security apparatus; and the power games of the Gestapo, which controlled resistance within the state. Further chapters evaluate the effectiveness of the naval and air security departments. Drawing on firsthand accounts from the men who took part, as well as exhaustive research, Hitler's Espionage Machine convincingly argues that Hitler's intelligence apparatus was as intrinsic to his success as to his failure. It is a tour de force of intelligence writing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yzpFvgAACAAJ&dq=Hitler%27s+Espionage+Machine+:+The+True+Story+Behind+One+of+the+World%27s+Most+Ruthless+Spy+Networks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The betrayed profession: Lawyering at the end of the twentieth century","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Martin Van Buren, (American statesmen)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kwE7AQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Libra 1ST Edition","description":"From the author of White Noise (winner of the National Book Award) and The Silence, an eerily convincing fictional speculation on the events leading up to the assassination of John F.

In this fascinating volume, Karen Armstrong, author of the highly praised A History of God, traces the history of how Jews, Christians, and Muslims have all laid claim to Jerusalem as their holy place, and how three radically different concepts of holiness have shaped and scarred the city for thousands of years. Armstrong unfolds a complex story of spiritual upheaval and political transformation--from King David's capital to an administrative outpost of the Roman Empire, from the cosmopolitan city sanctified by Christ to the spiritual center conquered and glorified by Muslims, from the gleaming prize of European Crusaders to the bullet-ridden symbol of the present-day Arab-Israeli conflict. Written with grace and clarity, the product of years of meticulous research, Jerusalem combines the pageant of history with the profundity of searching spiritual analysis. Like Karen Armstrong's A History of God, Jerusalem is a book for the ages.

In The Argumentative Indian, Amartya Sen draws on a lifetime study of his country's history and culture to suggest the ways we must understand India today in the light of its rich, long argumentative tradition. The millenia-old texts and interpretations of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim, agnostic, and atheistic Indian thought demonstrate, Sen reminds us, ancient and well-respected rules for conducting debates and disputations, and for appreciating not only the richness of India's diversity but its need for toleration. Though Westerners have often perceived India as a place of endless spirituality and unreasoning mysticism, he underlines its long tradition of skepticism and reasoning, not to mention its secular contributions to mathematics, astronomy, linguistics, medicine, and political economy. Sen discusses many aspects of India's rich intellectual and political heritage, including philosophies of governance from Kautilya's and Ashoka's in the fourth and third centuries BCE to Akbar's in the 1590s; the history and continuing relevance of India's relations with China more than a millennium ago; its old and well-organized calendars; the films of Satyajit Ray and the debates between Gandhi and the visionary poet Tagore about India's past, present, and future. The success of India's democracy and defense of its secular politics depend, Sen argues, on understanding and using this rich argumentative tradition. It is also essential to removing the inequalities (whether of caste, gender, class, or community) that mar Indian life, to stabilizing the now precarious conditions of a nuclear-armed subcontinent, and to correcting what Sen calls the politics of deprivation. His invaluable book concludes with his meditations on pluralism, on dialogue and dialectics in the pursuit of social justice, and on the nature of the Indian identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MZ7WAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Berserker Attack","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Atlas of the Human Skeleton","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Magical States of Consciousness (Llewellyn's Inner Guide Series, Paths of Knowledge and Power)","description":"Available Once Again the Groundbreaking Guide to Qabalistic Pathworking Pathworking is one of the most powerful techniques employed in the practical Qabalah, the core of the Western Esoteric Tradition.

In our collective consciousness, the term 'migration' conjures up images of hordes of refugees fleeing 'their' country, escaping on rafts and coming to invade 'ours'. When we think of migration, we think of (largely unwanted) immigration and its ills. We've got it all wrong. Far from being abnormal, the act of going in search of a better life is at the core of the human experience. And now a new kind of nomad is emerging. What used to be a movement largely from east to west, south to north, developing to developed country is becoming more of a multilateral phenomenon with each passing day. Young people from everywhere are moving everywhere. Or rather, they are moving to where they expect to improve their lives and are turning the world into a beauty contest of cities and regions and companies vying to attract them. They are doing so because movement has become a key to their emancipation. After centuries of becoming sedentary, the future of humanity and the key to its enlightenment in the 21st century lies in re-embracing nomadism. Migration fosters the qualities that will allow our children to flourish and succeed. Our times require more migration, not less.

In explaining the Soviet Union's political stability, the author analyzes the Soviet combination of harsh authoritarian rule with political flexibility in the treatment of its citizens, and he describes the social processes that contribute to this stability. He also analyzes the Soviet perception of the current international situation and discusses trends in Soviet foreign policy, including the imbalance between military power on the one hand and political, economic, ideological, and cultural resources on the other. Professor Bialer explains the Soviet concept of d tente and explores the difference between Soviet and American perceptions of this process. A major part of the work is devoted to an examination of the imminent succession of the Soviet leadership. The book gives a profile of the new generation of potential leaders and identifies the characteristics that make them different form those whom they will replace. The Soviet leadership, while embroiled in its succession struggle, will have to make difficult decisions concerning the allocation of national resources and overall changes in management, planning, and incentives. Professor Bialer concludes by analyzing the kinds of economic reform that could make the problems manageable and the conditions under which the new Soviet leadership will need to institute reforms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k6R1w6wQ2N0C&dq=The+legacies+of+central+planning+(Rand+Corporation.+Memorandum+RM-5530-PR)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rethinking Social Policy: Race, Poverty, and the Underclass","description":"Looks at Americans' view of race, poverty, crime, heredity, welfare, and the underclass, and describes the changes in social programs over recent decades","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BjFHAAAAMAAJ&dq=Rethinking+Social+Policy:+Race,+Poverty,+and+the+Underclass&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First With the Most: Nathan Bedford Forrest (The Civil War Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j0IhAAAACAAJ&dq=First+With+the+Most:+Nathan+Bedford+Forrest+(The+Civil+War+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Time Shall Be No More: Prophecy Belief in Modern American Culture (Studies in Cultural History)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ostpreussen, damals und heute (German Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vD0dEY5l-Z4C&dq=Ostpreussen,+damals+und+heute+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mars Book: A Guide to Your Personal Energy and Motivation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jfLYOgAACAAJ&dq=The+Mars+Book:+A+Guide+to+Your+Personal+Energy+and+Motivation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blizzard","description":"Blizzard is based on John Rocco's childhood experience during the now infamous Blizzard of 1978, which brought fifty-three inches of snow to his town in Rhode Island. Told with a brief text and dynamic illustrations, the book opens with a boy's excitement upon seeing the first snowflake fall outside his classroom window. It ends with the neighborhood's immense relief upon seeing the first snowplow break through on their street. In between the boy watches his familiar landscape transform into something alien, and readers watch him transform into a hero who puts the needs of others first. John uses an increasing amount of white space in his playful images, which include a gatefold spread of the boy's expedition to the store. This book about the wonder of a winter storm is as delicious as a mug of hot cocoa by the fire on a snowy day.

During the 1970s, Sergio Ram rez led prominent intellectuals, priests, and business leaders to support the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), against Anastasio Somoza s dictatorship. After the Sandinistas overthrew the Somoza regime in 1979, Ram rez served as vice-president under Daniel Ortega from 1985 until 1990, when the FSLN lost power in a national election. Disillusioned by his former comrades  increasing intolerance of dissent and resistance to democratization, Ram rez defected from the Sandinistas in 1995 and founded the Sandinista Renovation Movement. In Adi s Muchachos, he describes the utopian aspirations for liberation and reform that motivated the Sandinista revolution against the Somoza regime, as well as the triumphs and shortcomings of the movement s leadership as it struggled to turn an insurrection into a government, reconstruct a country beset by poverty and internal conflict, and defend the revolution against the Contras, an armed counterinsurgency supported by the United States. Adi s Muchachos was first published in 1999.

In it, McNeill challenges the Spengler-Toynbee view that a number of separate civilizations pursued essentially independent careers, and argues instead that human cultures interacted at every stage of their history. The author suggests that from the Neolithic beginnings of grain agriculture to the present major social changes in all parts of the world were triggered by new or newly important foreign stimuli, and he presents a persuasive narrative of world history to support this claim. In a retrospective essay titled \\"The Rise of the West after Twenty-five Years,\\" McNeill shows how his book was shaped by the time and place in which it was written (1954-63). He discusses how historiography subsequently developed and suggests how his portrait of the world's past in The Rise of the West should be revised to reflect these changes. \\"This is not only the most learned and the most intelligent, it is also the most stimulating and fascinating book that has ever set out to recount and explain the whole history of mankind. . . .

It seems that, despite the fact that a certain idea of God is assumed by not most, people, there is a degree of disagreement over the meaning many, if of the term. \\"God\\" is generally taken to refer to a supreme Being, the Creator, who is perfect and self-existent, holy, personal and loving. This understanding of \\"God\\" corresponds to what many have either been brought up to believe in or have come to accept as the meaning of this word. Neverthe less, theists appear to be defending a particular idea of God and to be accusing atheists of attacking another, one which does not tie in with the theistic interpretation. Cardinal Maximos IV, for instance, is quoted as saying, \\"The God the atheists don't believe in is a God I don't believe in either. \\"2 On the other hand, atheists have been challenging believers to explain clearly what they mean by \\"God\\" because these critics cannot see how that idea can have any acceptable meaning. Furthermore, theists them selves seem to be divided over the issue. H. P. Owen in his book Concepts of Deity shows quite convincingly that there is \\"a bewildering variety of concepts of God\\" among theists.

But through Henry Blackaby s careful examination, the cross becomes not a doctrine, but an experience. You ll be overwhelmed with the utter significance of Christ s death, leading you to a stronger sense of God s power in your daily life. Steeped in the Blackaby distinctive of constant encouragement toward your personal experience of God, and firmly rooted in Scripture, this study guide makes it impossible to keep a casual attitude toward sin. Practice surrendering to the deeper dimensions of the cross, so that nothing can block the Lord s presence and power in your life!  Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.  Luke 14:27 Are you ready to destroy a casual attitude toward sin? To eliminate every barrier blocking the Lord s presence and power in your life? Then you are ready to make the cross your own. This eight-week Bible study companion to Henry Blackaby s Experiencing the Cross provides the practical tools you need to: LESSON 1 Grasp the graveness of sin LESSON 2 Comprehend Christ s blood sacrifice LESSON 3 Grow in gratitude for the One who died your deserved death LESSON 4 Exchange your sin for Christ s righteousness LESSON 5 Tap into God s unlimited resources, blessings, and power LESSON 6 Submit to God s sanctifying work in your life LESSON 7 Become alive to righteousness LESSON 8 Share the message of the cross with others The One who called you to this journey promises to be with you every step of the way.

Leader s guide included. Story Behind the Book  Our whole identity with Christ is found in the cross. It was there that God dealt totally with sin. And it is there that God intends us to be united with Christ in His death so that we would forever hate sin, abhor sin, and forsake sin. In our intimate relationship with Christ and His crucifixion, God intends for us to obtain His perspective on sin to feel its horrors, as Christ does, and then to let God put sin to death in our lives as He did in the crucifixion of His Son. The victory accomplished through Christ s death and resurrection is the very same victory we can experience daily in our lives!

Brittany during the nineteenth century was a place seemingly frozen in the Middle Ages, backwards by most French standards; formal education among rural society was either unavailable or dismissed as unnecessary, while the church and local myth defined most people's reasoning and motivation. Jean-Marie D guignet is unique not only as a literate Breton peasant, but in his skepticism for the church, his interest in science, astronomy and languages, and for his keen often caustic observations of the world and people around him. Born into rural poverty in 1834, D guignet escapes Brittany by joining the French Army in 1854, and over the next fourteen years he fights in the Crimean war, attends Napoleon III s coronation ceremonies, supports Italy s liberation struggle, and defends the hapless French puppet emperor Maximilian in Mexico. He teaches himself Latin, French, Italian and Spanish and reads extensively on history, philosophy, politics, and literature. He returns home to live as a farmer and tobacco-seller, eventually falling back into dire poverty. Throughout the tale, Deguignet s freethinking, almost anarchic views put him ahead of his time and often (sadly, for him) out of step with his contemporaries. D guignet s voluminous journals (nearly 4,000 pages in total) were discovered in a farmhouse in Brittany a century after they were written. This narrative was drawn from them and became a surprise bestseller when published in France in 1998.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yb5vDwAAQBAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Breton+Peasant&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mt.

Such efforts are often dismissed as ideological defenses of the social status quo, of the sort wrongly associated with nineteenth-century social Darwinism. Howard Kaye argues they are more properly viewed as culturally radical attempts to redefine who we are by nature and thus rethink how we should live. Despite the scientific and philosophical weaknesses of arguments that \\"biology is destiny,\\" and their dehumanizing potential, in recent years they have proven to be powerfully attractive. They will continue to be so in an age enthralled by genetic explanations of human experience and excited by the prospect of its biological control.In the ten years since the original edition of The Social Meaning of Modern Biology was published, changes in both science and society have altered the terms of debate over the nature of man and human culture. Kaye's epilogue thoroughly examines these changes. He discusses the remarkable growth of ethology and sociobiology in their study of animal and human behavior and the stunning progress achieved in neuropsychology and behavioral genetics. These developments may appear to bring us closer to long-sought explanations of our physical, mental, and behavioral \\"machinery.\\" Yet, as Kaye demonstrates, attempts to use such explanations to unify the natural and social sciences are mired in self-contradictory accounts of human freedom and moral choice. The Social Meaning of Modern Biology remains a significant study in the field of sociobiology and is essential reading for sociologists, biologists, behavioral geneticists, and psychologists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mh8xDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Social+Meaning+of+Modern+Biology:+From+Social+Darwinism+to+Sociobiology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strangers in the land;: Patterns of American nativism, 1860-1925 (Atheneum paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Good Maine food,","description":"Here are Kenneth Roberts's favorite recipes, gathered by his niece and accompanied by Roberts's notes and anecdotes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lRZPh3oHoDoC&dq=Good+Maine+food,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violent Land: Single Men and Social Disorder from the Frontier to the Inner City","description":"This book offers an explosive look at violence in America--why it is so prevalent, and what and who are responsible. David Courtwright takes the long view of his subject, developing the historical pattern of violence and disorder in this country. Where there is violent and disorderly behavior, he shows, there are plenty of men, largely young and single. What began in the mining camp and bunkhouse has simply continued in the urban world of today, where many young, armed, intoxicated, honor-conscious bachelors have reverted to frontier conditions. Violent Land combines social science with an engrossing narrative that spans and reinterprets the history of violence and social disorder in America. Courtwright focuses on the origins, consequences, and eventual decline of frontier brutality. Though these rough days have passed, he points out that the frontier experience still looms large in our national self-image--and continues to influence the extent and type of violence in America as well as our collective response to it. Broadly interdisciplinary, looking at the interplay of biological, social, and historical forces behind the dark side of American life, this book offers a disturbing diagnosis of violence in our society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TLRtXWlNQI0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures of Buster Bear (Bedtime story-book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Birth of Tragedy and The Genealogy of Morals","description":"Explores the origins of Greek tragedy and the elements through which it achieved greatness, which include the opposing characteristics of Dionysian irrationality and Apollonian restraint.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5pzdCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Birth+of+Tragedy+and+The+Genealogy+of+Morals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You've Got to Be Kidding!: Real-life parenting advice from a mom and dad of nineteen","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Highest Hit","description":"This special-edition book/CD--authored by three baseball insiders and history experts--relates how Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" has won a unique and permanent place in the cultural landscape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D9smngEACAAJ&dq=Highest+Hit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pyramids (Young Scientist Concepts & Projects)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Scholars' Bedlam: Menippean Satire in the Renaissance","description":"Scholars' Bedlam is a genre study of Menippean satire in the Renaissance. While the study acknowledges the influence of certain classical authors, especially Lucian, on the revival of the Menippean form in the Renaissance, it also seeks to explain the popularity of the Menippean satire by other means. The initial chapter establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the revival of the form, discussing Renaissance Menippean satire as a vehicle for the expression of cynical and skeptical positions and also as an outlet for expressing the discontent which humanist scholars experienced with their increasingly competitive profession. The first chapter also links the Menippean satire in its Renaissance incarnation with trends of skepticism, with the social ambition of the humanist intelligentsia, and with the aesthetic category of the grotesque. Using Bakhtin and other theorists, the author defines the form as a type of intellectual satire which has a number of recognizable features, despite its various incarnations as dream vision, mock encomium, parodic learned treatise, and mock epic. The form is discussed as one in which iconoclastic sentiments generally prevail and in which the satiric freedom to criticize cultural institutions is exercised. The following four chapters examine representative Menippean satires. Chapter 2 examines the earliest Menippean satires in Italian humanism, most of which are not listed in Kirk's bibliography of Menippean satire. It also elicits two strains of the Menippean form: a purely academic form in the mock laus or university praelectio, and a more Lucianic form in the fictional satires of Pontano, Alberti, and Calcagnini. Chapter 3 focuses largely on Rabelais' Tiers Levre, though brief mention is made of Lipsius's Somnium, and Agrippa's De Vanitaie is discussed as a continuation of the encyclopedic tradition of Menippean satire originating in Italian humanism. Chapters 4 and 5 turn to England and examine Thomas Nashe and Robert Burton. Nashe's Lenten Stuff is examined as a satire which has a powerfully subversive political element in it, but which remains fundamentally intellectual in its use of the mock encomium to debunk the Elizabethan rage for allegorical poetics which characterized more prestigious literary forms. The final chapter discusses Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy as a culmination of the humanist rewriting of the Menippean form, a merging of the form's tendency toward encyclopedism with the parodic traditions associated with the mock encomium. Burton's work is seen in great part as a skeptical mock summa whose purpose appears to be the undermining of humanistic dependence on textual authority.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D45ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Scholars%27+Bedlam:+Menippean+Satire+in+the+Renaissance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art and Reality: Ways of the Creative Process","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rH61AAAAIAAJ&dq=Art+and+Reality:+Ways+of+the+Creative+Process&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Breaking Unhealthy Soul-Ties: Do Your Relationships Produce Bondage or Joy?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Best of Dave Lowry: Karate Way Columns 1995 to 2005","description":"A collection of more than 70 of Dave Lowry's Karate Way columns published in BLACK BELT from 1995 to 2005.

The secret of the missionary passion. If the Cross of CHRIST is anything to the mind, it is surely everything -- the most profound reality and the sublimest mystery. One comes to realize that literally all the wealth and glory of the Gospel centres here. The Cross is the pivot as well as the centre of New Testament thought. It is the exclusive mark of the Christian faith, the symbol of Christianity and its cynosure. The more unbelievers deny its crucial character, the more do believers find in it the key to the mysteries of sin and suffering. We rediscover the apostolic emphasis on the Cross when we read the Gospel with Moslems. We find that although the offence of the Cross remains, its magnetic power is irresistible. The following chapters are the result of meditations on the passion of our Lord and His Death on the Cross in the midst of men who deny the historicity of the crucifixion and the necessity of the atonement. But the Moslem is not alone in his denial. The message of the Cross has always been an outrage and a scandal, a superfluity of foolishness to the worldly-wise. Yet it is CHRIST on the Cross who will finally draw all men to Himself. Under the shadow of the Cross is rest and peace. The glory of the Cross is as real as its shame; and to meditate on the shame is to see the glory. The Cross interprets sin and righteousness and love. It is the power of GOD and the wisdom of GOD. Its shadow is the longest shadow in the world, because it fell even on the Resurrection morning. \\"He showed them His hands and His side.\\" Did He ever show them to you? Then were the disciples glad when they saw the scars of the Risen Lord. \\"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world\\" (Galatians 6:14). Samuel Marinus Zwemer, [1867-1952] Samuel Zwemer was called to preach the Gospel to Muslims, and he is without doubt the greatest missionary to the Islamic world. On June 28, 1890, he began his mission, sailing from the United States on a Dutch liner the Obdam. Zwemer stopped in Europe to meet with other evangelical groups and then traveled to Beirut. Zwemer traveled throughout much of the Muslim world proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus including the Balkans, India, China, Africa, the Middle East.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HDFRMwEACAAJ&dq=The+glory+of+the+cross,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vector and tensor analysis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Hindu Pantheon: An Introduction Illustrated With 19th Century Indian Miniatures from the st Petersburg Collection","description":"This introduction to the main Hindu deities is illustrated with 65 delightful, delicate Indian miniature paintings from the last century. Hindu life and belief is rooted in a mythology of gods and goddesses. The origins and adventures of the members of the pantheon are the source of Hindu philosophy, religious practice and social behaviour. It is an ancient, vast and varied mythology, which has changed across historical eras and geographical regions. Deities have their origins in different cultures that have gradually coalesced and, across time, the gods themselves have undergone vast shifts in role and importance. The myths, and the divinities themselves, embrace all aspects of experience: creation and destruction, benevolence and terror, love and rage. The mythology works at many levels: sometimes combined with local folk beliefs it provides simple personifications of natural phenomena, teaches moral lessons, explains the creation of the universe; at the other extreme it offers sophisticated theories of matter, energy, time and space. Here, a concise introduction outlines the development of Hindu religion and culture in India, while the commentary to each of the paintings introduces the god or goddess depicted. The miniature paintings illustrating this book come from the Oriental Manuscripts Collection in the Institute of Oriental Studies, St Petersburg.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jG0yAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Hindu+Pantheon:+An+Introduction+Illustrated+With+19th+Century+Indian+Miniatures+from+the+st+Petersburg+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Good Opera Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Home Life: A Journey Through Rooms and Recollections","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aberrant Players Guide (Aberrant Roleplaying, WW8505)","description":"Gods once wielded this kind of power.

Belittled by his critics as the babysitter-in-chief, Eisenhower ground down Joseph McCarthy, stimulated the economy to lift it from recession, and turned an $8 billion deficit in 1953 into a $500 million surplus in 1960. The President Eisenhower of popular imagination is a benign figure, armed with a putter, a winning smile, and little else. The Eisenhower of veteran journalist Jim Newton's rendering is shrewd, sentimental, and tempestuous. Admired as a general, he was a champion of peace. In Korea and Vietnam, in Quemoy and Berlin, his generals urged him to wage nuclear war. Time and again he considered the idea and rejected it. And it was Eisenhower who appointed the liberal justices Earl Warren and William Brennan and who then called in the military to enforce desegregation in the schools.--From publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3QzQQ_ADiO8C&dq=Eisenhower&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jamais Vu Papers","description":"A Beverly Hills psychiatrist embarks on a bizarre search for a missing patient, in a novel that blends elements of mystery with the latest spiritual and scientific concepts about the universe","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=28npAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Jamais+Vu+Papers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coal To Cream -","description":"A black journalist shares the insights into race and power he found while living in Brazil, a nation plagued with racial divides but lacking the sense of racial identity and pride needed to overcome those problems. 30,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uzwsAAAAYAAJ&dq=Coal+To+Cream+-&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pioneer urbanites: A social and cultural history of Black San Francisco","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Guide to the Identification of Alfa Romeo Cars","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Michael Collins: A Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Joan Elliott's Native American Cross Stitch","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983","description":"Holding the Line, Barbara Kingsolver's first non-fiction book, is the story of women's lives transformed by an a signal event. Set in the small mining towns of Arizona, it is part oral history and part social criticism, exploring the process of empowerment which occurs when people work together as a community. Like Kingsolver's award-winning novels, Holding the Line is a beautifully written book grounded on the strength of its characters. Hundreds of families held the line in the 1983 strike against Phelps Dodge Copper in Arizona. After more than a year the strikers lost their union certification, but the battle permanently altered the social order in these small, predominantly Hispanic mining towns. At the time the strike began, many women said they couldn't leave the house without their husband's permission. Yet, when injunctions barred union men from picketing, their wives and daughters turned out for the daily picket lines. When the strike dragged on and men left to seek jobs elsewhere, women continued to picket, organize support, and defend their rights even when the towns were occupied by the National Guard. \\"Nothing can ever be the same as it was before,\\" said Diane McCormick of the Morenci Miners Women's Auxiliary. \\"Look at us.

Diana Turk explores the founding and development of the earliest sororities (then called women's fraternities) and explains how these groups served as support networks to help the first female collegians succeed in the hostile world of nineteenth century higher education. Turk goes on to look at how and in what ways sororities changed over time. While the first generation focused primarily on schoolwork, later Greek sisters used their fraternity connections to ensure social status, gain access to jobs and job training, and secure financial and emotional support as they negotiated life in turn-of-the-century America. The costs they paid were conformity to certain tightly prescribed beliefs of how \\"ideal\\" fraternity women should act and what \\"ideal\\" fraternity women should do. Drawing on primary source documents written and preserved by the fraternity women themselves, as well as on oral history interviews conducted with fraternity officers and alumnae members, Bound by a Mighty Vow uncovers the intricate history of these early women's networks and makes a bold statement about the ties that have bound millions of American women to one another in the name of sisterhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sS3464dnXyQC&dq=Bound+By+a+Mighty+Vow:+Sisterhood+and+Women%27s+Fraternities,+1870-1920&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forms Of Brief Therapy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The embattled philosopher;: A biography of Denis Diderot","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l5cAAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+embattled+philosopher%3B:+A+biography+of+Denis+Diderot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rocker: And Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Man With A Past : Going Back (Harlequin Superromance No. 1347)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill Illustrated Telecommunications Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=71DBngEACAAJ&dq=McGraw-Hill+Illustrated+Telecommunications+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SOUND OF BLUE.","description":"The Sound of Bluetakes readers on an exquisite and soulful journey into a rare part of the world, exploring the healing power of music in the lives of three strangers during the last Balkan War.

H. Lawrence, published in 1911. Lawrence started the novel in 1906 and then rewrote it three times. The early versions had the working title of Laetitia.Lawrence's first novel is set in the Eastwood area of his youth and is narrated in the first person by a character named Cyril Beardsall. It involves themes such as the damage associated with mismatched marriages, and the border country between town and country. A misanthropic gamekeeper makes an appearance, in some ways the prototype of Mellors in Lawrence's last novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover. The book includes some notable description of nature and the impact of industrialisation on the countryside and the town. Its provincialism may be compared with the novels of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy.The novel is set in Nethermere (fictional name for real-life Eastwood) and is narrated by Cyril Beardsall, whose sister Laetitia (Lettie) is involved in a love triangle with two young men, George and Leslie Temple. She eventually marries Leslie, even though she feels sexually drawn to George. Spurned by Lettie, George marries the conventional Meg. Both his and Lettie's marriages end in unhappiness, as George slides into alcoholism at the novel's close. David Herbert Richards Lawrence (11 September 1885 - 2 March 1930) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic and painter who published as D. H. Lawrence. His collected works, among other things, represent an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation. In them, some of the issues Lawrence explores are emotional health, vitality, spontaneity and instinct.Lawrence's opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile which he called his \\"savage pilgrimage\\"At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents. E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as, \\"The greatest imaginative novelist of our generation.\\"Later, the influential Cambridge critic F. R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness, placing much of Lawrence's fiction within the canonical \\"great tradition\\" of the English novel.The fourth child of Arthur John Lawrence, a barely literate miner at Brinsley Colliery, and Lydia (nee Beardsall), a former pupil teacher who, owing to her family's financial difficulties, had to do manual work in a lace factory, Lawrence spent his formative years in the coal mining town of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. The house in which he was born, in Eastwood, 8a Victoria Street, is now the D. H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum.[4] His working-class background and the tensions between his parents provided the raw material for a number of his early works. Lawrence would return to this locality and often wrote about nearby Underwood, calling it; \\"the country of my heart,\\" as a setting for much of his fiction. Despite common misconception he is not related to T.E. Lawrence....he young Lawrence attended Beauvale Board School (now renamed Greasley Beauvale D. H. Lawrence Primary School in his honour) from 1891 until 1898, becoming the first local pupil to win a County Council scholarship to Nottingham High School in nearby Nottingham. He left in 1901, working for three months as a junior clerk at Haywood's surgical appliances factory, but a severe bout of pneumonia ended this career. During his convalescence he often visited Hagg's Farm, the home of the Chambers family, and began a friendship with Jessie Chambers.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kgi5jwEACAAJ&dq=The+White+Peacock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theory of literature (A Harvest book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yMnyjgEACAAJ&dq=Theory+of+literature+(A+Harvest+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Tree","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Five Lessons of Life","description":"THIS #1 INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLER UNCOVERS ONE OF THE MOST REVEALING & ENLIGHTENING NEAR-DEATH-EXPERIENCES EVER TOLD!

In the post-truth era we don't just have truth and lies but a third category of ambiguous statements that are not exactly the truth but fall just short of a lie. Enhanced truth it might be called. Neo-truth. Soft truth. Faux truth. Truth lite.\\" Deception has become the modern way of life. Where once the boundary line between truth and lies was clear and distinct, it is no longer so. In the post-truth era, deceiving others has become a challenge, a game, a habit. High-profile dissemblers compete for news coverage, from journalists like Jayson Blair and professors like Joseph Ellis to politicians (of all stripes), executives, and \\"creative\\" accountants. Research suggests that the average American tells multiple lies on a daily basis, often for no good reason. Not a finger-wagging scolding, The Post-Truth Era is a combination of Ralph Keyes's investigative journalism and solid science. The result is a spirited exploration of why we lie about practically everything and the consequences such casual dishonesty has on society. American society has become permeated from top to bottom by deception. Its consequences for the nature of public discourse, media, business, literature, academia, and politics are profound. With dry humor, passionate fervor, and deep understanding, Ralph Keyes takes us on a tour of a world where truth and honesty are no longer absolutes but mutable, fluid concepts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f0Kvm3KObXoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lighting Art: The Aesthetics of Stage Lighting Design (2nd Edition)","description":"Stage Lighting: The Fundamentals is written specifically for introductory stage lighting courses.

Here in the closing years of the 20th century is Baltimore, with all its unexpected triumphs, crushing troubles, idiosyncratic characters, and lively neighborhoods. Michael Olesker's Baltimore offers a front row seat at the daily skirmishes that mark the city's life. Olesker draws intimate portraits of major politicians and local celebrities, of big names like William Donald Schaefer and Kurt Schmoke, Barbara Mikulski and Bea Gaddy, Artie Donovan and Brooks Robinson, Barry Levinson and John Waters. He gives equal time to players along the fringes Block denizens, professional gamblers, petty street hustlers and to the generally unsung heroes who keep the city vibrant and kicking. With articles about the price neighborhoods pay over racial conflicts and about the small deals that are made to get communities through a given day, Michael Olesker's Baltimore deepens our understanding of the city's people and their resilience. Olesker is hard-edged and straightforward but also warmhearted in his portrayal of Baltimore's colorful characters and their settings. In a style that combines police-blotter with Sunday-feature writing, he tells brief stories that show why to visitors and residents alike Baltimore feels like home. \\"Baltimore is a city of tribal rituals, of neighbors sharing steamed crabs in the back yard, and downtown waitresses who call their customers Hon without worrying about any vast sociological implications, and worshipful football fans who believe the snatching of their beloved Colts was the worst kidnapping since the Lindbergh baby.\\" from Michael Olesker's Baltimore","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r2R8GedqOJ0C&dq=Michael+Olesker%27s+Baltimore:+If+You+Live+Here,+You%27re+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quest A Ans F Plumb Exam","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4kAhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Model 1911 Automatic Pistol","description":"First used in combat during the Punitive Expedition into Mexico and then extensively during the world wars, the Colt Government Model (1911) pistol remained the standard issue handgun in the US armed forces for nearly 80 years and has continued in service with some units to this day.

Lewis In A Time Of War","description":"C. S. Lewis is universally recognized as one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century. A noted scholar, Lewis was able to reach a vast popular audience during his lifetime and continues to attract thousands of new readers every year. But how did Lewis first become a popular public figure? During the most desperate years of World War II, Lewis was asked by the British Broadcasting Corporation's recently created Home Service to give radio addresses on Christianity to a nation shaken by war. The choice was controversial. At first dismissed by critics as a layman who was unqualified to tackle such weighty issues, Lewis proved to be enormously persuasive. These radio talks were eventually published as Mere Christianity, which now ranks as one of the great classics of religious literature. This rich chapter in Lewis's life, which deals with his love-hate relationship with the \\"new\\" medium of broadcasting, has received little attention from biographers and commentators. Yet it was Lewis's work on the radio that made him a household name. By combining narrative skill and adroitly quoting from correspondence, Phillips captures Lewis's reservations, vexations, achievements, and, finally, his enormous success. C. S. Lewis in a Time of War is a fascinating look at how these talks were created and the enthusiastic response they generated at a time when bombing in London caused many radio stations to be evacuated. This book reveals a rich, previously untapped vein of Lewis's life and work that will intrigue his millions of fans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S2bCrx8EwKMC&dq=C.S.+Lewis+In+A+Time+Of+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black","description":"Until now, the single most important unpublished work by C.G. Jung The Black Books. In 1913, C.G. Jung started a unique self- experiment that he called his  confrontation with the unconscious : an engagement with his fantasies in a waking state, which he charted in a series of notebooks referred to as The Black Books. These intimate writings shed light on the further elaboration of Jung s personal cosmology and his attempts to embody insights from his self- investigation into his life and personal relationships. The Red Book drew on material recorded from 1913 to 1916, but Jung actively kept the notebooks for many more decades. Presented in a magnificent, seven-volume boxed collection featuring a revelatory essay by noted Jung scholar Sonu Shamdasani illuminated by a selection of Jung s vibrant visual works and both translated and facsimile versions of each notebook, The Black Books offer a unique portal into Jung s mind and the origins of analytical psychology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eqbGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constantine the Great: The Man and His Times","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P-HPsgEACAAJ&dq=Constantine+the+Great:+The+Man+and+His+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Golden Dawn Enochian Magic (Llewellyn's High Magick Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Art of the Ancient Near East","description":"An historical survey of the development of sculpture, architecture, painting, and ornament in the cultures of ancient Syria, Iran, Babylon, and Sumeria","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GG1oQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+the+Ancient+Near+East&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Taliesin Legacy: The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright's Apprentices (Architecture Series)","description":"In this monumental book, the author unveils hundreds of photos and original interviews tracing the careers of thirty architects who apprenticed with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin.

Lee, hedonistic yet earnest, is on the cusp of a breakdown. Her wild nights out and her management shifts at a Tribeca restaurant are fueled by cocaine and pink champagne, and her glamorous lifestyle is financed by wealthy older men who shower her with gifts. Once an aspiring painter, she can t remember the last time she touched a canvas. Her old friend Belinda, a reformed party girl, has grown up and distanced herself from both Lee and the reckless lifestyle they once shared. Kai, the man she thought was her soulmate, has left her for Paris, and she is in treacherous territory with her sugar daddy, Yves. When she receives an eviction notice from her landlord, Lee is forced to acknowledge that her life is unraveling at the seams and consider the possibility that there might be meaning in life beyond what can be found in the arms of strange men and the effects of reality-altering substances. Despite her tough exterior, Lee is a vulnerable young woman trying to numb her inner turmoil with sex, drugs, and alcohol. Hypnotic descriptions of her romantic exploits and drunken nights are interspersed with nostalgic memories of her late mother, a stark contrast that alludes to an enduring innocence beneath the chaotic exterior. When Lee finds a seemingly genuine connection in Kelly, the new bartender at her restaurant who is grieving from a loss of his own, she strives to stand on her own and free herself from the grip of her debt and vices. With her signature hypnotizing, elegant prose, Libaire delves deep into Lee s intimate, toxic relationship with the city nightlife and her own identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KSJaDwAAQBAJ&dq=HERE+KITTY+KITTY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Page Turner","description":"After young pianist Paul Porterfield engages in a brief affair with aging prodigy Richard Kennington and both return to New York to pursue separate endeavors, they do not see each other again, but their relationship has profound repercussions that neither had expected.

Here they locked in the bloody battle of Chickamauga, one of the most hotly contested engagements of American history, and one of the most extraordinary. For two days  September 19 and 20, 1863   125,000 men struggled for the prize city of Chattanooga in terrain more like a jungle than a battlefield. All regarded the battle as decisive. On its outcome depended, for the South, the fate of Atlanta and all Georgia. For the North, it promised the one opportunity to cut the Confederacy through the middle and possibly end the war before Christmas. For the courage they displayed, these men surpassed any in the wars of western civilization. It was, perhaps above all else from the strategist s point of view, a battle of strong personalities. Leading the Federals was William Starke Rosecrans, of German ancestry, hot-tempered and sometimes vacillating. Opposed to him was the hard-fighting, brave and resourceful Braxton Bragg, a martinet who could be slow moving and careless in supervising the execution of his orders. Possibly most outstanding of all was the Union General George Henry Thomas, whose remarkable courage and tactical skill saved his side from overwhelming defeat and earned him the sobriquet of  Rock of Chickamauga.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9SxvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AUSTRALIA WIDE COOKBOOK","description":"A celebration of Australian cuisine like never before -- 350 recipes showcasing the rich diversity of its landscapes and its people.

Moreover, the Gothic allows filmmakers to hold a mirror up to their own age and reveal society's deepest fears. Franco Zeffirelli's Jane Eyre, Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet are just a few examples of film adaptations of literary Gothic texts. In this ground-breaking study, Lisa Hopkins explores how the Gothic has been deployed in these and other contemporary films and comes to some surprising conclusions. For instance, in a brilliant chapter on films geared to children, Hopkins finds that horror resides not in the trolls, wizards, and goblins that abound in Harry Potter, but in the heart of the family. Screening the Gothic offers a radical new way of understanding the relationship between film and the Gothic as it surveys a wide range of films, many of which have received scant critical attention. Its central claim is that, paradoxically, those texts whose affiliations with the Gothic were the clearest became the least Gothic when filmed. Thus, Hopkins surprises readers by revealing Gothic elements in films such as Sense and Sensibility and Mansfield Park, as well as exploring more obviously Gothic films like The Mummy and The Fellowship of the Ring. Written in an accessible and engaging manner, Screening the Gothic will be of interest to film lovers as well as students and scholars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4dmGAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Message to the Glorious Church, Vol. 1: A Verse by Verse Study of Ephesians, Chapters 1-4","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jerusalem Calling","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rick Steves' Spain 2006","description":"Travelers can experience the best of everything Spain has to offer, including tapas-hopping and cathedral visits, with this guide that offers opinionated coverage of famous and lesser-known sights, friendly places to eat and sleep, day plans, and walking tours.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mUY0LollZocC&dq=Rick+Steves%27+Spain+2006&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Guide to English Language Programs, Canada: 1999 (International Guide to English & French Language Programs in Canada)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tq_iAAAACAAJ&dq=International+Guide+to+English+Language+Programs,+Canada:+1999+(International+Guide+to+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fleet of the Damned","description":"Sten's luck seems to have deserted him.

It is written from the perspective of a Cosmetic Formulator on the production of the popular cosmetic base known as, Melt and Pour Soap. Whether you are a crafter, hobbyist or business owner this book has everything that you need. This book give you guidance on how, as a small home based business, you can follow the regulations, labeling laws and industry standards for selling soap and cosmetics. My entire journey into the cosmetic industry started with Melt and Pour Soap shortly after I discovered aromatherapy. The roots of our business, Essential Wholesale, all started in December of 1998. Over the years we moved from our home kitchenette to a 600 square foot space, to a 2500 square foot building, to a 10,000 square foot space in a bigger building, and from there we have expanded into 30,000 square feet of that same building. In 2011 our business will be moving to an even larger 58,000 square foot building. As our business expanded we began to focus on natural cosmetics and personal care products. However, I never lost my curiosity and fascination with Melt and Pour Soap. Our relationship with Melt and Pour Soap changed over the years. At first we sold retail customized Melt and Pour Soaps. We then bought and sold the company Critter Soaps. Later we sold thousands of pounds worth of wholesale Melt and Pour Soap base and eventually discontinued selling Melt and Pour Soap because the price kept rising. At the time Melt and Pour Soap was the only cosmetic base we sold that we didn't manufacture ourselves. It simply didn't make sense to wholesale someone else's base when our business model had changed to selling only the bases we manufactured ourselves. It was at this point in our business that I decided it was time to formulate our own Melt and Pour Soap ourselves. It didn't take long to have working formulas, but at that moment we were using up every inch of space in our 30,000 square foot building. We were bursting at the seams and couldn't accommodate the manufacturing and cooling of the Melt and Pour Soap Base in bulk. Our space was so tight we couldn't possibly cool an 8,000 lb batch of Melt and Pour Soap base into multiple 1 lb, 20 lb and 40 lb blocks to sell in bulk. But we got continued requests to manufacture and sell Melt and Pour Soap base. My solution is this book. I decided to share these basic recipes with you to give you the freedom to make your own Melt and Pour base in the quantities that work best for your business. These recipes will teach you the foundational information that you need and give you tips on how to customize your base.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5PqGZwEACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Making+Melt+and+Pour+Soaps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betrayal Trust and Forgiveness : A Guide to Emotional Healing and Self-Renewal","description":"In this new, third edition of her award-winning book, Betrayal, Trust and Forgiveness, Dr. Beth Hedva combines best-practices in psychology with cross-cultural initiation rites and ancient mystery traditions to provide techniques for life-renewal and healing from betrayal wounds.

It examines how the doctrine evolved within early Buddhism from efforts to make sense of contradictions within the collected sayings of the Buddha. The two truths, however, came to refer not primarily to statements or language, but to the realities to which statements or language referred. As such, the doctrine of the two truths became one through which Buddhist philosophers focused their efforts to elaborate an abhidharma, a higher teaching which allowed them to explain how the mind apprehends and misapprehends the world, how it attaches itself to objects that do not exist in and of themselves, thereby creating suffering. In effect, the doctrine then evolved into a distinction between different sorts of objects rather than a distinction between different sorts of statements. The doctrine of the truths understood in this way played a key role in the articulation of the Mahayana by its followers in distinguishing it from what they called Hinayana, especially in defining the central ideas of selflessness and emptiness. Unlike prior books on this topic which concentrate on the doctrine within the context of the Mahayana, Buescher's examines it within the context of the Hinayana. Tibetan Buddhist syntheses of Buddhist doctrine provide a fascinating perspective from which to compare the positions of the major Indian schools. Such works, however, often lack the historical perspective from which to discern the development of these positions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZZoZEAAAQBAJ&dq=Echoes+From+An+Empty+Sky:+The+Origin+Of+The+Buddhist+Doctrine+Of+The+Two+Truths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winter Chill (ISIS Large Print)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thanks, Mom: Humorous and Meaningful Quotes on Motherhood (Inspiring Ideas for Parents)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Murder for pleasure;: The life and times of the detective story,","description":"\\"Genuinely fascinating reading.\\" The New York Times Book Review \\"Diverting and patently authoritative.\\" The New Yorker \\"Grand and fascinating   a history, a compendium and a critical study all in one, and all first rate.\\" Rex Stout \\"A landmark   a brilliant study written with charm and authority.\\" Ellery Queen \\"This book is of permanent value.

Before setting out for the Trojan War, King Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia. Many years later, when Agamemnon returns to his palace, his adulterous Queen Clytemnestra takes her revenge by brutally murdering him and installing her lover on the throne. How will the gods judge Orestes, their estranged son, who must avenge his father's death by murdering his mother? The curse of the House of Atreus, passing from generation to generation, is one of the great myths of Western literature. In the hands of Aeschylus, the story enacts the final victory of reason and justice over superstition and barbarity. The original trilogy, comprising Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers and Eumenides, is distilled into one thrilling three-act play in this magnificent new translation by award-winning playwright Rory Mullarkey.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2MazCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Resurrection Club","description":"In the early 1800s, scientist Dr. Alexander Brodie develops a heinous device that extracts and preserves the souls of unsuspecting victims for future use in experiments on other patients.

By drawing on a wide range of materials and attending to the places where they overlap, Booth uncovers ways in which modernism is deeply embedded in a broader Great War culture. She links, for example, the modernist representation of an unstable self to soldiers' familiarity with corpses, the modernist mistrust for fact to the competing nationalist discourses of August 1914, and the modernist description of buildings as having shaken off the past to a desire to forget the war. Booth argues that the dislocations of war often figure centrally in modernist forms even when the war itself seems peripheral to modernist content. Thus she suggests that soldiers experienced the Great War as strangely modernist and that modernism itself is strangely haunted by the Great War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ck_nCwAAQBAJ&dq=Postcards+from+the+Trenches:+Negotiating+the+Space+between+Modernism+and+the+First+World+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angelique in Barbary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Touching the Wall - Entering the Steam","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UsU6AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Bounty Trilogy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Quiet, Wyatt!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Heart Speaks: A Cardiologist Reveals the Secret Language of Healing","description":"An evaluation of the multi-faceted role of the heart considers its representation of human emotions and spirituality as well as its essential role in the perpetuation of life, drawing on recent studies to reveal that the human heart has its own intelligence and memory and operates independently from the brain.

L. Stedman, author of The Light Between Oceans For generations they've shared the small Maine island of Seven, but the Hillsingers and the Quicks have always kept apart, even since before Jim Hillsinger and Billy Quick married sisters. When Jim is ousted from the CIA under suspicion of treason, he begins to suspect that he has been betrayed--by his brother-in-law, Billy, and also by his own wife, Lila. In retaliation, he decides to carry out an old threat: to send their twelve-year-old son, Catta, to a neighboring island to test his survival skills. Set over three summer days in 1964, Estep Nagy's debut novel moves among the communities of Seven--the families, the servants, and the children--as longstanding tensions become tactical face-offs in which love, loss, and long-held secrets become brutal ammunition. Vividly capturing the rift between the cold warriors of Jim's generation and the rebellious seekers of Catta's, We Shall Not All Sleep is a richly told story of American class, family, and manipulation, and a compelling portrait of a unique and privileged enclave on the brink of dissolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vtksDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cats Have No Lord","description":"The author's revised version.

Passionately engaged in politics, he continued his role of leadership throughout his life, building the MIT Political Science Department into an outstanding group. He organized international teams of social scientists and collaborated widely to develop the understanding of social change. He was a frequent adviser to governments as consultant and in-house critic, and a successful advocate of limits on government regulation. Politics in Wired Nations presents his writings on the social and political impact of different communication systems and new telecommunications technology. Included in this volume is the first study of trends in a global information society, and the first study of social networks and the \\"small world\\" phenomenon that creates new relationships and routes of informal influence and political power, both domestic and international. Pool's essays on the politics of foreign trade, the influence of American businessmen on Congress, and changeable \\"unnatural\\" institutions of the modern world (e.g., bureaucracies, mega-cities, and nation-states) are herein contained. Pool describes a nonviolent revolution in freedom and political control that is possible as the world changes from the era of one-way mass communications--targeted to national audiences--to a new era of abundant, high-capacity, low-cost, interactive, and user-controlled communications on a global scale.

It is also a pitch-perfect piece of writing. . . . As with Shirley Jackson s work or Sarah Waters s masterpiece Affinity, in Stonex s hands the unspoken, unexamined, unseen world we can call the supernatural, a world fed by repression and lies, becomes terrifyingly tangible.  --The Guardian (London) Inspired by a haunting true story, a gorgeous and atmospheric novel about the mysterious disappearance of three lighthouse keepers from a remote tower miles from the Cornish coast--and about the wives who were left behind. What strange fate befell these doomed men? The heavy sea whispers their names. Black rocks roll beneath the surface, drowning ghosts. And out of the swell like a finger of light, the salt-scratched tower stands lonely and magnificent. It's New Year's Eve, 1972, when a boat pulls up to the Maiden Rock lighthouse with relief for the keepers. But no one greets them. When the entrance door, locked from the inside, is battered down, rescuers find an empty tower. A table is laid for a meal not eaten. The Principal Keeper's weather log describes a storm raging round the tower, but the skies have been clear. And the clocks have all stopped at 8:45. Two decades later, the keepers' wives are visited by a writer determined to find the truth about the men's disappearance. Moving between the women's stories and the men's last weeks together in the lighthouse, long-held secrets surface and truths twist into lies as we piece together what happened, why, and who to believe. In her riveting and suspenseful novel, Emma Stonex writes a story of isolation and obsession, of reality and illusion, and of what it takes to keep the light burning when all else is swallowed by dark.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FE32DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Connecticut Guide (State Guide Travel Series)","description":"\\"Comprehensive . . .well organized . . . should be carried in every glove compartment of every car that traverses Connecticut highways.\\" Journal Inquirer, Manchester, Connecticut Welcomed and praised by newspapers across the state, Explorer s Guide Connecticut gives visitors and residents alike detailed descriptions of attractions and little-known tips about the Nutmeg State.

The officers immediately opened fire, killing a number of protestors and wounding some two hundred others. Albert Parsons was the best-known of those hanged; Haymarket is his story. Parsons, humanist and autodidact, was an ex-Confederate soldier who grew up in Texas in the 1870s, and fell in love with Lucy Gonzalez, a vibrant, outspoken black woman who preferred to describe herself as of Spanish and Creole descent. The novel tells the story of their lives together, of their growing political involvement, of the formation of a colorful circle of \\"co-conspirators\\"-immigrants, radical intellectuals, journalists, advocates of the working class-and of the events culminating in bloodshed. More than just a moving story of love and human struggle, more than a faithful account of a watershed event in United States history, Haymarket presents a layered and dynamic revelation of late nineteenth-century Chicago, and of the lives of a handful of remarkable individuals who were willing to risk their lives for the promise of social change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hl9OEAAAQBAJ&dq=Haymarket:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clanbook: Tzimisce","description":"\\"Clanbook: Tzimisce includes: the practice of the modern Tzimisce, including their role as spiritual leaders of the Sabbat; material on those tainted by contact with the Tzimisce, including the revenant families and the Old Clan; unsettling new applications of Vicissitude, schemes and the clan lore of the Fiends\\"--Page 4 of cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pihpPQAACAAJ&dq=Clanbook:+Tzimisce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TO LIVE AGAIN","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Greatest Thing In The World (Drummond's Inspirational Classic in a Modern, Readable Edition with Other Essays)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uMKAAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Greatest+Thing+In+The+World+(Drummond%27s+Inspirational+Classic+in+a+Modern,+Readable+Edition+with+Other+Essays)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literature-Based Science: Children's Books and Activities to Enrich the K-5 Curriculum (Oryx Literature-Based Series)","description":"Offers 600 entries for bibliographies","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A76zb-1x8e8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Self-Dismembered Man: Selected Later Poems of Guillaume Apollinaire (Wesleyan Poetry Series)","description":"Rae Armantrout's most recent collection of poems focuses on the phenomenon of time, both as lived experience at the start of the 21st century and as a stubborn mystery confronting physicists and philosophers.

Chicago s Dreamland Housing Project was created to give people with nothing a second chance. Like so many ill-conceived dreams of its time, eventually the project fell into disrepair and disrepute, just another slum ruled by the gangs and the drug dealers. But there was one building in the complex that contained an evil far fouler than the kind running the streets. Here eerie sounds emanated nightly from the elevator shafts and the shadows at the far end of the hallways, and inexplicable, fatal  accidents  were the norm. Here human blood regularly soaked the walls and cheap carpeting as rapists and murderers ran rampant, though none could remember their dark deeds afterward. Now, decades later, Dreamland is empty of its residents and mostly demolished. But one building still stands, thanks to billionaire Ramsey Lomax, who won t let the city raze the last and most notorious tower until he is done with it. Along with four willing strangers a writer, an ex-cop, a doctor, and a psychic, each with a reason for participating Lomax intends to spend two weeks living in the abandoned tower to see if the legends are real. But nothing can prepare these five for the terror they encounter once the front door slams behind them, trapping them all inside.

Concentrating on major writers and works, it covers translations out of many languages, from Greek to Korean, from Swahili to Russian. For some works (e.g. Virgil's Aeneid) which have been much translated, the discussion is historical and critical, showing how translation has evolved over the centuries and bringing out the differences between versions. Elsewhere, with less familiar literatures, the Guide examines the extent to which translation has done justice to the range of work available. The Guide is divided into two parts. Part I contains substantial essays on theoretical questions, a pioneering outline of the history of translation into English, and discussions of the problems raised by specific types of text (e.g. poetry, oralliterature). The second, much longer, part consists of entries grouped by language of origin; some are devoted to individual texts (e.g. the Thousand and One Nights) or writers (e.g. Ibsen, Proust), but the majority offer a critical overview of a genre (e.g. Chinese poetry, Spanish Golden Age drama) or of a national literature (e.g. Hungarian, Scottish Gaelic). There is a selective bibliography for each entry and an index of authors and translators.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JKTD2B2jxA8C&dq=THE+DAYS+(H)+(Modern+Arabic+Writing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pierce the Veil: From Put-in-bay to Wall Street","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cheyenne Memories: Second Edition (The Lamar Series in Western History)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Healthy Mediterranean Cooking","description":"First in the 'Healthy Cooking' series.

Come into the special ed classroom, where the kids who don't fit in anywhere else spend their day. For these kids real kids Dennis J. Bernstein taught in the New York City public schools before he became an internationally known investigative journalist pistols, switchblades, police cars and hunger are more instructive than textbooks. SPECIAL ED is about daily life under the siege of poverty, racism, and class warfare. We come to know these kids intimately: Gloria, whose mother was disappeared in Guatemala and whose friendship with Marilyn rescues her from trauma-induced silence; Paulie, who \\"finds tears in the mirror's eyes\\" but thinks of himself as tough and defies the gang-guys who threaten to drop him from the roof of the projects; Regina, who sells nickel bags before class and gets high alone in the gym before giving a heart-wrenching performance of a poem by Langston Hughes. Dennis Bernstein loves these kids fiercely, and we come to love them too as the collection unfolds. \\"Dennis Bernstein is a hero to me because of his dedicated, unflinching reporting of real news on Flashpoints, at KPFA in Berkeley, California. But his fearless pursuit of the truth about what is happening in our rapidly transforming world did not prepare me for the beauty, depth, not-one-word-mislaid perception of this amazing book. Each word, each line, each thought has a weight, a texture, a surprise all its own. With its moving preface, in which Dennis shares his own struggles as a young child with special needs, SPECIAL ED: VOICES FROM A HIDDEN CLASSROOM is that unusual gift literature can be: We are connected to humanity in ways we might never have even considered or imagined before. Above all it is art turned to us through the eyes of love.\\" Alice Walker \\"SPECIAL ED is about daily life under the siege of poverty, racism, and class warfare. In these stunning, understated poems, these poems unafraid to name the darkest facts of our world and yet continually informed with compassion, we find ourselves in Rilke's world of beauty and terror. To depict with love, as Bernstein does, is indeed to transform, the way a shattered guitar and broken glass are transformed by the kids in the special ed classroom into art and jewels.\\" Anita Barrows","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fr5-tgAACAAJ&dq=The+Hidden+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making a Rose Garden","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=26s1AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buddhism and Christianity in Japan: From Conflict to Dialogue, 1854-1899","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cLfYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Buddhism+and+Christianity+in+Japan:+From+Conflict+to+Dialogue,+1854-1899&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Agile Manager's Guide to Retaining Employees (The Agile Manager Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Scotch-Irish of colonial Pennsylvania","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g5DWAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Scotch-Irish+of+colonial+Pennsylvania&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wiley Concise Guides to Mental Health: Substance Use Disorders","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus: Secrets of Real Intimacy with God","description":"Over seven million people have purchased Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez.
