After reading Ende's Neverending Story I was eager to read Night of Wishes. Unfortunately, this novel suffers greatly in translation and lacked the charm and inventiveness of Story. The word play and potion descriptions were contrived and proved tiresome. I was greatly disappointed that A Night of Wishes amounted to an evening wasted."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"This was a good book. I loved every part of it. There are no parts that were better than the rest, although the whole book was remarkably good, and there were no complaints."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"This book is awsome and keeps you wanting to read. A true page turner, alot better than the Never Ending story!"},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"I love this story both for its uniqueness and darkness. Everything about it is infinitely creative and original, from the thumb-striking clock that marks the passage of time with an \\"ouch\\" instead of the same old \\"cuckoo,\\" to the fantastically twisted characters. However, this is not really a book for children. I think it is best read by teens and adults, (or mature younger readers!) The story involves two wicked individuals working for the Devil Himself to destroy the world. There is still hope though, in two raggedy animals who have just one night to foil their masters' plans! For an extra fun experience, I suggest you read this book in real time. It takes place in the course of that single evening, and there is even a clock every few pages to let you know how much time remains! If you crave dark stuff, or just enjoy really original stories, you'll fall in love with THE NIGHT OF WISHES!"},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"This is my favorite book since I've read it 5 years ago. The cat (a little dumb) und the always so pessimistic raven are well worked-out caracters and I really love them. Sometimes I wonder how Mr. Ende managed to invent all those words to describe the ingredients of the notion potion. Beeing German I know both versions - the German original and the English translation, which sometimes does not manage to give all the brilliant word-inventions an equal English meaning. So if you understand some German - buy both versions and you'll enjoy Michael Endes magic."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"The heart knows more than the mind can ever know alone. Michael Ende takes many turns and twists by bringing the wisdom of many animals together to stop the destruction of the nature of evolution. Notice that the animals always meet by the church but never in it. Notice, in the end when the day has been saved, that the animals each go back to their natural world. There are many subtleties in this book about how when evil tries to control nature and the unlikely forces that must take on the messy job of making things right. It is not inside the church where common sense tells you that things are made right, but outside."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"This book is thoroughly enchanting. I remember seeing the play on stage on New Year's Eve (my birthday and the day on which the story takes place) when I was a kid in Germany. Later, I read my sister's copy.I just bought the English translation and read it with my husband, and I was very impressed with it. There is a good deal of rhyming going on in this book and the translators took great care to capture the feeling of them as well as preserve the rhyming structures.What a great book!"},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"This book has many detailed descriptions to the potion ingredient and to the description of the night sky. It opened up many new vocabulary words and gave me a whole new demension of imagination. This book is simply outstanding and a &quot;Must Read&quot; for everyone. Ende has given us great description in this book. This shows his great literature work with this book and The Neverending Story. In conclusion, no one should back off from this book."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"This is a clever parable written by an engaging author. Ende's mischevous sense of humour shines through even in translation and the antics of the cat and the raven ironically reflect many of the attitudes of society."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"It's a pity that this book is not in print anymore, it certainly is one of the best I ever read. Yes, it's meant for children, but also for folks who didn't forget about their inner child. This book was as much fun for me to read when I was a child then it is now as a mature adult.The story has a good meaning and is told in a way that you will remember it for a loooooong time. And when you remember, it fills you up with good feelings. How many books can do that?Michael Ende, the author, is more known for his book \\"The Neverending Story\\", which has, by the way, not too much in common with the movie. \\"The Night of Wishes\\" never got the same attention, but it definitely is worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"I had just read this book recently. Michael Ende with no doubt is my favorite author of all times. All of the books i read by Ende, this probably would be the 2nd best (The Neverending Story being the 1st). This book is well written at a point that it is addicting. I dont know if it has to do with the conflict,humor, or just because its amazing; but i couldnt put it down until i was done. Im ashamed this book is out of print, its just so good that it should be put back and stay back in print. If you read this book, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"I fall into the same category of people who went searching for this book after reading the Neverending Story. It was on my Amazon wish list for months and months, but it was always too expensive to buy. Finally I saw it available for 16 bucks, so I got it. Was it worth the wait? You know, I'm not sure.On one hand, the plot's clever and easy to understand, all the way from beginning to end. And I'm sure it's no small task to construct a plot that meets both criteria. But the characters seem so uninspired. You can read hundreds and hundreds of books about talking animals who save the day. The raven in this story has a bunch of wives and the cat wants to be a singer, but these character traits have nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. The raven could have been an aspiring juggler and the cat a gambling casino player, and it wouldn't have changed the plot a bit. And Father New Year is pretty much the most worthless literary character I've ever seen. Sure, he helps the heroes out, but GOSH he's got less inspiration behind him than an extra on a made for TV movie set.Also there's an awful lot of witchery, and a bit of drunkness in the pages that (although quite amusing) makes me uncomfortable with its suitability for children, because it's definitely more of a children's book than a young adult book.Other than the uninspired heros and the heavy emphasis on witchery, I can't say anything bad about the book. The translation is magnificent. The rhyming is wonderful. The bad guys ruining themselves in the end is hilarious. And the cold fire bowl is neat.All in all, this book is a steady mixture of cleverness and blandness. So if you're like me, and you're looking for greatness, you're not going to find it in such a mixture. A Night of Wishes is a nice book to have because it's fairly obscure, but I wouldn't feel bad about telling anybody to pass it up."},{"Title":"The Night Of Wishes","review":"It seemed like it was a shallower version of a Dr. Seuss book. I thought it was going to be more imaginative than it was. ...and I don't think it holds that high a place, especially compared to all the other books that Ende has written. It seemed that he pushed this book out too fast and didn't take enough time with it. Or it is totally just a children's book, only for children."},{"Title":"AstroFAQs: Questions Amateur Astronomers Frequently Ask (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"Fantastic!! Just the book that I've been looking for - it has an enormous amount of information concentrated into relatively few pages. The format, similar to an internet FAQ, makes it easy to navigate.

Through sicknesses and storms the family endures, and through the everyday stresses, one senses the building of a higher spiritual order built on family responsibility. The book presents many details of plains life and risks that have been forgotten. After reading this, one is reminded of just how much more can be accomplished through resolve and love."},{"Title":"High, wide and lonesome","review":"This book tells the story of a young boy who becomes a young man out on the high plains of Eastern Colorado. In 1910, Hal Borland?s father got the wanderlust. He left his job as typesetter and newspaper editor in a small town in Nebraska and set off for the plains. He located a likely plot of land for homesteading in Colorado and returned to get Hal. Together, Hal and his father built a house and dug a well, and after they were joined by Hal?s mother, they determined to make a stand on their land. Over the next 3 years, life was not easy, between the vagaries of the weather, livestock losses, and health problems. Hal gradually grew up learning to deal with coyotes, playing with prairie dogs, and doing the chores around the farm.I found the first part of the book a little slow. The first chapter seemed to go on forever, with a blow-by-blow account of setting up the farm. Once the buildings were finally constructed, however, and the family began to settle into daily life, I found the story much more engaging. It brought back memories of family stories about my own grandfather?s boyhood growing up just across the border in Eastern Kansas during the same period. I had heard that my grandfather?s family built a sod hut to live in, but I couldn?t really grasp what this meant. Now, through Borland?s eyes, I can see that hut and picture some of the experiences that my grandfather must have had as a young child. Towards the end of the book, Borland philosophizes a little about what it means to be a pioneer, living on the frontier. One issue he doesn?t address is that this lifestyle was a choice not for him, but for his father, and that he and his mother lived through the homesteading adventure because it was his father?s dream. Nevertheless, although homesteading was thrust upon him, he looks back on it with nostalgia and respect for the land and people."},{"Title":"High, wide and lonesome","review":"This book is a memoir of Borland's childhood growing up on the High Plains of Colorado south of Brush and Gary early in the twentieth century. It was not an easy life with the harsh weather, little rain, and endless hard work; one needed to be constantly resourceful to run a homestead then. Borland captures the difficulties--and also the joys--of such an existence very well."},{"Title":"High, wide and lonesome","review":"I'm reading this book by Kindle and wanted a paper copy for my husband for Christmas. This book, ordered through Marketplace, was packaged so beautifully that I even considered wrapping it up as is. I'm happy with my purchase and I know my husband will be also."},{"Title":"High, wide and lonesome","review":"I first read \\"HIGH, WIDE and LONESOME\\" more than 50 years ago, when I was twelve. This book and one other, also a story of homesteading (in British Colombia) titled \\"CARUSO of LONESOME LAKE\\" have lingered in my imagination since. The lessons I learned reading these books have influenced me throughout my life: the importance of self-reliance and understanding that the simple necessities of life that I took for granted, came only with work and commitment.Reading Hal Borland's simple but compelling story again, after all these years was a deeply emotional experience for me, like going back in time and re-uniting with a long departed friend.I highly recommend this book for boys eight to fourteen years old. Actually, not just boys as I believe a lot of girls will enjoy this as well."},{"Title":"California Facts and Symbols","review":"This book is easy to read, the pictures are colorful, and all pertinent information is covered.

If you want that for this area try Peterson's Field Guide or Dr. Bob Shipp's Guide. It IS the definitive treatise on the systematics and identification of all fish one can find in the described area (Texas, Louisiana and adjacent waters). While I give five stars to this book I would not recommend it to any but the most serious of amateurs (professionals already know about it). Before you open it you need to know what a dichotomous key is and how to use it. The pictures are there for confirmation, not identification. It is laid out with an excellent introduction that explains all of the necessary terminology then jumps into how to identify any fish caught to the family level. After identification of the family it gives a key to that family and a brief (it has to be, there are several hundred fish mentioned) description of each species.

The fashion in which Ramsey lists things and pin points facts makes remembering and recalling his facts easy.As an educator with 15 years of teaching experience, I thought I'd explore the field of administration in education. I have taken several Principal's courses which are the first steps to getting into a Vice Principal's position, but I've never built the courage to apply for such a position. Several friends who have moved into such admin positions ask me why I don't make a move in that direction and I also ask myself why I'm not taking any steps in that direction. I never had a clear answer until I read this book by Ramsey. It really hit a nerve with me. In simple words it opened my eyes to the fact that at this point in time of my career I need to GET OUT OF THE WAY. The rest is yours to read. I highly reccomend this book to educators seeking positions in the admin areas."},{"Title":"Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way: How to Be a More Effective Leader in Today's Schools","review":"Ramsey, R.D. (2006). Lead, follow or get out of the way: How to be a more effective leader in today's schools (2nd. ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin.We have a perceived crisis in education at present, in that it is harder to find high quality school leaders. As professional educators it is our collective role to mentor the next generation of school leaders and ensure that the students of the future get the best possible education. With that in mind I took a look at Bob Ramsey's book- \\"Lead, follow or get out of the way\\".Being a principal is a complex job and I am sceptical of books in the management genre that simplify management to a list of rules and procedures. I was happy to find that Ramsey's book was far better than that. I was buoyed by the common-sense approach that the author has and it is accompanied by an economical and purposeful writing style. I was buoyed too by his observation that apart from authenticity and passion all of the leadership roles are learnable.Clearly this book has an educative role for the neophyte school leader. It is comprehensively informative. The lists and checklists are very useful and provide a great starting point for discussions about specific aspects of school leadership. If I were mentoring a school leader I would find this a useful text.A second role for the text is as a reflective tool for the experienced school leaders. None of us is perfect and it is rare to have a \\"significant other\\" in the near vicinity with whom reflection is possible. In a vicarious sense, Ramsey's book does this.What the book does not do, in detail, is address the two key issues of schooling- pedagogic and curriculum leadership. Not withstanding this, the book is a very useful addition to any professional library. This book is my book of choice for our school leaders' reading group.Corwin Press is to be thanked for producing good quality and topical books for educators, at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way: How to Be a More Effective Leader in Today's Schools","review":"this is great educational leadership book - I learned alot of great ideas from this book for my future administrative aspirations."},{"Title":"Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way: How to Be a More Effective Leader in Today's Schools","review":"Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way is an excellent book for school administrators specifically in the area of leadership.

She started to cry when her village was mentioned and she said &quot;someone does remember us&quot;. This was very touching and I think that all survivors should know that there are many who still remember.The thing that I felt that was lacking, is that there was very little detail of when of Jews of Italy and Greece were deported to the camps."},{"Title":"Atlas of the holocaust","review":"With the horrors of the Holocaust so well documented in words, film-footage and pictures, it is hard to believe that a book of maps could hit so hard and add so much more depth to the tragedy ... I was simply astounded by this book.First and foremost, the impressive research that Martin Gilbert put forth in creating this incredible work must be acknowledged.I purchased this book based on a suggestion from my history-teaching wife, who once possessed a copy, loaned it out and never got it back. She simply stated that the book was one of the most significant books she possessed on the Holocaust ... I immediately ordered it.An initial thumbing of the pages had me wondering what a book of maps could reveal that I already didn't know, so i started from the beginning and could not put the book down until I had reached the end.\\"Atlas of the Holocaust\\" is basically a book of maps that illustrate the intricate details of the transportation, deportation and extermination of Jews within the reaches of the Nazi empire. From the end of World War I all the way to the end of World War II. Each map traces the route of people extracted from their homes to final destinations. Whether those destinations were Auschwitz, Dachau or an unmarked ditch.Gilbert appears to leave no stone unturned as even the journey of the smallest bands of people from remote villages in Yugoslavia or Greece are documented. The details of the maps include the random executions, the forced \\"death marches\\" to various camps, as well as the sites of uprisings against the Nazis, even listing the names of those leading the revolts. The author has carefully inserted special inset maps that serve to \\"zoom in\\" on particular locations to detail individuals, such as the names and ages of particular groups of children or elderly. These special inset maps illustrate the depressing scope of the Holocaust more than anything.What is most evident, though, is the magnitude of the Nazi plan to eradicate the Jews of Europe as well as the extraordinary and extensive effort made to thoroughly carry out the plan. When even the most remote villages are shown being cleared of Jewish inhabitants, it leaves you wondering if there was ANY place in German-occupied Europe that was safe from detection.Martin Gilbert opens up a wound that history has cleanly sealed shut with the oft-referred, horrifying simple statement: \\"six-million Jews\\". The book breaks down that figure into the multitude of smaller tragedies that comprise that six-million figure ... i have yet to see any other work that has effectively presented the Holocaust in such a manner."},{"Title":"Atlas of the holocaust","review":"Very interesting book, especially valuable as a research tool for a new book in progress, plus one in a finished state but in review for fact checking."},{"Title":"Atlas of the holocaust","review":"This book is very informative, I have yet to see a history of the holocaust with so through a review of deportations and number of victims from every part of europe. It is a must read for individuals that care enought to find out what took place during the Holocaust who and when."},{"Title":"Atlas of the holocaust","review":"Martin Gilbert is possibly the most prolific historian on the history of the holocaust.In this volume gilbert has compiled 316 maps, together with a commentary t o illustrate the scope of the horror that took place between 1941 and 1945.He begins by tracing the history of anti-Semitic violence in Europe, with maps and history of anti-Jewish violence before the First World War, and anti-Jewish violence in Europe between 1918 and 1932.One fascinating map details the two thousand year history of Jewish life in Europe by 1933, explaining how long Jews had lived in each country in Europe covered.Gilbert painstakingly covers each region of Europe and North Africa, where Jews were targeted, interend and murdered. He details the greater massacres and the lesser known killings.He also outlines the countries to which German Jewish refugees were recieved.From Germany between 1933 and 1938, 500 000 Jews emigrated or fled abroad, including more than 33 000 to the then 'Palestine', where they joined tens of thousands of recent Jewish immigrants from Poland.After the war, 200 000 survivors of the camps emigrated to \\"Palestine\\".Hence descendants of refugees from Nazism and holocaust survivors make up a substantial part of Israel's population today.Gilbert does not spare the horror when he describes the random killing and anti-Jewish pogroms, the anti-Jewish measures taken in different countries, the forcing of Jews into ghettos, the deliberate starvation of Jews in these ghettos, the deportations and death camps, the slave labout systems and the mass killings.This is a very comprehensive digest, and although there were so many whose names have not been recorded, Gilbert does record the names, ages and places of birth of some holocaust victims whose cases he examines.He also details lesser known locations of the Nazi persecution, such as the fate of Jews in Morocco, LIbya and Tunisia under Nazi/Axis occupation during this period.Ever period is intensely covered, as is every geographic region where Jews suffered and died.Several maps detail the cases of some of the children deported to from various places in Europe, and from various countries, such as maps showing the names, ages and places from which several children were deported from France.We wonder about the lives and cruel deaths of the precious children whose ages and names we see, but whom we know little else about.The atlas is supplemented about 40 , sometimes very graphic photographs, and two important maps are placed at the end of the book estimated how many Jews from each country were murdered during the holocaust, and how many Jews returned to their countries of birth after the war.Always keeping the human touch and concern for each individual victim and survivor, Gilbert provides the stories of three of several children who survived and were taken to the children's home at Ulm: Idel Levitan, Renja Fraum and Zlata Tauber-with their photographs.Gilbert succeeds as always with combining the recording of the larger events, with a ground eye view."},{"Title":"Cardiac Auscultation","review":"A amazing, fantastic, and real review of the normal and abnormal aspects of heart sounds."},{"Title":"Handbook for Boys","review":"This book was a gift for a friend,who was a Boy Scout as a child.

I am so glad I did. These books are lovely. Things I especially liked:(1) They have short narratives that are appropriate for a new reader to finish in a day, or to be read at bedtime by a caregiver.(2) All the books follow the same pattern- \\"Little [letter]\\" fills a box, gentle, happy fun ensues, and then the words are reviewed at the end.(3) The children featured are of many different colors and shades, but their books are simple and pleasant, and there are no stereotypes (that I have seen so far).(4) The print is large and clear.(5) The illustrations are clear and contain plenty of items for discussion for the pre-reader.So far, we've only read four or five together, but my child likes them a lot. She can't read but these books provide a nice opportunity to gently reinforce letter sounds and sight words as we read books she enjoys.

Most of these five-star givers here are authors themselves. Now, they showed that how gullible they are. The biggest danger in pursuing science is \\"WANT the CERTAIN ANSWER\\". For example, if Gintis or Dennett eagerly want something to corroborate their anti-mainstream views then they would quickly jump to this Marc Hauser guy and find him so dear. Now you see the evidence of the gullibility of one of our most comfident scientists: Herbert Gintis. What a huge disppointment to me, because I just bought 3 books by Gintis... costing me a lot of dollars.I have watched and attended several of his (Hauser's) seminars. The guy (Marc Hauser) talks like a showman... I felt a bit uneasy because his style is not of a true thinker or scientist, he was more of a flashy showman who likes a drama effect in his talks. Now, I am right, he is a cheat. My 2 cent: if you see a speaker (scientist or \\"thinker\\") who talks in a showy \\"dramatic\\" way, then he is a cheap showman who wants fame and is not driven by the pure scientific curiosity.

It may be possible, likely, or may be plausible, it is definitely NOT a fact. It is not even demonstrated or shown that there is anything like a 'universal' moral sense. Chomsky is working with a given, language is universal and we know what people talking sounds like, even when we do not understand what they are talking about. We even know that animals communicate via audible channels. We know nothing like this about 'the moral sense'. We know even less about animals and their 'moral sense'. Do lions and tigers and bears have something in common that we don't know about ? So, as far as arguing in the sense that Chomsky does, starting from an observable, this book's attempt to do so is wholly pretentious. It pretends to have an observable, it does not. It claims that this observable is in some sense, universal. It presents no example of a universal moral act. It gives as example, the recent Iraqi fiasco, known as Abu-Ghraib as an example of a monsterously evil immoral act. This last gives the impression that there is a political statement being made here. Would the Holocaust or the on-going, as of January 2007, genocide in Darfur, not been more reasonable examples. By the way, where is the world-wide recognition of this un-speakable horror in Darfur 'moral sense' ?It is a strong point of this book to separate morals from religion. Does the author present a 'moral' that exists in a community without a religion ? It may have been in the small print. My eyesight is not what it used to be. Could he have given us a few words on 'thou shalt not steal' ? Or any of the moral strictures that Western civilization advocates ?I sat and read a very large portion of this book over a three day period at Barnes and Nobles.

The findings have resulted in the retraction of an influential study that he led. \\"MH accepts responsibility for the error,'' says the retraction of the study on whether monkeys learn rules, which was published in 2002 in the journal Cognition. Two other journals say they have been notified of concerns in papers on which Hauser is listed as one of the main authors. It is unusual for a scientist as prominent as Hauser -- a popular professor and eloquent communicator of science whose work has often been featured on television and in newspapers -- to be named in an investigation of scientific misconduct. His research focuses on the evolutionary roots of the human mind. In a letter Hauser wrote this year to some Harvard colleagues, he described the inquiry as painful. The letter, which was shown to the Globe, said that his lab has been under investigation for three years by a Harvard committee, and that evidence of misconduct was found. He alluded to unspecified mistakes and oversights that he had made, and said he will be on leave for the upcoming academic year."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"This book represents an impressive interdisciplinary attempt at presenting the biological, psychological and cultural context of moral action. Hauser (and i guess his graduate students) has compiled data from an array of disciplines - animal behavior, developmental psychology, sociology, anthropology, sociology, philosophy/ethics/logic to show that what we consider to be \\"moral\\" is highly conditioned by biology (the innate revulsion at engaging in evolutionary non-advantageous behavior) and culture (say, the different attitudes towards 'honor killings' in Afghanistan and Norway). Morality presents us with countless conundrums and paradoxes, which are eloquently described by Hauser (eg, several versions of the well-known \\"trolley dilemma\\"). It would seem that moral action ultimately depends on self-awareness - the individuation of the sense of self, and its recognition that life is not about selfish accumulation of goods and status but rather that real pleasure derives from being 'part of the bigger picture'.I enjoyed this book, and in my opinion the author (who has engendered his own share of ethical dilemmas) is essentially on the right track regarding his elusive subject. If I had an issue with the book it would be its disorganization, a certain opacity, a refusal to synthesize and a tendency to drone and ramble. Nonetheless, this is one of the best works that I've been able to see that presents a wholistic context grounded in real data and common sense. No esoteric philosophizing. If you are willing to grind through the disorganization, you may find this book worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"Professor Hauser does a superb job of looking at the moral facility present in the human mind. He differentiates between the cognitive moral abilities of humanity and the non-human community, by subtracting those characteristics which are discernible from observing the animal kingdom. His approach coupled with a Rawlsian (John Rawls, A Theory of Justice) perspective elucidates a compelling argument as to why humans exhibit such a complex variety of moral behaviors which go well beyond our genomic predilection or divine predetermination. Many highly emotional social issues are coupled inextricably to our moral sensibilities. Philosophers, scientists, psychologists and theologians have generated enormous amounts of speculative dialog on the subject of morality, many without really taking a structured look at why we are so predisposed to operate like automatons when it comes to moral matters.Linguistics has developed a number tools for examining the cognitive process and its potential relationship to a moral grammar. These tools have been finding their way into the morality discussion by thinkers such as Rawls, Pinker, Chomsky and Mikhail. Humans exhibit a broad range of moral behaviors, but the syntactic expression is a predicate construct. Normally, morality operates at a subconscious level. Even when challenged to provide a rational explanation, we often bumble our way through whatever pedagogical exposure we have to ultimately support the 'Don't confuse me with the facts, I have my mind made up already' position.Hauser uses econometric experimental data to demonstrate that a number of animals have impressive decision making abilities, but have significant future discounting skepticism. Even when trained to perform a series of complicated cooperative tasks, altruistic behavior seems restricted to kin and mostly females. We have risen above our wolf-like selfish gene origins and are tweaked like dogs to behave far more cooperatively outside of our clique. If we are to continue being successful as a species, we need to provide more opportunity for the seven billion of us to reduce our sensitivity to the subtle nuances which keep us from getting along globally. Absolutism's only real application is in the weird world of low temperature physics, not human morality. The conclusions raised in the epilogue are constructed on a solid foundation built in the preceding chapters. This book provides readers with an exciting opportunity to delve into the hidden realm of their own morality and expand their consciousness."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"I got this book after hearing Hauser give a very illluminating and fascinating interview on NPR. Sadly his book is not as nearly interesting as his interview technique is. He repeats his thesis into the ground many times. His clever examples are sometimes not so clever. The book is too long and wordy. Being a lover of philosophy, I of all people never thought I would say that about a book. That can be a good thing in capable hands, but Hauser is definitely a scientist and not a writer. Some better editing and tightening of the text would've made this book a real winner. Finally, the link to linguistics, a main theme of the book, is a turn off for me personally as the linguistics field in no way interests me. However, one refreshing aspect is that he amdits its a theory. Sometimes I feel contemporary science books are too ready to start claiming themselves to be fact. Only get it if you can find it cheap, and hopefully Hausers honesty, enthusiasm and knowledge will get you past the poor writing, sadly it wasn't the case for me."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"Marc D. Hauser sums up a wealth of findings on our moral status quo collected by evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology and developmental psychology and he does this in a very readable manner. Then and now he also throws a sidelong glance on culturally determined varieties of morals. Altruistic impulses and behavior can be proved to have a far-reaching cross-cultural statistical homogeneity. On request we come up with moral judgments and decisions spontaneously following intuitions. Rational deliberation and justification limps behind - as far as individuals are able to provide it at all. Thus we are allowed to assume a universal moral grammar in analogy to linguistic universal grammar. From the fact that we are natural moral beings Hauser concludes that the \\"marriage between morality and religion is not only forced but unnecessary, crying out for a divorce.\\" (p. XX) On the other hand he presents experiments which demonstrate that moral reactions and norms originating in bygone sociocultural conditions (as those of a nomadic or livestock herders society) keep influencing behaviour for generations after fundamental change in society has occurred. A warning for all euphorics of enlightenment and rapid political progress. But on the whole the book tilts a little bit to much to the optimistic side as far as moral naturalism is concerned. Hausers point of view is somewhat concentrated on the lab perspective. He describes the well-known harrowing Milgram experiments on authority. But he doesn't really take into account that aggression and violence can grasp whole societies under unfavourable conditions. A critical stadium of such a development passed there remains no adequate reward for peaceful behaviour and altruism. And all this is also part and consequence of our nature, our \\"moral minds\\". Hauser hardly touches the psychology of historic moral catastrophes. A comparable good book on the sociocultural status quo of our morals widely considering history would still have to be written by somebody who is able to take into account evolutionary psychology as well. This would provide a still broader and more realistic overview of our human \\"Is of the Ought\\". And beyond begins the task of philosophy (which no doubt religion is unable to complete): To which extent can empirically tested dispositions of our universal grammar be justified? How do we justify our choice among the various offers and claims of \\"ought\\"?"},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"Over the last decade the study of the human brain has moved out of the leafy halls of academia into many different fields, including ethics and the law. If socially unacceptable behavior is being driven by some wiring problem in the brain, is a person legally liable? Or is the brain just one part of the chain of causes with learning and experience playing a larger part? The lion's share of the evidence indicates that genes and the brain determine how we interact with the environment rather than determining how we behave, but there is still a great deal of research that needs to be done.This book has been getting a lot of attention and for a very good reason: not only is it a well-written account by someone who is an exceptionally clear thinker, but the implications of his book stretch far beyond simple academic discussions: they have implications not only for neuroscience, but for ethics, spirituality and the law.Marc Hauser is a biologist at Harvard and in this book he argues that the human moral sense is inbuilt and the product of evolution, much like our capacity for language. He suggests that the structure of our minds - or at least our brains - reflect our egalitarian hunter-gatherer past and reveals \\"left over circuitry from the cavemen.\\"Hauser begins by contrasting three approaches to moral thinking:The first was espoused by the philosopher Immanuel Kant in the late eighteenth century, who proposed that we follow a categorical imperative. In Kant's view, we could and should live by the Golden Rule, treating others as we would have them treat us, and never using people merely as a means to something else.The second approach was proposed by the eighteen century Scottish philosopher David Hume, who came to the conclusion that reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions. So if we do something because we are frustrated or angry, we should be castigated and punished because we failed to express out true nature.The third approach is that of the political philosopher John Rawls. Rawls - like the Harvard linguist Noam Chomsky - proposed that there are deep similarities between language and morality. Chomsky believes that we are hardwired to understand and produce language, while Rawls believes that we all have an innate moral faculty. What that means is that we are all born with an ability to form moral judgments, and that we do not simply embrace the views of our family, tribe or church. The rub is this: because it is an innate ability bred of countless millennia of evolution, we often have no idea why we hold the views they we do.The parallels between our innate morality and language are explored in this book.When a twenty-nine year old Chomsky produced his first book in 1957 it created a firestorm of protest as well as some enthusiastic acceptance. We know that people the world over utter grammatical sentences in their own language, but it had been assumed that it began as simple mimicry: children copied the language, syntax and grammar of their parents and others. But Chomsky proposed that the ability is hardwired into the structure of the brain, and that is why we have little or no insight into how grammar works. By analogy, Hauser proposes that children and adults construct moral codes and make judgments without any insight into their reasons for doing so.Hauser is an acclaimed academic, and it is no surprise that he supports his hypothesis with an array of thought-provoking examples, some better known than others.One of the better known has been used in psychology and philosophy classes for years. It is the Trolley Problem, taken from a classic set of moral dilemmas proposed by the philosopher Phillipa Foot. The story goes like this. A bystander named Denise is a passenger on an out-of-control railway trolley, which is speeding down the track with an incapacitated driver. The vehicle is heading directly toward five people on the track ahead, bringing with it certain death. Denise can flip a switch that would turn the trolley onto a sidetrack with just one person on it. That one person will die, saving the other five. Should she flip the switch? Hauser's own intuition is that she should, and he marshals various moral arguments to support him.But now comes the second part. Consider another bystander named Frank. He is on a footbridge over the same railway trolley with the same five endangered people. On the bridge is a large man whom Frank can push off the bridge and so stop the trolley and save the five. Should he do so? Should he sacrifice one man to save five?Here Hauser's view is that he should not. But exactly why not? Is it because of Denise and Frank's intentions? Is it because Frank would be using the man as a means? In each case the result is the same, one person is killed and five are saved. This is interesting, not as an academic exercise, but because most people come up with similar responses to the dilemma.Here is another example: what if a surgeon can save the lives of five dying people by taking organs from one perfectly healthy person? Almost no one says that this action is justified, but why not? In fact when such a thing was actually done during the Holocaust, the prosecutors at Nuremberg considered it to be one of the most egregious of all the crimes committed. The utter breakdown of agreed moral norms during those dark years and continuing depravity in some parts of the world remains a challenge for philosophers and scientists to this day; including the author of this book.Hauser is evidently a good teacher, and he constructs a number of variations of these themes to show us that, with the kinds of exceptions that I just mentioned, the intuitions of very different people are usually much the same. Second. He shows how difficult it is to provide logical justifications for those intuitions. Like all good teachers he includes some personal disclosures, and tells an amusing tale about his own father, who, despite being an intelligent and well-educated physicist, became confused and frustrated when he tried to find logical justifications for his immediate responses.Hauser reviews evidence from different cultures and from his own research using an online Moral Sense Test, to show how little judgments vary between people of different backgrounds and cultures.This leads to another important similarity between language and morality. Languages are not chaotic: they follow certain constraints. All known languages follow a set of universal principles. But there are also a set of variable parameters that include the order of words, different ways of making plurals, gender attributions and all those other nuances that can frustrate anyone trying to master a foreign language. Hauser argues that it is the same with morality: there are universal principles and culture-bound parameters. He continues the parallels to point out that as with a language, once people acquire their specific moral grammar, other grammars may seem as incomprehensible as does Japanese to a native English speaker.He illustrates his thesis with valuable discussions about murder and manslaughter, the treatment of women in different cultures, attitudes to abortion, euthanasia, pedophilia and incest, together with notions of fairness and punishment.The book is illustrated by some delightful little drawings that do an excellent job of breaking up the narrative.Marc Hauser if a very good writer and the book is not a difficult read, despite weighing in at over 400 closely reasoned pages. He makes many points that need to be heard. Not only by his colleagues and by people curious to understand more about themselves and those around them, but also by politicians, lawyers and ethicists.Highly recommended.Richard G. Petty, MD, author ofHealing, Meaning and Purpose: The Magical Power of the Emerging Laws of Life"},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"In a grand way Marc Hauser represents centuries of philosophy intermingled with anecdotes from psychological, anthropological, and economic research. Unfortunately, what he doesn't do is provide a scientific grounding for understanding moral choice.To understand why people call things right and wrong you need to start with the biology of learning, expectation, and cognition. Given that we are just barely now scratching the surface of these topics Hauser's attempt was bound to fail. His own morals pervade the book and act as logical starting points for his arguments, but rarely does he act as a scientist and dismiss his own morality to seek out the real question which is, \\"How does the brain create a sense of right and wrong, and is there any definitive proof that there is a universal biological morality?\\"Neuroscience tells us that there are very few things we are hardwired to do that we cannot unlearn or adapt to deal with our environments. Hauser spectacularly fails to convince that any moral code is anything other than a learned societal norm."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"The book is a fine introduction to current research on moral decision-making in humans and animals. The science of morality is newborn, and Hauser's analogy of a \\"moral grammar' is both illuminating and likely foreshadows the course of future research on the topic. The style is light and readable, and the book is filled with interesting moral puzzles. The common answers to these puzzles are sometimes surprising and always interesting, and the connections between the choices we make and those made by our animal kin are nicely drawn. If you seek an answer to \\"If we are evolved, how can we act morally?\\" then you will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"This book itself is a perfect example of irony. Dr. Marc Hauser has been found to have faked his published scientific data:[...]"},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"When Darwin discovered natural selection, he was quick and remarkably insightful as to how this might affect our understanding of our own species, Homo sapiens. Alfred Russel Wallace, the impressive co-discover of the theory, never agreed to its application to humans. He considered our mental faculties far too advanced to be accounted for by the same forces that gave rise to pond scum and even chimpanzees. The debate continues to this very day, and will not be resolved in the forseeable future.Nevertheless, there is now little doubt but that we share many of our mental faculties with other species, including, as Marc Hauser shows us in this fine volume, some of our moral capacities. Even those we do not share with our evolutionary relatives, he claims, are clearly the product of biological evolutionary forces. I think his argument accurately reflects our current state of knowledge, and is impressive indeed. Sociobiology, which was roundly rejected and indeed excoriate by most behavioral scientists when first proposed by Edward O. Wilson in 1975, has been fully vindicated.The past decade has seen a strong push for the notion that ethics is a part of science, and the philosophy of ethics, in principle, ought not to be that different from the philosophy of physics. In particular, our ethical notions do not come from some rarified Platonic realm, or the capacity to perceive synthetic a prioris, or our superior informational processing power, but rather from our evolution as a species that has spend most of its history living in small bands of mobile, propertyless, stateless, hunter-gatherers.Hauser deals with our current understanding of virtally all aspects of the mental life of humans, cognitive, affective, and moral, and he consistently weaves an intellectual web in which the mental capacities of animals and humans are inextricably interwoven. His specific claim, and unique to my knowledge, is that we can understand human morality in much the same manner as we have come to understand human language, based on the work of Chomsky and his coworkers. Humans are genetically endowed with a universal moral grammar, a tool kit for building specific human moralities, the latter being the product of cultural specificity. Thus, just as we cannot understand a foreign tongue, so we cannot appreciate a foreign morality, even though we know it springs from the same basic human capacities.I think the analogy of ethics with language is a fruitful one, and well argued by Hauser on the basis of the facts (e.g., people cannot defend their ethical beliefs any more than they can explain the rules of grammar that they follow, unless they have been trained to do so). I am less sure that it is true. This is because the actual content of ethical principles is largely the same across all societies, and certainly across major religious and cultural groups (see Donald Brown, Human Universals, and Hauser's discussion of religion, pp. 421ff). We humans certainly can amplify our petty differences (e.g., what to eat, what to call our God, when to wear what), and there are important non-petty differences (tolerance, gender equality, abortion and homosexuality), but these vary systematically with level of economic development, and are not the cocophony of human languages.This book is written for the novice, and is a wonderful introduction to the recent liturature on the human mind, by an eminent researcher whose knowledge of \\"wild minds\\" (the title of his previous book) is unsurpassed, and who has enriched us all by turning his gaze to human primates."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"This is a horribly written (at times incoherent) and poorly argued for book. Hauser's main thesis is that humans have a \\"moral grammar\\" analogous to the universal grammar made famous by Chomsky's theory of human language acquisition. Unfortunately Hauser offers little evidence to support his \\"theory\\" of universal moral grammar. His theory is actually a loosely held together notion that is more armchair speculation than actual systematic scientific theory.My first complaint is stylistic. I am usually not a stickler for style in scientific writing but the book is so bad in this area that something must be said to warn the potential reader. The reader is subjected to prose that meanders between the redundant to the trivial to the nonsensical. For example, odd phraseology such as describing at one point how one can \\"literally\\" pull \\"propositions\\" out of a hat slow the reading down and makes the reader wonder about the English proficiency of the writer. Hauser also repeatedly makes seemingly absurd claims without any justification such as claiming that Swedes would wage warfare on anyone who would dare to try to tell them to change religions (p. 416). I am not being nitpicky here; the book is filed with these kinds of stupid, nonsensical, and absolutely bizarre statements.Content wise, the book also fails. Hauser tries to establish his \\"theory\\" by listing a hodgepodge of empirical studies from ethology, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology and economics which he claims support it. Unfortunately the reader is not given any reason whatsoever to believe this. It's an uncontroversial truth that humans do have innate moral instincts given us by our evolutionary history but philosophers have known about the natural inclinations toward morality for, literally, thousands of years (Aristotle, Confucius, Mencius, for example all described how humans are naturally endowed with moral instincts, capacities, dispositions and emotions). This thesis is not new and it does have justification in the empirical sciences. But to claim that there are universal grammars analogous to universal linguistic grammars is to make a far stronger and more audacious claim, a claim that Hauser does not prove in this work (it seems to me he doesn't even offer much of an attempt). Many of the experiments he uses to \\"support\\" his thesis are only tenuously linked to it at best. At times Hauser strains to establish a connection and at other times no connection is apparent at all. His strategy seems to be to impress readers by throwing as much information as possible at them in the hope of impressing them with red herrings. At times, even Hauser seems to get confused by his own examples and how they are linked to his thesis. The critical reader gets the impression that Hauser's repeated uses of ad hoc interpretations of the experimental data are desperate attempts to save what little substance there is in the book.In arguing his case, he also makes use of ideas developed from moral philosophers. But his understanding of moral philosophy is grossly inadequate. His \\"Humean Creature\\" would have been completely alien to David Hume; his \\"Rawlsian Creature\\" likewise to John Rawls. It seems to me that he could have completely omitted all the talk of these moral creatures and stuck with the sciences, subject matters he has had far more experience with albeit uses incompetently to establish a very nebulous claim."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"Hauser ends his book \\"Moral Minds\\" as follows.\\"The notion of a universal moral grammar with parametric variation provides one way to think about pluralism. It requires us to understand how, in development, particular parameters are fixed by experience. It also requires us to appreciate that once fixed, we may be as perplexed by another community's moral system as we are by their language. Appreciating the fact that we share a universal moral grammar, and that at birth we could have acquired any of the world's moral systems, should provide us with a sense of comfort, a sense that perhaps we can understand each other.\\" (p 406)I have rarely started a book with such delight only to end it with such disgust.Hauser is not only wrong but lazy when he says we may be \\"as perplexed by another community's moral system as we are by their language.\\" It is *impossible* to be as perplexed by another community's morality as we are by its language. (Though female genital mutilation and honor killings horrify me, they do not perplex me: I \\"get it\\" but I also reject it.)As for acquiring \\"any of the world's moral systems,\\" Hauser never identifies and distinguishes them. I would like to know if he's thinking there are six major moral systems, or fifty, or several hundred if not thousands. The only moral systems he has a serious interest in are those of Kant, Hume, and Rawls, but Hauser never makes clear in what sense those three men were speaking different moral languages. Further, he attributes the three systems to these specific individuals and not the communities wherein these men grew up and presumably had the parameters of their native moral tongues permanently fixed. (One would think that Hauser would realize that by attributing the three most important ethical theories going--in his view, anyway--to individuals rather than communities, he has undercut his assumption that we take in our morality the way we take in our native languages. No one \\"grows up\\" Kantian; one chooses it.)Hauser does speak of the ethics of hunter-gatherer communities, and of herding communities. He blames excessive violence in the American South on the region's Irish and Scotch settlers--herders--whose honor-based morality contrasts sharply with that of peaceful German and Dutch farmers who settled the North. But if a Southern (Irish) woman marries a Northern (Dutch) man, what is the moral language of their children?Hauser sees UMG explaining why people from many backgrounds give the same answer to moral dilemmas. I think this is a conceptual mistake. Granted, I'm no linguist and may misperceive the analogy, but it seems to me that Chomsky's universal grammar focuses on the *structure* of spoken languages whereas Hauser focuses on the *content* of moral judgments.Further, Hauser focuses only on moral emergencies. This would be like a linguistic theory that explained only expletives. (Grammatically, expletives are *exceptional* cases.) We have a multitude of chances to cheat on our taxes or spread rumors about colleagues but few chances to make an instantaneous life or death decision. Consider how Hauser treats a *slow* life and death decision, the Terri Schiavo case.Hauser favored the removal of feeding tubes. Further, he argues that those opposed to this were basing their judgments on religious teachings and that morality and religion should be \\"divorced.\\" But he argues elsewhere that moral judgments are *immune* to religious instruction; yet if that were so, such a divorce would make absolutely no difference at all. (Most who favor the divorce of religion and morality think that religion has a negative moral impact and *that* is why they want the divorce; it makes no sense to ask for a divorce if religion is *irrelevant* to one's moral judgments.)Hauser is having it both ways: arguing that moral judgments are immune to religious instruction but then saying that the Terri Schiavo controversy arose because some people were making moral judgments based on religious instruction while other people (-in the same culture, no less) were not. Also, he clearly thinks those who wanted to remove the tubes were right and those who did not were wrong, but he provides no basis for judging the relative merits of claims made in different moral languages.I understand that Hauser is using language as an analogy and that no analogy is perfect, but I finished this book wondering in what ways he thought the analogy held. There are thousands of languages but apparently just a few moral systems. Some of these moral systems may be attributed to a specific individual, which no one's native language can be. If morality is like language, why aren't there as many moral systems as languages? What is the moral equivalent of being bi-lingual? One can translate Greek philosophy into Latin, or German, or English, but how can one translate \\"herder morality\\" into \\"farmer morality\\"? Or Christian morality into atheist terms? Or Rawlsian morality into Kantian terms?Hauser has gathered much fascinating research but his assessment is more than shaky."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"The most dangerous question Charles Darwin implied [but didn't ask] was what Nature imposed on humans. It was bad enough for Victorians to be confronted with the idea of an ape-like ancestor. If this was so, what did it say about our sense of values? Whatever else Darwin challenged about our fixed notions of who we are, that one remains in central place. There have been several attempts recently to address the question. Marc Hauser's is not only the most recent, but perhaps the most thorough, of these efforts. In this gracefully written account, he takes us through his reasoning and the evidence supporting it.Following his earlier \\"Wild Minds\\" on other animals, Hauser turns to what makes up human values and how they're achieved. To anyone understanding the process of natural selection, the idea of \\"morals\\" as the product of evolution should be a given. Unsatisfied with assumptions, Hauser collects a wealth of information in support of how we derive our values. He sets the data against some \\"standard\\" views of what is right and proper behaviour. Drawing on well-known thinkers, he synopsises their views into fabricated entities: the Kantian, Humean, and Rawlsian \\"creatures\\". Each represents a different approach in determining what is \\"fair\\" and just in the works of Immanuel Kant, David Hume and John Rawls [Hauser provides little cartoon figures as visual aids to help remember these. The publisher had the wit to keep these minimally sized.]. As might be expected, none of these stances are absolutes, and Hauser often confronts us with amalgamations of the positions. What's important isn't the melding itself, but why it has taken place. As humans, we can avoid absolutes and do so on a daily basis. There is, however, a mechanism that was built up over the millennia of our evolutionary track, providing the common foundation for these decisions and our ability to rationalise them.\\"Morality\\", he argues derives from what humans consider \\"fair\\" in our interactions with each other. Making the judgement of what is \\"fair\\" is an example of how humans break rigid biological bonds which is, in large part, what distinguishes us from others in the animal kingdom. There are fundamentally common aspects to our sense of what is \\"moral\\", but there are also variants, generally culturally based. The commonalities we observe are related, in Hauser's view, to Noam Chomsky's \\"language module\\". Dubbing it a \\"moral organ\\", he's careful not to assign it specific location or even clear function, but it must be an aspect of how our brains consider the world and our place in it.The pivotal element in his analysis is \\"The Trolley Test\\". This classic example pits the lives of five people against one. How are the five to be saved? Are you responsible for the one if you divert the trolley that takes her life? What optional versions provide further insights into what we consider valuable in our interpersonal relations? And, for this study, what is the underlying basis for developing the idea of \\"morals\\" at all? Hauser turns to studies of children at various ages, from close to birth through adolescence for explanations. Children perceive much more than we credit them for, due mostly to their lacking skills to communicate. It's clear that while children may often be selfish monsters, they also exhibit early a sense of empathy that extends beyond or by-passes parental input. Actions, here, definitely speak louder than words. They also show that any sense of \\"morals\\" cannot be a rigid structure. There must be flexibility and adaptability.Hauser's proposal can only stir further discussion and investigation. That, indeed, is his stated purpose. While we are unable to reach back into our evolutionary past to record how the proposed \\"moral organ\\" developed and how much it determines our behaviour and judgements. Many aspects of our society will be influenced by this book. It should give parents some pause when they find their dictates and a child's response clashing. Lawmakers and judges should consider this book required reading, since it necessarily means abandonment of some fundamental assumptions in the legal system. Hauser's examples even reach into the realm of international affairs and diplomacy. What else could be the result of looking at the question of \\"morals\\" in a global framework? It's a compelling study, requiring close reading with an open mind. How many of us are equipped for the task?

Various moral and social systems have long tried to codify and explain away through religious and other naratives what is only natural to us. Kudos to Mark Hauser for bringing our innate \\"moral organ\\" to broad attention.His writing however is another matter. I suggest, read his introductory chapter \\"What Is Wrong?\\" and then cherry-pick from the rest of the book as much of the following material is highly repetitive. This is topic waiting to be tackled again by another, stronger writer."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"If an ethical theory is to be useful and applicable to everyday life, its foundations must be drawn from human experiences, from what a human being has actually faced and might face in the real world. If this is not done, then it is merely a philosophical construction, and will lose itself in the gigantic conceptual spaces constructed by philosophical speculation. Ethical thought experiments are therefore to be avoided at all costs, as they complicate the issues at hand and make it appear that ethical reasoning is only proper in literary or verbal channels. It may be interesting or fun to debate hypothetical ethical dilemmas, but if there is not even one historical example that illustrate these dilemmas, their value for ethics is completely vitiated.The author of this book unfortunately makes use of several hypothetical ethical dilemmas to assist in building his case for a theory of ethics that could, following the same nomenclature in linguistics, be described as \`generative'. Therefore, moral reasoning, like language, is the result of a particular ability of the human mind (brain) and as such is universal in its grammatical patterns, even though these patterns can vary over geographical location and be parametrized by different cultures. Morality is instinctual, the author argues, and it is unaffected by the dictates of both religion and governmental institutions. The moral grammar that the author discusses, and his arguments to support it, is of course very analogous to the generative grammar of Chomskian linguistics. He even gives an analogue of the famous \`poverty of the stimulus' argument of Noam Chomsky, in that he asks whether the environment contains enough information to construct a moral grammar.This hypothesis may at first sight appear radical, and in the jacket of the book and in the author's prologue it is advertised as such. But given the advances in cognitive neuroscience that have taken place in the last fifteen years, it now seems that an ethical theory based on scientific principles is within reach. The author claims that his is such a theory, and he endeavors to justify it with what is known in evolutionary psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and related areas. It is refreshing to hear that the author wants to finally divorce morality and religion, and he feels a sense of urgency in proposing a different outlook on morality. The traditional ones have caused us great trouble, he states emphatically.In general the author presents a fair case for his conception of morality, but there are problems with his approach. The first deals with his use of thought experiments and his insistence, sometimes merely implicit, of the superiority of the moral philosophy of John Rawls. The author views Rawls as being one of the most important contributors to the problem of justice and fairness. The moral/ethical conceptions of Rawls are contrasted with those of Immanuel Kant and David Hume, with the Kantian conception being one characterized by duty, and the Humean emphasizing emotional responses. Rawls, at least the way the author understands him, asserts that moral judgments are driven by principles that are not part of conscious awareness. Even more interesting for the Rawlsian viewpoint is that the moral agent is not usually able to provide justification for a particular action or set of actions. The \`operative principles' on which judgments are based do not however have to be known by the moral agent, and this agent does not usually arrive at a moral decision by conscious reasoning from specific principles. Further, moral dilemmas or conflicts are resolved by \`considered judgment', which is done on very short time scales and is essentially automatic. Lastly, the author discusses the now famous Rawlsian thought experiment of \`original position' which was designed (apparently) to find the unconscious principles of justice that are contained in the moral faculty of an agent. The principles of justice must however be discovered behind a \`veil of ignorance' so as to eliminate the bias of social status, religious beliefs, etc.But Rawls falters here, since the veil of ignorance is an idealistic ephemeral construct, and while being favorable to philosophers who enjoy these types of abstractions, is not a practical strategy for discovering ethical truths. Bias is absolutely necessary for the discovery of not only ethical truth but all truth, for it enables one to frame an issue clearly so that it is accessible to experiment and study. A biased hypothesis is one that is more easily refuted if it is indeed wrong. A hypothesis that is floppy or unconstrained is much more difficult to find counterexamples to, and has much less predictive power. And the veil of ignorance seems to fall into a Marxian trap here since it is implicitly assuming that one's social status or membership in a class structure determines one's reasoning patterns on a particular issue. Rawls then invites \\"reasonable men\\" to free themselves from their social status in order to think more clearly about ethical issues. What Rawls is asking may be possible but it would be inefficient. What is really needed is a group of individuals of all backgrounds suggesting ideas as quickly as possible and then finding their flaws collectively. The search tree for principles of justice can then be more efficiently pruned. The author does in a later section of the book allude to the need and inevitability of errors in forming a worldview or theory. Errors that keep repeating in a theory, the author argues, are an indication that the theory is too rigid and immune to counterexamples. This requires a break with the past and attempting a new theory that goes against expectations. A successful theory of moral intelligence, either similar to the author's or not, will require an ability of theory to confront new situations and propose alternative courses of action.The author is aware of the problems in Rawlsian moral philosophy, and even more aware of the extreme difficulties is testing their applicability and practicality in the real world. To test Rawlsian principles and their insistence on long-term \\"reflective equilibrium' one needs large blocks of time and a method for monitoring whether a collection of experimental subjects indeed followed these principles in the period under question. Did these subjects actually follow the principles or did they alter them as they confronted new situations in life?These problems with Rawlsian philosophy do not completely undermine the author's case for an intrinsic moral grammar, but his use of thought experiments does to some extent. In the chapter entitled \\"Grammars of Violence\\" for example he discusses some favorite \\"moral dilemmas\\" of philosophers such as the \\"trolley problem\\". These are used to frame ethical issues and study responses to hypothetical scenarios, such as when it is permissible to kill. However there is not one historical example of any of these scenarios on the books, and as such they have a artificial air about them. They are good for philosophical diatribe but nothing more really, and completely unnecessary for building a scientific foundation for ethics. The author seems to be aware of this to some extent, since in that same chapter he reminds the reader that scientific evidence plays no role in the musings of moral philosophers. And he asks philosophers to consider the fact that many people may arrive at different answers to ethical dilemmas then they do, and that this variation may be more than just faulty thinking on the part of these people. Science can investigate this variation more meaningfully by taking philosophical insight \\"to the streets.\\" And in this same chapter the author's analysis of \`macho cultures' is fascinating and definitely worthy of attention and reflection.There are many more thought-provoking discussions in the book, which are outside the ill-defined boundaries of philosophy and touch on experimental efforts. One of these concerns the inability of three-year old children to access the knowledge and beliefs of other people. The author believes that this fact is crucial to an understanding of the origins of moral thinking, in that the child will need to be able to identify her own shortcomings, at least when judged relative to the affect they have on other people. And it is clear when reading the chapter \\"The Moral Organ\\" that the author believes that a successful theory of morals and ethics must be tied to what is known about the brain, i.e. the research and results in the field of neuroscience must be consulted at every step. It is in this chapter that skepticism regarding the moral dilemma/thought experiments discussed earlier will be somewhat alleviated, as the author discusses some neuroimaging studies that indicate a relationship between brain activation and these moral dilemmas. The author though is intellectually honest enough to state that this research does not indicate the existence of a neural system for selectively processing moral content.Morality that is based on religion or that is rule-based is of course rejected by the author, due mostly to its impotence in resolving important moral issues. No set of canons or legal principles can cover every contingency, and the moral agent must be able to adapt to novel situations and still maintain a moral perspective. The religions of the world fail at this miserably, and therefore their role in a scientific vision of morality will be marginal or even vacuous. The author though realizes that much work remains in deriving a science of morality, and he alludes to the growing influence of science into ethical inquiry. The role of religion, philosophy and sociology in moral considerations will therefore be eclipsed by what is being done in the scientific laboratory, and maybe at the end of the twenty-first century the divorce between science and religion will be complete, with no reconciliation possible."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"Hauser wants to develop a science of morality, which is increasingly feasible by combining insights from psychology, neuroscience, ethology (study of animals in natural settings), sociobiology (evolutionary origins of social behavior)and direct, empirical investigation of moral judgments. While I have had exposure to the first four fields before, I found the material on moral judgments new and fascinating, albeit challenging. We seem to make fine moral distinctions based on the proper application of complex principles most of us cannot consciously even begin to identify. Since, as Hauser argues, our basic moral sense is inherited, but \\"parameterized\\" by culture, it would be interesting to learn how culture teaches us these fine distinctions.Hauser can write clearly and make effective use of analogies. Yet I found the book so unnecessarily wordy that I lost patience and stopped reading at p260. Hauser is much too concerned with his non-scientific predecessors in the field, and redundant. I wold also point out that the ethologist Frans de Waal in his book \\"Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals\\" (1996) made the same analogies between language acquisition and the acquisition of morality that Hauser does. This should have been a great book, but is not."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"This book affirms something that I have thought true for some time now - that morality is governed by instinctual paradigms in healthy individuals. Hearing from birth and from right-wing sources on the news daily that our morality can only be saved by a reversion to \\"biblical\\" mores, I had always wondered why the statistics do not back this \\"moral majority\\" up. For instance, in countries like Sweden and Iceland and many other European nations where secularism is high, they have much lower rates of crime and their citizens are just as happy if not more so than the average Sunday-bible-toting-American who thinks they have a \\"higher\\" version of morality than the \\"godless heathen.\\"Hauser cites empirical data that shows that morality is often operating at an unconscious level in human beings as evidenced by tests where subjects make a moral choice but then can offer only incoherent justifications. Hauser's parallel to our \\"Language Instinct\\" here is spot on, given that most native speakers can form perfectly grammatical sentences, but if asked about detailed grammatical structures and relationships, they fail miserably. This, I think, is one reason that religion enjoys its ascendant status (at least in America) in regards to morality. Religion is an overt manifestation of moral principles, something people otherwise have little or no conscious access to. It doesn't matter how outdated or ridiculous religious \\"morals\\" are, people will cling to them because in their minds it is the only available source of a description of morality. The faster that science can describe these principles, the better off humanity will be.Taking in relevant topics from moral philosophy, economics, psychology, and of course, the meat of his argument, socio-biological findings from our primate and animal cousins, Hauser shows that the precursors of human morality, at least in rudimentary form, are present in many other animals. This presence gives science a strong foothold in the arena of ethics. These findings must be to the chagrin of such writers as Francis Collins who invoked the god of the gaps in \\"The Language of God\\" to explain that human morality must be due to divine fiat. Indeed it is not."},{"Title":"Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong","review":"This book is about a very interesting subject but it's been nothing but misery to read. I think Hauser must have actually decided that the key to writing readable, engaging non-fiction is to NEVER walk in a straight line. So we have him wandering here, and there, and everywhere. The burden is on the reader to figure out what he's really up to. What specific moral instincts is he postulating? What's the evidence that there are instincts? How is his theory about moral instincts like Haidt's or Pinker's?

As far as I have been able to find out (summer 2001) the publisher is not interested in a reissue or in selling the copyright.However, the more tricky you are with Fontographer, the more you need this book because it goes well beyond the software manual! Oh, and for the person who wants to do a ct ligature, buy Adobe's Bickham Script for a masterful example."},{"Title":"Fontographer: Type by Design","review":"Every review of this book touts its usefulness. I have searched for other books on Fontographer, none exist. I would love to get a copy of this. Will the publisher ever reprint? How do we let them know its valuable and needed?"},{"Title":"Fontographer: Type by Design","review":"I got this book a few years ago. It has good information but is in dire need of copyediting -- typos on every page, just about -- and a better index.It shouldn't be considered a substitute to the Fontographer manual (or the tech notes, which are available on the web site) but a supplement.Butcha know, what really annoyed me was where they use a ct ligature in the text but never tell you how to make on yrself."},{"Title":"Fontographer: Type by Design","review":"I bought the book on a recommendation from Thomas Phinney. It's good. Obviously very dated because Fontographer is long gone (sadly). Yes, I know know it's been rereleased by FontLab, but without OpenType support, the excellent interface is not worth much.But the information on spacing, serif design and so on is still very good. I found the book to be helpful."},{"Title":"Fontographer: Type by Design","review":"I'm in need of a manual other than one which came with software for Macromediat's Typographer 4.1 ... would love to see this one come back. Count me in, please."},{"Title":"IN DEFENCE OF POLITICS","review":"I cannot believe that I am the first one to do a review ofBernard Crick's great masterpiece, &quot;In Defense of Politics.&quot;This is a honor that forces me to question my worthiness. Crick so aptly understood that the aiming for a kind of absolutist perfection in any human relationship is dooming oneself to inevitable bitter disillusionment. This may especially be true within the political sphere. Those who indulge in a virtual cult of adoring specific &quot;great men&quot; totally misunderstand the goal of politics. Democracy can never be more than an attempt to search out a workable compromise between disagreeing citizens. A certain agnosticism concerning one's position is often required; a dogmatic true believer mentality may indeed become dangerous and threaten the very tenuous underpinnings of our governmental institutions. We must indeed strive to improve our political process. It is even a moral obligation to do so. Nonetheless, The search for the perfect and virtuous leader to give one's unhesitating allegiance and adoration has always resulted in a hell on earth.The political process is often yucky, disappointing, and after much effort may leave one at best with a half a loaf result. It has been said that there are two things someone with a weak disposition may wish to avoid---viewing the processing of sausage and the making of human law. Am I a cynic and possessing a defeatist attitude? The answer is an adamant no! On the contrary, Crick and I recognize the glorious possibilities of an evolving civilization premised upon frail and imperfect human beings. It takes incredible physical, intellectual and moral diligence to bring about viable human relationships of any sort. What we have so far accomplished in Great Britain and the United States is of mind boggling beauty and structural effectiveness. Bernard Crick understands the limits of politics and that a democratic society deserves two cheers, not three. Winston Churchill paradoxically said it best--democracy is usually disappointingly awful--it's simply better than all the other political systems devised and implemented throughout human history."},{"Title":"IN DEFENCE OF POLITICS","review":"One of Crick's key points is that losing is an essential part of the political (electoral) process. Everyone loses some of the time. But final, permanent and apocalyptic loss only occurs in absolutist societies which Crick contrasts with political societies. The political process always yields some results that are contrary to my ideology and to my interests. Forty years ago I was shocked by Crick's argument that this is a good thing. Now I hope the book will become better known and the author's position widely accepted. It's fine to work for my positions with passion and energy but not by spreading fear and anger."},{"Title":"In the Arms of a Hero (The Fortunes of Texas)","review":"WELL, BEVERLY BARTON HAS DONE IT AGAIN.

A New Era for Coordination ?Only the last two chapters (10 pages) allude to the topic.But like the other chapters, it stays really superficial, and the few anecdotes don't bring much.So for &quot;those navigating the rapids of multiple water resource planning agencies...&quot; I could recommend dozens of better books.Even as an introductory book, it is really too shallow and superficial, topics are rapidly discussed with little, if any, analysis.Finally and on top of that $40 for 100 pages, what a rip-off..."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"This gorgeous oversized hardcover (yes amazon has the wrong picture . . .) first gave me the impression that the authors' priority would be pretty pictures and recipes would come second. I was very pleased to find that I was wrong. The book has lovely and accurate recipes for everything an Indian Kitchen should have including how to make panner (indian home made cheese) chenna (cheese used to make desserts) yoghurt, obscure indian vegetables and the main staple recipes of most indian cookbooks. I do have two complaints - the recipes are given without possible western substitutions for indian ingredients . . E.G wrapping things in bananna leaves and cooking them. Sounds great but my indian store doesn't tend to carry bananna leaves. Would foil work?? I don't know. It usually helps if a recipe is tweaked to accomodate a western supermarket. Julie Sahni's book Savoring India does that wonderfully.Also, ocassionally there are fold out pages with little blurbs and pictures of things like street foods or snacks without a recipe for them. Nice to see but no way to cook them is provided.I would also like to make a comment about the growing size of the cookbooks nowadays. I hated the teensy weensy pocket paperbacks but these huge SUV's of the kitchen take up the entire counter space above a cabinet and are way to long and heavy for a standard cook book holder. about six inches shorter would have worked fine although some of the pretty decor would have had to go.All in all, a nice book for indian cooking"},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"When I decided to purchase an Indian cookbook, I looked extensively through the recipes in many different ones before buying this one. Yes, the pictures alone make this a coffee table book worth having, but the recipes were also very well laid out and looked acheivable.For a point of reference, I am a fairly experienced home cook, but not a pro by any stretch (except possibly a pro at cookbook collecting). This past Saturday night, I had a few friends over and made the following recipes (making them for the first time, I might add) - Butter Chicken, Lamb Korma, Matar Paneer, Raita, Carrot Halva (plus some spiced basmati rice). It was unbelievably scrumptious - with the added bonus of very straightforward, foolproof recipes. I hope to make my way through some more of them very soon. :)Ditto to several other reviewers' comments that you will need some special spices/ingredients if you don't already have a kitchen stocked for Indian cooking, but nothing that I was unable to find (in the Salt Lake City area). I highly recommend this cookbook."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"though the cover picture is wrong but the recepies aren't- i am a professional chef with quite a good expertise in indian cuisine and in pursue to sharpen my skills in south indian- i find the recipes easy and also authentic in every aspect- the author may be a srilankan national( a wild guess by her name) but the work and the dedication has made her a authentic indian to her work. It is very appreciable hats off to the author priya. I have tried a few reciepes which are perfect and the pictures in the book are extrodinary to the western eyes bringing the streets of indian market to them..I with no doubt give 5 star rating to this book"},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"This book is both gorgeous and useful. The many delicious recipes are interspersed with mini-photo essays on the geography and culture of the subcontinent. Every recipe I've tried from this book has been successful and delicious. (Try the Kasmiri chicken, cooked with yogurt, almonds, and pistachios!) However, I am lucky enough to live in a city (Houston) with a large ethnic Indian population and several sources of supply for some of the more unusual spices called for in these recipes without which it would be difficult to tackle these recipes."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"I use this cook book weekly, I love Indian food and this book really does an excellent job of going through step by step. Even my Indian friends say the food tastes like it does in India. I recommend this book highly. Oh, the almond corriander chicken is fantastic too!!!"},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"This is the ultimate Indian cookbook to own.This book explains in detail the delicacies of various parts of India. As many people know, India has culture, language and practices that differ vastly from one state to another. This book encompasses dishes from almost all the states of India. This book also explains when a meal is eaten (e.g. breakfast, special occassion etc). The photos of people, places, and dishes add good value to the book. I have tried many recipes and are quite authentic. (Since India is a large country, the meaning of authenticity of a particular dish varies from place to place). The ingredients are easily available in any specialty grocery store. If not, you can safely substitute/omit some of the ingredients.A must have for all Indian food cooks out there."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"Even though i was from India I amnow in the US where sometimes finding Indian ingredients could be a long lengthy process. This book not only retains the origian taste but also incorporates ingredients easily found in a non Indian environment. I absolutely love the andhra style chicken pulao and the chicken tikka masala. This book has made my mom proud (since she loves to take credit for training me with regards to cooking), little does she know i owe it all to this book."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"I received this book for Christmas and have used several recipes already.

It's simple: The Food Of India: A Journey For Food Lovers by Priya Wickramasinghe and Carol Selva Rajah is quite a cut above most of its similar-sounding competitors. In the first place, a team of traveler/food fans join forces to offer exquisite color photos of both Indian foods and culinary scenes across the country, pairing these photos with clear discussions of the seven Indian states and the local foods they're noted for. Secondly, The Food Of India includes a healthy dose of local history and ingredients research, as well as interviews with chefs and food producers. And if this isn't enough, it needs to be noted that the recipes selected for The Food Of India are anything but ordinary: from a Fried Beef Kerala to the Northern Indian traditional Chole Chaat, many regional specialty dishes aren't to be found in competing guides. All these features combined assure a visual treat packed with dishes all levels of Indian cook will relish."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"India is geographically and culturally enormous. The only country that is comparable gastronomically is China. The first problem for someone writing a cookbook about India is the selection of the national and regional segments of Indian cuisine that will be featured. For example, there must be at least one hundred ways to prepare cauliflower Indian-style. On Pages 180 and 183, we get two of those methods. That is two out of a hundred -- and they better be good! Well, in this book, the selection is superb -- both cauliflower recipes are terrific, and that holds for practically all the other selections as well. Don't buy this book expecting an encyclopedic approach -- this is a cookbook that takes a measured approach but that samples a huge variety of regional delights.I really appreciate the pictures in this book. They justify the size and cumbersomeness of the book because they add so much for a person who lives outside of India and has visited only a few times. I hardly ever get to see most of these dishes. I would have appreciated a few pictures of the preparation process as well. However, writing about Indian cuisine for a non-Indian audience places a special demand on the producers of the book to make the food look attractive so that those unfamiliar with it will buy the book and cook the food.If you are wise and flush enough to buy this book, I am sure you will cook the food. And you will be very glad you did. Accurate, attractive, authoritative, and, most of all, delicious."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"I love the \\"food of\\" series of books and so far this one is my favorite.

It is great in every respect.It is very well presented with beautiful puctures. The recipies are great, genuine Indian style dishes. The book also contains many small articles on india and indian cultureputs the recipies into cultural context. I especially like how it goes into the basics for making things like Paneer and garam masala.What else can I say? 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"It contains approximately 172 recipes, all with related photos on the same (or facing) page.There is a fair amount of background and historical information throughout the book, but the strong points are the recipes and photos. The recipes are well formatted, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. My small neighborhood Indian grocery carries virtually all of the ingredients.The recipe sections:- Tiffin (Snacks and Street Food)- Fish & Seafood- Poultry & Meat- Vegetables- Pulses- Rice & Grains- Breads- Accompaniments- Sweets & Drinks- BasicsIt has a good glossary and index."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"The Food of ______ series of books are exceptional. Each picks a country (China, Italy, France and now India) and gives an exhaustive report on the foods of that countrie. In a country as large and diverse as India, the food choices are equally diverse. The editors discuss the foods of various regions as part of the introduction before going on to the recipies.While vegetarianism has been and remains a major part of Indian cooking, the country is big enough with enough diversity that virtually every thing is included in at least a few recipies in this book.Rice is a staple across most of India with many different varieties. If I have a complaint about this book, it is that the authors do all of their rice recipies with Basmati rice. I'd like to see a greater discussion on other types of rice. On the other hand, basmati is probably the easiest Indian rice to get in this country, and I can't imagine that it would make a big difference in the taste to make it with some other kind of rice.Like the other books in this series, it is profusely illustrated with photographs taken all over the country of both the prepared dishes, sometimes of the preparation, and a few of the spectacular scenery.As with any kind of specialized cooking, you will find some special spices in use. Thanks to the internet, you should have no trouble getting them by mail if you don't happen to live near a city."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"This book is so wonderful.

My only complaint being, the seller did not respond to both my inquiries to this date!"},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"i liked it. Being an Indian myself i can say that recepies are very authentic. already tried some of the vegetarian recepies. very good. book came in nice condition too. it took a little longer then normal to receive it, but came within the range of expected delevary."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"There are, as far as I know, seven volumes in this nice little \\"Food of\\" series,each subtitled 'A Journey for Food lovers.' I bought the hardcover edition of the Indian volume first and only afterward learned it was part of a series. Since then I have bought three others. As I like all of these books for the same reasons, it would be easiest to do a general review and then add a few comments concerning the individual volumes.Mostly, the real pleasure from these books is the tremendous photography. The recipes are fine - I don't wish to suggest otherwise - but I wouldn't be as fond of these books if the recipes were the sole basis by which one could judge them. There is a picture for every recipe (some of them whole page photographs) and occasionally there are supplementary shots detailing some part of the cooking process. There are also all sorts of other pictures, some of which are directly or indirectly related to food, some of which are scenic shots, or pictures of people engaged in everyday life in the region in question. All are beautifully executed.The book is divided into recipe sections based on the type of food (snacks, main meat dishes, seafood etc) and each book has half a dozen 'Food Journey' sections which deal with some aspect of the cuisine at hand. The Chinese book for example has a section on 'dim sum', and the Indian volume has one on spices. In the hardcover Indian book, these sections are fold-out pages with lots of photographs whilst in the paperback editions I own each section is just a brief two page spread. All the books introduce the region in question with a descriptive culinary overview and the final recipe chapter in each book is entitled 'Basics' and provides tips and recipes on making various essentials in the cuisine.The Food of India: A Journey for Food Lovers- This, along with the Chinese volume' counts at the top of my 'favourite' list in this series. The 'dal' recipes are excellent and the recipes in the 'Basics' section for Coconut milk and Paneer were nice to see.The Food of China: A Journey for Food Lovers- The most beautiful recipe pictures of all the books, I think. The Turnip Cake recipe is on of the best I have tried and the 'Basics' section is excellent.The Food of Spain: A Journey for Food Lovers- Great textual introduction to Spanish cuisine in the first chapter. I *especially* love the Tapas section... I just wish this part could have been longer.The Food of Italy: A Journey for Food Lovers- This is my least favorite of the books I currently own but that comment should not scare away potential purchasers. The book is has the same excellent qualities as the others, I just personally am more interested in Indian, Chinese and Spanish cuisine than I am Italian.The remaining books in this series, as far as I know, areThe Food of France: A Journey for Food Lovers,The Food of Thailand: A Journey for Food LoversandThe Food of Morocco: A Journey for Food Lovers. I will certainly review any that I subsequently purchase. I will probably buy the French volume some time... I find Thai cuisine fascinating, although I don't like it very much, while Morrocan food doesn't particularly interest me very much. Still, I may just buy them for the terrific visual appeal!"},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"My chef had a copy of this book at a cafe I worked at years ago.

I have several other indian cookbooks of more encyclopedic proportions, and I figured anything that had such huge and lovely photos couldn't possibly have good recipes (especially after my recent experience with a Donna Hay cookbook, bleh!). However I recently started cooking from it and have found without exception the recipes to be authentic tasting and wonderful. There are a lot of meat-based recipes for an Indian cookbook, which I haven't tried as we're vegetarian, but that might make it more suitable for westerners."},{"Title":"The Food of India","review":"I originally bought this book as another of my spontaneous crazy cook book purchase.

And never from a book. Page after page. My hand to heaven, I hereby admit was in tears with hysterics before I even got passed the prologue and intro!!Scanning the cover, let me see, \\"a thirty-something mouths off about age angst, pregnancy pressure and dieting\\"...sounds like the usual chick-lit fodder, yes?To continue, \\"Saying good-bye to going to bars, seeing bands and generally being cool\\" and \\"Dealing with the fact that just when you finally know what you want out of a husband, it's too late to exchange him\\".....this had me snickering in the aisle of the store, then furtively glancing to make sure no other shoppers we witnessing my obvious relish at having found a subversive kindred spirit to the \\"I'm 30-something and I'm not feeling like I have my s*&%t entirely together\\" group.Yes, it is true, much like the author describes, I have only recently and very reluctantly retired the last of my 20s hold-out miniskirts.And I'll cop to the fact that I alternate days using Oil of Olay and Clearasil in the ongoing war of keeping my face in order.Oh, and that bit about being absolutely certain that my shoes, hair products and handbag all add at least 15 lbs onto my weight when venturing onto the scale in the doctors office...true without a doubt!!I found this book charming, disarming and alarming in the most hilarious way. Enjoyed it so much, I'm buying copies for all my 30-something gal pals and my sister, who is just entering into her 30s now. I'd like her to have the benefit of a funny reality check so she has a firm grasp of what's in store."},{"Title":"Skinny Bitching: A thirty-something woman mouths off about age angst, pregnancy pressure, and the dieting battles you'll never win","review":"I picked this up on the table at the bookstore and COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. Lee writes with such honesty and humor about things that my friends and I have all dealt with--husbands, tricky marriages, career, mothers, etc. I laughed out loud on every page.

Alban Butler is considered one of the greatest English Catholic writers. His Lives of the Saints has become the most important work after the Bible and the Imitation of Christ. But this new edition by Thurston and Attwater has destroyed much of the beauty of the orginal &quot;Lives,&quot; and for this reason Thurston was strongly criticized by Pope Pius XII. The original, unadultered 4 volume set is still in print under the title THE LIVES OF THE FATHERS, MARTYRS AND OTHER PRINCIPAL SAINTS from St. Bonaventure Publications, and is priced significantly lower than the new edition."},{"Title":"Butler's Lives of the Saints (complete in 4 Volumes)","review":"Little of Alban Butler's work survives in this revised edition--if the reader wants to have access to Butler's own words, with all his wonderful moral judgments, this is not the edition to consult. That said, Thurston and Attwater have done an exhaustive job of updating Butler's original work, including the addition of bibliographical references (mostly referring to foreign-language works) and attempting to sort through the historical inaccuracies that necessarily plague any study of the saints. As they admit, however, this is not meant to be a scholarly reference work.This collection includes more saints than any other I have seen, so it is a very useful and interesting work in itself. While Butler's wonderful 18th-century prose, so unfamiliar and even harsh to our modern ears, has been taken out in this revision, the result is not always easy to read. Some of the language is clumsy and poorly-constructed, but one gets used to it and it is not a major fault. In addition, the binding is not of the highest quality. The biggest failing of this edition--which is not the fault of the revisers, of course--is that many of the feast days of particular saints have been changed since the Second Vatican Council. An updated edition that takes this into account would be welcome, but all in all this is a useful collection."},{"Title":"Butler's Lives of the Saints (complete in 4 Volumes)","review":"I am not religious, but over the course of the years I have developed a fascination for the lives of Catholic saints. This compendium is a wonderful resource and a browser's delight. I recommend it very highly to anyone with a serious interest on the subject."},{"Title":"Butler's Lives of the Saints (complete in 4 Volumes)","review":"This second edition stripped away Butler's original verbocity, while keeping the beauty of the original prose. What's left is a compendium of the greatest men and women ever to walk the planet. Conveniently arranged for daily readings. This is a timeless classic that deserves the attention of anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Butler's Lives of the Saints (complete in 4 Volumes)","review":"I have been reading these 4 books daily for about 30 years and have learned a tremendous amount of history of my Catholic faith. They also have information on the martyrs of my faith, those who have achieved sainthood, archangels, etc. since the time of Jesus Christ. When we bought a second home in another state, I ordered another set for that residence, so I would have them at both residences. I highly recommend this set and I have the leather bound as I use them daily. I was glad Amazon.com had this available to ship to the new residence."},{"Title":"Butler's Lives of the Saints (complete in 4 Volumes)","review":"It has been nearly fifty years since I read this book. I had forgotten how much detail Butler placed in his research of the lives of the saints. Although my mind has moved more towards agnosticism, it is of great interest for me to read how the Church appreciated the lives of some of its past members. I am now trying to read of the saints related to that day, but alas my schedule is too busy to read the entire selection."},{"Title":"The Golden Apples of the Sun","review":"While these stories are excellent, most don't fit neat pigeonholes within Bradbury's work. Only some are SF. I've discussed them not in order of appearance, but alphabetically.\\"The April Witch\\" - Cecy is plain-faced, 17, and odd - in fact, a witch from a witch family. She can take possession of any creature, live through its experiences - but she wants romance. So lovely Ann Leary finds herself going to the dance with the boy she's not speaking to...(If you're interested in Cecy's family, try _The October Country_ and _From the Dust Returned_.)\\"The Big Black and White Game\\" - Set in 1940s Wisconsin. Once a year, two pickup baseball teams face off on a long summer day, just before the Cakewalk Jamboree, and somehow the white team always wins. But this year...hmm. If this appeals to you, look for other Bradbury stories like \\"Way Up High in the Middle of the Air\\".\\"Embroidery\\" - A nuclear test scheduled for five o'clock has the women sitting on a porch worrying over fancywork rather than supper. An interesting parallel is implied, as one woman, having made a mistake early on, rips out the design...\\"En La Noche\\" - Mrs. Navarrez has been grieving at the top of her lungs for days over her husband's departure for the army. The other sleepless adults in the tenement are growing desperate. When Mr. Villanazul comes up with a suggestion, guess who gets to carry it out.\\"The Flying Machine\\" - The emperor of China sees a great wonder in the dawn - a man has built a kite that lets him fly! But the inventor isn't the only far-sighted man in this tale.\\"The Fog Horn\\" - The old lighthouse keeper has told his assistant of many strange things, seen out here on the edge of the sea, to prepare him for these autumn nights when the strangest thing of all appears. One of Bradbury's best.\\"The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl\\" - Acton just killed Huxley with his bare hands in Huxley's own house. The background of the murder is provided as Acton retraces his actions, trying to remove all traces of his presence. But even obsessive people can't always get everything.\\"The Garbage Collector\\" - He liked his job, until civil defense created procedures for atomic attack.\\"The Golden Apples of the Sun\\" - The ship is heading for the sun, to scoop up some starfire and take it back to Earth. A man may be killed by frost if he fears fire too much...\\"The Golden Kite, the Silver Wind\\" - The mandarin has brought his chief advisor - his daughter - a problem. Kwan-Si has built a wall shaped like a pig - which threatens the mandarin's city, built in the shape of an orange. Each town is built and rebuilt, choosing a shape in response to one another. The final solution is ingenious.

Sometimes when reviewing a colection of tales, I have said that \\"none of the stories are stinkers\\". This phrase is technically true here, but it misses the point. The truth is that all of the stories are classics. Every one of them is a gem.\\"The Pedestrian\\" depicts an encounter between the last, mild-mannered individualist and the last beetle-shaped police car that stabs him with \\"a fierce white cone of light\\" (11). Leonard Mead \\"stood, entranced, not unlike a night moth, stunned by the illumination, and then drawn toward it\\" (11). There is a subtle connection between the moth and the beetle. Once the last nonconformist is gone, there will be no further use for the police car. All of society will be blandly conformist.\\"The Murderer\\" satirizes another element of such a society-- our infatuation with machines. It was fantastic back in 1953. But I fear that we have already arrived in this nightmare world:Three phones rang. A duplicate wrist radio in his desk drawer buzzed like a wounded grasshopper. The intercom flashed a pink light and click-clicked. Three phones rang. The drawer buzzed. Music blew in through the open door. (62)The title story is about a spaceship scooping up a load of plasma from the surface of the sun. Other writers, such as Chales L. Harness and Theodore L. Thomas, have dealt with this scenario. But I know of of none who have done it with Bradbury's poetry:For now there was only the sun and the sun and the sun. It was every horizon, it was every direction. It burned the minutes, the seconds, the hourglasses, the clocks; it burned all time and eternity away. It burned the eyelids, and the serum of the dark world behind the lids, the retina, the hidden brain; and it burned sleep and the sweet memories of sleep and cool nightfall. (165)\\"A Sound of Thunder\\" is the classic tale of T. Rex, big game hunters, and time travel. Other writers have imitated this story, spoofed it, revised it, or reinterpreted it. But nobody who knows anything at all about science fiction has ignored it.Another dinosaur appears in \\"The Fog Horn\\". But in this tale, we are meant to sympathize with the lonely monster. McDunn, the lighthouse keeper, says of it: \\"It's gone back to the Deeps. It's learned you can't love anything too much in this world\\" (8).Another love story (which also ends sadly) is that of young Cecy, \\"The April Witch\\". Cecy is so charming that each time I reread the story, I wish in vain for her happiness.Other stories include two Chinese fables, \\"The Flying Machine\\" and \\"The Golden Kite, the Silver Wind\\"; a story of murder and manic obsession, \\"The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl\\"; a Martian chronicles tale, \\"The Wilderness\\"; two stories of race relations, \\"I See You Never\\" and \\"The Big Black and White Game\\"; and a Hollywood tale, \\"The Meadow\\". I wonder if this last one was inspired by Bradbury's days working with the stop-motion genius Ray Harryhausen on sf movies.Each story is illustrated by Joseph Mugnaini, the artist who was born to illustrate Bradbury. Do not, do not, do not pass this one by."},{"Title":"The Golden Apples of the Sun","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"The Golden Apples of the Sun\\" short stories have been around for quite a while. Bradbury is Bradbury, a gifted man with an extraordinary imagination, the lyrical writing skill of a poet, and the magic of a master story teller. His stories pull you intuitively into his worlds and carry you along to achieve what Hemingway advocated for fiction writers: that they become a part of our experience.This hardbound edition is unusual in the way that it is beautifully bound. The silver and lime green cover and jacket design repeat within the text where the book title and the capital letters at the beginning of each story are colored the same green.

Modern history has tirelessly portrayed the sheer evil unleashed on Europe by Hitler and the National Socialist Party. The Nazis, along with the Soviet Communists, ensured that the people of Central and Eastern Europe had to endure at least a half-century of life within the brutal confines of totalitarian society. However, the passage of time presents us an opportunity to see Nazism as something much subtler than an overpowering evil force.Historian Robert N. Proctor guides readers through Hitler-led Germany in &quot;The Nazi War on Cancer.&quot; He examines a ruling regime and society grappling with health problems such as the exposure of factory workers to carcinogens in the plant, the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco use and the impact of poor diet. Proctor considers how public health concerns influenced the goal of creating a stronger, healthier and racially-pure population.The deliberation over public health during the Nazi era pushed German researchers and scientists ahead of their counterparts around the rest of the industrialized world in connecting many health problems to the fast-paced and often stressful twentieth century lifestyle. Proctor does not portray the German medical elite as being completely manipulated by the Nazis. In fact, many men of sceince used the Nazi takeover of Germany as an opening to purge Jews, Socialists and Communists from important research positions. Proctor concludes that the Nazi experience with public health gives us an opportunity to understand the appeal and triumph of fascism as more than an aberration. Overall, Proctor presents a solid study of German medicine under Nazi rule. He brings many interesting facts to light which may surprise many readers who picture the Nazis as an all-powerful wave washing over and consuming all of Germany. In presenting his study, Proctor is mindful that many may misuse his facts to discredit modern public health iniatives or to justify the existence of Nazism though he does not let this stop him from delivering a thougt-provoking interpretation of a little known aspect of twentieth century history."},{"Title":"Reducing radon in North Carolina homes (HE)","review":"There's a lot of interesting material in this book: Nazi ideas of the proper diet, indications that the Nazi Institute for Cancer Research may have been a cover for developing bioweapons, and, of course, the chapter that has garnered the most attention: &quot;The Campaign Against Tobacco&quot;. Throughout the book Proctor uses the Nazi concern with cancer to show that Nazi science, while often motivated by bizarre or evil notions, wasn't always shoddy. He also shows that it's a mistake to think of Nazi Germany as a totalitarian monolith that always reflected Hitler's will.For instance, while Hitler wanted to eventually ban smoking, he was ultimately defeated by cultural resistance to the notion and the desire to keep tobacco taxes coming in and tobacco exports leaving. Still, it was Nazi science that first indicated that smoking was harmful though its general emphasis on clinical studies with few patients caused it to be ignored by epidemiologists in other countries. However, the Anglo-American scientists who made their reputations by proving that smoking was a major cause of lung cancer were preceded more than 10 years by Franz H. Muller's dissertation on that link, the first &quot;case-control epidemiologic&quot; study to do so. And he did it in 1939 Germany.Besides its material on Nazi scientific efforts to diagnose, cure, and prevent cancer, the book also has some very interesting illustrations of Nazi public health propaganda. My favorite illustration, though, is of various animals giving the &quot;Heil&quot; salute to Goering who banned vivisection in 1933.My one quibble with the book is Proctor's insistence that his book provides no aid and comfort to those, like libertarian Jacob Sullum -- whose book FOR YOUR OWN GOOD: THE ANTI-SMOKING CRUSADE AND THE TYRANNY OF PUBLIC HEALTH is specifically mentioned in the final chapter -- who wish to link anti-smoking efforts with Nazis. I've never heard any anti-smoking activist propose euthanasia programs or putting people in concentration camps. However, the Nazi regime justified its coercive public health measures with the philosophy that your body was state property and &quot;nutrition was not a private matter&quot;. And, as in modern America, economic rationales were given for the Nazi laws intended to make life difficult for smokers. Proctor also speculates, in the Prologue, that public health measures like the Nazi war on tobacco could have been one of the appealing tunes in the siren suite of Hitler's fascism. Not everyone became a Nazi to kill Jews. And not all the doctors who signed up with the Nazi Party were quacks. This book does provide some evidence that coercive public health measures that go beyond mere education can spring from a totalitarian impulse."},{"Title":"Reducing radon in North Carolina homes (HE)","review":"This book was written in large part to correct the public impression that science under the Nazi regime was uniformly perverse, biased, and Mengele-monstrous. Instead, Proctor wants to show that legitimate scientific investigation was not only carried on, but even encouraged in the Third Reich. As much as everyone would like to discredit all research done by anyone associated with Nazism, Proctor points out that such blanket condemnation led to the world's subsequent dismissal of even valid cancer research that could have saved countless lives had it been considered.In order to illustrate this point, Proctor reviews many areas of cancer research done during the Nazi years. One of his chapters deals with the mass X-ray screenings instituted in many parts of Germany to detect tumors. In connection with this early initiative to root out cancer, Proctor makes the point that Nazi medicine never presented a monolithic front. At the same time these screenings were taking place, there was a large faction of German doctors objecting to them on the theory that X-rays promoted more cancerous growth than they detected. You might find this section of the book to be of particular interest in light of the current debate over mammographies.Another chapter deals with the German Government's concern over carcinogens in the workplace. German researchers did one of the first, most comprehensive studies linking asbestos and cancer. Then there's a chapter on German concern with the link between diet and cancer. This led to campaigns promoting whole wheat bread and fresh, organic produce. Much of this initiative overturned earlier, unscientific beliefs that held fresh fruit and vegetables actually promoted cancer.However, the section of the book dealing with the links that German researchers documented between tobacco smoking and cancer might be the most relevant to current debates. Smoking and cancer of the mouth had long been associated. But until Third Reich scientists began to do meticulous statistical studies and autopsies, few suspected a specific link between smoking and lung cancer. Then, as now, many tobacco manufacturers argued that factors such as auto exhaust were responsible for more lung cancer than cigarettes. However, Proctor cites comparative studies done by German scientists showing lung cancer rates in rural areas (where there were few cars in the 1930's) and heavily trafficked urban areas to be nearly identical. Also, women had markedly less lung cancer, likely as a result of Hitler's insistence that German women avoid cigarettes in order to keep themselves undefiled for childbearing. The Germans coined the term \\"passive smoking\\" and campaigned for smoke-free environments generally.The German studies could have been used to counter many arguments being made by smoking apologists today, but most of these studies were automatically ignored or dismissed due to their association with the Nazi regime. Therefore we are covering the same ground again.So Proctor does a good job giving credit where credit is due for pioneering cancer research. Still, the book left me feeling somewhat frustrated. I kept hoping for some more definitive condemnation of Nazi medical research. Even if Reich studies often came up with some right answers - the research was done in the wrong spirit, and therefore was ultimately dangerous. Cancer diagnoses and cures were sought in order to better enable the Germans to do their \\"duty\\" of being healthy. Everything was framed in terms of one's duty to the Higher Powers and to the German Nation as a whole. Failure to be fit for doing practical work was considered virtually criminal. So as Proctor sums up, the \\"war on disease became a war on the diseased,\\" including those deemed to be diseased by virtue of age, ethnicity, or any medical/mental health problem.Proctor does consider some of these philosophical questions in his final chapters - which are well worth reading. He argues, no doubt rightly, that if a person is bad, that doesn't mean everything that person produces should be dismissed as bad. Such an attitude leads to logical and practical absurdities. However Proctor further argues that no equation should be made between the enforcements favored by modern fanatic anti-smokers and any facet of the Nazi program. That aspect of his even-handed approach might give a reader a little more pause. If there's danger in allowing the wrong letter of the law to prevail, there's also danger in allowing the wrong spirit to prevail."},{"Title":"Reducing radon in North Carolina homes (HE)","review":"Proctor seems in promotion of the current replication of Hitlers reign, of Public health campaigns. Entitled by Proctors insane ignorance of the reality, that Jews were driven from restaurants and eventually from common society, to reside in Ghettos because they supposedly created a health risk for those around them, especially for the children, similar to the stepping stones that defined smokers the same way. It was not a miracle that allowed a Public health movement to thrive within Nazi Germany, but rather a state of government emotional blackmail foisted against the citizenry, and more predominantly that this form of medicine is one of majority always wins by force and hatred, as the most popular prescription for what ails everyone else. The power of hateful medicine that gave rise to an unquestionable power he had over the masses, by divide and conquer. Power of higher drama and emotional restriction, which eventually led to their grudgingly accepting the final solution as Law, under the personal balance of; \\"at least it is someone else that has the man's attention and if it won't affect me, I have other things to worry about\\". The early development programming of children to report even their own parents if they should say or do anything contrary to the word of law is seen again today. [Quoting Hitler and Goering; \\"I don't care about your politics, I have your children\\"]With Public health advocates and teachers telling children in their classrooms if they feel threatened by their parents smoking or even speaking to them in unkind terms let alone giving them a slap on the backside, to report it as child abuse. Rights of the child legislation eliminated the notion of parents autonomy rights over their own children, affording that power to government. Many have already lost parental rights to even speak to their own children, based on the parent's physical condition, updated descriptions of the word \\"abuse\\" or even something as inconsequential as a parent's smoking status or weight. All in democratic and supposedly free countries who traditionally dedicated themselves to the preservation of \\"Personal liberty\\" are now shunning that foundation and berating anyone in the National press who speaks otherwise. The efforts of Governments today forming monolith Public Health networks that reside both inside and outside Government Bureaucracies, to replicate the meager by comparison propaganda networks that existed in 1930s Germany and the hiring of Lobby Groups to lobby themselves, has many Governments in the developed world including the entirety of the G20 involved in what should only be seen as illegal use of Taxpayers funds to undermine national security and the personal rights of the entire electorate. Politics of the master being purchased to lobby for more. This insanity of Payola and and corrupted medical sciences is no largely held secret today. Unbelievably in this day and age those who should be speaking out to end the UN-necessary fears of people who believe they are at threat from something as benign as tobacco smoke in the outdoor air, are not being provided assurances that no harm exists, rather Governments are paying AstroTurf organizations to inflame those fears. Not a single politician on either side of the floor, or Public health representative will now speak up, because they are all afraid to speak up in fear of reprisals. Again in this day and age? Utterly inconceivable not a word. Proof positive that the acts of Public Health campaigns during Hitler's reign were absolutely effective as a form of significant power as it's reinvention at the World health organization today confirms an extremely powerful weapon, however was medicine really meant to be used in this way?"},{"Title":"Reducing radon in North Carolina homes (HE)","review":"A most interesting subject, not least because of similarities between today's &quot;health nazis&quot; and the real nazis! But for the non-specialist reader (such as myself) there is a little too much mundane detail, and discussion of what paper was published in what year, who wrote it, how often it was cited ...One nice aspect: Proctor has no time for &quot;cultural relativism&quot; applied to mass murder, and is free of the prolix heavy prose many academics favor."},{"Title":"Reducing radon in North Carolina homes (HE)","review":"Robert Proctor presents a great deal of evidence that the nazis' exerted massive control over most facets of ordinary citizen's lives. Yet somehow, he never reaches the obvious conclusion that such compulsive regulations,even if arguably well intentioned,ultimately lead to a large scale sacrifice of basic freedoms.He explains how the nazis greatly restricted tobacco advertising, banned smoking in most public buildings, increasingly restricted and regulated tobacco farmers growing abilities, and engaged in a sophisticated anti-smoking public relations campaign. (Suing tobacco companies for announced consequences was a stunt that mysteriously eluded Hitler's thugs.) Despite the frightening parallels to the current war on tobacco, Mr. Proctor never even hints at the analogy. Curiously, he seems to take an approach that such alleged concern for public health shows nazism to be a more complex dogma than commonly presumed. While nothing present in the book betokens even a trace of sympathy for the Third Reich, this viewpoint seems incredibly naive. It's easy to wonder if Hitler and company were truly concerned with promoting public health. The unquenchable lust for absolute control is a far more believable motive.Incongruously some of the book's desultory details lend further certitude to its unpromulgated thesis. Hitler not only abstained from tobacco; he also never drank and was,for the most part--a vegetarian. Frighteningly he also was an animal rights activist. The book reruns a nazi-era cartoon depicting many liberated lab animals giving the nazi salute to Hermann Goring after he outlawed animal experimentation and promised to send violators to a concentration camp. Also included is a fitting quote -now too widely suppressed from Joseph Goebbles, \`the fuhrer is deeply religious, though completely anti-Christian; he views Christianity as a symptom of decay.&quot; Controversial as it may be in some circles, such a quote proves that nazism viewed Christianity as hatefully as it did Judaism. Passing coverage is given to the Third Reich's forays into euthanasia and eugenics. Another striking morsel is the reporting of a widespread nazi-era whispered joke \`What is the ideal German? Blond like Hitler. Slim like Goring. Masculine like Goebbles...' implying that Gautlier Goebble's homosexuality was common knowledge. Nazi linguistic restrictions seem to be the counterpart of modern day \`hate speech.' Words such as \`catastrophe,' sabotage,' and \`assassination' were to be avoided, and in a portentous move, \`cripple' was replaced by \`handicapped. Proctor also suggests \`the word \`enlightenment' (was) probably used more in the nazi period than at any other time.'Perhaps the ultimate overlooked point of this work is the suggestion that Adolph Hitler with his anti-tobacco, anti-religion, pro-animal rights, pro-government intrusion would find success as a modern day liberal."},{"Title":"Reducing radon in North Carolina homes (HE)","review":"It is good reading but I was dissapointed to learn that the Nazis don't have a cure for cancer."},{"Title":"Manifest destiny and mission in American history: A reinterpretation","review":"Oh boy, this is the worst book I've ever read.

So I fooled myself into thinking that the ending was vague. &quot;I'm not quite sure&quot; I would tell myself. Days after reading this book, I am still trying to g! et &quot;answers&quot; that I already know. Donna Hill has written a book that will touch you to the core. If you haven't read it, you must run and get this book."},{"Title":"A Private Affair (Arabesque)","review":"This is absolutely one of the best romance novels that I have read. The author did a great job of exploring the lives of Quinn and Nikita. This novel went much deeper than most romance novels. It was not filled with sugar coated phrases and nonsense that ordinary people never say. But the words and actions of each character reflected real life people in real life relationships. The only reason that this book does not get a 10 is because the ending was a little vague. I wanted more. I wanted the author to spell out where they were in their relationship. And what was next for the two of them but knowing Donna she'll incorporate them into her next novel."},{"Title":"A Private Affair (Arabesque)","review":"I REALLY LIKED THE PROFILE OF THE BOOK AS A WHOLE.

PLUS NIKITA WAITED FOR TWO YEARS TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT HE LOVES HER AND WHEN HE DID, HE WENT TO LIVE WITH MAX AND SHE WAS WITH GRANT.

I always felt I could not pass because you need talent thrower and speedy receivers to pass. So I forced my teams to continue running the football even with eight man fronts. Kind of chopping down a tree with a sledge hammer. Then I read this book. Not only do you not need a good thrower or speedy receivers, but if you want something that is going to confuse the defense. Then do not look any further. This book will completely change your offensive attitude towards the pass. I no longer pass with fear. The book is easy to understand and is a great reference for both offensive and defensive coordinators. It goes with any offensive philosophy. Mine is wing T and I have not change my philosophy it just enhance it. If you pass this book by you are making a big mistake. I now have defense playing 6 and 7 men fronts which is a lot easier to run on. No matter how much of committment you choose to use in your passing game: a lot or once in a while, this book will give that edge over today's defenses."},{"Title":"The Bunch Attack: Using Compressed Formations in the Passing Game (Art & Science of Coaching)","review":"Every decade, some humble coach or in this case coaches take the time to write about a revolutionary idea that they have tinkered with, and they do it with such amazing clarity and detail that even those who may not agree with such madness owe it to themselves and their profession to study such a masterwork.This is one of those books.Coverdale and Robinson do not claim to have invented the bunch formation. They simply explain it in such vivid detail that this is probably one of the greatest football books written for coaches in this century. I AM NOT KIDDING!The diagrams are splendidly detail, the authors explain all of their techniques and methods thoroughly, and then they give you the hows and whens to use this tremendous idea. Furthermore they give you ideas to build on that will only stimulate your own creative thinking.Any formation or system can easily adapt this idea, you don't have to be a run and shooteer, a west coaster, or a wing t guy. Any system at any level can use the ideas presented. What you won't get from these two authors however is a lot of blowhard stories meant to soothe their own egos or a bunch of clinic talk that leaves you the reader feeling cheated. This is a football book meant for people who are serious about football.I bought the book two years ago, I still pull it out and review it every few weeks, I've read and reread it countless times. Folks you aren't going to find a better football book that is so readily available and easily easily readable that is this important. I just ordered my second copy because the binding on the one I bought two years ago is worn out."},{"Title":"The Bunch Attack: Using Compressed Formations in the Passing Game (Art & Science of Coaching)","review":"This is perhaps one of the best technical football books I have read.

It is X's and O's, so if someone doesn't understand the game, it won't make any sense, but why would anyone buy this book if that were so? Once they get down to the nitty gritty of the attack, which seems to take a while, they give detailed descriptions of how they can break down nearly any defense with the concepts. If you coach, and you want a better passing game, get it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Bunch Attack: Using Compressed Formations in the Passing Game (Art & Science of Coaching)","review":"I found it to be the best technical coaching book I've ever read (and believe me I've read almost all of therecent ones in the last 10 years).It amazes me just how much of this stuff is used in the pro's now that I recognize what theyredoing.

I have been a football coach for over twenty years, mostly on the defensive side of the football. I have faced many teams that employ bunch formations in their offensive attacks. I bought the book to learn more about the theory of attacking different defensive coverages using bunch formations to better defend these offensive sets and discovered some good formations and plays that could easily transfer to the offense our High School team currently uses; in both our passing as well as rushing attacks. This book contains a lot of information and is not a quick read and will require time and patience on the part of the reader. It explains a lot of different passing plays that can be run using bunch formations very well. It also contains a brief section on some running plays that can be employed from bunch formations, which I found stimulating as I am a fan of option offensive football and this section has me scheming ! If you are interested in using bunch or \\"cluster\\" formations to diversify your offense, then this is a good book to purchase. I have yet to come across another book on this topic."},{"Title":"The Bunch Attack: Using Compressed Formations in the Passing Game (Art & Science of Coaching)","review":"This book is an excellent resource. It is not, however, a casual read. The concepts in this book get very in depth and specific.In order to understand all the adjustments and \\"tags\\" added to route packages, you must have a sound understanding of coverage schemes. For each route package the author goes into detail on what modifications (routes, formations, motions) can be used to exploit almost any coverage. This includes not only basic cover 0,1,2,3,4, but also 2 man free, cover 3 sky and cloud, banjo/triangle man coverage etc. As you can see, much of this will be hard to decipher if you do not have a fundamental understanding of these coverage schemes.Another challenge that his book presents is how to incorporate these ideas into a pre-existing system. It may seem like a true \\"bunch\\" system is nothing but 4 WR's and a lone back in the backfield. This would not fit a lot of offensive systems, let alone personnel. Fortunately, this book dispels the single back myth, and includes many alternative ways to line up, both formation wise and personnel wise. For example, you could set X and Z to the left, Y in the tight end spot on the right, and an offset \\"I\\" backfield with the fullback offset to the right (strong). This does not sound like a bunch formation, but by simply motioning Z across the Y, you now have Z as #1, Y as #2, and F as #3 all frontside. This formation and motion would be achieved by the call: Larry Strong, Z 6. As you can see, this is pretty concise and simple.My favorite part of the book is not the routes or adjustments, but rather the author's system for formations and motion. He uses a very flexible and consistent system that gives you a lot of freedom as a play caller. I have been searching for a formation/motion system that is numerical, short, simple, and intuitive and I believe the one presented in this book is one of the best I have come across. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Bunch Attack: Using Compressed Formations in the Passing Game (Art & Science of Coaching)","review":"This book was well written with different rountes that can be run from the set.

The ghost in it was described in such detail that it seemed as if you were standing there in the room viewing it. I also enjoyed the book because its main character was a teenage girl with many responsibilities. If you are a teenage girl, you are sure to be able to relate to this book. Sweet Whispers, Brother Rush was also a good book for anyone who is dealing with a death in their family, especially for someone who was really close. I could share the girl's pain in the book because I knew what it was like. The book doesn't bring you down, it just shows how things work out in the end.

I was mad at her mother for a while but then I understood what she was trying to do for her family. If you are looking for a good quick read that will keep you interested from the first to the last page this is the book for you.

Several weeks later, he appears in her apartment, and it's only then that she knows that he's a ghost, Brother Rush. He takes Tree and her mentally challenged brother Dab on journeys into the past, and slowly Tree realizes in these glimpses of the past, Brother Rush may be telling her something about her own present.Hamilton's writing is wonderfully lucid and descriptive, showing Tree's thoughts in a language and idiom that perfectly express her character. Here's a passage I especially liked, from Tree's first meeting with Brother Rush in her apartment:\\"The sweatshirt she had on couldn't keep her warm. Yet she was aware of the moment when the cold turned into something she could live with. Fear was sealed inside her, like a tatter of paper from her ream. And if you opened the tatter, it would read: This is all the scared I can get.The categorizing part of my brain wants to say that this is fantasy, because it's a ghost story. I suppose technically it is, but it's so rooted in reality that the supernatural doesn't feel especially fantastic. It's simply a book about people, about Tree's relationships with her brother and her mother, who has to work so hard to keep the family going that she's rarely there, leaving Tree to take care of herself and Dab. It's a bittersweet book, full of loss and sadness, yet also full of love and hope."},{"Title":"Sweet Whispers, Brother Rush","review":"I liked this book in middle school. So I read it again recently to take a walk down memory lane. I remember now why certain parts of it were confusing. Like why was the mother the way she was?

The main thing I liked about the book and other's that I've read by VA Hamilton is that her books will make your imagination soar.

This time around, McKiernan takes another well-beloved fairy tale (\\"Sleeping Beauty\\") and gives it a a rework, this time with tighter writing, tighter plotting, and a very likable hero.While napping at Summerwood Manor, Borel has a dream about a young woman in a tower, surrounded by knives and blindfolded. Searching for an answer to who she is and what trouble she is in, he goes to the seemingly abandoned cottage of an evil witch. By reading her diary, he manages to find out that she is Chelle (Michelle), the daughter of his father's old pal.Accompanied by a sassy Sprite, Flic, and his bumblebee Buzzer, Borel sets off across Faery to find Chelle and set her free. Every night he encounters her in his dreams, without her knowledge that it's only a dream, and tries to figure out where she is and who has taken her captive. To learn where she is, Borel will deal with tricky faerie kings and spectral rider, and even the Fates. But he has only one month to find Chelle, and not many clues to go on...After the sugary heroine of \\"Once Upon A Winter's Night,\\" the down-to-earth Borel is a relief. He was one of the more interesting minor characters of that first book, and it's nice to see him getting his own book. This time around, it's not initially as obvious what fairy tale McKiernan is retelling, and he manages to keep up the suspense about the daggers, squeaking and other odd clues that come together at the finale.With only a month to deal with the wicked witch and damsel in distress, the plot goes quite fast, and has some genuinely creepy scenes, such as when Borel is captured by trolls. The book does sag somewhat in the middle, and also retreads old ground by having Borel deal with each of the rather pompous Fates in turn -- something Camille did in the previous book.However, McKiernan's writing has improved a great deal. The plot is sparer and leaner, with virtually no side trips or red herrings. So is his writing; he throws in a few discussions about love and sex, but not enough to sabotage the suspense. And he reveals quite a few little tidbits about the forthcoming Great Epic Struggle against The Evil Force, leaving some enormous plot threads dangling at the end. (Not to mention name-dropping some future villains for our heroes to fight)While it has some flaws, \\"Once Upon A Summer Day\\" is a tighter, faster read than its predecessor. Here's hoping that the rest of the series follows this trend."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"Previously, I've liked most efforts by this author, but this one was an exception.My concerns?...let me explain1.) I found that the rather unusual combination of heroes, that being, Borel (Prince and all round good guy), Flic (a faery) and Buzzer (a bumble bee), really pushed the envelop of believability to the very edge (I know, unbelievability is difficult to conceive as a concern when discussing the fantasy genre).2.) Although this novel did have a few good moments, I felt that the dialogue between the main characters had an overall sense of immaturity; this hindered character development and made it difficult to become immersed in this book.3.) I got the feeling that a lot of the background story telling done in this novel was really, (and let me be honest here), just fill; maybe to enlarge the book to novel length?...I began to find it easy to begin skimming some of these sections.4.) Many of the \\"quests\\" in this story seemed somehow, out of place; they just didn't seem to fit in. It seemed a new piece of the puzzle would spontaneously appear in a chapter and then become the next important piece in a series of problems that need to be solved. The concern being, that more often than not,(after a period of head scratching by our heroes and several dead ends) a convenient, timely solution appears, like magic, to let the story finally proceed onwards.All in all, less than I'd hoped for! 2 Stars."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"I really loved the first book in this series, and I remember being fascinated with the character of Borel when he was introduced. I was excited to hear that the sequel was all about Borel, but I find myself a bit let down. While an interesting read, this book is just not as satisfying as the first, and I would venture to call it predictable.I do admire McKiernan's use of old fairy tales in his work, and I very much enjoyed seeing some of the characters from the old tales as well as characters from Celtic lore. Adding the French flavor to his world of Faery also serves to make it more unique than many of the \\"stock\\" fantasy worlds we have out there already. But, Borel is still not very fleshed out."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"This book is awful.There's no way around it. The writing is pretentious and lacks any kind of grit, substance, or texture. It rambles on for pages about the feast the nobles ate for dinner. The writing is overly flowery and poorly presented. It's awkward, condescending, and sounds like an arrogant 45-year old hitting on teenagers at a RennFaire. The sentences are choppy and overdone to the point of nausea, and the headache you get after reading a few pages doesn't go away until you've read something better to get the taste of McKiernan's book out of your head. I wish someone had told me how awful it was before I wasted my $7.99 at the bookstore.There are much better books out there. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"Okay, when comparing the facts, I gave both this book and the first in the series \\"Once Upon a Winter's Night\\" 3 stars. But when comparing the content, the latter is more deserving of a 2, and I regret that now, for this one was far better. Well, far might be a bit of a stretch.Haunted by the dream of a beautiful girl (Ha! How terrifying), Prince Borel of the Summerwood is determined to find and free the maiden from her constraints. To satisfy not only his curiosity but his hope that she is his destiny, Borel leaves the comfort of his palace to fight another battle in the war that is overcoming all of Faery: one of good and evil. By reading her diary and gaining some priceless friends, the Prince finds out why Chelle, the maid in the tower, is contacting him and how to reach her. But will it be soon enough?Dun dun dun. Just kidding. It's nice to have interesting character as a lead that has a generally likeable disposition, unlike the previous book (Camille *shakes fist*). The tale itself is traditional but with new suspense, something hard to accomplish in a time-and-time-again-told tale (wow- a mouthful). It also ties in the series, and there are recurring characters from \\"Once Upon a Winter's Night\\", but they make vague appearances, which is wonderful.Although there are a fair share of \\"boring\\" parts, the writing is much more improved from McKiernan's first book in the series, and it's more...well...readable. And enjoyable. If only to learn the characters and the series' plot line would I suggest \\"Once Upon a Winter's Night\\". But I would recommend this one as a decent book that a person can enjoy without having to think too much.

I was truly captured by the story, I wanted to know what happened as fast as possible.Borel rocks in his devotion to a maiden in a dream. I wished I was her locked in a tower, so he could rescue me.

When he wakes up he finds that the dream was a visitation from an imprisoned golden maiden, who will die thanks to the curse of the witch if he doesn't rescue her before the next full moon.In his quest to find the woman Chelle who he knew as a child, he gains two allies in Flec the sprite and Buzzer the Bee. He and his two friends help the three crones who are disguised; in return for his kindness they each give him a riddle to solve that will lead him closer to Chelle. Along the way they fight evil monsters sent out by the witch to kill them and though Borel is near where Chelle sleeps, the path to her turret is filled with danger. He knows he might be killed but does not give up trying to reach the woman he loves even though he courts her only in dreams that they both share.Dennis L. McKiernan always manages to enchant his readers with his fabulous fantasy novels. ONCE UPON A SUMMER DAY is his magical rendition of Sleeping Beauty only updated with more characters both good and evil including monsters, trolls, goblins, the sprites and other players. This romantic fantasy is very different because the lovers come together for the most part only in their dreams. Readers will not be disappointed with this beautiful adult fairy tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"Once Upon a Summer Day (2005) is the second fantasy novel in the Faery series, following Once Upon a Winter's Night. In the previous volume, Camille challenged the marriage of the troll princess to Prince Alain and won all three contests. When the troll king refused to honor his terms and attacked Camille, the thralls rose up and, with a little help from the dwarf band, killed all the trolls and goblins. Upon returning to Summerwood Manor, Camille also solved the previous disappearance of Prince Alain's parents.In this novel, Prince Borel of Winterwood passes an enjoyable summer day with his brother, sisters and sister-to-be at Summerwood Manor. Lazing in the gazebo, he falls asleep and dreams of a Demoiselle within a stone chamber with a band of shadow across her eyes. Free-floating daggers are outside the tower facing inward at him. The young lady cries out \\"Aidez-moi\\" and he awakes with a jerk.Prince Borel tells his siblings and Camille about his dream before supper and they discuss the possibilities. Borel is morose during the meal and Alain calls for a gala that evening to cheer him. Borel seems to enjoy the singing and dancing, as do all within the manor.The next morning, Borel awakens early, dresses for the road, and leaves the manor with his wolves. For the next four days, they travel toward the Winterwood. After his arrival, Borel bathes, eats and sleeps until he has recovered from the travel, then he arms himself and sets out to consult a dream diviner.On his way, Borel scouts the hut of the witch Hradian. Since the primitive hovel seems to be deserted, he searches inside for any indications of the witch's intentions. He stuffs scrolls and a memoire into a rucksack and departs the hut. Just then, the witch lands on her besom and sends him flying with a black wind.In this story, Prince Borel escapes from a keep that is guarded by Red Caps and Trolls. In the process, he frees Flic, a meadow sprite, and Buzzer, a bumble bee. From what he has learned from the memoire, Borel seeks the lands of Duke Roulan and Buzzer leads the way.This story is a greatly enhanced version of Sleeping Beauty. The author presents a compelling argument that the fairy tale is a condensed and simplified version of the original bardic tale. This version, however, is much too long to be told in a single evening, since verbal renditions have a very low data rate. Indeed, this novel would provide enough material for a cinema taking five or more hours.Nonetheless, this fairy tale has much the same flavor as others in that genre. Like the previous work, the vocabulary and settings are enchanting and the story is so engrossing that the chapters seem to fly by. Putting this novel down takes true willpower or maybe just overwhelming sleep.Highly recommended for McKiernan fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of faery lands, noble princes, evil witches, and magical creatures.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"The sequel to Once Upon a Winter's Night is an entertaining, action-packed, and sometimes humorous story. Keeping with the theme of the series, Once Upon a Summer Day is based on a fairy tale, though which one may surprise you. Those familiar with this author's work won't be surprised to find \\"red slippers\\" here and there, and I look forward to seeing how these might come to play in upcoming books.Once Upon a Summer Day stars Borel, Prince of Winterwood, and two unlikely companions on their quest to rescue a damsel in distress. I enjoyed returning to Faery, and as in the first book the author does an outstanding job of transporting the reader to this magical realm. My favorite scenes were those where the mystery and mysticism of Faery come most into play, like those with the King Under the Hill. I also loved the rich, evocative use of language, which is very much a part of what Faery is. Although I missed the sweetness of the first book, the second installment of the Once Upon a... series doesn't disappoint in the least. Faster pacing, loads of adventure, and heroes/heroines to cheer for, this was truly Borel's tale, and a definite keeper."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"I will admit, I'm biased as my favorite tale as a child was Sleeping Beauty! Dennis McKiernan's writing continues to enthrall me! I become part of the characters in the book and I cheer them on.This tale is wonderful- a beautiful mix of romance, adventure, chivalry, and fantasy. It is yet another epic fairy tale told by a bard himself.Again, I highly recommend you read the foreword to his novels! He takes famous, legendary fairy tales and expands upon them, going from a mere few pages to a full book. I claim that Dennis McKiernan himself is a bard and I would take the opportunity any day to sit in a great hall and listen to his stories."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"Just started book, haven't got really into it as yet. This is the second in a series. he first was good!"},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"In this re-telling of Sleeping Beauty, McKiernan continues his tradition of great fantasy writing. Prince Borel has recurring dreams of an imprisoned maiden. He realizes that his dreams are sendings from a real woman imprisoned somewhere by some forces he doesn't understand. He then quests to find her, and along the way is accompanied by Flick, a sprite, and Buzzer, Flick's bumblebee companion. As with any quest, there are many seemingly unrelated adventures that end up being all connected in the end.I thought it started out slow, but got better once it picked up momentum. It never reaches the fever pitch of some of McKiernan's other works (such as Hel's Crucible or Iron Tower) but maintains a pleasant steady pace once it gets going.It is not necessary to read \\"Once Upon a Winter Night\\" before reading this one. References are made to the earlier book, but this one stands alone. I would place the reading level at age 13 and older due to mild sexuality and general difficulty level."},{"Title":"Once Upon a Summer Day","review":"The second in the \\"Once Upon A...\\" series of enhanced faery tales by Dennis McKiernan, of Mithgar fame. All in all, this story was a fun read. McKiernan develops his characters well, and ties this tale in well with the first \\"Once Upon A...\\" book. The story moves at a good pace, not bogging down in my opinion, even with the requisite visit by the hero Borel, to the 3 Fates.I have read all of McKiernan's other works (save some short stories in publication), and find this compares well in quality, if not in scope, to his world of Mithgar. I look forward to the remaining books in this series."},{"Title":"The doll who came alive","review":"This is a classic tale of a Cornish lass who receives a Dutch doll from a sailor and loves her to life. The author is the famous Cornish folklorist Enys Tregarthen and it's a wonderful story written decades before its copyright in 1942. Better yet, it's an authentic voice from an age all gone, a hard world but filled with pixies and white magic, a period that built Narnia and Middle Earth and now Harry Potter,a world view that neo-Puritans have never allowed to flourish in the United States, but one that children continue to love to life. A very old story, not sweet but tender and good -- little girls will love it. It's been treasured by four generations of women or more and shouldn't be lost."},{"Title":"The Maxwell Leadership Bible: Lessons in Leadership from the Word of God","review":"This is a pretty good study bible. It covers a lot of fascinating leadership concepts using scripture to draw out principles that Maxwell teaches. There are many instances of leadership passages or points that are skipped or missed, whether intentionally or unintentionally. So it is NOT an authoritative or exhaustive work on leadership issues in the bible.I would recommend this only as a resource for doing bible study on leadership. One must do their own exegesis of the text to see if the study bible's main points really match what the bible says there or if there is some tendency to insert Maxwellian ideas into the text.Generally speaking, this is a great tool that I use from time to time. As a pastor, I am always looking for good materials on leadership development.

Maxwell as America's #1 leadership expert, yet you probably didn't know that he said the secret to everything he knows about leadership he learned in the pages of the Bible. This is a remarkable resource, because it takes hundreds of insights from Maxwell's teaching and wraps them around the pages of both the old and new testaments of a full version of scripture. It has an easy to use cross-reference system that includes quotes and insights from many of his best selling books on leadership and is an excellent addition to anyones top shelf already in a leadership position looking for bullet points of truth to use in building a stronger team.This is a great tool for you as a leader, and an even better one to give as a graduation gift because it's designed to rocket the reader forward in their own success journey with courage, character and the strength of personal conviction. Regardless of your faith background, you'll benefit from Maxwell's practical teachings to make you a better leader."},{"Title":"The Maxwell Leadership Bible: Lessons in Leadership from the Word of God","review":"This has been such a inspirational tool for me to embrace the role of a leader.

He then works thorough the Bible to illustrate his position and to stay true to his definition of leadership that being influence (Original source: J. Oswald Sanders)Even though we disagree on the definition of leadership, Maxwell has truly invested a great deal of time to put the context of the Bible utilizing a spiritual perspective or filter.Using the King James version as his primary resource, Maxwell walks the reader through each book of the Bible. At the beginning of each Book he provides:1. A Summary2. God's Role3. Leaders4. People of Influence5. Lessons in Leadership6.

The excellence stems from several features: 1) the emphasis on combinations rather than characters alone - during every lesson you learn about ten characters but many more words (combinations of two or more characters); 2) large size of the characters - very, very useful for the beginner; 3) systematic repetition -- characters from one lesson are used in the following lessons in a systematic way that helps to build and keep your vocabulary. I can't think of any other book available on Amazon that shares these features. If you get the book, I suggest you buy both volumes together because the appendices with stroke order and simplified characters are at the end of the second volume."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"The DeFrancis series of books on Chinese includes &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;, &quot;Character Text for Beginning Chinese&quot;, the two volumes of &quot;Beginning Chinese Reader&quot;, and I think an intermediate book as well. While I am not thrilled with &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot; as a text (you can read my review on that book), I think that the readers are admirable. They are designed to teach the writing system on its own, independent of the course material in &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;, and yet there is a certain thematic continuity between the two books, so that they can be used as a supplement to each other. The Yale series used the same process in their earlier set of books, which are something of a classic in the field.The books start off teaching you ten characters a lesson. They build up from the simpler ones to the more complicated, and also drill you on forming words from the characters you already know (most Chinese &quot;words&quot;, if you can use the term, consist of two characters, each with a meaning of its own).DeFrancis apparently produced the book &quot;Character Text for Beginning Chinese&quot; in addition to the Readers because some educators balk at the system of teaching the writing system independently, preferring to teach their students the words they learn to speak as they go along. I've tried both ways, and I really believe that it's a mistake not to treat the writing system as a separate subject with beginners.You can probably teach yourself to write from these books without too much trouble. However, learning to write Chinese is an aesthetic experience as well as a linguistic one, and I don't know how authentic your handwriting will be without a teacher. DeFrancis takes it about as far as you can in a book, reviewing the traditional ways that Chinese children are taught to write the component parts in a balanced way. The grammatical demands are minimal, since it's assumed that you're using other material for that part of the learning process. On the whole, a very creditable effort, which is no doubt one reason why it has survived as a standard text for so long."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"In the 1960's, while Mr. DeFrancis was working on this series, he wrote an essay called \\"Why Johnny Can't Read Chinese\\" (Journal of the Chinese Language Teaching Institute, Volume 1) in which he explains why a book like this is necessary and why he designed it the way he did. The reviews below pretty much restate it - you cannot learn to read Chinese just by memorizing a lot of individual characters.An example: ben3 means \\"root\\" or \\"self.\\" Lai2 means \\"come.\\" Di4 means \\"earth.\\" Ren2 means \\"man.\\" All simple words. But when combined, could you guess that benlai would mean \\"originally\\" or bendi would mean \\"this country\\" or benren would mean \\"myself, yourself, himself\\"? There are thousands and thousands of combinations of this sort that have to be learned separately from the individual characters or you will have no idea what you're reading.In addition, I would like to get something off my chest. Everyone tells you Chinese grammar is easy. It isn't! It's just different! Chinese uses word order instead of declensions, tenses, etc., to convey different meanings. If you get the word order wrong, you're saying something completely different from what you wanted to say. People will tell you word order in Chinese is a lot like English, which is true in simple terms, but a very dangerous generalization. \\"Bu hen hao,\\" for instance, means not very good, but \\"Hen bu hao\\" means really bad. \\"Min2guo2\\" means republic but \\"guo2min2\\" (same characters) means citizen. In any kind of complex sentence (or even in simple ones) you need to be very familiar with common, habitual word order rules. There are too many of them to simply learn by rote. And that's not even mentioning the problem with particles like the infamous \\"le.\\" You need to read a LOT of Chinese words in context to really learn these grammar rules.And the DeFrancis Chinese Reader Series has just that. These books are thick! Another reviewer below gave the number of characters in each volume, I think, and you can read above the dimensions of the book, so I won't repeat it here.The Readers also teach you the cultural significance of a lot of terms, a lot of idiomatic expressions, and a lot of historical and place names. And also I'll make the suggestion that you use these books in combination with his grammar texts, \\"Beginning Chinese,\\" etc. The audiotapes for the whole series, including the Readers, is available from Seton Hall Language Lab. I don't think you can find any series more thorough.Some people will tell you these books are out of date because they were written in the late 1960's, but I haven't found that to be a problem at all. Grammar doesn't change much. A few words have changed, but really, you need to know the old words as well as the new. I mean, is anyone saying that English readers can't understand books written 50 years ago? The only form of language that changes that quickly is slang, and you're in trouble if you think that's language learning. Foreign language book publishers are the main culprits here - they want to come out with a new, more expensive edition of their audaciously expensive, well-nigh worthless texts every 5 years. But don't get me started.The introduction in the beginning of the book makes a lot of good points, but I've used up all my space, so I'll put some quotes in a \\"Volume 2\\" review in case you're still wondering if this is the right series for you.Oh - and do buy Volume 2 along with Volume 1 because, as reviewers have noted below, the index is at the back of Volume 2."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"First off, don't think that this 2-volume set will teach you to read Chinese by itself; it's designed as a companion to his &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;. Each of the 48 lessons is matched to a lesson in his &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;; for example, before you study Lesson 10 in Beginning Chinese Reader, you need to have learned the grammar in Lesson 8 of &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;.The author stresses a couple of key points: Learning characters has to come AFTER the sound system and after at least some grammar has been introduced. And secondly, the number of characters you know is not nearly as important as the number of character combinations that you've learned, and the amount of practice that you've had with the characters.Each lesson introduces 10 new characters, and 20 to 40 character combinations built up from the new characters and characters previously learned. All the new characters are used in &quot;Illustrative Sentences&quot;, which are translated into English at the end of the chapter. The bulk of each lesson consists of readings, both in dialogue form and expository prose.By the end of the 2 books, you will have learned app. 400 characters, and about 1,200 character compounds. But these are the most frequently utilized 400 characters; according to a study cited, these 400 characters account for 73% of all the characters found in books, periodicals, and other sources.The book uses traditional characters, although in the back of volume 2, the authors gives the simplified versions, and a small bit of practice using these. Like the companion &quot;Beginning Chinese&quot;, the topics are somewhat dated ... you constantly read about so-and-so not having enough money to send his children to college. But overall, if you're seriously interested in the Chinese language, and you're willing to invest the time and energy to do it right, the DeFrancis series is the surest way to get a sound foundation in Chinese."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"I'm not going to repeat what has already been said but DeFrancis states that this book and volume 2 combined contains 120,000 characters of running text using just 400-500 distinct characters!!! It is this repetition and various presentation of characters in different contexts that I find the most valuable. I am not sure where else you can find such a large number of what is essentially graded readings for beginners.As many have mentioned before, this is bested used as a supplement to a grammar text."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"This book is good for learning Chinese characters. Ten characters are introduced each lesson and then combined with ones learned in previous lessons. Chinese is often mistakenly called a monosyllabic language and this book shows the true way by showing how the characters can be combined different ways to form usable words. The characters introduced in this two book series are those most frequently used so by the end of the second book the author says you can recognize two-thirds of the characters used even though that is a small fraction of all Chinese characters. The font used in the book is especially big and clear so it's easy on the eyes. This book uses only the traditional form of the characters used in Taiwan and overseas; not the simplified form used in Mainland China."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"This book is an excellent means of practicing reading Mandarin chinese in Traditional characters, but has little to no guidance on grammar, pronunciation, or traditional uses. While some self-study types like myself would be tempted to try using just one book at a time, I'd say this would best be used in conjunction with the other books in the series, or one of the software/tape systems for spoken and grammatical chinese."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"this is one of the few teach-yourself books that you'll actually find yourself following from beginning to end. the lessons are nicely graded and don't necessarily get much harder the further you go.while it's frustrating for a start that you only get 10 new characters per lesson, you quickly realize that the only way to learn is by combination.i'm on beginning chinese reader ii now, and fully intend to go through the whole series."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"This book will help you learn Chinese sentences. From basics onward (always using big-size ideograms) you start reading fairly adult sentences and paragraphs. Is it challenging? You bet! Sometimes it's like sparring with a mystery writer or devious crossword puzzle maker, but Mr. DeFrancis is pushing your mind to grow! Unfortunately, some of the ideograms have changed in Mainland China. (e.g., Car and East) On the other hand, when you start noticing that you can read simple Chinese sentences that are NOT IN THE BOOK you will be elated. Get ready for an effective, but excruciating challenge! This review applies to Part I."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"Anyone who has studied languages, particularly difficult ones, knows that repetition, and lots of it, is the key to success. This book and its companions excel in this regard. Vocabulary is chosen carefully and is then used to build graded sentences through example, dialog and narrative which can run to over twenty pages in a single lesson. I wish that I'd had the equivalent when studying Korean and Japanese.One piece of bad news, however, the text is in traditional characters. This means that at some point you are going to have to make the effort to learn the simplified characters that are used by the bulk of Chinese throughout the world now. However, if you've mastered the texts in this series, that shouldn't be too much of a challenge."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"This Chinese reader was the best I've found on the market. I just jumped right in and feel like I can really get a handle on the language. I'm glad there are more in the series because this method could really help someone read fluently."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"Although this is now a work with a lot of miles on it, to me it is still the best method ever devised for English speaking students of Chinese to actually start reading and writing the language. The lessons themselves teach the traditional characters (with short lessons on the contemporary simplified characters in the back). While this is an emphasis that some people may disagree with, learning traditional characters won't do any harm and it is much easier to transition from traditional to simplified that to do it the other way around. Each character (and each longer word formed from combinations of more than one character) is given with its pinyin transcription. Stroke order charts are provided so that a learner can quickly grasp how to handwrite each character. Each lesson (except for the review lessons) introduces new words first by illustrative sentences and then with either dialogues or narratives, which gradually get longer and more challenging as the course progresses. Particularly helpful are the drills for recognizing characters in context- it is not always immediately clear to a beginner looking at a sentence whether a character is standing by itself or whether it is part of a two-character word, just to give one example. And simple but authentic reading material is introduced from early on. There is no question that actually learning to read and write Chinese is a long journey that requires both a lot of time (years, in fact) and a great deal of personal commitment, but a student can start down this road well-equipped. This author truly did everything he could to anticipate every possible difficulty that a beginning student could have."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"The book moves along quite quickly. Within the first 4 lessons(about 10 pages) I was reading simple and basic chinese sentences. It is quite advanced and requires discipline(obviously)and substantial memorizationto master ."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"This series of textbooks by John DeFrancis is an excellent way to learn Chinese characters. I've looked around for other textbooks, but have never found another with such a structured, systematic approach. You learn ten characters in each lesson, and about 40 combinations (words and phrases) composed of those characters. Their usage is illustrated in sample sentences; then you are given dialogues and narratives to read. Every sixth lesson is a review lesson, in which you don't learn any new characters or combinations. In Volume I and Volume II combined there are 48 lessons, for a total of 400 characters.One of the great things about this system is that it doesn't require a lot of memorization. You learn the characters from reading them in actual sentences and paragraphs. When you're working on chapter 12, for example, the characters you learned in chapter 11 may be difficult to remember, but by the time you get to chapter 16 you've read them so many times that they are second nature to you.As for the actual text, the book is intended for college students majoring in Chinese, so a lot of the stuff you're reading relates to academia: attending classes, taking exams, teaching, reading and writing books. As you go on in the series and learn more characters, the topics get broader and you start to learn about Chinese culture, geography, politics, and everyday life. It can seem a little counterintuitive at times; before you know the words for colors or food items, you already know the words for 20 different academic disciplines. Since these books were published in the 1960's, some of the narratives are a little outdated. There's a lot of talk about \\"I remember before the People's Republic . . .\\" and \\"That old man was an official in the Qing Dynasty . . .\\" (if the book were written today, that old man would be dead), but you do learn a little about Chinese history and, more importantly, you do learn how to read and write Chinese characters.This series concentrates mostly on the traditional characters. At the end of Beginning Chinese Reader Volume II there is an extended lesson on simplified (or modern) characters. So you spend about 90% of your time on traditional, and 10% on simplified. Because you spend less time reading the simplifed characters, they require more memorization. Between the two versions about two-thirds of the characters are the same, so you just have to learn the simplified equivalents of the other one-third.One important thing to note is that in the back of Beginning Reader Volume II, besides the aforementioned lesson on modern characters, there is a glossary/index of all 400 characters and their combinations, plus charts listing the characters by lesson, by radical, and by number of strokes. There's some diagrams on stroke order (how to actually draw the characters). If you just buy Volume I you won't have access to all that helpful material, yet it's still possible to complete Volume I without it."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"This is an excellent book for learning standard - read traditional - Chinese characters. I'm learning Chinese in Taiwan where they still used the traditional characters and I have found it really quite good... so much so I'm buying a few more when I get home (U.S.A.) and will be bringing them back for my friends here.One thing the author should have done (in my view) is to have included the stroke order chart... which strokes to write in which order... in the first book and not in the second volume... but that's a small complaint."},{"Title":"Beginning Chinese reader,","review":"Good for all the reasons already enunciated by previous positive reviewers.

Kaufman was of course more expert on certain matters ( Neitzsche ) than on others(Kierkegaard) but he here provides a variety of texts that enable the reader to know and think for himself about the major ' existensial writers and thinkers'."},{"Title":"Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre","review":"Walter Kaufmann's book, \\"The Faith of a Heretic\\" was the work which brought me to study philosophy, and I have been a fan of his writings and translations ever since, but, like some reviewers have said, if your interest is to study a particular author, this book is not for you. It may not even be for you if you wish to study Existentialism. But, if what you want is to get some feeling for what this Existentialism thing is all about, this collection is far superior to, for example, William Barrett's \\"Irrational Man\\", who, I believe makes a special mish mash of the 19th century precursors of Existentialism.One example is with the writings of Dostoyevsky, who wrote very long, intricately plotted novels, but to find those passages which uniquely identify his perception of the existential condition of life, you could spend days. Here, in a very nice, concise selection, is exactly the passage you want, from \\"Notes from Underground\\". I would say the same about the other literary selections from Kafka, Rilke, Camus, and perhaps Sartre. Oddly, I would skip over the Nietzsche selections and read Nietzsche's complete books, especially \\"The Gay Science\\" and \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\". He wrote in aphorisms, but his arguments spanned several numbered paragraphs.I suspect that reading snippets of Heidegger is a total waste of time, but I think Jaspers piece of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard is a nice piece for this collection. To those who complained about the binding and printing, I have no such problems with my latest edition."},{"Title":"Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre","review":"I bought this book for a class in literature and modern thought when I was in college.

I found a frequent disconnect between what I knew of the philosophers and what seemed to be in the passages. Having come to existentialism through literature, I was eager to explore it from the philosophers' point of view, but I honestly found myself searching in vain through many of the selections for something that I recognized as existentialist.Another issue I have with this book is that the texts are given in chronological order. It seems to make more sense to start with an understanding of Sartre and then to move back to works that appear in retrospect to contain existentialist themes or ideas."},{"Title":"Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre","review":"I read this book for an Existentialism graduate course.

Today in most places Kierkegaard is actually read the Kaufmann-view would be considered eccentric, misshapen even. -Alistair Hannay, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, University of Olso, April 1999The Kierkegaard that W Kaufmann presents to the reader in thirty pages of writing was a \\"skandelon, a frequently befuddled thinker who attacked the Greek heritage in philosophy and Christianity, failed to distinguish between responsible and irresponsible decisions, rashly renounced clear and distinct thinking all together, was a man whose literary and intellectual conscience was perhaps lax even for a religious writer, was one of the foremost leading spokesman for uthoritarian religion, whose conception of God and the proper relationship between Father and Son is utterly different and authoritarian through and through, who wistfully deplored his own intelligence, and extols the incarnation of sancta simplicitas, with no understanding whatsoever of any religious attitude other than his own, is charged with self- importance, had a limited, poor, infinitely pathetic and upsetting individuality, offers only sundry observations, his psychology is vitiated by uncritical self-projection and sanctimonious self- deception, and being physically deformed, he probably wondered if his own deformity was not a punishment for his fathers sins, he abandoned reason entirely, and persistently deceived himself because he didn't want to know the truth that his broken engagement was caused by all too human motives, and on faith should be compared with Sartre's \`Portraite of the Antisemite.'\\" (WK: S to E 175-199 &amp; S to E 15-20 &amp; 85)Incredibly, despite these shortcomings he still had the nerve to compare himself to Socrates! &quot;Being much more modest than Kierkegaard, Jaspers is not in the habit of comparing himself to Socrates&quot; (WK: S to E 25)It appears that K's comparison with Socrates is not all that arrogant though:&quot;What I write here is for orientation. It is a public attestation; not a defense or an apology. In this respect truly if in no other, I have something in common with Socrates. For when he was accused, and was about to be judged by 'the crowd' his daemon forbade him to defend himself.&quot; (PV 6)For the sake of brevity, two philosophers who hold other opinions on K will be looked at. It must be noted however, that WK is in the minority on his judgement of Kierkegaard and perhaps on his own entirely. In the introductory essay to Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre Wk claims that K was for the abandoning of reason, but in the Jaspers section of Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre Jaspers claims that &quot;Never on such a high level had there been such a thorough-going and radical opposition to mere reason. This questioning is never simply hostility to reason; rather (Kierkegaard and Nietzsche) sought to appropriate limitlessly all modes of rationality.&quot; (J: D to S 190) Another charge Kaufmann brings against Kierkegaard that Jaspers sharply disagrees with is Kierkegaard's desire to know the truth. Jaspers claims that &quot;...their [Kierkegaard and Nietzsche's] whole thought strove toward the genuine truth.&quot; (J: D to S 190) Wk seems unaware of Jaspers ideas when he says in the introductory essay to Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre &quot;...the differences [between K and N] would far outweigh the similarities, which Karl Jaspers has catalogued so carefully.&quot; (WK: D to S 19) Alistair Hannay, the editor of Inquiry seems familiar with ideas like Kaufmann's, and in the Kierkegaard section of The Oxford Companion to Philosophy he says: &quot;The more scandalous views attributed to Kierkegaard [...] often vanish on a closer reading of the texts, which in context lend themselves to more readily acceptable readings.&quot; (Companion 444) Also, he mentions that &quot;Wittgenstein however, once referred to Kierkegaard as by far the most profound thinker of the last century. (Companion 445)When WK calls Wittgenstein's jugement on spiritual matters into question in one of his (WK's) books, it gives the reader the impression that wk is familiar with Wittgenstein's thought. But it appears that wk has learned little from the analytic philosopher. A display of wk's dialectical despair can be found in his &quot;from Shakespeare to Existentialism&quot; Wk seems to have trouble in quoting Nietzsche to make his point. In response to K's claim that:&quot;After my death no one will find in my papers (this is my comfort) a single explanation of what it was that really filled my life, the secret writing of my inmost parts which explains everything and often transforms what the world would call bagatelles into events of prodigious importance for me, which I regard as insignificant apart from the secret gloss which explains them&quot; (K: S to E 185-186)Wk says, &quot;This note should be compared with Nietzsche's observation:&quot;&quot;The worst readers of aphorisms are the writers friends if they are intent on guessing back from the general to the particular instance to which the aphorism owes its origin: for with this pot-peeking they reduce the whole author's effort to nothing, and they only deserve it when, instead of philosophical outlook or instruction, they gain nothing but-at best, or at worst- the satisfaction of a vulgar curiosity.&quot; (N: S to E 186)Kaufmann seems to think Kierkegaard is Pot peeking on himself, therefore forcing the reader to pot peek. But since Kierkegaard was an existential writer, the man and the thought are inseperable. But Kaufmann reduces kierkegaards works to nothing by obsessing over K's 'deformity and love-life, and gets rather vulgar as well, 2paragraphs after quoting Nietzsche WK seems to do some pot-peeking:&quot;I have said that Kierkegaard's range of experience was narrow; and yet his life was certainly no less interesting than Freud's or Nietzsche's. [...] In the concept of dread for example where he deals psychologically with original sin and admits that his psychology is based on his own case, he is preoccupied with the relation of his own sin to his father's; and he probably wondered whether his own deformity was not a punishment for his fathers sins.&quot; (WK: S to E 186)Also, wk's charge of self-deception is based on this pot peeking:&quot;...And when we read his books in these terms, his conception of the three stages and the teleological suspension of the ethical are seen to be in part the desperate attempts of a misshapen man who was as he reveals in other contexts completely dominated by the figure of his father, to convince himself as well as a woman that the strange way in which he had broken his engagement with her had nothing to do with all-too-human motives? It would be absurd to claim that such a psychological analysis does justice to his work. Of course it does not. The only reason for as much as mentioning these matters is that the desire not to know the truth was as important element in K's faith.\\" (WK: D to S 20)Is WK's knowledge of what constitutes all-too-human motives objective or subjective? Does WK assume the objective truth of certain beliefs?Often Wk lacks clarity in his criticisms of K. In the introductory essay to Existentialism from D to S Wk claims that K is against the wisdom of the Greeks. One may wonder why he would want to compare himself to Socrates when he is against the wisdom of the Greeks. Perhaps the Greeks did not all agree on what wisdom was. Wk is unclear about Plato's position on the limits of reason, which he seems to use as an example to show that K was anti-Plato. In Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre wk says &quot;Plato had maintained on the whole that in the things that matter most reason is competent,&quot; (WK: D to S 18) then in Faith of a Heretic he says Plato &quot;had insisted that knowledge was available in regard to {most} of the questions which mattered most.&quot; (Heretic p.355) Also, Wk is critical of K's negative attitude toward science, and then complains that Nietzsche's interest in science has been ignored. But it appears that they are closer on this issue than Wk thinks. According to Nietzsche; &quot;It would be a mistake to adduce German science here, as well as being proof one had not read a word I had written, for seventeen years I have not wearied of exposing the de-spiritualizing influence of our contemporary scientific pursuits.\\" (Twilight 65) To show that K was against science WK uses K's Concluding Unscientific Postscript as an example, but this is misleading. The Postscript is against the raising of philosophy to a systematic science, not science itself. In hte inroductory essay to D to S Wk implies that K encouraged people to abandon reason entirely. But K seems to disagree here; \\"I prefer talking with children, with them one can still hope that"},{"Title":"Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre","review":"This book does contain some great selections, but is flawed by Kaufmann's subjectivity. The questions WK raises about Kierkegaard's Truth is Subjectivity selection raise some interesting questions. WK asks;\\"does he (K) stick with the claims made in the first two sentences? Is the second sentence of the third paragraph for example consistent with these claims? Or does Kierkegaard assume the objective truth of certain beliefs?\\" (WK: D to S 84-85) The thesis is; &quot;Our treatment of the problem does not raise the question of the truth of Christianity. It merely deals with the individuals relationship to Christianity.&quot; (K: D to S 110) In the second sentence of the third paragraph K claims that &quot;it is surely quite impossible for anyone who has lost a sensibility for his eternal happiness to enjoy eternal happiness,&quot; (K: D to S 111) which is compatible with the thesis. However, WK's question; &quot;Or does Kierkegaard assume the objective truth of certain beliefs?&quot; is not compatible with K's thesis. Another of WK's questions that gets him in some trouble is where he asks; &quot;in the second part (of the truth is subjectivity section) he makes much of the fact that scholarship cannot firmly establish faith. Why does he ignore the no less obvious fact that it can, and often does undermine faith? Does the section on authority help us to understand him at this point?&quot; (WK: D to S 85) One reason K ignores the fact that scholarship can undermine faith is because Wk cut that part out. In his intro to the K section of his book wk says the only K selection he edited himself was the &quot;on his mission' selection. WK claims the three dots in the Truth is Subjectivity section are puntuation marks by the author, but they are actually cuts by WK. In one of the ommissions K says that the contradictions in scripture that scholarly types like wk like to fuss over do not undermine faith, because inspiration is an object of faith, and does not come from scholarly deliberation:I assume now the opposite, that the opponents have succeded in proving what they desire about the scriptures, with a certanty trancending the most ardent wish of most passionate hostility - what then? Have the opponents thereby abolished Christianity? By no means. Has the beliver been harmed? By no means, not in the least. Has the opponent made good a right to be relived of responibility for not being a beleiver? By no means. Because these books were not written by these authors, are not authentic, are not in an intergal condition, are not inspired (though this cannot be disproved, since it is an object of faith), it does not follow that these authors have not existed; and above all, it does not follow that Christ has not existed. In so far, the believer is equally free to assume it; equally free, let us note this well, for if he had assumed it by virtue of any proof, he would have been on the verge of giving up his faith. If matters ever come to this pass, the believer will have some share of guilt, in so far as he himself has invited this procedure, and begun to play into the hands of unbelief by proposing to demonstrate. (K, CUP, Swensen-Lowrie, p.31)The selection Kaufmann includes from Authority and Revelation can be read like this, but WK seems to include it to back up his &quot;authoritaritan K&quot; theory. But when this section is read in entirety it becomes clear that K is not asking us to submit blindly to the religious authorities, he is promoting a leap of faith toward spiritual authority. The section on authority WK sees as being authoritarian is in fact encouraging the opposite of what WK thinks. K wants people to make up their own minds about Christianity, not let the scholars do it for them. Back to the question &quot;in the second part he makes much of the fact that scholarship cannot firmly establish faith. Why does he ignore the no less obvious fact that it can, and often does undermine faith? Does the section on authority help us to understand him at this point? It appears that WK did not read A&amp;R very thoughly:&quot;A learned twaddler who at the bottom knows nothing can seldom be got to deal with anything concrete; he does not talk of a particular dialogue of Plato, that is too little for him-also it might become apparent that {he had not read it.} No, he talks about Plato as a whole, or even Greek philosophy as a whole, but especially about the wisdom of the Indians and the Chinese. This Greek philosophy as a whole, the profundity of Oriental philosophy as a whole is the prodigiously great, the boundless, which advantageously hides his ignorance. So it is much easier to talk about an alteration in the forum of government than discuss a very little concrete problem like sewing a pair of shoes, and the injustice towards a few capable men lies in the fact that by reason of the prodigious greatness of the problem they are apparently an par with every peer, who &quot;also speaks out&quot; So it is much easier for a dunce to criticize our Lord than to judge the handiwork of the apprentice in a shop, yea, than to judge a sulfur match. For if only the problem is concrete, he will, it is soon to be hoped, soon betray how stupid he is. But our Lord and his Governance of the world is something so prodigiously great that in a certain giddy abstract sense the most foolish man takes part in gossiping about it as well as the wisest man, because no one understands it.&quot; (A&amp;R 31-32)One way for scholarship to undermine faith is to criticize the object of faith, so it appears that K did not ignore this problem entirely.&quot;Suprised it was assigned without alternative readings, yes. Today in most places Kierkegaard is actually read the WK-view would be considered eccentric, misshapen even.&quot; -Alistair Hannay, April 1999"},{"Title":"Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre","review":"The selections are excellent, but the book is ruined by Kaufmann's philistine misunderstanding of Sartre, Nietzsche, and (especially) Kierkegaard.

This made it easy for me to pick Walter Kaufmann as a professor and editor who would be widely recognized as being a leader in this field. In turn, it may have been his feeling, at some point, that I was less philosophical than he was. If that was a game, like chess, I might easily concede, and stop playing a game which depended on such mastery of obscure possibilities. When I was in high school, I had to read Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, who is also represented in this volume. More than I am interested in philosophy, I would like to understand Dostoevsky's comment on page 76 of this book: &quot;Gentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not brilliant, but you know one can't take everything as a joke. I am, perhaps, jesting against the grain.&quot; I had expected philosophy to be an attempted rationalization of existence, as my previous training in religious thought had emphasized acceptance of whatever is expected to be accepted above all else.I would expect this book to appeal mainly to those who have an interest in philosophy. The class that I was in didn't attempt to read or discuss those selections which the professor considered too difficult (we were not a group that was expected to argue, just understand), but this book seemed to be pointing us in a reasonable direction when we left it and took a better look at the philosophy of Camus, contained in a book which concluded with the chapter which also concludes this volume, &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus.&quot; The final sentence there, &quot;One must imagine Sisyphus happy,&quot; (p. 315) suggested that perhaps Sisyphus had discovered the best joke for describing what this field is all about. My vote would be for the idea on page 312, &quot;To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their secrets.&quot;"},{"Title":"Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre","review":"In 1975 Wk expanded the Kierkegaard section of his &quot;Existentialism From D to S&quot;, adding three selections. The 'Truth is Subjectivity' section he includes is rather facinating. Wk claims in his intro to the K writings that the only section he (Wk) edited is the 'On his Mission' section, and adds that in the other sections the three dots &quot;are punctuation marks which the author (K) sometimes used in place of dashes.&quot; (D to S p.83) But a close reading of the 'Truth is Subjectivity' section (it is from the CuP) shows not only editing by Wk, but strongly indicates that Wk made these cuts with the intention of creating a straw-man. I was suspicious of the dots for a while, and found proof that they were cuts when I was reading &quot;From Plato to Nietzsche, Kaufmann/Baird, 1997 ed.&quot; It includes cuts from K's Concluding unscientific Postscript that show that &quot;From D to S&quot; is butchered. One example of a Wk style cut:&quot;A young girl may enjoy all of the sweetmness of love on the basis of what is merely a weak hope that she is beloved, because she rests everything on this weak hope; but many a wedded matron more that once subjected to the strongest expressions of love, has indeed had proofs, but strangely enough has not enjoyed 'Quod erat demonstrandum'...[D to S ends here, enter Plato to N]...The Socratic ignorance was thus the expression, firmly maintained with the passion of inwardness, of the relation of the eternal truth to an existing person, and therefore it must remain a paradox as long as he exists. Yet it is possible that there is more truth in the Socratic ignorance than in the objective truth of the entire system that flirts with the times and adapts itself to assistant professors...[D to S starts again here]... Objectively the emphasis is on 'what' is said.&quot; (D to S, p.116 &amp; P to N, p.1061)Getting exposed by your heirs for such behavior might sound like the ultimate folly, but it is not. Wk outdoes his heirs by pre-exposing his editing himself, . In 1959 Wk published a collection of essays called &quot;From Shakespeare to Existentialism&quot;. For the K essay in &quot;From S to E&quot; Wk creates two psuedonyms, Brother Brash and Brother Brief. In addition to his preoccupation with k's &quot;deformity&quot;, Brother Brash makes awkward attempts at demolishing K's 'Truth is Subjectivity' doctrine. In the process of this he quotes from 'CuP' in a way that tips the reader to the cuts WK later made in his &quot;From D to S&quot;. Perhaps Wk had not read his own book. And I don't blame him. This cut that Wk attempts to explain to us in &quot;From S to E&quot; was removed by him from his &quot;D to S&quot;. It starts just past the socratic ignorance cut above (D to S, p.116)Thus spoke Brother Brash:&quot;As K's argument progresses, the confusion mounts. To show that subjectivity is truth he distinguishes what is said from how it is said, and then proceeds:&quot; [square brackets WK's]At its maximum, this how is the passion of the infinite, and the passion of the infinite is the very truth.[Surely, this is wrong and begs the question.] But the passion of the infinite is precisely subjectivity, and thus subjectivity is the truth. From the objective point of view, there is no infinite decision, and thus it is objectively correct that the distinction between good and evil is canceled., along with the principle of contradiction, [why?] and thereby also the infinite distinction between truth and falsehood.[why] Only in subjectivity is there decision, whereas wanting to become objective is untruth.[why?] The passion for the infinite, not its content, is the deciding factor, for its content is precisely itself.

I addition the excerps from the Scriptures are rendered in English with the key word in the text highlighted, so it is in fact very easy to use, also for the student who is not very much accustomed to Greek.

This volume is an incredibly helpful resource for study especially in relation to preaching, and teaching. However, if one did not know Greek, or at least the alphabet and the word he or she was looking for it would be too difficult and time consuming to really be helpful. Money would be better spent on an NIV exhaustive concordance, or even buying both the NIV concordance from Zondervan, as well as this one. The G/K numbers correspond. Of all word study tools the concordance is most basic and necessary.

As a huge Supergirl fan, I was excited to read (yet another!) different take on her.This story does have a few ties to real origins Supergirl has had. An angel \\"Matrix\\" (whose look is obviously supposed to represent Supergirl or \\"Kara\\") has a job to look over and protect a girl named Linda Danvers. But despite \\"Matrix's\\" continued attempts Linda seems intent on living dangerously with drugs, alcohol and her horrible 'boyfriend' named Buzz. So dangerously, in fact, a demon is very interested in her immediate damnation. But this ends up being the side focus, as the angel starts having a crisis of faith once she temporarily enters Linda's body and is shocked by how bad everything is and the \\"disease\\". She is faced with very different paths she can take (Heaven, walk as a human, live in a past evolution under the sea or even Hell?) and if she even wants to help the humans that disgust and confuse her. Her choice will also affect Linda's eternity.At times in the story I was a little confused, I love graphic novels with a lot of dialouge (like this one) but keeping everything straight takes complete concentration. How the world and \\"angels\\" were split up was also pretty complicated for such a short story, but nothing the reader can't follow. Despite that, the art is beautiful and the characters all have real depth. The message the story ended with was beautiful, and it's a message worth sharing. In the end, I'm proud to add this book to my Supergirl collection."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I was not planning on sumbitting a review of this book until I read with alarm the undeserved slammings from the majority of the other reviewers. I was genuinely stunned to find the overwhelmingly negative response, or, at best, lukewarm reactions or damning with faint praise. This is especially true since my own experience of Headlong was extremely positive. I found the story to be engaging and funny and also well written. I found the characters believable and fully formed and did not mind at all the sidebar lecture on the Dutch Masters. In short, I LIKED it from start to finish, and found it to be one of the most entertaining novels I had read in a long time.Considering the garbage that is being fobbed off on the unsuspecting public in the past few years, Headlong seemed like a breath of fresh air. I mean, there are some books that make it to the best seller list that make me wonder if the lost art of book-burning should be revived. But this was not one of them. Why not save the one-star reviews for books like the Historian and its idiotic and overpaid ilk?"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"If it is possible to experience whiplash while reading a book, then &quot;Headlong&quot; may be just the literary vehicle.The deliciously measured pace with which Frayn leads us into his farce picks up speed as our art-besotted hero pratfalls his way to nabbing the missing masterpiece from its bumpkin owner.Yet no sooner does Frayn have you hurtling along his farcical highway when he slams on the brakes and takes a sideroad into the arcane world of iconography, iconology and Netherlandish painting.Then just as you've adjusted yourself to Frayn's scholarly, languid and rather taxing explorations of these disciplines, wham! He's put his foot to the floor and once again we're careening along with Martin Clay and his roadshow of inept scheming and second-guessing.In the end, the reader requires a virtue which Martin seems to entirely lack: patience.But it's worthwhile to endure with Frayn's detours and pedantry. Not only are they fascinating exercises in genuine scholarship, but they also make Martin Clay a thoroughly plausible art detective, dogged academic and blinkered buffoon.Though sometimes ponderous, Frayn's meanderings through the artistic and political history of Europe are a curiously successful counterbalance to the slapstick results they engender.There is one superbly comic moment which ties these two polar opposites together. It comes when Clay finally clutches his prize. His words of triumph are surprising yet obvious, and like the novel, hilarious."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn is an excellent writer who can appeal to the intellectuals and can also reach a mass audience with his wit and great prose. However, Headlong is a work of fiction that requires at minimum a passing knowledge of art history, because the detail is intense and can sometimes be detrimental to the plot. Even if your knowledge is minimal, an interest in art helps if you are willing to absorb the lessons that the book teaches as a matter of course. This is the book's one big flaw, because it becomes absolutely necessary to understand the historical and cultural facts that Frayn gives because they are essential to the plot moving forward and you can get bogged down in trying to follow it. It's really not that bad, but sometimes it's frustrating. In spite of that, this is one of those books that you can read in a few days because once the plot gets in full swing, there is a strong urge to get to the end and see how everything is resolved. It's very enjoyable and more importantly, makes you think. I can definitely see this novel becoming a film someday."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"&quot;Headlong&quot; is a confession by the narrator of his failed plan to secure, identify, and present to the nation a long-lost painting by Pieter Breugel. Not entirely failed -- for a brief time at the end he does secure it -- but the rest of his plan comes to naught, as the reader knows it must, for Martin tells us in the prologue that he will come to look ridiculous. Martin's failure is the reader's fun, however. His descriptions of his country neighbor's seething mass of friendly dogs, the neighbor's forward wife, his own scurryings about the neighbor's house in an attempt to examine the painting are the top level of pleasure in this novel. The next level is more serious: a consideration of the circumstances of Breugel's life, his fears, the hidden meanings of his paintings. Frayne makes Martin's excursions into the bloody history of the Netherlands and the conditions of art production just as interesting as the adventures of his protagonist. &quot;Headlong&quot; is in places laugh-out-loud funny; it has tender moments of marital affection; it has intellectual detective work and art interpretation. It is my favorite novel of 1999."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"&quot;Headlong&quot; is a very entertaining sort of novel that revolves around a wonderful plot device: a man finds, in his boorish neighbor's house, a neglected painting be believes may be a lost Bruegel. The rest of the novel revolves around his plot to confirm the painting's identity and to steal it from the undeserving neighbor. Frayn does a remarkably good job of showing how protagonist Clay, while neglecting his own philosophical scholarship, engages in his quest to confirm the painting's authenticity, and the history and art history are mixed in fast and furiously. The novel becomes one of those intellectual mysteries in which the clues are scholarly details, and this material is handled remarkably well, and I learned a great deal about Dutch political and aesthetic history. This aspect of the story, however, is hung on a less effectively executed plot to free the painting from its undeserving owner. If the book drags at times it is not because it gets bogged down in history, it is because it doesn't bog itself down sufficiently in the present. I would have liked to have seen the characters fleshed out a bit more, motives made clearer, and the emotional investments of the characters made more real. Ultimately, however, &quot;Headlong&quot; is an effective and engaging read."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"In &quot;..1568, the Holy Office [in Rome] condemmed the entire population of the Netherlands to death as heretics, and the king ordered the sentence to be carried out at once, without regard to age, sex or condition.&quot;Readers of &quot;The Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; or &quot;The Girl With the Pearl Earring&quot; will find &quot;Headlong&quot; a bit more challenging, however, what it lacks in simplicity and slimness it makes up for in verismilitude. And, unlike one other reviewer, I don't think you have to understand all the esoterica of Dutch painting to &quot;get&quot; the story. Also, if you read and appreciated Simon Schama's &quot;Embarrassment of Riches&quot; and Umberto Eco's &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; this book will be a welcome addition to your library.There are two main stories in &quot;Headlong&quot; --the one in the foreground concerns Martin the &quot;art dealer&quot; philosper who is trying to pull a fast one on his neighbor Tony Churt by acquiring for a nominal sum a potentially valuable painting in the latter's possession. The second story, which I found even more intriguing, concerns the origin of the painting in question which may have been executed by Pieter Bruegel sometime in the bloody 16th Century in the Netherlands.When Martin first describes &quot;The Merrymakers&quot; many readers will suspect it is a Bruegel or &quot;after&quot; Bruegel. Martin's search for information to determine whether or not the painting is a Bruegel leads him deeper and deeper into a bloody past that is not discussed these days. Contempory history classes teach about slavery and the destruction of American Indians (which took place at the same time), as well as the plight of Jews in WWII, but we don't hear much about the &quot;real&quot; bloody history of Europe--until films like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;Les Miserabe&quot; gain our attention.I am American of Dutch descent and have read much history on the Netherlands and the wars of religious freedom, so I was hooked from the beginning on &quot;Headlong.&quot; I particularly liked Frayn's analogy between the Duke of Alva's troops (Philip II's Reich commisar) and the Nazi storm troopers of the 20th Century. One of my earliest memories as a child is my mother cursing the Nazis because of the havoc they wrecked on her homeland. Make no mistake about it, &quot;Headlong&quot; is a very serious book about very serious subjects--religious freedom, oppression and exploitation, and censorship.The destruction of the people of the Netherlands..&quot;seems to have been beyond even Alva, and that same year the Prince of Orange was provoked into armed revolt. The consequences...spread outward across Europe and onward through the centuries. ...To destroy the support for the rebellious provinces in the north [Holland etc.] Philip [II] had to invade England. To cover Parma's crossing of the Channel in defenseless flat-bottomed barges he had to send a naval task force. To restore Spain's falling position after the destruction of this Armada, he had to intervene agaist the Protestants in France. To stem the the hemmorrhage of wealth [from New Spain and the lost Netherlands] after his failure in France, he had to declare bankruptcy...Down went the old empire of Spain. Up came the new empires of the North.&quot;And where did Bruegel figure in all this? I think he was a hero, but you will have to read the book and form your own conclusions. All I can say is I am going to look at the iconography in Bruegel's paintings with a new eye from now on."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Visited London for the first time this past August and among the highlights of the trip were reading 'Headlong' and seeing Frayn's 'Copenhagen'. Terrific blend of farce, moral ambiguity and scholarship, this is one of the best books I've read all year. Tremendously entertaining, it also includes some of the most lucid art history I've ever read. Frayn makes Bruegel's paintings come alive and his descriptions of Holland under Spanish rule are chilling. Very intelligent. Very funny."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn's \\"Headlong\\" takes us on a wild caper of deception, obsession, and the discovery of a lost masterpiece that could turn the art world upside down. Or not. The novel opens with a confession by the narrator, Martin Clay, that he either is a fool or a fool as well as \\"the subject of outrage and horror.\\" What follows is an account of a philosopher's headlong plunge into an escapade that begins and ends in the deceptively peaceful English countryside.Frayn deftly takes us from scholarly analysis of Flemish art to slapstick moments in the crumbling estate of country bumpkin Tony Churt. Just when we think we are learning something about the subtleties of iconography and iconology, we find ourselves laughing at Martin's desire to tackle \\"normalism\\" as his next project. Occasionally the reader is left scratching her head in disbelief at Martin's willingness to put his marriage, his reputation, and his life on the line for a hunch. But just as we wonder if this character has lost his mind, Frayn reminds us of what a truly remarkable (and lucrative) discovery it would be if his hunch were on the mark.In the meantime, the author provokes us to think about the true value of art and what determines whether a painting is a masterpiece or worth little more than a collector's taste. Perhaps more profoundly, he also asks us to explore the human price for preserving culture. He peppers these provocations with a dose of wry British humor.Historians' knowledge of Flemish painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder, circa 1525 - 1569, leaves plenty of holes for Frayn to climb through and develop a believable theory for his tale. Just enough is know about Bruegel for scholars to salivate over the possibilities of what kind of man he was, what he believed in, and what his artistic and philosophical intentions were. Anyone who has gazed upon a Bruegel painting or print knows it can be an unsettling experience. It is easy to end up staring for twenty minutes at a peasant's gap-toothed grin before noticing a telling, sometimes macabre, detail that represents the turbulent times in which the artist painted. Or, as with the series of \\"The Seven Virtues,\\" the viewer easily could get caught up in trying to decipher the multifaceted meanings of Bruegel's allegorical figures.In the end, Martin's infatuation with Bruegel evolves not so much from the aesthetics of the artist's work, but from the genius and daring of a man who \\"painted the many things that could not be painted.\\" The philosopher's fixation on one small detail reflects the real-life pains curators and collectors have gone through to identify Bruegel's work. It's worth reading \\"Headlong\\" to find out how Martin Clay becomes entangled in the world of Netherlandish art and an adventure he'll never live down."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"A philosopher turned art historian chances upon a rare find in a debilitated country house - a lost painting by Bruegel, the 16th century Flemish master. There are only two problems - how can he coax it from its (semi-) legitimate owner, and how can he really be sure it's genuine, certain enough to jeopardize his wife and daughter's future?What transpires is a headlong plunge into shame and hypocrisy. The Babel-like demolition of Martin's aspiring academic pride is painfully inevitable. Drawn deeper and deeper into a self-constructed conspiracy theory - the politicization of Bruegel's &quot;Months&quot; - he decides that he must possess the painting at any cost, or, rather, the attendant glory of its restoration to the world. The result is a dizzying fall from grace, scorched by his selfish, reckless ambition.You will certainly enjoy it if, like me, you are a lover of Bruegel's beautiful paintings. I found the art history intriguing - a trail of evidence in search of a crime, and a powerful deconstruction of the terrifying political and social climate in which Bruegel worked.The book benefits greatly from having to hand the paintings it describes - these allow you to investigate for yourself the illuminating details picked out by the narrator. I recommend Bruegel, by Keith Roberts: it has a concise biography and excellent, full-page, colour reproductions of the &quot;Months&quot; and other paintings described throughout the book."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Many reviewers have complained about the detail of the art history aspect of the novel. Some have even called it a flaw. I couldn't disagree more! It's the books greatest strength. The ability to reflect on what is only a mix of pigments on a canvas, and to extract intriguing insights into a long-gone century and culture is fascinating. To those familiar with the academic milieu, the iconography/iconology distinction and mutual distain is dead-on and hilarious. If you aren't interested in history and/or art, well, you might not find the book so thrilling.The main plot is sitcomesque, to be sure (though it's not half as hokey as Ian McEwen's &quot;Amsterdam&quot;). Nonetheless, it is fun to watch the main character's mind at work - everybody thinks they're perfectly reasonable, now matter how flawed they are. If you enjoy that aspect of the novel, consider reading Tim Park's &quot;Juggling the Stars&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Mimi's Ghost&quot;. The &quot;protagonist&quot; in those darkly comic books descends into multiple murder, all the while maintaining an entirely reasonable attitude (in his eyes)."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I noticed this book on the front table at my favorite London bookstore, Hatchards, years ago. Years later I bought it at my local library and only, just now, read it.What a rollicking story involving Tony and Laura Churt, their art and Martin Clay and his wife Kate and daughter Tilda. At first a drama between the four primary personalities, an art history fueled detective story and ultimately a cautionary tale that ends with the thud of the brokenness that results from an obsession laced scam by Martin to sell one of Tony's art pieces (an alleged long lost Dutch Master) before Tony realizes its value. But then Tony has his own hidden agenda as well. And so we see the consequences of this obsession and the cost that this has on personal relationships.Worth the read."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"What a fabulous read! Simply a page turner from start to finish, gathering momentum as it went. I now know much about Pieter Bruegel and the Netherlands in the 1560s. Would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This novel runs on two tracks: the life of a London academic couple and their infant daughter on an early Spring sojourn to their second home in England's rural hinterlands; and a highly speculative and evolving narrative on the meaning and context of Pieter Breughel's 16th century paintings.On the latter track, the protagonist's personal quest eventually seems to get woven in with his art historical musings.The novel turns into a sort of \\"Keystone Kops\\" story for intellectuals as the action reaches its frightening crescendo. But all ends well. I was pleasantly surprised by the life decision of Martin's wife that enabled her to overcome the conseqences of his headlong fall into reckless adventure and financial shennanigans.A smart and entertaining book with an out of the ordinary structure, plus very well-crafted use of language and situations. A cerebral thriller of sorts that can be enjoyed at the beach."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is one of the better books I have read in a long time. I know nothing about Dutch art in the 1600's, but I don't have to. Frayn lays everything out for you, and the art history is a vital and exciting element of the book.The book is so well written, you understand exactly what motivates the main character. Frayn's writing style is easy to read, but very well developed and intelligent. I had to force myself to slow down, I was so caught up in the plot, but wanted to enjoy the writing.Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Martin Clay, a philosopher turned art expert, believes he has identified a lost Brueghel masterpiece, and suffers misadventures in trying to acquire it, &#65533;on the cheap&#65533;. He must contend with the caddish owner of the painting and also the skepticism of his wife, even more of an art expert than he. The book is intended as a satirical, farcical comedy, and the physical comedy aspects work. There is a great deal of art criticism in the book, focusing on the putative cultural, historical, and personal context of the painting, and its symbolism. I, possibly naively, took this as mostly serious, and found it wonderful, and highly educational, not just in the specifics, but in illuminating the attraction and value of this type of art criticism. The book does a splendid job in portraying a marriage between 2 loving people, Martin and his wife, stressed by Martin&#65533;s unshared obsession. I would have enjoyed the book more if Martin had fewer hoops to go through, and if some of his calculations and plans weren&#65533;t so absurd. I also found the art discussions to be overdone at times."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn is very current with his plays &quot;Copenhagen&quot; and &quot;Noises Off&quot; delighting audiences bicoastally. His facility for words, whether placed in the mouths of actors or on the page of a novel, makes him a delight. &quot;Headlong&quot; is a witty, erudite frolic with the protagonist being an obscure painting by Breughel owned by an naive country bumpkin and coveted by his apparent art historian friend. Frayn has a solid quartet of main characters that bounce across his net offering both sides of a dilemma as to whether knowledge about art provides real ownership over mere possession of a &quot;pretty picture&quot;. Doesn't much sound like an interesting plot, but in Frayn's facile hands this novel becomes endlessly entertaining and funny and wise and .... successful. He makes the light touch of comedy drive home some rather intense points of justice. A fun book for scholar and light reader alike."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Headlong presents an outstanding example of what happens when a hunch becomess an infatuation and all logical decisions are cast away to allow for a rapid stream of ill planded actions. This depiction of Martin Clay, the narrator of the novel, shows how he goes from atempting to remain civil to eventualy abandoned all integrety, as he tries to attain what he believes is an undescovered painting by Peter Bruegel. Throughout this entire novel as Martin streams through volumes of imformation on Bruegel, convincing himself that this painting is what he believes it to be, the reader is given a lesson on fourteenth century Netherlandish history, perhaps even learning a bit more tham anyone may want to know. However this does make good background information for why Martin is so convinced that the painting is a Bruegel. As Michael Frayn unravels the chain of events that leads to Martin's loss of any sencable reasoning, the reader is brought along and can see how these poor decisions could have been made given the situatuion. This work offers an inciteful look at a man who is motivated by his own greed and cannot see past the one goal that he has set for himself."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"A well written novel, with fascinating historical details.

Comedy of manners meets art history in a new and novel way. I found myself interested enough in Brugel to pull out an old art history book and gaze at the paintings with new eyes. Great reading!"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is not a bad book, exactly. It's just that Frayn dives headlong into so many things at once herein that it all ends up being terribly confusing and emotionally deflating in the end, which may be the point, about where obsessions lead one, or it may not. Who knows? By the end, one simply feels too twirled about to care a damn.If you love the paintings of Pieter Brueg(h)el the Elder - one of the things you'll learn is that he altered the orthography of his surname twice, removing and then reinstating the \\"h\\" - though nobody quite knows why, then you will love the in depth iconological as well as iconographical (q.v. the book) descriptions of the import of his paintings. I know I did.If you're interested in the history of the Netherlands - There were 17 of them, by the way, nether or low lands, that is, or so you shall learn - then the book will also fascinate you. This part was engrossing to me as well.It's the modern setting and characters where everything falls short. Only one of the characters is even two dimensional, Martin Clay; the rest, such as his wife Kate, are such one-dimensional stick figures that the reader is hard-pressed to bother or care about them at all.At one point in the narrative, Martin is comparing himself to Icarus, who, flying too close to the sun, falls headlong into the sea. By the end, he's describing himself as being thrown headlong into a millpond, by a rout of yobbish Lowlanders.This is certainly how this particular reader felt at the end."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Frayn's book is far more than just a typical British-countryside farce novel. By combining historical facts of artist Pieter Bruegel's life, as well as 16th century Netherlandish history, into a novel of 20th century deceit, Frayn has created a classic for all times. An enjoyable -- and heady -- read for anyone lucky enough to pick this one up."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I also read a glowing review of this Booker award nominated novel, rushed right out to buy it, and must confess that my copy went straight to the local library sale within a week. I thought that the art history topic would be an enthralling component of the plot. Nope. Although I don't have an intense academic art background, I have taken a few courses and was surprised that the author couldn't spark more than passing interest in a complete new world of art historians, auction houses, etc. Ah well, at least the character development should be something special. Oops. No again. Other reviews saw this novel peopled by flawed but humorous, true to life subjects. I only read about fairly unintelligent, selfish, yet surprisingly boring characters. I frankly didn't care all that much about what happened to them. This author is off my list...."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"On problem with the argument is that orthographics were simply not pinned down in the sixteenth century. I mean that people simply did not spell their names consistently each time they wrote it down, or each time it was recorded for them in a tax record or receipt. For example, the artist we call Geertgen tot Sint Jans was also called Gheertgen tot Sing Jans and Gheerrit van Haerlem and Gerardus Leydanus and Geertje van Sint Jans. In the Bruges records for the Guild of Saint Luke (which is the name for every painters' guild in every city, because Luke was said to have painted the Virgin's portrait from life) his name is spelled Gheraert, Gheraerd, Gheeraerd, Gherraert, Gherart, Gherardt, etc... Thus, basing an argument on the orthographics of Pieter Bruegel (Breugel, Brugel, etc...) can only lead to nonsense.A second niggling inaccuracy was that it would be impossible to do the amount of research on Bruegel (or on any other topic) in the time allotted to this activity according to the narrative. You can't just expect to drop into the British Library (which doesn't lend books) and find out all this information about the status questionis surrounding the Seasons paintings. (The author of The British Library is Falling Down describes library research much more accurately. First, you have to order your books, then immediately go on a coffee break, because some library worker has to page the books, and this takes at least an hour. Only if you order them the night before can you expect to be reading by 9 am.) Maybe I'm just sensitive to these issues because I spend so much time in libraries, and the character in Headlong makes finding information look so easy.I found this book inaccurate and tiresome. If you want to read a great novel about Early Netherlandish Painting, read William Gaddis' The Recognitions."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"After reading the glowing New York Times review, I rushed to buy this book in hardcover. That purchase is certainly the worst I have made in some time, and I would advise others who have an interest in this topic or in works by the author to avoid this novel. In fact, I hate to even give the book away and subject someone else to the tediousness of this work.As an art historian, I anticipated discovering what the very clever Mr. Frayn could do with a highly fascinating topic. I am sorry that he could do no better, and would agree that the long-winded descriptions of the netherlandish political arena were overblown. In fact, they were discursive enough to cause me to lose interest in a theoretically interesting story with completely unappealing characters.For those interested in the topic, I would recommend Robertson Davies' What's Bred in the Bone. It is a far better read on all fronts."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"A couple from London are at their country home for the summer (they are both professors - he of philosophy, she of art history). They are invited to the house of one of their neighbors for dinner, and asked to appraise some paintings they're thinking of selling. The husband (the main character and narrator of the story) thinks one of the paintings (held in low regard by the couple) is actually a long-lost painting by Bruegel, a Netherlandish painter of the mid-1500's. The painting may be part of a series of six (or more) paintings depicting characteristic activities of the peasants during the year, only five of which are currently accounted for (in real life - this novel does try to stick to the historical facts).About one-third of the book's text advanced the plot of how the main character was going to get his hands on this painting, and the rest was a narrative of his research into Bruegel and the time he lived to try to find hints that could help him prove this was actually the lost painting he thought it was. I found the part that advanced the plot to be less than enthralling; the characters came across as rather slimy and the events just left a bad taste in my mouth; the humor just didn't work for me. However, the part describing the art history and political history of Bruegel's times was interesting, and it was intruging to see how a real historian could go about doing his research into a lost work of art."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I was fascinated by the theme of this book: What lengths will a man go to possess something that he covets? In this case, the object of desire is a painting which the narrator of the tale is convinced is the work of Bruegel, and he is prepared to lie, cheat, and jeopardize his marriage to obtain it. Although I laughed out loud at the narrator's efforts to rationalize despicable conduct, my enjoyment of the story was diminished by (what I deemed) the excessive descriptions of the political and religious forces in the Netherlands in the 16th century that shaped Bruegel's work. It is this detail which, although likely appealing to a reader with a keen interest in art history, significantly reduced the pleasure I derived when reading this novel."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"after the vibrant read of frayn's media-satire (it had something with \\"tomorrow\\" in the title?), i was deadly disappointed by headlong. what a boring book!"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, yet turned out to be pretty dissapointed.

The early dinner-party scene at the Churts' house was hilarious, but then the endless, dry art-historical and philosophical ruminations just put me to sleep.

It does have the same universal absurdities that can be found in 'The Treasure of Sierra Madre'or 'She Stoops to Conquer', but at heart this is a deeply intriguing political inquiry into the work of a great artist, and its blend of political, religious, historical, and artistic analysis contains a brilliant series of well-asked questions and decisively imaginedprobable answers.It's a bit like Beef Wellington, with the outer shell plot all enjoyable pastry, and the story-within-a-story all good red meat.I very much expect the author could never have published his analysis and theory as scholarship -- too much jump-the-potholes speculation -- but, by cleverly wrapping it in a comedic fiction, he can give his best intuitive faculties full play without wasting time peeling Brussels sprouts to go with the meal.Mitchell"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I read this book several years ago, and would like to read it again-in fact I'm recommending it to my book group.Unlike some other reviewers here, I found the digressions into art history fascinating, and I enjoyed the hero's hilarious machinations as he tried to get the painting away from the upper-class twit neighbor before the neighbor found out how valuable it was."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Here's what I suggest for an utterly intriguing run of books: read Frayn's Copenhagen, Headlong, The Copenhagen Papers, and Spies in that order.

It is my way of taking a mental vacation to the UK if I cannot actually be there myself (which has been the case for over 2 decades). Frayn is one of my favorite British authors and it was fun to read this gem of a novel a second time, which takes me to London, the English countryside, and even bits of Holland, Belgium, and Vienna. I have also read his novelSpies: A Noveland seen a production of his playCopenhagen, and Frayn is both intellectually brilliant and entertaining. Headlong is a joy for me because it is a boffo storyline--that of an amature art historian trying to con a not-so-wealthy aristocrat out of what out of what he suspects is a lost painting by Pieter Bruegel--mixed with liberal amounts of art appreciation and historical context. Frayn manages to juggle them all splendidly and as he shifts gears he does so almost seamlessly, doing it all with humor and humanity. I lose myself in the storyline for pages, then lose myself in the Bruegel backstory, then lose myself in the history of the Netherlands, by turn. It is like reading three books in one. It falls short of five stars only because there are a few moments when the plot twists get to be a bit much, but nothing to mar the overall enjoyment of the novel or detract from Frayn's mastery as a writer."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"\\"Headlong,\\" by Michael Frayn, neatly tugs at your funnybone while tossing you on a roller-coaster of duplicity, intrigue, and action . . . and throws a good deal of Dutch Art Criticism in for good measure.Martin, our \\"hero,\\" is a middling academic on sabbatical to the countryside in a desperate attempt to finish what is sure to be a long-ignored work on \\"nominalism.\\" What Martin lacks in style, panache, or apparently many other worthy attributes, he more than makes up for in pell-mell scholarship and an eye for minutiae.In a scene reminiscent of \\"The Irish R.M.,\\" Martin finds himself being asked for his opinion on various paintings by the scruffy country lord, Tony Churt, of a scruffy country estate. In a flash, Martin believes he spies an unknown painting by the Dutch master Bruegel, currently being employed as a chimney-stop. Soon Martin is engaged with himself in a furious battle of rationalization as he becomes consumed with the notion of swiping it from Churt's grubby hands and making millions off it, all without Churt's knowledge. Which is difficult, because Churt is desperate for money and has a nose for treachery, being a treacherous sort himself.What ensues is a hilarious tale of duplicity, half-truths, a stretched marriage (Kate, Martin's suffering wife, labors away unsuccessfully as Martin's conscience), pathetic overtures for infidelity, and a torrent of art criticism. Through it all, Frayn writes exceedingly well, evoking just the right amounts of panic, triumph, guilt, shame, horror, and self-satisfaction to make Martin a loveable schmuck.Along the way, Martin offers a highly entertaining and insightful dissertation on iconography and Dutch history, and at the end of the day, \\"Headlong\\" conveys a lot of information along with smiles, chuckles, and outright guffaws.\\"Headlong\\" is the perfect title for this work, and you will enjoy turning the pages as Martin dives headlong into this crazy world of art and the double-cross."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn's book is a good read but uneven. The story of Martin Clay's sudden obsession with his neighbor's possibly valuable painting is funny in the manner of Frayn's stage farces--wacky car chases, mistaken identities, lovers hidden in closets, etc.Interspersed with the farce are lengthy detailed passages in which Martin picks apart in detail the political environment of 16th-century Netherlands in hopes of identifying whether &quot;his&quot; painting is by the famed painter Bruegel. I found this part quite interesting but disruptive in tone from the farce (16th-century Netherlands was apparently tragically oppressive, full of religious persecution, torture, etc.). These passages are so long and involving that it becomes a bit hard to follow the farce that surrounds it.It would have worked better for me if I had bought into Martin Clay's motivation for doing what he does. It's not clear why a philosophy professor (the main character) would suddenly develop either an art-history fixation or an interest in defrauding his neighbor of a valuable painting.It's all quite entertaining but rather unbelievable. Overall I found the whole less than the sum of the parts."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I found this book very entertaining. The story is engaging and the protagonist is well rounded. You are drawn into his dilemma of wanting to make his fame and fortune. Any student could relate to his desire for procrastinating on his work by following a fanciful idea about an undiscovered treasure. I found his system of rational to be amusing and the way he carries out his theoretical ideas verses his wife's a touching way to pull the characters along. The fact that it is probably going to be made at the expense of a couple women is what makes the story more complex. You want to tell him that he can have a comfortable and happy rural living with his plump wife. You know eventually he will go back to her. The question is whether he will survive the experience. It was really thrilling when it became a matter of life or death. Of course, the story is a clich&eacute; and the narrator admits this in the beginning. You are always conscious that you are being told a story, but it is a very engaging one."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"\\"Headlong\\" is a great title, since Martin Clay, the narrator of this very funny book, does rush forward headfirst, without deliberation, and gets himself involved in a ridiculous business deal, which costs him not only money and the temporary loss of his wife's good will, but also causes the destruction of a painting --- perhaps a long lost Bruegel - which is the object of his reckless behavior.In \\"Headlong\\", Michael Frayn, also shows why he is a very successful playwright. Repeatedly, he has Martin Clay constructing tight little scenarios about his interaction and manipulation of other characters, only to find their character-driven unpredictability completely destroying his planning, usually in hilarious ways. In reading this book, I often thought that scenes would play well as an intelligent Broadway comedy.Anyone who has worked strenuously to achieve something, only to find the experience having a transforming effect on the goal, may appreciate this comment from Martin Clay (page 371), which he utters when he finally has the possible Bruegel in his grasp: \\"I suppose I've won after all. Not that I feel the slightest sense of it. The only thing I actually feel is that I've nothing more to lose.\\"I highly recommend this fast-moving book."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I was waffling on reading this one but a friend gave me the final nudge I needed and I'm awfully glad he did. This book moves from comic novel to theatrical farce so smoothly you can practically see it on stage as you read. Farce is ridiculously hard to do and Frayn is very, very good at it. In fact, his play &quot;Noises Off&quot; is a farce about a farce and is one of the funniest productions I've ever seen.Philosopher turned amateur art-historian Martin Clay and his art historian wife Kate take an extended stay in the country, mostly for Martin to finish his book on &quot;the impact of Nominalism on Netherlandish art of the 15th century.&quot; They happen upon their neighbors -- Tony Churt and his wife Laura, owners of a dilapidated manor (and wonderfully vivid supporting characters) --and get invited to dinner where they are asked to assess the value of several paintings in the family estate. Among these paintings, Martin believes, is a lost masterpiece by Flemish artist Peter Bruegel. He doesn't say a word to the Churts about this &quot;discovery&quot;; instead, he sets out to prove its authenticity and immediately begins plans on staging an elaborate art theft.The progression of plot depends very heavily on art history but because its told through the spinning wheels of Martin's over-active mind, it's very entertaining stuff, and you don't feel as if you've walked into an art-history text book (well, okay, there are moments when you do, but I found it all rather interesting). Martin is beautifully comical in his earnestness and completely believable at that. Very British too, which adds to his appeal.The story comes to a frenzied head near the end, as farces generally do, and goes out with a bang. Fun stuff."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"First of all this is one of the few underrated books in amazon. I have just finished reading it and I still feel the thrill, speed and colors of it. There are some somethings in this book that made feel the same way as I felt when I read &quot;the name of the rose&quot;. This book has many levels many facades, it can be classified as comedy, mystery, tragedy and romance at once. It is written for people who can enjoy solving a good problem, or people who are simultaneously interested in human relations, art, history and having a good time. It is just a fun book to read with a lot to offer on the way to the end. Being interested in art and history is a plus but not needed."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This novel is an awkward attempt to marry farce with art history. The farcial portions of this book are immensely entertaining with well drawn characters. The art historical portions, while initially interesting, tend to bog the plot down with overlong excursions into fairly obscure aspects of Netherlandish history. If you want well done art history, read &quot;Rembrandt's Eyes&quot;. It actually would have been helpful to the average reader for this book to include some plates of the paintings being discussed, which is an odd comment to make for a novel!"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn spins a wonderful, witty and well-researched yarn which kept this reader up all of one Tuesday night recently. His command of the written language is exceptional and while this is not the &quot;Book of Evidence&quot;, it is every bit as fascinating. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"'Headlong' seems to be the case of where an obviously gifted writer decides to write a thinly disguised story of himself and/or his passion. And as in most of these cases, the results are less than if he chose to write it as non-fiction.The 'story' is about a couple, keenly knowledgeable of art history, who upon meeting their wacky neighbors discover that they own a small collection or art antiquity. One particular piece of art is suspected to be a missing piece by a famous Dutch painter (its origins and value is not understood by its owners), and our happy couple proceed to swindle, or rather attempt to swindle, their neighbors - all to a humorous effect. The story is then, in effect, placed on hold while the author delves into great lengths about this Dutch painter, they type of paintings he did and why, etc. We are given a lengthy art history lesson. Enjoyable? Yes, generally. However the 'story' itself is rather contrived, with the author not bothering to flesh out the characters.Bottom line: a curious read to be savoured by art history buffs. All others will probably be bored with it all."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn has written one of the funniest plays ever (&quot;Noises Off&quot;), as well as one of the most intellectually stimulating (the Tony-award winning &quot;Copenhagen&quot;). In &quot;Headlong&quot; he has fashioned a delightful novel that combines the best aspects of both. Part raucous comedy, part Art History lesson, part mystery, this is a dazzling work sure to please anyone with a desire to be both entertained and educated. That it did not win the Booker Prize is a puzzlement to me. (And if you don't know what the Booker Prize is, don't bother.)"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This was my first time to read Mr. Frayn's work. There is no doubt the novel will appeal to art enthusiasts. However, I found it cluttered with too many details of the different paintings. The history sections took up too much of the novel and were, frankly, boring and not at all illuminating. The story was great, though, when we could see beyond the frames of the paintings. And hey, I object to the portrayal of the fat, quiet wife. Still, I'll look for other work by Mr. Frayn."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I'm not a trained art historian, but the only part of this book that I enjoyed was the investigation of the painting. I completely missed the supposed humor of the novel - I think because I didn't find a single likeable quality in any of the characters. This book got a great review in the local paper &amp; was a disappointment. It's on it's way to the used book store."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is the first book by Michael Frayen I've ever read and I'm really impressed. The novel is a page-turner: the comical part of the plot is rather unobtrusive, it includes genuine pearls of humorous characteristics and funny remarks; the part depicting life and time of the great Flemish artist Peter Bruegel is excellent, it is cognitive and incentive, one will feel necessity to dive into bizarre world of painter's fantasies by visiting libraries or appropriate sites on the Net. The author invites you to solve the mystery of Bruegel's art and simultaneously entertines with masterly depiction of unfortunate attempts of Martin Clay, a hero of the novel, to obtain lost masterpiece.But under the layers of comical effects one can discern elements of tragical events in some keeping with bloody history of the Netherlands under Spanish rule in the 16th century. Martin, a modern person who has everything he really needs - a loving young wife, wonderful daughter, decent work and income, by accident comes across a lost Bruegel's (probably) canvas in the home of his country neighbor who is unaware of his fortune and wants to sell it. Martin commences his efforts to acquire the picture with a proper desire to give it to the National Gallery in London and receive universal kudos for its discovery. But little by little the craving for its possession takes him all, he lies, cheats, commits illegal actions. Next comes possibility of adultery and even leaving his wife and daughter as a price for the canvas. Martin can not resist his monomania anymore, he is ready to justify all his unbecoming deeds. Even in the last ordeal by fire, when he has to choose between rescue of Laura, his neighbor's wife, and the longed-for canvas, he picks the latter at first and only Laura's desperate scream helps him to make right choice.The last pages of the novel are rather sad...the life of the hero is normalizing again (or at least he thinks so). The book is Martin's confession, his endeavor to alleviate pain caused by his rash actions, to understand what has happened with him... And why..."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Like some other reviewers, I am astonished that this novel has not received rave reviews by more. I rate this book up there with A Confederacy of Dunces in terms of humour and humanity.

Rather like Dostyevsky's Crime and Punishment (without the second half), the book focuses on a man who is desperately trying to fulfill an obsession that he has. In this case, it is an iconologist (different from an iconographer, don't ya know), who becomes completely, irrationally, and annoyingly obsessed with bringing to light what he believes is a long-forgotten, long-lost masterpiece.During the course of the book, we are subjected to probably at least 100 pages of Dutch history between the ages of 1530 and 1570. This would all be well and good if the book didn't consist of 340 pages. That is correct, almost 1/3 of this book is history from forty years. Forty years that were not terribly important in the grand scheme of European history. The fact that we are subjected to it in such mundane detail is painful. The fact that, in the end, it all comes to naught, is even worse.Other reviewers have called it a mystery, and I think that is misleading. From the start, we know, simply know, that the fool will take the painting, by hook or by crook. He is obsessed, and, like a drug addict, he will do anything to fulfill his need, even mortgaging his child's future. This may be part of what one of the other reviewers referred to (along with the extramarital &quot;relations&quot;) when they said it was part morality play, which I can accept. Boring, but about morality, sure.There are some novel things in this book. For example, his interpretations of the complex silences between his wife and himself are kind of interesting. However, that gets old really, really fast. I purchased this book expecting something like a cross between Gregory Blake Smith's &quot;The Divine Comedy of John Venner&quot; and Arturo Perez-Reverte's &quot;The Flanders Panel&quot;. I was sorely disappointed. It had the history of the latter, indeed, and the moral difficulties of the former, but it had far too much of both and not enough payoff to make reading it worthwhile. I am sincerely glad that I only paid four dollars for it.If you want moral plays, find The Divine Comedy of John Venner. If you want art history in a fun, fictional format, findThe Flanders Panel or The Da Vinci Code. Skip this. It isn't really worthwhile unless you want to punish yourself.Harkius"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I saw Frayn's play &quot;Copenhagen&quot; in London and loved it. &quot;Headlong&quot; is sooooo boring.

It was my sister who recommended it and she loved it so what I'm about to say is my opinion only (especially after reading some of the other reviews). I felt this was really a novella of about 100-150 pages with filler material to the extent of 250 pages taking the form of an art history lesson. If, like my sister, you like this sort of thing then you'll love the book. I don't know (or care) how factual the art history is. All I know was that all the art history made the book plod along.It's about a guy, and not a very likeable one either, who thinks he's discovered a lost masterpiece by Breugal/ Breughal, Shmegal or whoever it is. Our Hero (can't remeber his name)tries to con it out of the owner and excuse himself in the process while trying not to let his greed wreck his own marriage. That's the plot for what it's worth. I would have liked more about his marriage and his base instincts delved into by MF rather than the history lesson which seemed to leave my brain as soon as it entered it. For an attempted farce it was very short on laughs as well but again, when you lecture the reader on art for so long he/she is hardly going to be in the frame of mind for a laugh, no matter how hard the author may try.But, like I said it has its fans so it's a love or hate book. And I hated it."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This book was just awful. The characters were paper-thin, with no substance. The plot was entirely predictable, and pointless. I read to the end, thinking that there had to be some twist, some redeeming feature -- but there was nothing. Just what you think will happen, happens.

I compare this book strongly with Peter Mayle's &quot;Chasing Cezanne&quot;. Mayle's book can be considered a farce. The pages turn quickly as new locations show up. Frayn's book looks deeper into the art world of the fourteenth century. Pages turn a little slower, but with just as much intensity.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"It's about a painting. It's about a philosopher. It's about a philosopher stealing a painting. It's written by a man whose recent work veers between the intensely cerebral Copenhagen, a two hour dialogue between physicists Werner Heisenberg and Neils Bohr, and the riotuous Noises Off, a masterpiece of farce, all situation and perfect timing. It's Michael Frayn's Headlong. Michael Frayn uses humour to explore beneath the surface of what really is a common brand of literary derring-do : man steals painting. Frayn's fictitious Bruegel really did or does or should exist. It went missing a couple of centuries ago, one in a series called The Months, painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder in 1565. A wealthy banker, Niclaes Jonghelinck , commissioned the series depicting the months of the year. Five of these survive: Haymaking in the National Gallery, Prague, The Corn Harvest in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and three others, including Hunters in the Snow in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Michael Frayn's choice of Bruegel could not have been entirely serendipitous. Bruegel's art form was very like Frayn's. He was a master of irony in portraying the robust excesses of his age. The painting Netherlandish Proverbs (The Blue Cloak) probably contains every nuance of farce from the slapstick to the absurd. Headlong has all Frayn's thoughts on Breugel's iconography."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is a witty and cleverly-constructed book. There are two problems with it. The first is that this sort of trick of juxtaposing a story in a contemporary setting with a narrative about some subtly parallel scholarly discoveries has already been done about as well as it ever could have been by A.S. Byatt in _Possession_. Frayn's novel rather suffers by comparison, although I didn't find the long digressions on Breughel here as annoying as some other reviewers seem to have.The second more debilitating problem is that the narrator is a Fool. Not just a loveable stumblebum or a mild eccentric, but an out-and-out, unqualified buffoon. In many of his plays Frayn displays a formidable talent for the construction of hilarious bedroom farces, but these talents are misused in a novel like this, which in other ways attempts to be much more serious in what it communicates. Here the awful way that the guy treats his family and the casual delusions that he cultivates as a way to distract himself from his own research can't just be chuckled off as devices for keeping the door slamming and the bedpans flying - they make it awfully difficult for one to get excited about the hero's researches in the way that I think Frayn wants us to. He strikes a better balance between the forces of seriousness and farce in his two best novels (both absolutely wonderful, five-star reads) _The Trick of It_ and _A Landing on the Sun_."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Comsidering the error in the Kirkus review (the protagonist's wife is Kate, not Julia) and the pan below by the &quot;art historian&quot; (with this book, Michael Frayn, among so many other things, pulls the rug out from under all interpreters of art and history), I wonder if there's anybody reading this wonderful book with a clear, interested eye. There's so much going here-an intellectual mystery, sophisticated humor, the disintegration of a consciousness and escalating slapstick-that one wonders just how many balls author Frayn can juggle. My guess, based on the wisdom, the courage, the talent on display, is as many as he wants too. Sure, the characters aren't heros, but who really fascinating is? This novel thrills, challenges, instructs and best of all, elbows you in the gut. It's as if A.S. Byatt's POSSESSION was written by Evelyn Waugh."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Philosopher Martin Clay is asked by a neighbor to appraise a few paintings; he's unimpressed with all but one, a pastoral scene that he believes to be a long-lost Bruegel. But instead of leveling with his neighbor, Martin decides to keep mum and buy the painting himself. Is Martin truly motivated by a desire to see a great work of art returned to a museum so that the world can enjoy it, or is it simply greed? Can a nerdy academic successfully scam his more worldly neighbor -- and convince his own wife that it's worth doing? Is the painting truly the Dutch masterpiece that Martin believes (or wants to believe) it is? Will Martin's marriage and family survive his obsession with the purported Bruegel? Frayn keeps the reader guessing, mixing art history lessons about the Dutch masters with Martin's bumbling attempts to pull a sting, deftly portraying the unintended disruption to Martin's family life and marriage that inevitably follows. The book is perhaps a little too didactic when it comes to Martin's art history research, and this is why I found the beginning of the book slow going -- it is densely packed with names and dates, references to obscure artists and intellectuals as well as more well-known ones, and in-depth analysis of various Dutch paintings. But it's worth persevering as the novel builds up steam until its hilarious and supremely fitting denouement."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is a novel about art and obsession, written in turns as mystery and as farce. The mystery concerns how a long-lost painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder could have turned up un-noticed in a crumbling mansion in the English countryside. Could this be the piece that makes sense of the others in the artist's priceless cycle of 'The Months'? And what does it say about the role of Bruegel in the turbulent birth of the Dutch Republic? Pastoral or polemic - what are his paintings really about?Meanwhile, the farce concerns the lengths to which protagonist Martin Clay will go to get his hands on the unrecognised painting (which may or may not be what he thinks it is). Frayne has produced an hilariously convoluted plot in which Clay deceives everyone he meets - most of all himself. Whether it is comedy or tragedy, Avarice seems to be the winner, though perhaps Clay's 'confession' - the book - is his attempt at showing that he has learned the error of his ways.Reading this, I learned a great deal about Bruegel and the bloody history of the Netherlands of his day. An aquaintance of mine checked all of Frayne's references and found that they were indeed accurate. I too was left with a feeling of wanting to know much more about the intrigue that surrounds Bruegel.If the book has a weakness it is that the plot is barely enough to support the weight of the research. I wonder whether the best way to write about an artist isn't simply to write about the artist. On the other hand, I picked up a piece of fiction, but now I'm hooked on the art..."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"A fantastic book. Extremely funny and witty.

The local land-poor squire, an ignorant boor who beats his wife, tries to get a free valuation of some family pictures from them and Martin discovers what he believes to be a long-lost Bruegel -- a find that not only would make his career but would be worth several million pounds. Naturally, he has to possess it. And that draws him into a convoluted (but perfectly believable, earlier reviews of this book not withstanding) scheme to con his neighbor out of the unrecognized masterpiece . . . for the painting's own good, of course. That's the surface story, a very entertaining sort of bedroom farce it is. But Martin's wife, an iconographer who hasn't seen the picture, doesn't for a moment believe it could be what he thinks it is, so Martin must research the attribution -- a quest that takes him and us through the ins and outs of 16th century Dutch and Spanish politics, the Reformation and the Catholic counterattack, and the possible personal trials of the painter himself. I \\"read\\" this one on a recent trip via audiobook, read by British actor Robert Powell, and it may be one of those few books that's better listened to than read. Though my art background is minimal, I found the scholarly detective work and Martin's thought processes absorbing. And when I took this back to the library, I immediately went looking for the Bruegel books."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I have such mixed feelings about this book. There's no question that I was completely awed by Michael Frayn's intellectual creativity. The story centers around a lost Bruegel painting that an English academian thinks he's spotted among his boorish and avaristic neighbor's art collection. Frayn does an wonderful job of using the narrator's quest to authenticate the painting as a platform for discussing Netherlandish painting and history. It's all quite impressive, but anyone who doesn't have a love of art history is likely to find themselves getting bogged down in some of the theoretical aspects. Even though Frayn does a fine job describing Bruegel's known works, it might be very interesting to read &quot;Headlong&quot; with a copy of a book showing Bruegel's work sitting beside you.My reservations about the book come from the rest of the plot which concerns the narrator's efforts to buy the painting without alerting its owner to its true value. Yes, I know that the silly situations and outlandish schemes were supposed to be funny, but I personally found it so unbelievable that this very smart person would behave in such an outrageously stupid manner that it was more annoying than funny. The farcical elements would undoubtedly have been more palatable if there hadn't been such a complete dichotomy between the incredibly sophisticated academic analysis and the silly plot. It's frustrating because I think the whole scenario would have been funnier if the author had exercised a little more restraint."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is the first time I've read Frayn, but his high-tea civilised comic intelligence is reminiscent of P.G. Wodehouse. The wit that encases Headlong is not in the laugh-out-loud, satirically savage league of Sedaris or Rakoff, but it manages to hold its own in the bittersweet and ironic department.Plotwise, there isn't exactly too much adipose. Our urban protagonist, a philosophy lecturer with an interest in art history, camps up in his country cottage to cope with a writer's block, meets a rich but rural landowner and his younger wife (bundles of urban-rural barbs), finds at their house what we are led to believe is a collector's item unbeknownst to the landowner, and sets out on a frantic process of discovery to authenticate this potentially pricey work of art and steal it from his host. Troubles ensue. The wife of the landowner is enlisted as an accomplice in the grand heist plan. Oodles of action, clinched by a chase sequence at the end.While not something I'd read again (I am told Frayn's &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; is better) Headlong is certainly a pleasant book that chugs along with a genial step. Very decent light-reading material to accompany you on a lazy Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"An unworldly academic tries to cheat an eccentric landowner out of a valuable picture and ends up losing his money and almost his wife. The farcical plot is loaded with long stretches about art history, the way some thrillers are loaded with technology. It's as well that we should not forget the atrocities in the name of religion committed in the Netherlands and Frayn does a worthy job of reminding us. (Motley's Rise of the Dutch Republic sits in my library but I had to stop reading it because of the sickening cruelties described). I think there's supposed to be some symbolism about the Catholic/Protestant divide and the flawed hero's marriage. It was funny in parts but I think comic genius is rare and Frayn just does not quite have it. The present tense is used throughout and I found this intrusive."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I found this to be a very enjoyable book for the most part. I thought it was a very pleasing combination of art history and modern comedy. Except for a few overly detailed digressions into art history (and I do like art history) the book moved along well. On the downside, although the narrator was likable, most of the characters seemed rather two-dimentional. Furthermore, though I did get a few laughs, the book was not nearly as funny as I was hoping for. On the whole, though, well worth reading--especially for an art lover."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"\\"When musicians play together ... they must of necessity listen to one another\\" is the lead sentence in a Tommasini review in The New York Times on 2/1/13. Exactly correct. This is one of the paramount pleasures of playing/singing with others.On page 33 of \\"Headlong\\" Michael Frayn writes: \\" they're singing. This would explain why they're not listening to one another. People can't listen to one another if they're singing in counterpoint.\\" Mr. Frayn shows his ignorance about music, and his indifference to checking out what he has written: he knows. Well, he knows nothing about music, but that's not new. Hardly anyone does, with the notable exception (in recent books) of MacEwan's \\"Amsterdam.\\"As to the rest of the book, there is no need at this point to be encyclopedic in writing about it. None of the characters is worth anyone's attention. Period. The history of the Netherlands and Spain is the chief interest in all these pages. The analogy of Spain in the 16th century to Nazi Germany is well taken. The evocation of works by Pieter Breughel caused me to go and take a new look, a plus. The freckling of the pages with countless contractions (in one paragraph alone: he's = he is; he's = he has), especially with polysyllabic nouns is annoying.

I always enjoyed the deceptively languid style of Frayn's prose, which masks the muscularity of his research and learning. In short, this is an intensely readable artistic detective story built around the world of art history and the search for provenance in a potential Breugel masterpiece. It might lose pace on occasions and we could debate whether the finale is as strong as it should be, but there is endless fascination to be found on every page. Read and learn and enjoy..."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Many good novels, besides telling their own story, take their readers into a world that may be virtually unknown to them. The classic example is Melville's wealth of detail about whaling inMOBY-DICK, but you see it in numerous other authors from Tolstoy to Tom Clancy. Martin Clay, the protagonist of Michael Frayn's 1999 comedy HEADLONG, is an art historian. Something of an amateur, as it happens, because he is venturing outside his own academic field of medieval iconology, but that makes it no less exciting to watch him apply the familiar process of intellectual enquiry to a new territory. Frayn, who constructed a whole play,COPENHAGEN, around a debate between the nuclear physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, pays his readers the compliment of assuming that they care about abstract thought. This was fine for me, as art history was my first professional field and the book made me wonder why I had ever left it. So interested was I in the facts, that I could easily ignore the rather contrived nature of the containing fiction and excuse its weak ending.Martin moves with his wife and baby to a cottage some way out of London, hoping to complete some writing. They are invited to dinner by the local squire, Tony Churt, who asks their advice about four old paintings that he hopes may pay for a few repairs to his crumbling mansion. Three seem insignificant, but Martin, after a quick glimpse at the fourth, believes he recognizes a long-lost Bruegel, one of the series of Months as represented by the HARVESTERS in New York or HUNTERS IN THE SNOW in Vienna. The moment is electric: \\"The high air is still cold, but as you move down into the valley the chill dies away. The colors change, from cool brilliant greens to deeper and deeper blues. The season seems to shift in front of you from April into May as you travel south into the eye of the sun. Among the trees just below me is a group of clumsy figures, some of them breaking branches of white blossom from the trees, some caught awkwardly in the middle of a heavy clumping dance. A bagpiper sits on a stump; you can almost hear the harsh pentatonic drone. People are dancing because it's spring again and they're alive to see it.\\"Amazed that Tony Churt does not seem to know what he has got, Martin concocts an elaborate scheme to buy the picture off him for an absurdly low price in order to make his own fame and fortune. You have to accept that he only manages to get a brief glance at the picture, and so is forced to confirm its authenticity by peripheral research in libraries, but it is this research that is so fascinating. Even though I once taught Bruegel in college, I learned more from this novel than I have ever forgotten. Frayn juggles scholars and sources with a delight so infectious that you believe in the picture, and believe even more in the chase. Here is an example of some of the tougher writing: \\"Stein-Schneider takes a very different view of the Family of Love from Tolnay. To a heresiologist, a reading of Familist documents entirely confounds Tolnay's view that the sect was faithful to the Roman church. The Familists' doctrines of irenicism and ethic soteriology... I run to the shelf where the dictionaries are kept... their doctrines of pacifism and salvation through goodness... together with their sexual asceticism, identify them as a Manichaean movement in the Cathar tradition.\\" Frayn gently mocks Martin for getting into words he doesn't even know -- but at the same time assumes that he WANTS to know, and that the reader does too.If that reader is you, rush to buy this book. If not, be warned: the story is amusing but slight, and may not be enough to carry you through all the academics."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This book was given given to me and my wife by my mother-in-law, who passed away a few years ago. She had a sharp wit and was quite the punster, and she also loved art. She also had an eye for the unusual - the out of the ordinary. So it is not surprising that she loved this book so much that she wanted to share it with us.I can see why some people may think the long discourses about art history and Brugel the artist may be tiresome to some readers, but that would be like saying that Glengarry Glenross was boring because it was too much about selling, or that the Sopranos was bad because of too much violence.My point is, once you peel back the first few layers of the onion that comprises these complex bits of storytelling, at the core you find terrific characters, original thought, and a wonderful mix of drama, intrigue, and even some comic relief.So after thoroughly enjoying this novel, I found myself researching Brugel and his paintings and read more about 16th century Dutch art than I'd ever learned before. It was a thoroughly mind-expanding read.And so for this, I have to thank the author, Michael Frayn, and of course my dear mother-in-law Alice."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I think the negative reviews may have been given by those who were looking for a book to read on the beach. To enjoy the book, you have to remember (at least to some extent) the sketches of art history, the Spanish attempts to suppress the beginning of the Dutch rebellion against themselves and the Catholic church, the college-professor narrator's get-rich-quick scheme, etc.I was willing to put in the effort, and felt richly rewarded for it. Within the author's intent, my only criticism would be that the narrator is generally portrayed as intelligent, but his actions sometimes seem imbecile, which stretched my credulity. Perhaps it should not have - I have known some fairly impractical college professors."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"One of the funniest books I've read in the last few years. His understated humor is marvelously accomplished. The dialogue between the protagonist and his wife (and the non-verbal communication borne in the silences between words) are hilarous. Art, folly, wit, and wisdom combine in a tour-de-force."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Headlong is an interesting combination of historical research and rationalizing behavior. Martin Clay, thinks that he has discovered a long lost Bruegal painting and he wants to present it to the world. The machinations involved in this scheme are extraordinary. The historical context of the Netherlands in the mid 1500s is fascinating as are the explanations of the researched paintings. At times, there is too much research detail which bogged down this reader. Overall, it is a good read and brings Bruegal and his work to life."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I was an art history major in college. I took quite a few classes in art of the Netherlands. This book was funny and light, but I honestly do not know how someone not enchanted by the process of decoding artwork, and specifically the art of the Netherlands, would be able to tolerate this book. By the end even I was skimming over the disertations on political and religious forces shaping Bruegel's life.If you are interested in exploring how addicting the study of art and its context can be, by all means dive right in. If not, dive in as well, and don't feel guilty about skipping the seemingly endless historical chit-chat - it really does not have much impact on the story."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Frayn's novel is yet another fictionalization of the pleasures of scholarship, resonating with the same sorts of delight which informed Byatt's POSSESSION, Barnes's FLAUBERT'S PARROT, Hollinghurst's THE FOLDING STAR, Stoppard's play ARCADIA, and on and on and on. Perhaps this theme may have been done to death in the last twenty years, but that didn't stop Frayn from producing a very charming and informative novel about a man who has discovered a painting which may or may not be an important undiscovered Brueghel.The best things the book has going for it are its wonderfully inept and likeable hero (who is free of the tiresome sexual and intellectual arrogance that far too often dogs similar protagonists of similar works on this theme), and its real pleasure in delving to the arcane details of Brueghel's political and cultural milieu. This is a pleasant timekiller, but it is no great work: the plot is thin, the denouement is unbelievable, and the wife is an extremely shadowy and thinly-drawn character. Accept this novel for what it's worth, but no more."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Half of this novel is hilarious; the rest of it is quite serious. It's a strange, schizophrenic combination, that concerns a picture that Martin Clay sees in his country neighbor's home. The neighbor thinks it is junk, but Martin thinks he has found a work by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. If he can correctly discover its provenance he hopes to buy the painting for a pittance, and then resell it for a small fortune.Martin's subsequent adventures with the rather uncouth neighbor, his flirtatious wife, and the London art world are hectic, bizarre, and above all quite funny. Now comes the qualification. About half of the book's text is taken up with Martin's library research concerning Bruegel, his paintings, and late 16th century Netherlands history. Now I am interested in both art history, and medieval history so I was quite intrigued by all of this. But if you are not of a similar mind, you might object to several antic escapades being interrupted for another lesson in the history of Bruegel's paintings. If you don't like art lessons can you skip through the pedantic parts? Well, I don't know. If you don't like boxing can you skip the fight scenes in Rocky?I'm rating it four stars, because I liked both components of the book. You'll have to decide for yourself if you are in the mood for Art History 101."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is a novel about a painting; and it is also a novel about a middle-aged philosopher turned art historian, suffering from Peter Pan syndrome, subject to obsessive intellectual fits and get-rich-quick fevers. Martin Clay, the philosopher, is a very flawed protagonist, a bungling conniver, sort of like a more intelligent Basil Fawlty. The painting, on the other hand, is a treasure. The comic Clay finds it stopping up a fireplace in his comic neighbors' breakfast room, and he instantly falls for it the way Dudley Moore falls for Bo Derek on the beach in &quot;10&quot;:&quot;I recognize it instantly. ... I'm looking down from wooded hills into a valley. The valley runs diagonally from near the bottom left of the picture, with a river that meanders through it, past a village, past a castle crowning a bluff, to a distant town at the edge of the sea, close to the high horizon. .. Among the trees just below me is a group of clumsy figures, some of them breaking branches of white blossom from the trees, some caught awkwardly in the middle of a heavy clumping dance. A bagpiper sits on a stump; you can almost hear the harsh pentatonic drone. .. [H]alf-hidden in the raw spring undergrowth, watched only by a bird on a tree, a little thickset man holding two small wild daffodils is expressionlessly touching his comically pouted lips to the comically pouted lips of a little thick-set woman. .. A ship is setting sail, bound for the hot south. ... How can even these two fools not know what it is? I daren't think the name of its creator to myself, because it simply cannot be so.&quot;This very abbreviated excerpt only hints at the loving craftsmanship with which Frayn has created this lost masterpiece. It is more real, more alive, better crafted, more memorable, and more important to the reader than any of the characters in this novel. It's not just the intricate detail of the painting itself: Frayn convinces us that it's a painting which logically MUST exist, to make sense of the rest of the artist's works which really do exist in our world. After you are done, you will have to shake yourself alert and remind yourself that this painting is not known to have existed outside of Frayn's imagination, such is the integrity and reality which Frayn has lent its creation. I consider this to be an impressive accomplishment.The reader is fairly warned up front that she/he will be asked to attend to some details of art history and biography and to the history of the Netherlands under Spanish rule in the mid-16th century. The going is challenging but not impossible, and if you don't follow all the details, still you will be able to grasp the conclusions which they lead to about the unique importance of the painting and Clay's frenzied passion for finding the answers which have been put in his hand - or rather, which would be in his hand if it were now his painting. Which is the problem, of course: it's not.So, while on the one hand Clay engages in brain-wracking intellectual toil and surmise to produce the answers which have eluded the guardians of culture of the West for 450 years, on the other he is engaged in highly cinematic farce involving plots, deceptions, trying to sneak into the neighbor's bedroom, car chases, dogs, and the like. In fact the structure of the action is very much in tune with an Alec Guinness comedy, and has the same kind of bittersweet taste at the end. It would make a nice film if they could figure out how to get the intellectual arguments into it! I don't say that the novel is flawless, but it is a very unusual achievement. Ultimately it is a study of the dangerous lust of a foolish and unworthy married man for a sublime and unattainable object. The Moore-Derek metaphor holds up rather well. Except that Derek's beauty in &quot;10&quot; ultimately proved not to really be worth so much fuss. Not the case here - alas."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"British postwar literature has produced a fair amount of erudite writers who rely heavily on the ironic situations that occur when people behave unbecoming to their class and rank. These writers try desperately to balance comedy and existential despair in one narrative and David Lodge's campus novels are exemplary in this respect. You laugh while reading, yet some of the finer points linger on. Michael Frayn's much lauded Headlong falls into the same category, even if it's not as engaging as Lodge's best work. Headlong tells the not-so-gripping tale of lapsed philosopher Martin Clay who gets involved in an art scam involving an undiscovered Breugel, thereby displaying a behaviour that is not commonly expected from men of his standing. One must add that this is not really a convincing premise for a compelling novel of today. Especially since it is hardly shocking news to anyone who has spent any time within the confinements of an university that academics are conceited, wilfully deceitful, hungry for money and power and driven by the same shady motivations as the rest of the world. Frayn seems to imply that there actually is something of interest beyond these less noble instincts, a hunger for meaning and coherence that naturally cannot be saturated. So be it, but it is for the genuinly farcical moments that one should read Headlong, not for its depth. So be warned, great literature it is not, but great fun nevertheless."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"If one can see past the esoteric, self-indulgent topic, Michael Frayn's book is a great deal of fun. Frayn brings his playwright's skill for quick wit to the book, along with an erudition about art history that is refreshing. I certainly grew more excited abou tthe fate of the painting as the book progressed, and in the end learned a great deal about Nederlandish art and politics in the 16th Century. Obscure? Maybe. Pedantic? Perhaps. Entertaining, insighful and, most importantly, educating? Certainly.Don't bother with the readers who are put off by a smart book without obvious references. It would be your loss to take their word for it."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This clever, broad comedy had me stifling belly laughs every day on the train, as I commuted into the city and read. I loved &quot;Noises Off&quot;, and this book has a bit of the same complicated, overwrought planning and fumbling, misinterpreted intentions, cleverness gone totally stupid, the destruction of pride that comes from tryong too hard to protect one's pride."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn's &quot;Headong&quot; an astonishing feat. The chapters about Bruegel and his times are, just in themselves, riveting. I shudderingly read Motley as an undergraduate, when I hadn't heard of Bruegel; but, I confess, in my adult years it never occurred to me to put that painter together with those hideous events. This goes with my having attended mainly to paintings by him that I could read as cheerfully sardonic records of peasant life. After &quot;Headlong&quot; I shall l have to look again, much harder and more warily. The questions about what Bruegel was up to, who protected him, how he survived, and how his paintings figured in all of this - Frayn makes these grippingly exciting, a self-contained thriller within the novel. He does a beautiful job of feeding it into Martin's adventure, through the question of what details in Tony's picture will settle that it's by Breugel. (We are to suppose, I suppose, that Martin hasn't the skill to settle it by brush-strokes and the like.) The initial description of the painting made it seem perfectly real; but by the end of the book it was almost painfully real, because of what we don't know about it as well as because of what we do. It is literally true that I have several times caught myself thinking &quot;I ache to know whether the man's head was tied between his legs&quot;. No other book has had quite that effect on me. Frayn's handling of the campaign to get Tony's picture is wonderful fun: the descriptions of situations and relationships and landscapes in terms of Bruegel paintings; the brilliantly funny uses of Lenin's Who-whom? idea; the theory (as it seems to be) about the dominant role of silence in marriage.... It's a superlatively rich and various book, and an amazing tour de force. On the surface and in the centre there is a kind of farce; some of one character's actions are motivated by things he learns from the art-history books; and then those learnings penetrate the farce in all sorts of other ways as well, and give the whole thing a permeating darkness and sadness through all the fun. In its deeply original way, it is also a highly unified book. The &quot;reviewers&quot; who deplored all the scholarship were presumably looking for a romp, not a novel."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is a novel in the tradition of The Name of the Rose. Frayn is clearly more interested in the history of Breugle (which is fascinating), than the concreteness of his characters. For me the historical content was so great that it almost completely made up for the blah characters. By the end I didn't feel like I really knew or identified with any of the characters, but I was incredibly interested in Breugle's art historical period. This book didn't make me want to read more by Frayn, but it did make me want to investigate art history."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"In his previous works, including the plays \\"Copenhagen\\" and \\"Noises Off\\" and the novel \\"The Trick of It,\\" Frayn has proved himself an expert at meshing two or more disparate genres into unique hybrids. With \\"Headlong,\\" he's done it again: merging satirical farce and historical mystery--the sort of novel P. G. Wodehouse and Umberto Eco might write together.The plot is nothing short of brilliant in conception and nearly perfect in execution. Martin Clay, a professor of philosophy, and his wife Kate, an art historian, have gone on a sabbatical at their country home. \\"We don't want to drive 100 miles out of London only to meet people who have driven 100 miles out of London to avoid meeting people like us.\\" (Frayn is a master of the quotable quip.) Martin has procrastinated writing a book on a topic that sidesteps a bit into his wife's field--both his delays and his turf-crossing are sources of tension between the two--but the couple soon encounter a new and imposing distraction: the neighbors. The initial meeting, a side-splittingly funny dinner between the frumpish academics and two not-so-bright members of the rural gentry (\\"My God, I've never met a philosopher before\\"), is as funny as anything Wodehouse ever penned.There's a catch to the dinner invitation: the neighbors have a few paintings that they'd like the two \\"experts\\" to examine, just to see if they just might be worth anything. The first is by an Italian artist named Giordano. (Here Frayn makes his first mistake: anyone who knows much about the art world will know instantly that this one's not as insignificant as the author wants you to believe.) The second and third seem to be unremarkable 17th-century Dutch canvases. After his wife leaves the room, Martin views the fourth painting and is convinced that it's the missing panel from the six ''Seasons'' paintings by the Flemish master Bruegel--a work that, if it exists, would be priceless and instantly famous.Now, there is absolutely no record of what this Bruegel might even look like, but that doesn't stop Martin from falling \\"headlong\\" into a comedy of errors. He embarks on a scheme to convince his wife (and himself) of the validity of his initial surmise and to \\"relieve\\" the owners of their possession in exchange for a small payment that is still high enough risk everything that Martin and Kate own. At this point, the farcical comedy turns intellectual mystery, as we read summaries of Martin's research on Bruegel's life and work, sixteenth-century Netherlands, the Inquisition, the Counter-Reformation, and more. Admittedly, some readers might find all these \\"facts\\" a drag on the story, but I think Frayn skillfully weaves the elements of the mystery and the historical detail with the themes of his satire and the various plot elements (including his depiction of the Clays' marriage). If you love history and art--even (or perhaps especially) if you don't know a thing about Bruegel--the payoff is especially keen.The only false note is the portrayal of Martin's wife. Although Martin himself is a buffoon--perhaps too much so--it's easy to visualize the type of stubborn, myopic know-it-all Frayn means to lampoon. Kate, however, is little more than a plot device--a compliant marshmallow who accommodates her husband's tomfoolery without offering much in the way of resistance. She's hard to imagine and impossible to believe, and if the author means to aim his barbs at a particular target, it's lost on me.Although the ending is a little more than predictable, it's still both hilarious and satisfying. But \\"Headlong\\" isn't a book you read simply for the unfolding of the plot and the solution to the mystery; instead, its main satisfaction is the cerebral stimulation offered by the author's adroitness at linking all the loose ends and the many disparate themes. And, after you're done, you'll probably want to buy a book on Dutch art history."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Headlong by Michael Frayn has everything I like. Comedy, chewy language, history, ideas and loads of momentum. This book just keeps on going to its literally smashing and satisfying climax. It is just what you'd expect from the playwright of Noises Off and Copenhagen.Martin Clay, the philsopher-turned-art historian who tells the story narrates in the first person present. He reports everything as he sees it and--even better--thinks it. Following along with Martin from elation to desperation, from clarity to confusion, from logical conlusion to its equally logically refutation keeps Headlong exciting. Even the pages on Netherlands history are exciting, made that way by the deft and breathless narration.Consider this tip as you read: pop into the library (or a bookstore-coffee bar) and have a look at book of Bruegel's paintings. You'll have a better appreciation of the artist in question and, in a way, be Martin's collaborator he works to uncover the mystery of the Merrymakers.Headlong is just that, an exciting rush of a book you will dive into and keep pursuing at full delight to the last page."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Part of this review includes some plot discloure so if you haven't read the book, don't read on. First, I gave the book 4 stars because I thought it was very well written and frequently funny.Here's what I didn't like so much about it. First, I hard a hard time dealing with the fact that fully 50% of the entire book consisted of a DETAILED exposition of 16th century Netherlandish political, social and artistic history. However, I'm perfectly willing to concede that my reluctance to plow through this part of the book (although I did) may be merely a function of my own intellectual laziness.More importantly however, I thought that the book had a significant plot flaw: The whole notion that Martin Clay would have some preferred right to sell (or purchase for himself) the 3 Dutch paintings if he could sell the Giordano was only in his mind. Martin and Tony had only one very brief discussion about this issue, and Tony didn't really agree to anything about it. Whatever other personal failings Tony may have had (and there appear to be many), the notion that he somehow breached his agreement with Martin by consigning the 3 Dutch paintings to a third party is clearly not one of them. To me, this was an obvious risk that Martin was taking the whole time, and if the author intended this to be some sort of &quot;plot twist&quot;, it certainly didn't strike me that way. Even if Tony knew that it was really the Dutch paintings Martin was after (and even this is not entirely clear), Tony absolutely never agreed to give Martin any sort of &quot;right of first refusal.&quot;In addition, I would suggest that Tony was NOT trying to pull a fast one on Martin, at least as to the Bruegel painting. While it was not clear whether or not Tony had any appreciaton of the value of the other two Dutch paintings, it appears clear that thought nothing of the Bruegel. Otherwise why would he have it stuffed in the fireplace?In short, I felt that the premise that Martin was operating under the whole book through--i.e. sale of the Giordano=possession and ownership of the Bruegel, was simply a false premise on Martin's part, and because this potential flaw turned out to be a real flaw, I view this as the author's fault. If I recognized this potential problem right away, I assume others did as well. Finally, I must say that I found the ending somewhat dissatisfying, at least as to the Bruegel, though not as to the other two Dutch paintings."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"If you are looking for a Dan Brown-eque thrilling archaic mystery page turner, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a solid novel with more depth than anything Dan Brown has ever written, you may find it here. If you are a fan of art history, you will simply love this book. It exemplifies what I find so fascinating about art history, the political, social, and religious goings on in the artist's world at the time the paintings are created, and how these things are reflected in the artist's work. This book slowly unravels a fascinating mystery, while learning about the intriguing art and life of Renaissance artist, Pieter Bruegel. Although not laugh-out-loud funny, the narrative is funny in that understated British way, that elicits at least one quiet smile per page. The slow burn of the plot intensifies until it explodes in the final chapter and ends as only it can.This book is a brilliant melding of comedy and tragedy and an in depth study of one fascinating Renaissance artist. Perhaps this book could be enhanced by giving it the Illustrated treatment that DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons have recieved recently, but there is plenty of Bruegel's works on display on the Internet for those who want to follow along with the protagonist's explorations and examinations. Better yet, couple this book with a comprehensive book of Bruegel's work, like Bruegel: The Complete Paintings, by Rose-Marie Hagen. Overall this book was slow-moving, alternately heart-warming and heart-wrenching, well researched, and ultimately satisfying."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Martin Clay is an academic who comes across a lost Bruegel painting at the home of his country neighbor. As the neighbor is unaware of what it is, Martin concocts a scheme to get possession of it for himself. This part of the plot is purely farcical, and frequently quite funny (Frayn is an extremely witty writer). However, cut into the plot are Martin's ruminations about the painting and its period of Dutch history, as he keeps vacillating about the authenticity of his find. These parts of the book are sometimes hard to follow and become monotonous after a while. Also, the plot has too many stops and starts, and you start to lose patience with it. More successful are the scenes involving Martin's marriage, and the psychological warfare with his wife, who is dead set against the scheme. I enjoyed enough of this book to recommend it, but hope that Frayn gets a different editor for his next one."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Frayn begins with a clever idea, but flogs it to death. The flashes of humor are obscured by not very well-presented minutiae of the political history of the age of Bruegel. Far more absorbing and provocative treatments of interactions of past and present include A.S. Byatt's POSSESSION and Graham Swift's great WATERLAND."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This book does have some lovely writing in it. There are moments when I thought, \\"ah, at last, this is going to get good\\" and then two pages later I was back to feeling bored and antsy. The writing is clever in some spots and very funny but overall, those bright spots just aren't enough.There are interesting moments such as the lessons given about art history but Frayn goes into them in far too much detail such that they become boring and tedious. The characters tend to do things which are unbelievable several times over and in the end, I only finished it because it was for my bookclub and I was the one who made the recommendation to begin with."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"One of my favorite books is An Instance of the Fingerpost, by Iain Pears. The Pears book is an historical mystery with many facets and a killer of an ending. Headlong traces the consequence of one unethical act, an act that results in destruction and loss, another killer ending. Martin Clay, the protagonist, is a philosopher by training who's a bit jealous of his wife, Kate, an art historian. Both are writing books, but his is beginning to bore him, and he'd like to finesse his wife. As he says several times, her field is iconography, whereas his is iconology. She is an interpreter of icons in art---those symbols artists use to instruct the untutored, but he is the scholar who integrates the whole, who sees not only the symbols, but what the symbols mean in the context of the work of art. In his own mind, Martin's better at what Kate does so ploddingly, never seeing the forest for the trees. Wanting to make a name for himself as the discoverer of a long-lost Bruegel/Brueghel painting, he abandons integrity and even toys with betraying his wife and their life together (they have a baby girl). The Clays have a home in the country to which they've repaired to write their respective books. They are looking forward to three months or more of relative peace and quiet, far from busy, noisy London and their Oswald Street flat. The local lord of the manor, Call-me-Tony Churt, however, seizes upon their knowledge of paintings and art history and asks them to evaluate several canvases he keeps in a cold, dirty, locked room. He needs to know how much hard cash they'll get him so he can fix up his dilapidated holdings. The paintings don't fall within either Martin or Kate's areas of expertise, but the dirtiest of all suddenly hits Martin with a coup de foudre, a clap of thunder. He's sure it's a Bruegel. Martin begins to make a pact with his internal devil, tempting himself with thoughts of money and fame much as the Devil tempted Faust. He goes over to the dark side and begins to craft a plan that will gratify his heart's desire, no matter what happens to his soul in the meantime. This is an enthralling read---I read it in one afternoon---what reviewers call \\"a page-turner\\"---and it will keep readers on the edge of their seats. Perhaps not all readers. This is a bookish novel, and if one is thrilled by the hunt of research into arcane areas and intrigued by intellectual pursuits that include the history of art as well as European history in general, this is definitely for that person. There are some tantalizing almost-sexy segments, but the joy of Headlong is the breathless following of Martin Clay's rapid spin into ultimate self-destruction, headlong, indeed. Some finely drawn minor characters---Kate, the suffering-in-silence neglected wife, the jug-eared art historian John Quiss, the beautiful and restless chainsmoking, gin-swilling Lady Churt, the brutal, charmless Tony, blueblood breeding gone to seed, surrounded by yapping hounds and living in a pit of a once-stately home---and, a truly fabulous creation lurking in the deep, dark shadows of his artistic masterpieces, the enigmatic figure of the little-known Netherlandish painter Bruegel, who may have been rather more than the quiet figure described by later historians of 16th-century Dutch paintings. What were the painter's convictions, and did he set them down deliberately for others to discover while imperiling his own life? Whether or not one buys into Frayn's conclusions, this is a masterly tour de force and highly recommended for those who appreciate literary fiction at its very best."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn's \\"Headlong\\" is a fun, funny tale of intrigue with the added kick of being a repository of \\"Northern Renaissance\\" art tidbits and curiousities. Reading this novel is akin to spending a weekend at a spirited seminar with very bright experts: One feels smarter for having been vastly entertained. This is a highbrow beach read with fun characters, settings, plot twists, and ironies."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Michael Frayn's &quot;Headlong&quot; is a heady thriller with a difference. It's exciting, exhilirating, yet incredibly intelligent and enduring. The novel begins on a deceptively quiet note as art historian Martin Clay retreats to the English countryside with his wife and baby daughter to finish his project on the study of nominalism. But fate quickly intervenes and we find ourselves plunging headlong with him into a journey of discovery of his own corrupt soul as he schemes to covet a painting he suspects to be the missing piece in a series of six by the great Flemish painter Peter Bruegel. The owners he attempts to wrest the prized treasure from are no angels, as we soon discover. The immorality of their mutual intent cancel each other out - they are a rotten bunch - so we find ourselves (shamefully) rooting for Martin as he rollercoasters his way through seemingly countless new obstacles that keep popping up from all sides to derail him. Fueled by a relentless nervous energy and the rush of adrenalin pumping through our veins, we ride with him as he negotiates each twist and turn to yield surprising results. The whole scheme is a farce. Martin knows it. So do we, but Frayn's genius lies in turning the farcical nature of the exploit to reveal a humour and a realism that is at once touching and ironic. Every impulsive tick or nuance experienced by Martin registers with us. Instantly. It's as if Martin is rendered skinless. Transparent. Significantly, Frayn's foray into 16th century Dutch art history isn't the pointless or impenetrable diversion some readers have made it out to be. I was intimidated at first but needlessly. It was friendly, absorbing and relevant. Frayn's prose is always sharp, witty, intelligent and accessible. &quot;Headlong&quot; should, in my opinion, have won the 1999 Booker Prize. Not that J.M. Coetzee's &quot;Disgrace&quot; wasn't a deserving winner. It's just that &quot;Headlong&quot; has that extra spark that should have tilted the balance. One of the best novels I have read in a long time. Don't miss it !"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Frayn tells an interesting if not particularly unusual human story, but the tone is uncertain and the apparatus that moves the story--the history and iconography surrounding Bruegel's masterpieces--alternately interests and bores. Much more effective use of history as revealing human personality has been made by other contemporary English novelists like Graham Swift in WATERLAND and A. S. Byatt in POSSESSION--both of which rate &quot;five stars.&quot;"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"The book is one very long art history lesson. A career's worth of history. Worthy of a PhD thesis. I just wanted a good read but the pedantic writer kept adding more and more and more history. As a consequence, the book plodded along like an overburdened carthorse. Eventually, it freed itself of the cart and galloped thankfully to the finish. Don't bother to read the book. Just visit an art museum and enjoy a Bruegel exhibit."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"A well-written book, but not for those with little prior knowledge of Dutch history and art!"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This is my first Frayn novel, which I bought after reading the recent profile of the author in The New Yorker. I feel ambivalent about it: I read through this quickly, and I'm encouraged to read other Frayn novels, yet I wouldn't recommend this one very strongly. Though I'm mainly a nonfiction reader, I found the endless digressions into the main character's researches mostly boring. The good: Frayn is a wonderfully fluent writer, and parts are quite funny. The book reaches a peak of humor about two thirds of the way through, when the comedy of errors reaches a ripe pitch, and it made me laugh out loud more than once. But the ending is way too Hollywood for me, shoot-'em-up and smash-'em-up, and I hate the fact that we never find out...! I won't say what, so as not to ruin the book for those who haven't read it yet. Those who have read it know what I'm talking about.I intend to try a couple of the author's other books. I wouldn't recommend starting on this one, although...(my ambivalence again) I'm not sorry I read it."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"I was given a copy of HEADLONG quite by chance and loved it. The often tedious relm of art history has never come alive quite like this before. Frayn's book combines a page turning detective novel about art with a cautionary morality play. The protagonist of the story ensnares himself in a tangled web of deceit that is almost impossible to escape. The many twists and turns of the first person plot are held together masterfully with a selfdepreciating ... humor that makes HEADLONG an absolute delight."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This story is hysterically funny. If I could force you to buy and read it, I would. If you liked &quot;..Dunces&quot;, you'll probably enjoy this. The other reviews go into what the story's about, so the only thing I'll add is that this was a fun read. It'd make a great movie too."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"There is nothing worse than squandered talent and skill. Unfortunately this novel is the poster child for self-indulgence and narcissism. Frayn is a fine playwright and I highly recommend Copenhagen, but this novel is an extended narrative on the author's desire to be an art critic/philosopher, replete with long discursive sections that neither reveal character or move the plot forward. Female characters are a sham and are so unbelievable as to break the willful suspension of disbelief. Of course with this noxious stew in place it is no surprise that Frayn was forced to breathlessly resolve the plot in 5 pages or else, not withstanding voluminous ruminations on art and philosophy that could be better read elsewhere. Like a previous reviewer, I'm off to the used bookstore to salvage what I can from this book. A major downer!"},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"This thing was very disappointing. To wit: the protagonist concocts a scheme to steal a valuable painting that involves--really just that, stealing it, no sophisticated confidence scam, etc. Instead, they guy (with the help of the victim's wife) puts it in the back of a truck and drives away with it as fast as he can with the victim chasing him--clever. Another thing I didn't like (and there were a lot) was the characters--dullards, each and every one of them, especially the guy's wife, from who he kept the scheme quiet for fear she would not believe him and who tried to foil his scheme by involving a friend and mutual art critic to look at the painting, then finally just tells him to go away, at the same time she gives him money to pursue the hair-brained scheme. Let's be clear: some very, very good novels are about very mundane, even repulsive things (e.g, david foster wallace's novel set in a half-way house) and just because a novel is &quot;about&quot; art and art criticism, doesn't make the book a work of art. In other words, it takes more than a high-brow setting to make a good novel. Usually one has to visit an airport to find a novel of this quality."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"For readers who fancy condescending and self-aggrandizing wit, this book could be a treat. It reeks of intellectual pride and sardonic misanthropy. It isn't only the characters who are unpleasant; to judge from the content and narrative tone, you wouldn't want to spend much time with the author, either."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"Having previously enjoyed Frayn's novel Spies, I thought I'd give him another whirl, and so picked up this earlier work of his. Alas, this is a book caught between two worlds: part of it wants to be a comic romp, and part of it wants to be an art history lesson. The combination is a rather clunky and sporadically enjoyable farce. Set in the English countryside (with occasional forays into London), the story is narrated by philosophy professor Martin, who has relocated to his country cottage for the summer with his art historian wife Julia and baby daughter Tilda. The plot kicks off when they meet their overbearing cliche of a country squire neighbor, who invites them to dinner at his deteriorating mansion.In his academic pursuits, Martin is currently veering away from philosophy and into his wife's realm, and when the neighbor asks him to look at some old paintings, the plot thickens. You see, Martin is convinced from a brief glance that a large soot-covered panel is actually a missing work of Bruegel (the 16th-century Flemish painter), one from a series titled \\"The Months\\" (of which five are extant). Frayn milks this conceit to the max, as Martin rushes too and fro in great secrecy, both attempting to ascertain the work's authenticity and provenance, as well as trying to come up with a con to \\"have it off\\" the insufferable neighbor. On the painting side, this involves lots of homework on the iconography and iconology of the work in question, which Frayn handles very clumsily. There is a lot of potted art history cobbled together from various sources, including recountings of the shifting academic debates on \\"The Months\\" series. This is all doubtless fascinating to art historians, as Martin recounts all manner of speculation about encoded portrayals of Spanish persecution in the 16th century and the issues of patronage. However, this all goes on at far greater length and detail than most readers will care for. Whenever the art history bits appear, the pace of the proceedings is inevitably ruined, as the light farce gets bogged down in arcana. It also doesn't help that one really needs to have reproductions of the paintings under discussion to look at while reading.The rest of the book is rather more entertaining, although like many such farces, Martin creates all kinds of unnecessarily extra complications for himself by trying to keep everything secret. There's a certain satisfaction to be gained from watching Martin flounder, since he's not a particularly sympathetic character. He's an average upper-middle class academic who sees in the painting his chance to score a few million and get his name in the history books. But he is constantly bedeviled by the uncertain authenticity of the painting and his own lack of funds to set up the sting of his neighbor. Other complications include the neighbor's flirty wife, the neighbor's sharp brother, and plenty of misadventures. It's all sort of funny, but also sort of pathetic to see Martin bumbling around in a cloud of delusional greed. Frayn is certainly adept at skewering types of characters and lifestyle, and his prose is certainly enjoyable, but it's an uneasy mix he's created here."},{"Title":"Headlong","review":"The first part of this novel made me laugh hard and often. The middle part of the novel seems preoccupied with art history which is interesting, but maybe a bit long. The last part of the novel is the big finale which has a lot of fireworks and twists, but I found it bit unsatisfying. With all that said, I'd say it's a good read."},{"Title":"WRESTLING WITH ANGELS conversations in modern theology","review":"The 104th Archbishop of Canterbury is a prolific speaker on the many subjects of Christianity, and in \\"Wrestling with Angels: Conversations in Modern Theology\\" his writings, long out of print and hard to find, are now collected and displayed in one easy tome for a new generation of readers. Focusing on his discussions with his contemporaries like Hegel, Barth, Bathasar, Adams, and others,\\"Wrestling with Angels: Conversations in Modern Theology\\" is a scholarly and informed compilation in modern philosophy and art, speaking on such topics as postmodernity, innocence, nature of historical development, and more. \\"Wrestling with Angels: Conversations in Modern Theology\\" is highly recommended for religious studies shelves and anyone who wants a deeper look into how today's modern philosophers think."},{"Title":"WRESTLING WITH ANGELS conversations in modern theology","review":"The book is a collection of fourteen previously published articles by Rowan Williams (perhaps better known as the Archbishop of Canterbury), commenting on various theologians from the past two centuries. Williams wrote these articles from the 1970s to the 1990s. It would seem that the editor wants readers to return to the original texts by the theologians to rethink their own interpretations and/or to evaluate Williams' insight. The collection carries the approval of Rowan Williams, proven by his introduction to the volume.The subject matter does not relate to one specific topic or even theme. It ranges from Negativism to Metaphysics and each chapter is thus a discussion on its own. It is beyond the scope of the review to comment on or summarise the book. The reviewer also frankly admits that he certainly does not regard himself qualified to express an opinion on validity of the arguments as set out in the various chapters. The chapters are basically in the form of critiques by Williams on the writings of the theologians, including Vladimir Lossky, Karl Barth, Simone Weil and Georg Hegel.The chapters largely contain subjective viewpoints from Williams on the various subjects. In many cases he expresses agreement with some of the viewpoints but also do not hesitate to differ from the authors. This reviewer, however, appreciates the way in which Williams treats the authors' works. He always shows the greatest respect for the author whose work he critiques. Although one can expect a religious person to display such an attitude, history has revealed that it is not necessarily always the case! Also, Williams continuously provides arguments for his viewpoints and although a reader does not have to agree with all his views and conclusions, at least there is sufficient explanation and groundwork for his arguments, supporting interpretation and evaluation.It is this reviewer's opinion that that is probably the objective and biggest benefit of the book. It provides literature-founded and/or scripture-based and proper arguments on various subjects that should interest scholars and researchers in modern times and lends itself to readers exploring the various arguments and approaches while forming their own conclusions on the subjects.Interestingly enough, many of the subjects, even though some are decades old, are still relevant in this day and age. A typical example will be chapter 8, dealing with war and the state. Although the writing largely revolves around the nuclear threat of the then Cold War, the arguments are relevant in today's scenarios where war continues to feature on most countries agendas, whether as participant, instigator, defendant or wary observer. Despite being written from a religious perspective, it will still be beneficial reading to anyone struggling with the concept of war as a human endeavour. Further subjects that this reviewer could easily relate to included politics and metaphysics (chapter 4), violence and society (chapter 9), realism (chapter 12) and evil (chapter 13). Moving closer to a more philosophical perspective, subjects like \\"being\\" (chapter 6), the existence of god (chapter 11) and to know oneself as part of humankind (chapter 10) are discussed. The book is obviously religious in nature, but deals with philosophers like Freud and other non-religious thinkers on equal foot, incorporating relevant thinking from any source where it can contribute to the discussion.This reviewer found the book highly intellectual and challenging to read and understand. This is no book to read while relaxing just before falling asleep! As a matter of fact, this reviewer had to sit at a desk with pencil and highlighter to even start to grasp the content! Rowan Williams is an intelligent man with a passion for his cause. He must read and study and think continuously to be able to function at the level and capacity to produce writings of this stature. This reviewer confesses that he has not read any of the text that Williams deals with in the book and that is definitely a problem when reading the book. It is clear from Williams' writing style that he expects the reader to be knowledgeable about the theologians he engages with in his essays. With some effort and concentration a reader will be able to understand the context of the writing without having read the original author's work, but one certainly sacrifices some insight in such a case.One definite conclusion for this reviewer was that Rowan Williams has a surprisingly practical approach to many of the subjects. While many of the authors he critiques, deals with a subject at a philosophical level (admittedly, many of the subjects are philosophical), Williams discusses it in such a way that it is possible to relate to it in a practical way, as one can encounter it in your normal day-to-day living. The following quote from the book confirms this observation: \\"Part of the task of a good theology and of a candid religious philosophy is, I believe, to reacquaint us with our materiality and mortality.\\" (p.271). Williams has proven this statement throughout the book, an approach admired by this reviewer.It is from personal experience, therefore, that this reviewer recommends this book only to serious scholars either of any of the specific authors dealt with in the publication or else of theology in general. Any reader should be prepared to read further and wider when selecting this book as reading material. The book is written by an intellectual for intellectuals (irrespective of how you define \`intellectual'!). Although this reviewer acknowledges that he has learned a lot while reading the book, he has certainly not enjoyed the reading journey!The book is well edited and has a catching cover illustration. It contains introductions from both the author and the editor. It is largely an academic book and complies with academic standards in that it contains full references and bibliographies to referenced works. It also has a useful index reflecting the main authors and individuals dealt with in the chapters. This reviewer found the binding to be not reader-friendly. It is a typical paperback binding and given the thickness of the book will not survive serious use and this book should be able to be left open and available while referencing another source. Its current binding does not lend itself to such treatment and a hard cover, stitched binding would have been more appropriate. Given the stature of the book, it is probably also warranted."},{"Title":"Call and Response: The Challenge of Christian Life (Call & Response)","review":"Werner Jeanrond's book, 'Call and Response: The Challenge of Christian Life' is a little known work by a little known theologian. Often as is the case, it is this obscure work that has made a profound impact on my personal theological development.Back when I was discerning my call (or rather, trying to discern if I had a call) to ministry, there were many obstacles thrown up (some circumstantial, some deliberate) which caused me to reflect on the nature of what a call is. For starters, I tend to stay away from \`call' language, as I believe everyone is called to something, and a call to ministry is not necessarily more important (and indeed, can often be less important) than a call to be a teacher or doctor or engineer, or the call to be a good parent or good neighbour, etc. Jeanrond helped me to put into words some of my doubts and frustrations with current practice in churches, and current language of vocation.He begins by identifying that Christianity (as indeed many religions) is in crisis. It is harder, he says, to reconcile the experiences of ancient forms of religious organisation or ancient ritualistic practices with the ordinary life as mature adults in today's society. However, this is not to say that society is anti-religious.'It would be wrong to diagnose a foundational hostility to religion in today's intellectual climate. What is, however, true is that the intellectual climate in the West harbours a fundamental suspicion of any form of dogmatism and institutionalism.'He gave me insight into the nature of ministry:'All too often priests and even theologians are considered to be a sort of professional Christian, paid to be Christian so as to assure that the non-paid Christians be saved.'In calling for a more cooperative form of organisation and ministerial outlook, one that embraces the call of all to be workers for justice and compassion, Jeanrond voices some of the same concerns as Bill Countryman in his book on the priesthood of all believers (see my review on that, too, posted 4/1/00).We are called by God to join in the work of creation and sustenance of justice and mercy.'The belief in God's concern for this world tends to promote more of an appreciation of a communal effort, both to protect this world from extinction and to make it better in response to God's call according to which all of us ought to become co-creators of his project.'Jeanrond calls for a radical shift in the way that communities view themselves, and to lessen the divisive characters, to spread the idea of authority out across ever-widening circles which hold each other in check and cooperation. So long as one group (i.e., the clergy) have authority over another (i.e., the laity) there will be a skewing of the radical equality we all share before God.Jeanrond echoes many theologians past and present when calling for continuing interpretation of the Gospel message.'The gospel must be interpreted anew in every generation and context. Such interpretation will always be pluralistic by nature of the different perspectives and contexts of the interpreters.'Jeanrond, while calling for more cooperation and community (communion), warns against simplistic ideas of ecumenism, particularly the kind of ecumenism that happens in committee rooms and conferences but fails to involve the actual people of the churches for whom these leadership groups claim to act. Without the consent of the people, the efforts will fail, probably damaging the mothering institutions in the process.Werner Jeanrond, having taught at Trinity College Dublin and the University of Lund, is a bit outside common theological circles, which is unfortunate, as his writing is crisp and clear. He does not introduce obscure or \`patented' terminology, but rather embraces common language as the vehicle for remarkably simple yet meaningful thoughts.This is not a long book. But it is important. It is on my regular re-read list. It is a compassionate critique of the current state of religion, and hopefully a voice that will be heard."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"It's been said that what Elmore Leonard (\\"Freaky Deaky,\\" \\"Get Shorty,\\" etc.) did for crime novels in urban environments, Ross Thomas did for crime novels in suburban environments. Thomas' novels aren't so much gritty as they are witty, and less about openly violent crimes as about deep corruption beneath the veneer of civilization.\\"The Fools in Town Are On Our Side\\" is one of the best Thomas novels. It's really about three or four stories all wrapped together. The stories all happen to be about the narrator, Lucifer C. Dye. Dye was born in Montana, but spent his childhood in Shanghai, China, before and during World War II. Story No. 1 is about how he came to be raised by a Russian-born madam running Shanghai's top brothel. Story No. 2 is about how Dye came to be the youngest Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, largely on the strength of his perfectly fluent Mandarin (Chinese), and his subsequent recruitment into a government intelligence program. Story No. 3 is about how he got booted out of the program. And Story No. 4 is the main story, wherein he is offered $50,000 (it was worth a lot more back in 1970 when the book was written) to help \\"corrupt\\" a town, the idea being that in order to get the townspeople to vote for a reform slate, they have to be really fed up with corruption. That requires making things far worse so people see how bad the corruption is.Of course, Thomas does not tell the stories in that sequence. Instead, they're all mixed together, which ordinarily I find annoying, but each story is so interesting that the technique works here.There's a little bit of violence, but for the most part, the book is really about intrigue, double-dealings, and so forth. If you've never read anything by Ross Thomas, this is a great introduction."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"At eight years of age, Lucifer Dye could \\"shill a crap game, pimp for a whore house, speak six or seven languages, roll drunks, and hustle the rubes,\\" but could neither read nor write.Dye is the central character in \\"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side\\" (1970) by Ross Thomas.It is a complex, unique, compulsively entertaining small town corruption novel.After Dye completes his education on a \\"scholarship\\" granted by a clandestine government agency he is employed by the agency, Section Two. And, he is told, \\"There is no Section One.\\"After being unceremoniously dumped by the outfit, he is hired by Victor Orcutt to corrupt the corrupt in a Gulf Coast city.Myriad scalawags abound, chicanery is the order of the day and abundant deceptions are trump cards, as a cast of sharp, unforgettable characters are manipulated by Dye, Orcutt and two associates.There is never a dull moment in the absorbing narrative.The \\"heroes\\" are tarnished and shady, and not much better than their adversaries.The novels of Ross Thomas are fascinating and impossible to put down.Out of print for nearly a decade, several of his works are being reissued by St. Martin's Press. Do yourself a favor---pick one up and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"Victor Orcutt of Victor Orcutt Associates has discovered an ingenious way of earning large amounts of money. If a community becomes disgusted with rampant corruption in the ranks of its civic leaders, Victor will come in and clean things up. But Victor has found that before bad government can be reformed it has to first become even more corrupt. When the good citizens of Swankerton, a southern gulfcoast city, hire his firm to rid them of their thoroughly corrupt municipal government, he in turn hires Lucifer Dye to carry out the task of making the corruption worse.Who is Lucifer Dye? Why he's the novel's protagonist and first person narrator. Born in Montana and raised in Japanese occupied Shanghai, Lucifer's biography is an exceedingly interesting one. For the past decade he has been a spy stationed in Hong Kong.When the ultra-secretive intelligence agency he works for abruptly hands him his walking papers, Victor Orcutt is right there to provide employment for him on the Swankerton project.Lucifer's much anticipated work in Swankerton really doesn't get underway until the second half of The Fools in Town Are on Our Side. The first half of the book is largely about Lucifer's early life and his later tenure as an intelligence agent. Subjects which are both amazingly interesting to read about.This book deserves a 5 star rating for a number of reasons. The narrative is extremely compelling and substantial. There's lots of action including several instances of sudden, shocking violence. As in all Ross Thomas novels, almost all of the characters are imbued with cynical attitudes that are finely honed. In fact, the degree of cynicism found in the pages of this novel is a delight to behold and is probably its most engaging characteristic.The Fools in Town Are on Our Side is one of the author's best efforts. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"Being a voracious reader - and particularly loving books from the suspense and thriller genres - I can't believe that I've missed Ross Thomas until now! But, now that I've found him, I can't wait to read his other books.For those of you who like your characters fully fleshed out; who enjoy complex plots and intricate stories; who like your good guys with flaws and your bad guys flouted in the end - this book is for you. It reminds me of some of the early books from Thomas Perry - particularly \\"Metzger's Dog\\".Take the title of the book: \\"The fools in town are on our side\\" - it comes from Mark Twain's book about Huck Fin who says to Big Jim that, if the fools in town are on our side, pretty much we've got the whole town on our side - I'm paraphrasing.Our hero - one Lucifer C. Dye - was born in the US, orphaned in Shanghai pre-WWII, and raised in a Whore House run by an escapee \\"White Russian\\" - Lucifer's Tante Katerina - and peopled by a \\"United Nations\\" of survivor ladies! In essence, the skills that Dye acquires here, later in the Shanghai prison, on the ship back to the US, in various schools to round out his education, and later in the \\"intelligence business\\" all blend to create a thoroughly fascinating character. As some other Reviewer has written, this book really weaves together 4 different stories into one cohesive whole. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"THE FOOLS IN TOWN ARE ON OUR SIDE is an amazing piece of writing. The late Ross Thomas not only carved out one of the best thrillers in print but he did so with interesting, unforgetable characters and in an entertaining style and spot on dialogue that make the pages fly. No hack writing here, just a nicely entangled plot, sleazy bad and good guys, and the kind of corruption in secret government agencies that make you wonder if there are any good guys out there without dangerous agendas.I read this when it was new on the book shelves and having just re-read it again I'm still nodding and smiling. Talent transcends time.Ross Thomas was one of those unique writers (I hate to say 'gifted' because he worked hard at it so any 'gift' was the result of his efforts and a present for the rest of us). Thomas left us with a wonderful list of stories and none better than this one.By the way, I hate it when reviewers tell you too much about a book before you read it, at times giving away the plot...'and then he kills so and so because of such and such because he or she isn't really who you think they are, and oh yeah, did I mention that he dies?'Buying a book should be like buying a new pair of shoes. This book is a thriller. You already like the style so try it on and see just how comfortable it fits."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"Not a classic \\"mystery novel\\" but a close cousin to that. Different, interesting - got me in the so-good-I-hate-to-finish mode. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"As a mystery writer myself, I have a list of my own favorites from whom I learn. No one does it better than Ross Thomas -- a writer's writer."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"When i read the plot line for this book, I bought it just to see what it was really about. The author holds the story together well and the surprises are believable."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"I just finished this, my first Ross Thomas book. It is just incredible. His writing is evocative of character, place, complexity and conflict, in as few words as possible. I found myself rereading lines in order to grasp their full impact. The underlying clear vision of the writer is impressive as well.All with an underlying passion and self-deprecating humor. I loved every single moment of it."},{"Title":"The Fools in Town Are on Our Side","review":"I would say this is a finely crafted novel. It was a great story with great characters and plot. What could be better? Shanghai, San Francisco, Great stuff."},{"Title":"Eyes","review":"A woman with a very checkered past thinks things are finally going her way. She has straightened out and dried out and in a good relationship. He is rich, she is pregnant and they are about to be married. Who cares if his family is against it? But then tragedy strikes as he is killed. His family takes all of her stuff and locks her out. To make things worse, news of his death causes her to lose the baby. But one small ray of hope does shine as she finds out she has some money he set aside for the baby. With that money she can follow her heart to try and track down what is left of him; his donated organs.If she can get pregnant by one of the organ recipients, she feels she will have recaptured a part of him. But what happens when a prospect doesn't pan out? Slowly she sinks into deeper madness as she begins to run out of donors. Then she learns of a child fathered by one of the recipients after he received the transplant. If she can't have a baby of her own she just mike take someone else's.A pretty good suspense tale. The plot moves around amongst the main characters as they are slowly drawn together. But I want to know just how crazy the events are. As readers, we get to hear the commands and ideas from the dead. It is never resolved whether this is real or imagined. If real, then the book takes on a more sinister tone. If not, then it is still pretty good. A lot of action happens off camera and it is up to the reader's imagination to supply the details. In the end the story works well."},{"Title":"Teaching Stories","review":"What needs to happen in our schools to make today's students humane, engaged, confident about themselves and tolerant of each other? The experts throw up their hands. They should simply ask a superb teacher or, better yet, read Judy Logan's TEACHING STORIES. Logan worked for 35 years in some of the most challenging school settings in San Francisco. She created a multi-cultural, gender-neutral or &quot;gender-enhancing&quot;, student-centered classroom where &quot;no&quot; becomes &quot;yes&quot; and students take responsibility for themselves, each other, and their school. Rarely do we read books in which we seek to learn that also move us to tears and laughter. TEACHING STORIES does all that and more; it is for teachers, parents and all citizens concerned about the next generation. I can't wait for Logan's sequel."},{"Title":"Teaching Stories","review":"If you're a pre-service or new teacher this book will spur you on. If you're a veteran, it may fan your passion and make you remember why you wanted to teach in the first place. The first story alone, on making a quilt, was worth much more than the price of the book in the many valuable lessons it taught me. If you are a teacher, read this book. If you know someone who wants to be a teacher, buy them this book."},{"Title":"Teaching Stories","review":"I first read this book without knowing much about it, completely inspired by the events of the book and continuously thinking of how to be a better teacher in my own classroom.I gushed about the book to my husband, he takes the book, looks at it, and says \\"I was in that class.\\" HE had a very different view. He was actually able to recall the projects, and people Mrs. Logan talked about in the book and linked them all except for one girl (the dancer) to an upper-middle class area in San Francisco in the GATE program. He was in the same GATE program, but came from a crowded one room apartment in the Mission District. Mrs. Logan, he said, had a tendency to not pay attention to the working class kids in her GATE class, whether she realized it or not.As a fictional story, this is a wonderful, moving, compassionate story of a teacher in an inner city school, and if inspires someone to become a better teacher, then \\"bravo.\\" I think we should all strive to be our own Mrs. Logan, regardless of how our own stories truly play out. This book has also made me realize as an educator, you should always take a step back and look at yourself as a teacher and see if you're becoming the person you want to be for your children."},{"Title":"Teaching Stories","review":"I am a teacher educator and a former middle school teacher and I am completely taken and inspired by Teaching Stories. Logan's experiences with middle school students and her remarkable insights into pre-adolescent development provide the reader with a joy-filled reading experience.

It is a significant contribution for anyone interested in teaching- at any level!"},{"Title":"Teaching Stories","review":"I was assigned to read this waste of paper for not one, but two graduate school classes. I even met Mrs. Logan and wondered how this women actually survived a real classroom where you are actually accountable for your actions.I am a sucessful educator. I know that my students enjoy coming to my class everyday. Beyond that, they actually learn in my class. Not fluffy, feeling things, but true American history. My students do not spend each day writing stories and looking at fluffy clouds getting in touch with their inner children, but learning about the New Deal or the causes of the Spanish American War.Mrs. Logan's students seem to spend all of their time sewing quilts. That is fine, but teachers in the real world have a curriculum to follow. She may dislike the &quot;big bad tests&quot;, but that is too bad. They are a fact of life in schools across America- my principal expects me to prepare the student for those tests. I would love to ask Logan's students questions to see if they know who JFK, FDR or Rockefeller are, but at least they know how to make quilts.She advises new teachers to abondon the material you should be teachers to just &quot;chat&quot; with your students. Hmm, is that why so many kids can barely read, forget about writing a resume or balancing a checkbook.She also favors getting to know your students on a personal level. I love my students, but am fine with the fact that we part ways at 3 pm each day. She goes for ice cream with them and visits them at home. The parents must love that.The most appalling of these little vignettes includes an episode where a 13 year old student had her first menstual period. Mrs. Logan, ever the fluffy sensitive teacher, throws the girl a special party. Is that not crossing the line? Is that even acceptable in any school in America? Not on Long Island!This is not a book for serious educators. This is recommended by school of education professors who have no idea what it means to be a teacher!"},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"Roy Neubergers book is part biographical, part inspirational tome and part road map for those seeking the way back to their Jewish roots. The author nicely weaves a long series of spiritual short stories in his book as he makes his way from living a secular life in the suburbs, to a spiritual life based on the timeless truths of Judaism as written in the Torah. The authors enthusiam for his subject really shines through as does his hope for anybody seeking genuine fulfillment in life. One comes away thinking that coincidence is often G-d's way of trying to tell us something. The book is truly inspiring in that the author is able to convey his sense of mission to help others return to their Jewish roots without being overbearing. A marvelous and easy book to read that tugs at the mind, the heart, and sometimes the funny bone too!"},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"Rabbi Paysach Krohn, a world renowned speaker, questions the meaning of the words Baal Teshuva. He rejects the accepted translation of someone who has returned, because that infers there was something that the BT is coming back to. In many cases he was never there in the beginning. Rabbi Krohn suggests Baal Teshuva as one who has the answer, similar to the word Teshuvos, used in responsa written by prominent rabbis. Roy and Linda (no longer their real names) certainly have found the answer to what life is all about. They concur with the Bobover Rebbe's (OBM) comment about the problems in America. He said that we (the Jewish way of life) have the answers to the drug problem, the crime problem, the teen pregnancy problem etc, and no one wants to listen. Yisroel and Leah have found the answers - and their children, grandchildren, and the many others they have come into contact with and have helped, are witnesses to that undeniable fact. They, in addition, are the Baal, or master, of such a definition. They have not only come full circle, but have committed themselves to go all out in helping others in their search for answers. From Central Park to Sinai was enjoyable, very readable, and a page turner. You won't be able to stop until you finish it. I recommend it not only for BT's but even FFB's"},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"This was a heartfelt story of a mensch who was dissatisfied with the lack of spirituality in bland liberal universalist culture in which he was raised. Eventually, he found true joy in Jewish orthodoxy. However, if you're pondering deep metaphysical issues, you'll find assertions here, but not deep abstract notions of different \\"isms\\" and why they are true or not. I was also uncomfortable with the assertion that Jewish assimilation caused the Holocaust."},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"During the first third of the book, I almost gave up on it several times. The writing is... frantic, shouting. But maybe that's how the author really was at that time in his soul-search. After he and his wife meet Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis, he calms down and becomes truly descriptive and, ultimately, very inspiring. All in all, I do highly recommend the book for any of us still in need of more revelation."},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"A Jewish friend of mine recommended this book to me. Although not Jewish myself, I had long wondered about the &quot;hidden&quot; (at least to me) lifestyle of observant Jews.

Anyone of any religion (or none at all) who is interested in modern spirituality and ways to attain it ought to enjoy and be inspired by this book."},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"Roy Neuberger takes us on a fantastic spiritual voyage. From the asssimilated and financially upperclass of the social elite of New York to his final destination of serene tranquility in the Jewish religion of his heritage. The heartwarming story makes us realize that with enough honest introspection, we can all make our lives more fulfilling and meaningful. The tale reaffirms the belief that no matter how estranged from Judaism one has strayed the path of return is always available and fulfilling.The book is a must read for those of the Jewish faith as well as to those of any other faith."},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"To say that Roy Neuberger's book entitled \\"From Central Park to Sinai\\" was a real page turner, is a definite understatement. This most engrossing and captivating book details the story of a personal transformation of a man searching for spiritual meaning and purpose in his life. The grandson of a great rabbi and founder of the \\"Mussar\\" movement in Judaism, Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, Roy Neuberger's life couldn't be further apart from that of his grandfather. Educated in the traditions of ethical culturalism, Mr. Neuberger felt an ever present spiritual vacuum in his life and as such he embarked on a personal quest for truth, via the study of Catholicism, Protestantism and a whole host of other religions and value systems. He even wrote a book detailing why these other religions and their credos were superior to that of Judaism and why Judaism held no meaning.Accompanying Mr. Neuberger on his trajectory towards spiritual fulfillment was that of his beloved wife, Linda, also a student of ethical culturalism. The fear and uncertainty that plagued Mr. Neuberger throughout his life could be simply termed as a man living through a perpetual anxiety attack with no relief in sight.It would seem that G-d heard the inner cry and pain of Mr. Neuberger, and as destiny would have it, he was guided in the direction of Rebbetzen Esther Jungreis. That night in Neuburgh, NY changed the course of an entire generation of Neubergers. Mr. Neuberger was deeply impressed with Rebbetzen Jungreis' Torah message and he began to attend her classes on a weekly basis, despite the hardship of traveling such a long distance during a fuel crisis. Rebbetzen Jungreis served as a conduit to bring the message of G-d's love and compassion to a man who hungered and thirsted for spiritual guidance and meaning. In essence, Mr. Neuberger began to fall in love with G-d, embracing His Torah and commandments.Since that time, Mr. Neuberger and his wife have raised a beautiful family steeped in Torah values and has spread his joy and understanding of spiritual truth with hundreds of people who he has invited to his home to enjoy the uplifting experience of Shabbos.Mr. Neuberger's story will not only inspire, but will captivate the heart and soul of the reader. It is a must read for anyone searching for guidance and truth and even for those who are not searching for anything in particular. It is a welcome addition to any library and will remain within the recesses of the soul for posterity."},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"Roy Neuberger's journey to find himself is extremely inspiring. It goes to show you that a man can have all the money in the world,but without a some spiritual guidance, what is he really living for? In some ways his wealthy background was a great hinderance to him. His parents did not give Roy all the proper attention and guidance as the Ethical Cultural Schools merely confused his thinking.Finally after 31 years, a colleague woke him up to the fact that he is a Jew whether he realizes it or not. Mr. Neuberger finally realized that he was not giving his own heritage a chance. Finally he asked to visit a synagogue with a friend and it so happened the Rebbetzin Jungeris was speaking there that night. At that point a chain reaction fo events triggered in Mr. Neuberger's brain that this was answer he was looking for.The rest of the book consists of many powerful miracles based on prayer and faith in G_d. Although many of the stories are repeated from Esther Jungeris' The Committed Life, it is still a pleasure read about people turning their lives around by believing the Power of the Jewish Religion. Judaism encourages its followers to be strong and persist towards acheiving happiness and overcoming obstacles.This book will make you believe in miracles even if you are not Jewish. An inspiration to us all."},{"Title":"From Central Park to Sinai: How I Found My Jewish Soul","review":"A warm personal account of the author's search for answers to the most basic questions. Born into a convention and comfortable life, Roy Neuberger discovered that everything was not enough. His strong academic background and inquisitive mind led him through a series of &quot;-ism&quot;s until he returned to that of his forefathers. The reader is drawn into his search. The open, direct, and almost intimate style of the book makes the reader feel more like a participant than an observer.

The main characters tend to be cheerful and optimistic while handling life's ups and downs. Very inspiring to a pessimist like myself.Although The Glass Lake is my favorite Binchy novel so far, this ranks as one of the better ones. But even bad Binchy, like the disappointing Scarlet Feather, is better than most mass produced paperback romances -- or \\"Oprah\\" selections, for that matter! I did think the ending was quite abrupt, but other than that, it was enjoyable, and as always, sad to leave the characters behind :("},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"For those of you who read these mixed reviews, do not give up on &quot;Echos&quot;! A fan of Maeve Binchy's works, I enjoyed this book. The landscape, the language, the people are very tangible in all of her works. Maeve Binchy writes about people living in Ireland with such color that you feel as if you know each place intimately by the completion of a book.Sometimes life is not what you expect. But just as people have hopes and dreams, each person has a story to tell. At times this book gives a melancholy tone, much like the sea-side town it takes place in. The overall story is as real and beautiful as life can be."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Another wonderful story by Maeve, a powerful storyteller. I can picture Castlebay in my mind's eye as if I just returned from a summer vacation there. I felt that I was not finished when I turned the last page. Maeve left the future of Clare and David to the reader's imagination. This is my third book by Maeve, and I am reading Evening Class next!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"ECHOES was my first exposure to Maeve Binchy, and I was not disappointed. It is the timeworn tale of the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who wins the love of the wealthy boy. But it doesn't necessarily end happily ever after, and for that it's a step above your run-of-the-mill romance novel.Binchy's enchanting depiction of Ireland in the \`50s and \`60s and her loving characterizations warmly send the reader into that time and place. It was a treat for me every evening to come home from working in the corporate frenzy of the new millennium to return to that simpler time. Nothing too terribly shocking or powerful, not a whole lot to contemplate when you reach the end, just a welcome respite for a few hundred pages.If, as many reviewers here have suggested, ECHOES is not Maeve Binchy's best work, then I find myself very fortunate to be able to work my way through her catalog."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the only Maeve Binchy book that I had not read. Once again, I was not disapointed. It took a while to get into, but once I did, I found it impossible to put down. The charecters and their problems are extremely well devleoped, and I loved Claire's spirit and determination. By the end of this book, all of the charecheters had learned something very valuable, and they all had the courage and grace to continue with their lives. This book reminded me of &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; in many small ways, and also a little of &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; in places. I highly recomend &quot;Echoes&quot;, but give it time to develop throughout the pages."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"In 'Echoes', Maeve Binchy has created a masterpiece, chronicling principally the lives of the two protagonists, Clare and David. They are two children growing up under the watchful eye of Castlebay, the sleepy Irish seaside resort where they live. The small-town mentality dictates who one can and cannot associate with: in other words, Clare from the huckster's shop and David the doctor's son can never be compatible. However, Dublin, and the lure of education, takes the two away from home and here, on neutral ground, they discover a mutual admiration and respect of the kind neither has ever known before. However, as their lives get drawn closer and closer together, they also realise that there is no escaping from Castlebay and their roots.Binchy's characters are extremely realistic, from the determined Clare to the passive David. What makes the book so eminently readable, however, is the league of supporting characters she creates, such as Angela, the supportive teacher struggling to keep a secret of her own from the prying eyes of the town, to Gerry Doyle, a man whose passions are too great to be contained within the confines of a small Irish town.The authress has a gossipy, chatty style that almost lulls you into believing that, far from reading a book, you are actually having an enthralling conversation with a close friend.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in life, love, or gossip."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the second novel that I have read by this author. I first read Circle of Friends and absolutely loved it. You can't help but get caught up in the characters and their stories. Maive Binchy is a wonderful story-teller. It's a catch-22 with her books...I can't put the book down, yet dread finishing it. Although the plot took some sad (and/or awkward) turns, Claire O'Brien is an unsung hero wise beyond her years."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy is a skilled storyteller with a strong career behind her (and hopefully before her). Her subject is always Irish life, but her earlier books are more of a retrospective on growing up in Ireland in the 1950s or 1960s. The Ireland of that time was a far more provincial, tradition-bound place than the cosmopolitan Celtic Tiger of today. People stayed where they were brought up, and were expected to take after their families, for better or worse. If you were the son of the town drunkard, his was your lot. If you were the son of the town doctor, you were at the top of the Irish food chain (as opposed to the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, who were another thing altogether), and medicine was your expected profession. If you were a daughter rather than a son, husband and children were your destiny, with your status determined by your mate's.Such is the world that Clare and David were born into in Castlebay. Clare's parents are shopkeepers in this summer resort town, relying on the tourists to keep them afloat. David's father is the doctor, and he goes to a boarding school rather than the parochial school in the village like Clare and the other children. Clare is very bright, and fortunately has a champion at the school in the form of Angela O'Hara, a lay teacher at the school. Miss O'Hara is herself the daughter of the town drunk who was able to get an education despite her community's expectations. Clare and David both go to University: \\"the\\" University in their world, University College, Dublin, and not unexpectedly from the reader's point of view, fall in love.Echoes is a less satisfactory story than Binchy'sCircle of Friends, which is set in the same period and has a similar theme. The ending is unresolved and the message is mixed. The village characters aren't as well rounded, and characters seem to make stupid decisions for (to me) poorly grounded reasons. I enjoy the retrospective Binchy stories as much as her contemporary ones, but this one isn't the pick of the bunch."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I've read almost all of Binchey's novels and this is one of her best. She is very skilled at creating numerous characters and somehow managing to intertwine their stories. This is evident here, with the main characters being Claire and David who are from the same town of Castlebay but from distinctly different upbringings. To put it simply, Claire was raised poor to a family that works round the clock in their little shop, and David comes from money with a doctor as a father. They discover love while in college, as Claire is very bright and won several scholarships to school and David is studying to be a doctor. When Claire discovers she is pregnant, their lives change forever. They believe love will overcome everything in their way, which is a great concept but idealistic. The reality is that being married with a newborn baby can be mundane and demanding.I especially like this book because I can relate to Claire--I did not marry until I was 29 (although Claire is much younger), but I had gone to school for a masters and owned my own home. I decided to be a stay at home mom because my mother always worked and I always felt this void when I was younger. While I love being home with my children, at times I have felt \\"there has to be more than this!\\" Being married and home with children can be hard for someone who has struggled to be independent, and Claire finds herself in this position as she gives everything up while David continues to do what he loves. The end of the book is tragic but believable and no one could have told this story better than Binchey."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Let's get this straight -- Echoes does not end with all of the plot strings tied up in a happy bow. In a way it echoes life itself. Plans go astray, promises are broken, moments of greatness are reached and the story keeps going.Binchy does an excellent job making the reader care about Claire, the spunky scholarship girl with dreams beyond her tiny seaside hometown. You cheer her on through her academic victories, laugh and cry with her at the cast of small town characters and urge her to fall in love with David, the Doctor's perfect son.Because Claire's character is so artfully presented, the last hundred or so pages are painful. What seemed like a perfect story of love unbounded by class becomes a lesson on unfullfilled dreams and changing priorities. You are sad for Claire, even mad at her for giving in to her situation. You rail against the people who hurt her and complain about an ending that leaves too much up in the air, but never once can you complain that the book is unbelievable.And for the ending. We don't know what happens to David and Claire. They both have a life ahead of them, with hopes that it will be together. I think, with a spark of optimism, that Claire sees that her life isn't over and maybe her dreams have just been delayed."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"After reading Tara Road, I was ready to read every Binchy book I could get my hands on. This novel started out very slowly, but by the time I got to the middle, I was glad I had trudged through to the &quot;good part.&quot; What I did not know, however, was that the middle was the ONLY &quot;good part.&quot; The last section of the novel was so disappointing. Clare changed so much, and in ways that were not true to her character. The Clare that Binchy had made me love would not have done the things that she ultimately did at the novel's end. If she had left out the first 200 pages and the last 100 pages, the novel would've been a good read."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"The end was not closure for me...I felt it should have went a little further.

With her other novels I was drawn right in with the characters, this one took me a while.

Not as good as some of her others, but, as usual, I wanted to keep reading 'til the end without stopping. Binchy is one of my favorite authors, so this story satisfied me. The two main characters are real and honestly portrayed, and the small Irish town where most of this story takes place sounds like a place I'd like to visit."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy is nothing more than a formula writer. She has shown that she can write a good friendship yarn; however, she doesn't seem to progress as a writer. Novel after novel, she churns out the same type of story-line. Perhaps it's time to turn her talents towards other topics. A very disappointing read."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I COULDN' GET PASS ONE CHAPTER. I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T TO MY TASTE RIGHT NOW...

It started off prominsingly enough, we were introduced to intersting characters, each pursuing their own dreams. However, about three quater through the book, it seemed that the story itself was unsure what it wanted itself to be. Was it going to be about dreams, pursing or giving up because of other priorities in life? Was it going to be a romance? Or was it going to become a thriller, with a slightly crazy man pursuing his love? The book tried to bring in a bit of everything and ultimately left all the areas underdeveloped."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have been unable to read this book, because the type is so small and dim.

What a gracious gift she left behind for all of us."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Unfortunately, I was not able to finish reading this, a very disappointing, unreadable book from one of my favourite authors."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy was such a dear. Really enjoyed her books about every day life in England and Ireland.They made me want to move to the villages she described."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I enjoyed reading about the town and people of Castlebay very much, so much so that I want to go to Ireland and find this little town!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Another really enjoyable book from this author, who never fails to please. Her inate ability to draw together the many characters and their individual stories, then weave them into a truly believable story is an art in itself and no-one does it better than Ms Binchy. The characters from this story are rounded and believable, from the town doctor, his haughty wife and medical student son, to Clare, the shopkeeper's daughter, who is determined to \\"study\\" herself into a better situation, to the hard-working schoolteacher, who guides Clare through her school years and beyond, This group and all the other characters, who move through the story, make for a very interesting read"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy never disappointed. I enjoyed the story of the characters who sought to achieve the dream of an education, the teacher who inspired and, of course, the clash of classes in the time it was written. (It probably still exists!) Ms. Binchy can make you laugh, cry, and care. You want them all to succeed. Not all do,but the reader will enjoy discovering which ones rise above class prejudice and the resentment and disappointment of those who do not."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I love Maeve Binchy as a storyteller. In fact, I am in the process of reading all her books. This one had a wonderful story, but was very slow in plot progression. I did enjoy it, but it probably won't be my favorite."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"The book starts out in the 1950's in a small seaside town in Ireland and follows the lives of two young people and their families. David Power is the son of the town doctor, while Clare's family runs the general store. Clare dreams of something more in life and is aided by one of her teachers to strive for scholarship to help her try to escape her destiny and class. In contrast, David is expected to become a doctor and marry right. We see Clare's struggles as she finds herself between worlds, where she has left her past behind, but does not fit in with the more educated class. When love turns her head, jealousy, fate and bad choices turn her vision of success into something entirely different. While I appreciated the vignette of life in Ireland during this timeframe, my frustration with some of Clare's choices made the latter part of the book difficult for me. I wanted her to succeed, and while her life did not turn out the way she planned, we did see her grow up by the end of the novel."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I loved this book so much the first time I read it -- probably 10 years ago - that I bought it to read again electronically. Rest in Peace Maeve Binchy! We will miss your wonderful books."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"What an unfullfuling, unrewarding waste of time. The disappointment is more sharply felt because Binchy's set up is actually promising. The characters are engrossing, if one dimensional, and the vibrant town plays a leading role as well. The heroine and hero, Clare and David, are carefully portrayed and the reader cannot help but become emotionally attached to both of them. The reward for this attachment? An ending where the heroine becomes an object of pity and the hero proves himself to be an abject heel, an anti-hero in every way. Why is this the fate that Binchy creates for brave, brilliant, studious Clare O'Brien? Here's a girl longing from a young age not just to \\"be different\\" and get out of her small town (cliche by an standard), but to do it by scholarly excellence. The obstacles she faces are real and seemingly insurmountable. The sexism of the time and place, the narrow rigidity of the nuns who teach her, her parents' lack of support, her siblings' constant stream of problems and scorn. Why does Binchy want to write a book about a girl like this failing to fulfill her destiny as a major achiever because she has sex and \\"gets caught?\\" Binchy is simply promoting the age-old chauvinistic not to mention Catholic punishment of the good girl who falls to temptation. It doesn't seem to matter that Clare preserves her virginity much longer than her peers, that she takes a spiritual, values-driven approach to love, that she is waiting for something true and special, and that when love comes to her it does so with full force in the person of a seemingly mature, honest and loyal young man. What young woman wouldn't fall in love with sincere, hard-working, good David Power? What young woman wouldn't believe in the sincerity of his feelings and his promises? Nevertheless, Clare is punished by a string of belittling mistreatments, slights and betrayals. What motive can Binchy have than to punish her heroine for believing in true love other than the social and religious judgement of which she seems so critical? By punishing Clare, Binchy punishes her readers as well - it's not a fun ride, nor does it have the benefit of being a cautionary tale. Is all of Clare's spunk, drive and talent just flushed away with the arrival of her baby? What a boring old story. David, whom we watch grow up and come to care about chapter by chapter, is revealed to be a self-involved, uncaring, philandering pig. Ultimately he embodies the worst of his mother's bad qualities and little of his father's goodness, contrary to how it apepars to the town. If Binchy were a more sophisticated novelist and this were a much greater work of fiction, it might be interesting to see our hero and heroine unravel and prove to be not what they appear. However, Binchy just isn't that great a writer - this is not Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary. If you are looking for a good old-fashioned love story with a happy ending, this is NOT it. If you are looking for a good old-fashioned love story with a sad ending, this is NOT it. This is a bad love-story that builds up to a hoaky, B-movie plot twist and leaves you emotionally empty. Here's a question: why don't any of the bad guys get punished? The hypocritical snobs never get a comeuppance, and even more sadly, they never learn a single lesson. Where is Charles Dickens when you need him? Or any good writer for that matter? No one in this novel grows as a human being. No one expands their understanding of human nature or evolves as a result of their relationships with one another. Angela O'Hara, who is set up as Clare's older alter-ego and a voice of wisdom in the novel, also remains mired in her prejudices. What's the point? The story isn't entertaining enough to justify the characters' lack of growth. It is an exercise in static; it features a lot of potential that goes nowhere. There is no catharsis nor is there any emotional sweep. Binchy is a hugely popular best-selling writier. This reader's humble opinion will do little or nothing to shake her fan-base. For myself, however, this will be my first Binchy novel and my last."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"The book was typical Binchy, very satisfying with an assortment of characters. It kind of fell apart once the two main characters married because they \\"had to\\". It seemed forced and sad. Time to reread Tara Road and Scarlett Feather!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the first Maeve Binchy book I have read and I will read more. Having been to Ireland and the area she is writing about her description put me there so vividly in my mind. The story is a lovely story and well written."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is one of Binchy's \\"bigger\\" books ~~ but it's very engrossing reading though and I have managed to read it in a week in the midst of all the household chores, kids, cooking and so on ~~ it's very good though a bit darker than her other books. Several of my online reading friends highly recommended this one and I was surprised that I haven't read it since I have made it a point to read all of Binchy's books (I have a couple left now to find and read). One of the online reading buddies strongly recommended this book as it was her favorite book.This book is about Claire O'Brien, one of the numerous O'Brien children ~~ her parents own a shop in Castlebay, Ireland. This is a small town that is also a small resort in the summertime ~~ that is when they get their best business ~~ from the tourists. Claire is one of the two daughters ~~ her sister, Chrissie, is more flamboyant and outgoing than Claire is. Claire was just bound and determined to move out of Castlebay and see the world. Angela O'Hara is her teacher with her own secrets. David Power, the doctor's son, is a distant friend of Claire ~~ even though he is older, his life has always been entwined with Claire's life ~~ they ended up in Dublin during his medical residency and her undergraduate studies. There is Gerry Doyle, the good-looking photographer's son, who took over the business when his father died of cancer. All of their stories are entwined as only lives in small towns are known to be.This is one of Binchy's older books and it is very well-written. She has a way of capturing your imagination and taking you down a path to a different life in the same small-townness of our lives. The characters are familiar to you and to me ~~ because they are based on realistic people. Their stories are comforting because they are familiar. This book is definitely a good read ~~ one I would recommend this summer to read wherever you are.6-2-05"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This book started out somewhat slow and I almost took a trip to boreville until about the 60th page or so when it picked up a little.

Binchy shows the trials and tribulations of a small town, of those trying to escape it, and those who must return to Castlebay. But foremost, the novel depicts the story about Clare O' Brien, and the way she is a central figure in most peoples' lives. And it depicts social class, and perhaps that there is a remote possibility that love can conquer all."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have read this book three times and I still can't get over it. The depth and detail is amazing. It leaves you aching for more; I still wish I knew what happened with Claire and David... A sequel would be nice!

The characters are so well-developed, and the 'mood' of a small Irish tonw in the fifties very well presented.

A delightful and enthralling read."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"An avid reader of Maeve Binchy's books, I was not disappointed with Echoes. I was hooked from the first pages and it just kept getting better. It's Binchy's ability to make you feel as though you know each character intimately that makes her books so enjoyable. Although I have never been to Ireland, after reading a Maeve Binchy novel, I feel as though I lived there my whole lfie. I was a little disappointed with the ending of this book, but it was still a phenomenal read."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Although, I am a huge Maeve Binchy fan I have found the last few books she has written to be more difficult to 'get into'.

I have read almost all of her books and consider this one of her best."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"'Echoes\\" is actually one of Binchy's older novels, and it is classic Binchy with a convincing blend of human drama, social commentary and romance. As with almost all her novels, \\"Echoes\\" is peopled with memorable characters and filled with poignancy.\\"Echoes\\" tells the story of Clare O'Brien, a grocer's daughter growing up in a small Irish holiday resort. Clare is a bright girl and dreams of a life beyond her present circumstances. Then there is David, a doctor's only son whose mother is class-conscious and disapproving of her son's friendship with Clare. There's also Gerry, a photographer's son. These three lives intersect and the story focuses on them growing up amidst the class prejudices of the times and how individuals discover what life is about and what truly matters.I'm a long-time Binchy fan and I've been collecting her books since I first read Circle of Friends back when I was in college more than a decade ago. Her stories are always so real and down-to-earth, peopled with characters that are not just well-developed but ones readers can relate to and genuinely care about. The story here flows seamlessly and pulls you in, and as with most of Binchy's works, makes you feel all warm inside."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I'm surprised this book doesn't have as many reviews as her other titles.

Maeve Binchy is usually a very reliable story teller and this book is not up to her ususal standards. The character descriptions are great in the begining but towards the end,the story line and characters fall apart. The ending is extremely unsatisfying.Choose another book by this author if you're new to Binchy,such as Tara Road. But if you must read Echoes,get it from the library, don't spend your money on it."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This book was thoroughly depressing!

If somebody hadto be sacrificed I could handle it being Gerry Doyle, therewas something disconcerting about his character.Angela O'Hara was great; her pairing with Dick Dillon wasat first a bit surprising but satisfying in the end.This was a pleasant story about average Irish people, howthey work, live, and love, and how and why they keep somany family secrets."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Very well written, as always.

Binchy makes each character in Echoes come alive."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I found this book almost as enjoyable as \\"light a penny candle\\" (my favorite Maeve book so far). That being said, I thought Echoes was a great story! I appreciate how well Maeve is able to make all the characters seem like real people.. they are never overdone and you can maybe even recognize them in yourself or in your friends. Perhaps one of the better aspects of any book I've read by Maeve is her story-telling style. Maeve is gifted at putting the words together, such that it seems like you are having a conversation with an old friend.If you have read by Maeve before, Echoes will not disappoint. If you are new to Maeve then Echoes will likely have you hunting for your next Maeve story. Echoes is a bit long, but once you get attached to the main characters (especially Clare) it's difficult to set aside the book for very long."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy is a magical author. Echoes is a story with the power to evoke many emotions. Her characters jump from the pages into your imagination imprinting a reality. You feel that these are real people. Clare and David are characters with faults and you love them for it. But, they also have strength that resounds within anyone reading it. At the end of the book you feel fulfilled and wish you could walk the beach of Castle Bay. Maeve Binchy has an incredible talent for creating stories you not only relate to, but that you live the story out with the characters. Read just one of her books you will want to read them all."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I consider myself a huge Maeve Binchy fan, and this book by far, was my favorite one. I loved the details that are her trademark. It was a book I devoured in 2 days."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I normally prefer romance novels, but this was nice for a change. It's a story about many different people in a small town on the coast of Ireland. Some set goals and work hard for them, others do not. One fellow had movie star good looks, was very smart, but never committed to anyone or anything. Girls loved him. It was fascinating watching what happened to these people over the course of many years. Some people I loved, others I disliked. The only negative for me was the ending. It was ok but sad.CAUTION SPOILERS: It was sad because a guy cheated on his wife. She suspected it all along but never wanted to admit it to herself. When a friend proved it to her, her husband was sorry but couldn't say so and he couldn't make any promises for the future. Yet, she forgave him and I assume stayed with him. That was too sad for me. I wished there was more explaining why he did it, or reasons to trust that he wouldn't do it again. I'm writing this a day later, and I'm still sad thinking about it. I wish the author would have given us a happier feeling at the end. Although, I am glad I read the book, and I will continue to think about some of the characters in the future.Sexual language: none.

Wonderful characters whom we care about very much and a story which reaches out and brings you in as though you, too, were a resident of Castlebay. Kate Binchy is a marvelous reader and her narration does full justice to this terrific book. In one of the editorial reviews above I noted that Kate Binchy is described as Maeve Binchy's daugther which is a mistake. She is Maeve Binchy's cousin and narrates quite a few of the novels. Echoes is wonderfully read and produced and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I am always looking for new works by Maeve Binchy. Although I looked at the publication date before I purchased and read the description of the book, I failed to note that 2008 was the 'publication date for this edition.' This book was originally published in 1985. Be careful.....you may have already read it!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This book had an underdeveloped plot and was very disapointing to me! I love Maeve Binchy but I'm glad I didn't read this book before reading the Copper Beach, the Glass Lake, and Evening Class, which were all wonderful, or I never would have read another book by her. The characters start out so promising, and then their personalities become completely unpredictable towards the end. I think the plot wasn't well thought out for this novel, because the ending is tragic and severe, comes suddenly and really doesn't make a lot of sense. I recommend people read The Glass Lake, which is one of my favorites, and don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I am not a member of Amazon.com and so decided to take a kid's review. It says above that I am 12, but I am actually 14.When I read this book I was captivatated as it is based on themes of change and this is conveyed very strongly by Claire O'Brien, daughter of the local shopkeepers, who grew up alongside the local doctor's perfect son, David Power. Claire receives a scholarship for college and it is there that she meets David again and they fall in love. The perfect part, though, is that it is not a mushy-mushy happy ending as there is betrayal, but the title of Echoes fits this book very much as the story seems to echo and you don't know what happens to David and Claire. It was my first Maeve Binchy and I thought it was brilliant."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I've read everything Maeve Binchy has written, and in my opinion this is by far the best of her many novels. It's about a group of friends growing up together in a small seaside town in 1950s Ireland. As they get older they discover there are differences of status between their families, and Claire and David, who are beginning to fall in love as teenagers, discover his family is not receptive to their relationship.The story moves on, through their college years and beyond, and along the way Binchy shows the passage of time by subtly blending social and political changes in with the characters' lives. Binchy has fantastic story-telling skills, and these are best exhibited in her earlier books, such as this and Light a Penny Candle; I did find some of her later books a little disappointing."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I started reading this book about 6:00 one night, and ended up staying awake until about 4:00 to finish it. I loved it, the beginning anyway. The characters were very real and the story was very good. I got very caught up it in, and couldn't put it down. Then came the last fifty or maybe a hundred pages. Maeve Binchy set up an amazing plot, a little depressing maybe, but still good, but the ending was no where near my expectations based on the rest of the book. It seemed like she spent months building up the story, then realized &quot;Oh no! I only have two days to my deadline!&quot; then hastily wrapped up the book in a very unsatisfying way that was untrue to the characters and very disappointing. Read it anyway, it's still a very good book, just don't take the ending as personnally as I did. I spent the next day very sad and very tired."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have never, repeat never, read a book as touching and involving as this one. I have no clue why this was my first introduction to such a superior storyteller as Maeve Binchy. I'm only saddened that I've waited so long to read one of her books. I can't wait to get another. This lady has a gift. This book is enthralling. Definitely not a story you will soon forget if ever. The characters are amazingly real, you grow so attached to them faults and all. You will be happy for them at times and your heart will absolutely break for them at other times. Simply fabulous. Although a little slow in the beginning you won't be able to put it down when things start happening. Although I didn't like the way the ending left me hanging, I couldn't dare think it wasn't worth it. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story! However this one isn't good, it's wonderful!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"ECHOES by Maeve BinchyHere's a book I read earlier this summer - ECHOES by Maeve Binchy. It's the story of two people, David Powers and Clare O'Brien, and how their lives seem to be destined to come together, despite what social status dictates. They grow up in the same small town of Castlebay in Ireland, travelling in different circles, since David's family is well to do, while Clare's is part of the working class. But they eventually find their lives intertwined as they approach adulthood.Clare's desire as she's growing up is to leave this small town, where she knows she would be trapped forever, expected to live out a life as traditionally as women have in the past - get married, have babies. Clare wants more for herself, and with the help of her teacher Angela O'Hara, who had remained single so far into her adult life, she tries to meet her goal.David's calling is to be a doctor as his father before him. For him, his parents prefer something better than being stuck forever with a lower class girl like Clare. It is their hopes that he marries into a prominent Irish family and continues the family practice.But fate has something different in mind. The story of David and Clare had me glued to this book, and as always Maeve Binchy tells a great story, filled with wonderful personalities that surround the main characters. I highly recommend ECHOES as one of Binchys' best books to date. Don't be put off by the length. It's worth the read!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This was my third Maeve Binchy experience and by far my favorite. Better than CIRCLE OF FRIENDS or TARA ROAD. A rich story, and wonderfully developed characters. The town of Castlebay is described beautifully, and Clare's experience at the university in Dublin adds a nice variety to the setting. I agree with other reviewers that the ending was not completely satisfying because it left me hanging, but I really did enjoy ECHOES. Pour a cup of tea, curl up with this book and be transported to your own Irish cottage in Castlebay."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is a great story of life in a small Irish village. The characters are wonderfully real to life. Maeve really captures Irish village life mentality. Once you get in to the book it is hard to put down. I couldn't wait to pick it up and read when ever I had the time, it leaves you wondering what is going to happen next? I loved the story but not the ending. I wish we had known how things were going to turn out for David &amp; Clare."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy has an uncanny ability to create characters which the reader grows to know and enjoy and hates to let go at the end of the book. In this novel, Binchy details the lives of a group of young people in the town of Castlebay, Ireland, from 1950-1962. There are the usual class distinctions which are far more important to the adults than they are to their children. One young woman, Clare O'Brien, renounces the usual life of her working class parents by working hard enough to get scholarships to school. She studies under the tutelage of Angela O'Hara who was also academically gifted, but whom circumstances have trapped in a dead-end teaching job in her hometown. Clare works hard for her degree, thus separating herself from her family. However, her academic successes have not put her on an even level with some of the young people who come from more prominent families. She and a wealthier young man fall in love and they must battle a variety of negative outside influences. This is an engrossing tale which causes the reader to really care about the characters and what becomes of them."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"In looking through books on tape at the library, I ran across ECHOES, and decided to give it a try. I had never heard of it before, but have found most of Maeve Binchy's stories to be more than good. What at great treat! This is a terrific story about a small seaside village in Ireland called Castlebay. I was immediately hooked on the story.Clare O'Brien is the daughter of a poor shopkeeper and meant to stay in her place in this village where your birth status decides your life. The assumption is rather amazing since the story takes place in the 1950's and early 1960's. Clare is very bright and stands out in a family where her siblings are certainly not overachievers. She's helped and motivated by a young teacher who sees herself in Clare and wants to give her a chance at a better life. Clare works hard and wins several scholarships, which enable her to go on to the university in Dublin. This story is filled with a cast of characters who seemed very genuine to me. The unfolding events explain how Clare changes and how the village people, both rich and poor, view the young woman. Clare's own family, seem to be at odds with the fact that she wants to improve her lot in life, and her choice of a husband is not well received by anyone.The author's daughter, Kate Binchy, read my audio book. She was such an excellent reader, that I will now look for her name on other audio books. She was able, with different Irish accents, to keep each character totally unique."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Started off slow and then was involving. Binchy's characters are very well-drawn and their personal dramas have a very realistic tinge. She has the fabled Irish gift for storytelling that is lyrical and lovely and that draws one deeply into a tale. However, I found the ending very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I always have enjoyed Maeve's books set in 1950s Ireland, and this one is no exception. Plot lines are not Maeve's strong point and, as often is true of her work, about 75% of the way through, the lack of discernible plot leads her to try to tie up the ends with improbable melodrama. Until then, it is an engrossing book, showing Maeve's gifts for depicting characters, relationships, and a good deal of depth about the realities of life. Her characters have wisdom and insight most of us would envy.I especially liked the characters of Angela and Clare, which were developed very well. Most of the men who are part of the action do not fare so well and have fewer dimensions.Overall, it is a highly enjoyable book - the sort which I'd like to have in my bag during a train or bus ride (which, indeed, is just where I gobbled it down.)"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the best book I've ever read! Characters that will stay in your heart forever."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Binchy happens to be my favorite author but this novel was truly disappointing.Yes,it had it's moments but overall it's was not very pleasing.I would'nt recommend this as a novel by binchy to read first.It would discourage you to read others which are mostly very good.Instead I would go with Tara Road,Circle of Friends,Evening Class or my fav-The Glass Lake.It was uneventful until nearly the end.Binchy is known for a slow beginning but Echoes just never seemed to get very good."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I was mentored by a high school teacher who is closer to me than any person on the planet. In this book, Binchy captures the symbiotic growth experienced by both the teacher and pupil through a relationship that spans decades, from teacher and child to the eventual woman to woman relationship. I loved seeing that transformation on paper. To some, the maternal bond Angela and Clare share may seem unrealistic, but to me, it was perfectly depicted.Also, I find the ending fitting--in fact, I would say perfect--in that sometimes, as adults, we make very different and difficult choices that we would not have made in high school or even college--these sacrifices make us more compelling women in many ways, although they also may make us weaker to those whom expected so much of us."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This book was truly breathtaking! As Clare grows up, the reader experiences everything she goes through in her life as a young adult. Her good times keep the reader waiting to see if they will last. When she goes through hard times, the audience holds their breath to see if she will get through the situation alright. I think this book would be enjoyed be readers everywhere"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have read many Binchy novels and have always enjoyed them. &quot;Light a penny candle&quot; being my favorite. However, Echoes&quot; was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed to take forever to develop the characters and therefore it was difficult to stay with book."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"recommend to all Irish folks particularly so they can see where those 'phrases' we grew up with came from!! This is a well written book. I notice she has 20 books and I've read 2 so far both 5 star from me. A great read for all folks...."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"My mom turned me on to Maeve Binchy this summer with Tara Road. I loved it. Echoes is also wonderful until you get to the end. The ending is so abrupt and disconnected it is hard to take. The women is the story is complex and mulit-layered so it's a shame that we don't get to know how she handles the next phase of her life. I'm almost afraid to try another book this one was so disappointing."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This was a great book until about 100 pages from the end. I loved David and Claire despite their flaws (and maybe because of them) and felt very strongly about the huge cast of peripheral characters. The main story centers around David and Claire but intertwined are many side stories, not least of which centers around the small Irish town which is a character in itself. There were a few things I disliked such as the constant repetition and though I liked Angela as a character, I found the story involving her brother tiresome. Also I'm not sure a detailed account of who liked who and was dating who each and every summer was exactly necessary to plot development. But overall, I would rate the majority of the book 5 stars.Then the book changes entirely. I won't spoil the ending but once David and Claire change their life course (and you'll know what I'm talking about once you there), all hell breaks loose. Characters go completely against their development and one of, if the not THE, most important them of education/bettering yourself/getting the hell out of the small town is completely forgotten. You begin to dislike David and Claire until the very ending when you'll REALLY dislike them. I literally groaned at the plot twist and just sped through the rest until I was done with thing.*SPOILER ALERT*So my advice is to read this great 5 star book and stop once Claire learns she is pregnant and Dr. Powers has a seizure. Yes, this would be an unsatisfactory ending but not nearly to the level of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Yes, this is a \\"re-issue\\" of one of her earlier novels but, that doesn't change the fact that this is still one of Maeve's better books. It starts off with unanswered questions that keep you pulled into the plot line and characters all the way though the book while enchanting you with the town in Ireland that you'll want to visit by the end of the book!I picked the book up one night at 8pm and didn't put it down till 5am the following morning. I just HAD to know what happened and all the answers to the questions before I could go to sleep. I passed the book along to 8 of my friends and all of them (male and female alike) all enjoyed and read the book in the same time or less than I did.Maeve Binchy is one of the better contemporary writers of our time. I just wish that more of her books were made into films. I want to go to the places that Maeve takes me!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I love every book Maeve Binchy has ever written. Her writing style is superb and I never want her books to end. I feel like I know the characters personally."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's books. She brings all her characters to life. \\"Echoes\\" is a wonderful read and one of Binchy's best books."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Never predictable, but always engrossing, in Echoes Maeve Binchy is at her best. From the first few pages, till the last I was involved with every believable character."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Typical hometown family story that you would expect from Madge Binchy. She was one of a kind. We have lost a great author."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I was in the middle of reading this when Maeve died so I felt a tad guilty that I wasn't loving this book. I appreciated the totality of the story when it was over but it just didn't keep my interest like everything else of hers I've read. It felt like it was the (long) story of someone's life that just wasn't all that exciting."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I love reading this author's books. She's great at developing characters. If you are looking for murder and mayhem, then you'd be better off reading someone else's work. I have read other books of Binchy's that I enjoyed more than this one. But, this was my second time reading this book (once when it first came out) and it still held my interest throughout."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Excellent book, I couldn't stop reading it. It was one of those books that I got so into that I just couldn't stop reading it, I had to find out what happened. I finished it much faster than what I usually do. I would recommend this book to my friends as well as colleagues."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I agree that it was slow to begin and that the ending wasn't exactly happy. But I really enjoyed reading it and about thinking about it. I enjoy a book that ends with a bit of reality. Not everyone keeps on pushing thru hard times and sometimes people just need the time to consider what they really want. I know people were upset about the ending but I think that it fit the story. It is worth reading and getting to know these people. I also have enjoyed many of her works."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I was in bed with the flu and wanted a comforting, long story to read and knew I could count on Maeve Binchy. Great characters, and an enjoyable read. I do wish the ending gave a little more information and I felt like the last part of the book was a little untrue to the characters, but overall a great book to snuggle in with."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I think the great thing about Binchy is her unpredictable endings, this is no exception. Again Binchy gives a great insight to Irish life and the witty Irish attitude!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maybe it's me, but this book dragged on and on. I liked the beginning,but by the middle it became too repetitive for me. Who saw who in Dublin, who said what to who, who wore what. Like a movie that is too long, I think 100 pages could have been eliminated. How many times do we really have to hear about Angela's arthritic mother, or mrs. O'Brien looking tired? The limitations of Irish life in a small village in the 50's is very well done, as are the influences of Catholicism."},{"Title":"1001 Humorous Illustrations for Public Speaking: Fresh, Timely, and Compelling Illustrations for Preachers, Teachers, and Speakers","review":"I have an opportunity by the Lord to preach and teach at church on a regular basis.

This can be useful when you are preparing a presentation and most of these are funny enough for you to be able to use to \\"break the ice\\" in a setting like this.If you need content and you do a lot of speeches and presentations paying less than $10 for the Kindle version is a pretty good deal."},{"Title":"1001 Humorous Illustrations for Public Speaking: Fresh, Timely, and Compelling Illustrations for Preachers, Teachers, and Speakers","review":"I like this book and will definitely read it a couple more times.

However, before I continue with my review I think it is appropriate for me to quote what Rudolf Hess's son Wolf Rudiger Hess thought of the book. He says in his book 'My Father Rudolf Hess' written in the 1980's the following comments regarding the book:Bird was U.S Director at Spandau and maintains that he won my father's confidence over the period. My father allegedly gave him permission to use his Nuremberg notes in a publication.Although Bird's description sounds quite credible in many respects, as a source I consider the book to be of only limited reliability until such time as it's content is confirmed by Rudolf Hess.With the above in mind, I do not know if the book was ever confirmed as completely reliable by Rudolf Hess (probably not) but Bird's account of things certainly tie in with many facts concerning the 'Third Reich's' most tragic figure.It is written from the point of view of a humanitarian who wanted to really get to know Rudolf Hess and find out what he was really like. I believe that because of Eugene Bird's kind and compassionate manner, Hess felt able to talk to him and reveal a lot about himself and subjects and events that he had not had the chance to talk about to anyone eles in years of captivity. Eugene Bird states in the book that he believes he was the first person to get close to Hess since Hess's captivity in 1941 which is very probably the truth. Hence you have a very moving and at times very sad glimpse into the life and emotions of Rudolf Hess which would not have been revealed in such detail by other people in Spandau.The book features Hess's Nuremburg diary entries which make fascinating reading indeed. Also the book features the lives of the other Spandau prisoners up until their various release dates when only Rudolf Hess remained. Eugene Bird is able to tell us the reaction of Hess at that momentous time when he found himself completely alone without Albert Speer and Baldur Von-Shirach.The book covers Rudolf Hess's illness with a serious stomach ulcer which required hospital treatment. It was after this illness that Bird was able to persuade Rudolf Hess to receive a visit from his wife Ilse and son Wolf who he had not seen since he was 3 years old. The sensitive way in which Bird gently persuaded him to see his family after 28 years is a credit to his sensitivity as a Director and as a man. The book goes on to explain and detail that very first meeting and also later meetings between Hess and his family.Eugene Bird got to know Rudolf Hess in a very real way and he discovered that Hess was a sensitive, humourous and warm human being who had a sharp intellect and keen interest in things.A truly fascinating part of the book is devoted to the letters which pointed to the peace mission to Great Britain of Rudolf Hess in which he made an attempt to stop the war.Hess explains to Eugene Bird how he was trying to achieve peace in 1941.The book has an unexpected 'twist' at the end. As a result of Bird's liaison with Rudolf Hess to write the book, Bird is questioned and put under house arrest for a time and asked to resign his post as Spandau Director. These events came as a complete shock and surprise to Eugene Bird and he writes about it as an epiloge in the book.He ends the book by saying he hoped that Rudolf Hess would be released from Spandau one day and that only time would tell.Sadly, it never happened.Louise"},{"Title":"Loneliest Man in the World: Inside Story of the Thirty Year Imprisonment of Rudolf Hess","review":"To the readers of Speers magnificent Spandau Diaries this authoritative book fills in many intriguing gaps, and illuminates many mysteries abour Hess' true state of mind. A valuable and wonderful book."},{"Title":"Loneliest Man in the World: Inside Story of the Thirty Year Imprisonment of Rudolf Hess","review":"If you have read Speer's magnificent Spandau diaries, this book will fill in a lot of very interesting gaps.

At a book review last March in Berlin we met and a friendship developed. After visiting the graveside of the Hess family at Wunsiedel last July, I managed to meet Mr. Bird at his home in Berlin in August. I regret to report that Mr. Bird passed away in late October.

His experience is tested when he must race on Ford's Mountain, to share the mountain.Personally, my favorite part is when Dennis catches big air, and has to ride down the mountain to get help, to save his friends, which are stuck, because one decide to try and drop in, but she had no real experience with the sport. This is my favorite part because it shows how strong Dennis's friendship really is. This book is really about a teenage boy who falls in love with a new action sport. The theme of this book is just really about following what you love.What I personally liked about this book was that it dealed with snowboarding which I love. If I could change one thing though, I would make the plot not so near the end.

To my mind, this is one of the most important publishing events in recent memory. In addition, these works are reset and contain solid introductions by experts in the field. This is third in the series (following Progress and Religion; and Medieval Essays).The Making of Europe: An Introduction to the History of European Unity is an important book, which came out in 1932. Dawson highlights the central factors and contributions in the formation of European unity - the Roman Empire, Classical Culture, Christianity, the Barbarians, the Byzantines and Islam. Although Dawson was a Catholic, the book is balanced and can be enjoyed by just about anyone. I liked in particular the fair overview of Islam. It's fashionable to say that history books of the past ignored the contributions of other culture and only contemporary (and leftist) historians rescued us from the evils of \\"eurocentrism\\" and \\"ethnocentrism.\\" This is silly, as anyone who has read history books from the past knows. (In addition, take for example the success of books in the nineteenth century such as Salambo by Flaubert, or the exaggerated claims of Masons of the contributions of Egyptians, which rival the \\"Black Athena\\" crowd).In particular, I enjoyed Alexander Murray's introductory essay, which updates some of Dawson's arguments in light of current scholarship and also places this work within his oeuvre."},{"Title":"The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity","review":"What amazes me most is that this book is probably not even known about in most modern educational circles, yet it should be required reading in every 101 history class in academia. In fact everything Chistopher Dawson writes should be on that list. This book is brilliant on so many levels I couldn't address them all in this space. Christopher himself was one of those extreamly rare individuals who had the ability to truely see the 'forest through the trees' and even better he could write about it for the rest of us to understand. Its one thing to know about a giantic and complex topic and a whole different thing to be able to put it into understandable sentences. The amount of books he read, understood and then tied the thoughts together is itself a staggering feat. The bibliography iteslf list the 100's and 100's of books that when into forming Dawson's mind and then the concepts in this book. As Tiger is to golf Dawson is to history, particularly western cultural history. The other reviewers have done a good job of telling you what the contents of this book are about so read them to get the idea, I second all their thoughts and reviews. What I can add for you is about the author himself. He is from England and grew up in a wealthly and privilaged family of book worms. It is important to understand that he came from wealth for one reason only. He didn't have to waste time like the rest of us toiling away to make ends meet. He understood this yet didn't live the life of a rich playboy. He felt an obligation to his fellow man and dedicated his free time to learning history and then teaching it to the rest of us. He read an wrote for 5 to 10 hours each day. Married young and never divored. His uncle gave him a library full of books where he spent most of his time growing up. He went to all the finest schools and was a professor at Harvard later in his life. All I can say is that this book is well worth the effort of working your way though it. It will give you a deep down spiritual-like experience to know so much more about your roots and where you came from. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity","review":"So just what did happen in Europe between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Crusades? This famous overview is just as readable today as when it was first written. Dawson's prose flow effortlessly and will keep you engaged. He covers everything from Baghdad to Iceland.He has the decidedly un-Marxist view that ideas and individuals do count in history. His pan-European sympathies probably sounded unrealistic in the '30's, but are back in vogue as we approach the introduction of the Euro coins."},{"Title":"The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity","review":"A rare book. It is profound, prophetic, insightful, level-headed. Christopher Dawson is one of the few authors whose books are still mandatory reading in university history circles because of the vastness of his knowldege exhibited in his books. Few writers have the ability to say as much so succinctly: reading one chapter gives you almost as much as a book on the same topic written by someone else.We need to remember that if the West saw far, it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants. The giants of our past who, step by step, brought disparate tribes, from many races, speaking many languages and coming from different parts of the world, into one cohesive whole known as Europe. We had better find out how our ancestors did it, before we lose it all."},{"Title":"The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity","review":"This concise little work attempts to cover the rise of nations from the crumbling Roman and Byzantine empires and the progress of Christianity all in less than 250 pages. Amazingly, the feat is accomplished with entertaining text. There is one shortfall in that there are no maps but the political characters and the events that brought about the European nations are given life. Very well done and a wonderful overview in its brevity and clarrity without paying the expense of literary color."},{"Title":"The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity","review":"This book has to be the best survey of the beginnings of European, i.e. Western, civilization in the English language.It reveals that European culture has its origins in the confluence of four vital elements: (1) the Roman Empire; (2) the classical, or Hellenistic, tradition; (3) Christianity (more specifically, the Catholic Church); (4) and the barbarians who infiltrated the collapsing Western Roman Empire. Each is treated in detail, and the combination of Dawson's encyclopedic knowledge and eloquent diction has the singular merit of making a vast and complex subject accessible and appealing to the educated reader.To me what makes this book so special is the author's unique capacity to project the reader into the period under discussion without filtering it through the distorted lens of modern mores and attitudes that seem typically to color texts dealing with medieval history. He seems to have an intuitive understanding of what was important to the people of the period, and conveys this to the reader while at the same time he refrains from disparaging the so-called \\"dark ages\\" with remarks that emphasize its \\"primitiveness\\" by constantly comparing it to contemporary culture. (Aside from technological superiority, I see little basis for superciliousness on our part) Such parochialism of viewpoint is entirely absent from The Making of Europe, and for this, and other compelling reasons, I am sure that the interested and discriminating reader will find that it is, indeed, indispensible."},{"Title":"The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity","review":"The Making of Europe: An Introduction to the History of European Unityby Christopher DawsonLondon: Sheed and Ward, 1932; Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 2003; new introduction and reprintReview by Reverend Brian Van Hove, S.J.Alma, MichiganPublished in The Fellowship of Catholic Scholars Quarterly, vol. 27, no. 2 (Summer 2004): 43We have waited a long time to see the works of Christopher Dawson (1889-1970) reappear. One of the joys of the new millennium is to discover this expectation partially fulfilled.The Catholic University of America Press now lists Progress and Religion, Medieval Essays, and The Making of Europe as again in print. Also an edited collection of his works, Christianity and European Culture, contains The Historic Reality of Christian Culture (1960) and selections from The Making of Europe (1932), The Judgment of the Nations (1943), and Medieval Essays (1959). There is still a void for his 1928 classic, The Age of the Gods.Dawson had a fine British education, thanks in part to his religion. However, Dawson never had a university teaching position in Britain because he changed his religion in 1914. As a Catholic, he was refused when he applied for a post as professor at the University of Leeds shortly after the 1932 publication of The Making of Europe. The author of the new introduction, Alexander Murray, sees some good in this. It made Dawson a kind of \\"historian prophet\\" who gained respect and an eager audience in the English-speaking world outside the academic establishment. Dawson finished only two of his planned major works, and The Making of Europe is one of them.The Making of Europe treats the period between 300 BC and 1000 AD. Let us remember that the Renaissance mentality saw no real good after the classical period which effectively came to an end with the Emperor Constantine. The mood of the Enlightenment was even more severe in accepting nothing good from the past when it replaced \\"the myth of the golden age\\" with \\"the myth of progress\\". Marxism pushed this further taking the stance that \\"all history is the history of oppression\\". But Dawson brought light where there was darkness, and his work rejected the concept of the Dark Ages. His thought was original when he saw the complex history of Europe as more akin to the myth of the Phoenix--something new and vital arising from the ashes of the old when Christian Europe was born.In just over 250 pages Dawson shows how conflicting movements eventually coalesced into a vibrant medieval unity. Roman institutions and learning, barbarian spirit and energy, contact with the East--both the Byzantine State and Islam, and the fusion of church and state in the Carolingian period, all had a role in the story. There had been partial revival and partial reversal with Justinian and Charlemagne, but by the eleventh century what we know as Western culture was in place, and it has continued without interruption to the present.Though The Making of Europe dwells upon the past, it ends with a warning about the present. Dawson says that the deeper spiritual needs of man were met by the medieval synthesis which he has outlined in the manner of a \\"meta-history\\". But in the last four centuries this spiritual aspect has been muted in favor of secular culture and material advantage. He warns that this is not enough. Surely since 1932 his warning seems correct. The fashionable Nihilism of our day does not satisfy, and Europe is poised either to regain her lost soul or to lose it to alien forces."},{"Title":"The making of Europe: An introduction to the history of European unity","review":"Christopher Dawson (1889-1970)wrote a knowledgeable history of the historical events and cultural influences that defined Europe. Dawson was a devout Catholic who had a meticulous concern for careful research and honest history. He discussed the phenomena of how the concept of Europe expanded from Ancient History to Early Medieval History.The early parts of this book dealt with Mesopotamian influences on Western Civilzation. Dawson then dealt that the concept of \\"Europe\\" meant Hellenic Greece. When Augustus Caesar's (63 BC-14 AD) forces won the battle of Actrium in 31 BC, the concept of Europe expanded to include the Greek world and the Roman Empire. The intellectual and cultural influences of these events could not be over estimated.Dawson explains that as the Roman Empire declined, the emergence of Christianity held its followers as the old religions became stagnant. The ruinous taxation and the divisions within the Roman army led to the phrase, \\"Enrich the soldiers and scorn the rest.\\" The early Christian martyrs were not impressed by Rome's power and cheerfully faced martydom which showed firm resolve. The early Catholic Bishops became de facto authorities because of their organization and influence. The bishops and clergy became the economic and social forces that absorbed functions that the Roman authorities could no longer afford such as refuge from famine and social collapse. Esubius (c. 260-c.341)mentioned that the Catholic Church preserved intelligent tradition over chaos. As history students may know, the differences between the Eastern Church and the Latin Roman Catholic Church gradually resulted in schism. Dawson gave credit to the Byzantine Greek Church as having more astute thought, but the Latin Catholic Church was more disciplined. Dawson also gave credit to St. Augustine (354-430)for creating \\"The Church Intellectual\\" which helped attract intelligent men and woman especially when he wrote THE CITY OF GOD.The Byzantine Greek Orthodox Church was closely tied to the Byzantine ruler via Caesaropapism which meant that secular and religious authority were under the Byzantine emperors and kings. While the Latin Western Catholics and Greek Eastern Orthodox were divided, the status of the Pope still had some influence in the East, but this ended by the Iconoclastic Controversy re the use of icons and images in churches.Due to the apparent differences between early Christianity and Classical learning, there was the expected tension of comparison/contrast between beliefs and philosophy-especially Greek philosophy. Tertullian (c. 160-225) denegrated Greek thought while St. Clement (d. 215)argued that Greek philosphy was a blessing in knowing about the mystery of Creation and God. St. Clement's view was mirrored in Boethius' (c. 480-535)book titled THE CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY.In the midst of the emergence of Catholicism, Dawson gave careful attention to the barbarian intrusions into the Roman Empire. Many of the barbarians considered themselves as career Romans and not barbarians. However, after the rule of the Roman Emperor Theodosius (379-395), the Roman Empire faced disaster. St. Jerome (346-420), who translated the Vulgate Bible, argued that God was for eternity while the Roman Empire, like all empires, would disappear.One of the problems for the Latin Catholic Church was to appeal to the barbarians whose model was the hero warrior and whereby war was the ideal. To penetrate this view would be difficult. However, the Catholic West clergy had literate men who gained influence because of their usefulness as administrators. When Clovis (480-520)converted to Catholicism in 493, the Catholic Church found fertile ground for conversion and influence.Dawson then compared/contrasted the Latin Catholic Church with the Byzantine East whose Christians were not as well organized. After the Council of Chalcedon (451), the Egyptians and others in the Greek East literally massacred bishops and authorities because of local loyalty to personalities rather than concepts. The Latin Church authorities faced outside pressures as well as doctrinal threats from the Gnostics who believed that an intermediary and not God Himself made Creation. The Manichians argued that the material world was evil and part of an evil God as opposed to Christ who was good. The Monophysilism heresy argued only for Christ's divine nature and not His human nature.The rise of Islam was a serious threat to both the Greek Orthodox Christians and the Latin Catholics. The Byzantines lost considerable territory and the loss of the library in Alexandria, Egypt. Yet, the Byzantines who faced such threats started the Iconoclastic controversy during the reign of Leo III (717-740) and got worse in 1054 when the Byzantines need allies and not more enemies.Yet, the Byzantines were able to recover from their refusal to examine and learn from Ancient Greek thought. Photius (815-897), who was responsible in part for the Iconclastic Controversy, and Psellus (1019-1079)helped to resurrect Greek thought and wisdom the realm of Byzantine rule.While the Byzantine was more advanced than the Latin West, Dawson made a good point that intellectually the Latin West was more dynamic. Dawson cited the work of the Irish Celtic monks whose missionary zeal took them to Iceland before the Vikings arreivd. The Benedictines, started by St. Benedict (480-543)and his twin sister St. Scholastica (480-543)gave the Western Latin monasticism discipline and learning. The Benedictines created the great library at Monto Cassio. The Benedictine monastary at Jarrow, England produced such great scholars as St. Bede (680-735). St. Boniface (c.680-755)helped to spread Catholicism to Germany.These efforts were embellished by the Franks. The Merovingian Franks were secular while the Carolingians were religious. Dawson argued that Charlemagne (768-814)was the protector of the Latin Catholic Church via his military exploits and his encouraging of learning especially at the school at Aachen. Dawson informed readers of the important work of Alcuin (735-804)whose scholars developed minuscule writing and \\"Bookhand.\\" Their work embellished teaching and learning for subsequent generations of students.The efforts of Charlemagne and the Franks was almost destroyed by the Viking invasions. Victories by the forces of Alfred the Great (848-899)at Eddinton, and victories by Charles III 898-922)stopped the Viking invasions, and these North Europeans became absorbed in Catholic culture and religion. The successful invastion of England by the forces of William the Conqueror (1066-1087)gave the English better administration and organization. The military success of Otto I (912-973)against the Magyars (Hungarians)were important in expanding European culture and thought in what were then considered non European areas.Dawson wrote an informative account of European History. As mentioned above, Dawson was a devout Catholic. He cited the failures of the Catholic Church, but he also gave readers a good assessment of the vast achievements during the History of Catholic Church and the making of Europe. This book should be slowly read and absorbed.James E.

Cziko brilliantly reviews the application of selection theory (blind variation followed by selection of best fits) to fields as different as neurology, immunology, linguistics, education, pharmacology and artificial intelligence, and presents a strong argument for the claim that innovation in any field can only arise through an application of selection theory. How does our immune system deal with a potentially infinite variety of antigens? Not directly through information contained in the genes, which are quite limited in number. Not through direct copying of the shapes of antigens, since no mechanism allows it to copy an infinite number of potential shapes. Rather, sequential generations of B lymphocytes produce antibodies that fit the antigen better and better, with continual selection of the B lymphocytes that produce the best-fitting antibodies. How do we acquire new knowledge? It is not innate, as Plato claimed. And we don't directly &quot;learn&quot; it from others, except in the sense that a parrot learns. Rather, we are constantly trying to make better and better sense of our perceptions, by building better and better explanations in our minds and rejecting inadequate explanations. Information and instruction received from others are only perceptions to us until we have incorporated them into our own explanatory schemes. So &quot;learning&quot; is actually an active process of explanation-building through trial and error, in other words, a form of blind variation of explanatory schemes and selection of the best ones.This book is well-written, clear, and immensely &quot;instructive&quot;, causing me to modify a number of explanatory schemes in my own mind. I put it alongside the best of Dawkins, Dennett and Wilson. It should have a much wider readership than it apparently has."},{"Title":"Without Miracles: Universal Selection Theory and the Second Darwinian Revolution","review":"This book is surely a must for anyone interested in phylosophical discussions concerning &quot;darwinian&quot; (or better, neo-darwinian) evolution theory, and its potential to explain other fields where any kind of innovation is created. The author describes these innovations as &quot;puzzles of fit&quot; of an organism or of a system to another organism or system, and he brilliantly equals all these &quot;fits&quot; to &quot;knowledge&quot;. Cziko reached a good level of quality in his transdisciplinary approach, putting together data from fields like evolutionary biology, immunology, neurobiology, animal and human learning, human thought and language, scientific knowledge growth, and cultural adaptation. For this, he no doubt deserves a four-star ranking. But then, there come the flaws...The central issue in the book is that just any kind of innovation, puzzle of fit, knowledge growth, or whatever you call it, can only be achieved through a process very much like biological evolution as accepted by the neo-darwinian paradigm: cumulative blind variation followed by the survival of the fittest. Cziko also shows how explanations for these puzzles of fit have evolved in all fields from providential explanations (like in the book of Genesis, where things happened to achieve a pourpose previously devised), through instructionist ones (like Lamarck's &quot;Use and Disuse&quot; plus &quot;Inheritance of Acquired Characters&quot;, where the environment would &quot;force&quot; the individual creatures to change just in the right, successful way, and then the creatures would pass these changes on to their offsprings), and finally to selectionist ones (Darwin's Selection Theory). He says that only selectionist explanations can give truly &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;naturalistic&quot; accounts for these fits, without recoursing to miraculous schemes. In short: Cziko brings us the good news that not only are we merely machines (like we have feared ever since the mechanical physics of Newton), but we are blind ones too!The starting point of his reasoning is evolutionary biology, and Cziko's understanding of it seems to me too narrow-minded, with a strong bias toward the old notions of New-Darwinism. Consequently, his report and deductions on it are misinformative. Evolution was (and, to a large extent, still is) thought to be based on &quot;variation and survival of the fittest&quot;. But in the past the view of the causes of these variations were believed to be basically errors: DNA damage by the environment, and failure of the organism to correct damages or to make precise copies of the DNA. It's been a long time now that this view has changed dramatically, and organisms, even as simple as bacteria, are now known (from before 1990) to possess amazing control over the ways and the contexts in which these variations happen. They can trigger DNA mutation under appropriate conditions (stress, threats to survival), and even control which areas of the genome will be subject to change. This renders organisms much more &quot;smartly&quot; interactive with the environment as might be expected from reading Cziko.So, what Cziko did not tell about the process of antibody creation by B-Lynphocytes is that when they undergo somatic hypermutation to fine tune their antibody production to the antigen, this hypermutation is, first, triggered by the interaction with the very antigen, and second, it is far from blind: the mutation happens only in a very restricted area of the chromosome, changing only the areas of the antibody molecule that interact with the antigen (and not even the whole molecule!). So this is a very &quot;thematic&quot; kind of mutation-variation; maybe &quot;short-sighted&quot;, but surely not &quot;blind&quot;!When he comments on the phenomenon of &quot;directed mutation&quot;, the strange capability of many procarionts (like bacteria) to seemingly direct their mutation to the desired result, he takes a rather cynical and slightly arrogant stand, apparently rejecting the existance of the phenomenon itself, even saying &quot;But let us continue to imagine for a moment that a bacterium was able to change just those genes regulating metabolism in just the right way to allow for the digestion of a foreign sugar&quot;. It seems that he read only two research articles on this, and not quite well, and draw much of his attitude towards the phenomenon from his academic-environment prejudiced and uninformed criticism. By the time he was writing his book , directed mutation had been fully demonstrated by many researchers, and not only by Cairns. Actually, even as early as 1984, four years before Cairns revolutionary and controversial paper on it, J.A. Shapiro had already shown the phenomenon fully (Observations on the Formation of Clones Containing araB-lacZ cistrons fusions. Molecular &amp; General Genetics 1984;194(1-2):79-80), only in a much more discreet maner. By 1995, a wealth of information was already available, from researchers like Shapiro and B.G. Hall, among others, and now even eukariotes (yeast) are known to perform &quot;directed mutation&quot; (Hall BG. Adaptive Mutagenesis: a Process that Generates Almost Exclusively Beneficial Mutations. Genetica 1998;102(103):109-125.). Strikingly, this process shows some resemblance to human B-lynphocyte somatic hypermutation!When Cziko moves on to the other areas, scientific knowledge growth, etc, the already &quot;short-sighted&quot; (and not blind) variation seems to have undergone a surgical operation on its eye and starts to see almost sharply. Also, the second step, that is, the survival of the fittest (in biology, through killing the non-fit) seems to change to a true &quot;selection&quot; process (choosing one among many, by identifying its desirable qualities, which is quite different from &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;). Even Campbell and Pinker, which he defines as fully (or almost) selectionists, seem to turn to rather providential viewpoints, like &quot;innativism&quot; and &quot;constraints&quot;, for triggering and orienting the variation, and guiding the selection, not succeding in solving Meno's providential dilema: &quot;...if you don't already possess the knowledge you are looking for, how will you know when you have found it?&quot;Cziko, like many, wrongly equals &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;naturalistic&quot; explanations to &quot;mechanical&quot; ones, and since our mechanistic view of nature is basically deterministic, he only sees lamarckism as an instructionist process, not a &quot;freely-willed&quot; one, failing to address vital phenomena like human consciouness and apparent free-will."},{"Title":"Without Miracles: Universal Selection Theory and the Second Darwinian Revolution","review":"That applies to this book, as well as the concepts described herein.When a book can alter your perception and understanding of the world for the better you reread it. I'm currently on my third formal reading of this masterpiece. I go back to it often.Cziko has brought to life the simple but powerful concept that Campbell called evolutionary epistemology: blind variation and selection. I use these concepts in everyday life (risk-taking, creativity, trade-off decision-making). Even if not useful, the concept would enegender admiration for its sheer beauty. The fact that it can be useful and fun is an added benefit."},{"Title":"The Taste of Luxury: Bernard Arnault and the Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton Story","review":"This book reads a lot like a really long magazine article in that it provides enough detail for you to understand the jist of the action that is happening and keeps the story flowing along at a brisk pace.

The story is interesting, however the book is written in very casual English, with sentence fragments and rhetorical questions appearing quite often.The book begins with background about Bernard Arnault, painting him as a dedicated student as a child. As Arnault grows up, his involvment in his family's business and eventual entry into the luxury goods arena via his acquisition of Dior are recounted, providing glimpses of his talents as a financier. The story then breaks into an account of the development of the LVMH group and the histories of its component companies.As the story progresses, the authors do an effective job of providing insights into the personalities involved in the battle for power at the world's leading luxury goods company.

She frequently advises the reader to put themselves in the shoes of the owner/board of the company when decided how to act, but doesn't seem to realize that in reality sometimes the owner/board has agendas that are not in the best interest of the company. She's apparently never heard of Enron, for example.There are also a few times where her advice is vague to the point of unhelpfulness. For example when she advises the reader to try to figure out the company's hidden/true values and/or agenda, but she doesn't give any clues as to how one would do that.Several times she claims that her goal is to make everybody aware of these pitfalls, ostensibly so that when we rise up into management we can somehow change things. She advises that the only way to get these problems changed is to become like existing management. I agree that the only way to rise in a company full of politics is to learn to play the game. But I dispute that the way to run a revolution is to become the enemy. I'm not sure what the solution is, but playing the game only perpetuates it.Overall, I think this book is most valuable to young people just entering the workforce. Some things seem unbelievable (like policies that are just to make the company look good) until you've been burned by them, so hopefully young people can read it here and not trip over them in their own careers. They *sound* unbelievable, but let me tell you as someone who's been working for 15 years and been burned a few times, Cynthia is right about these things."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I read many books throughout the year.

Essentially the key points can be summed up in a couple pages: Don't complain to anyone (especially HR), bend over backwards for your boss, and figure out what your company actually values (not just what they say they value).The last point is certainly good advice, but I don't feel there is enough guidance on how to go about doing that. She does state at one point that looking at the characteristics of others who have been promoted is a great way to learn about what the company wants. Again that's a great tip but to me that also conflicts with the rest of the specified advice in the book which seems to imply that every company has a \\"1 size fits all\\" approach. I know that the \\"untouchable stars\\" in the companies I've worked for don't fit the part of a lot of the things she recommends, such as not taking long vacations.You have to use your judgement as to what advice in here is applicable to your company and what isn't, and at the end of the day you either have enough awareness to do that or you don't; book or no book."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I used to think that I was pretty savvy when it came to my workplace, and the politics involved. (When I was really new, I thought I was lucky and didn't have politics in my workplace). It took me a long time to learn I was completely wrong.

Well worth it, even at twice the price."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I read business books for fun- Peter Drucker, Michael Gerber, Donald Trump, etc..etc..been there, read that. Cynthia Shapiro's book is by far the most important business book I have read in my life. The dirty secret that HR is not on your side is not an epiphany, but the degree to which Shapiro lets us in on the secret Tao of Human Asset Management is ground breaking. This is information you can't get from the big name authors or publishers. If I had this book before Sept 2005- my life would be different. I could have avoided the pitfalls that cost me a 6-figure job- pitfalls that Shapiro exposes and solves. If Cynthia Shapiro is successful, she will do to HR what the Motley Fool did to stock brokers: show the world the Emporer has no clothes.If you value your career and want to keep it- MEMORIZE THIS BOOK!....just don't let your boss catch you reading it at work....."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"An outstanding book! Should be required reading for anyone planning to enter the workforce, those already in it, and those who know someone who works - in other words everyone."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I got this book because a coworker recommended it. I think the book does an excellent job of stating and explaining the obvious - which is what any good self help book should do. It's a quick read, well organized, and it has bullet points for easy reference! While the book is mainly targeting manager types, there is plenty of advice for non-manager types. If anything the book offers a perspective on what it's like to be a lead or a manager, so as an individual contributor one can sufficiently please their gatekeeper ;)Things I found particularly valuable was the emphasis that it's not about your skills, it's about how you play the game - and this isn't represented in a negative light. The author doesn't state opinions - just facts. I've always been frustrated in my career because I'm 3x as smart as the average person, yet I have to work 3x as hard! Shapiro clearly outlines behaviors we may engage in that can harm our ability to progress in our jobs. I realized from her examples that my blunt nature is likely mis-perceived as negativity, so I've started developing better ways of communicating on various work issues that are less \\"threatening\\". This has resulted in an almost instantaneous change, both in improved attitudes of my coworkers, and I get less resistance from higher ups when implementing improvements.The aspect of this book that is especially beneficial is how Shapiro emphasizes that mistakes are rarely final - you can usually redeem yourself. She even gives advice on how to explain the change to your boss and coworkers. While the book is a harsh dose of corporate reality (although not quite as *shocking* as the review might suggest), it doesn't leave you feeling stuck. The advice in this book ultimately enables you to take control of your professional reputation in a corporate setting such that the powers that be can truly focus on and reward you for your talents and what you contribute."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"Excellent book- must have for all working professionals.

This book is my second Bible as I will read it often and keep at arms length to refresh my memory on what to do and not do.While I was already on the path of changing some of my rigid habits with the viewing D. Johnson's video on working with different personalities, Cynthia Shapiro's book helped me to see how I can enhance Johnson's personalities traits into the work place. Believe it or not, within three month of viewing the Johnson's videos and within a month of reading Shapiro's book, I received a increase in pay with a great bonus.This book will forever change your perspective of the work place. I no longer view the world as being one dimensional. I've come to realize that there are many micro worlds that we encounter on a daily basis. And although we may not realize it, these micro worlds are often two dimensional. Often times what we see is not what is, and what is happening behind closed doors is often hidden from you. Shapiro gives you a glimpse inside the corporate world giving you insight on the decisions that take place and the eyes of our overseer who are constantly taking inventory of their workers attitude and performance."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"Found this book online and ordered - alot great things to know and not to do when interviewing for a job - a must for job seekers"},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I was naive about work, thinking that people cared about my opinion that that being right was important.

I normally abhor when people leave reviews based on what they have heard about a book, but I have no other outlet to express my opinion about the content as represented by the author.I have never in my 20 years in HR encountered the despicable practices that the author states are common place. Here is my email that I attempted to send the author:Cynthia- I'm certain this isn't the only email that you have gotten regarding your 20/20 appearance from an HR Professional. I'm so disappointed in your interview. I've worked in HR for many years and although not everyone that I have worked with has maintained high ethical standards or practices, the vast majority have been hard working professionals that try their best to strike the balance between protecting the interests of the company and representing the employees. I have never, at any point in time, encountered the practices you discussed in your interview. I certainly don't question your honesty and assume that you have in your career but I am also certain that you are well aware that these practices are the exception and not the rule.You indicate that you want to protect the best interests of women and yet you threw under the bus the thousands of women that work in the female dominated HR profession. I shudder to think now what my co-workers think of my department if they saw your interview. It really is so disappointing to me that you couldn't even bother to mention that these practices represent the worst of HR. It's a shame to think that the people we work hard for could now have a tainted view of what we do.So thanks so much for defaming myself and my hard laboring HR co-workers, both past and present, who spend time away from their own families trying to make their way in the professional world and who conduct themselves with integrity and dignity."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I haven't read the book, atleast yet. I have read a few quotes from it elsewhere in another magazine. The magazine had quite a few quotes from other HR personalities as well, and Cythia's comments were bang on target as to the realities in corporate life. I am not entirely sure I'd want to follow any advice to \\"move up\\" the ladders, when I don't myself trust and believe in those values and ethics at workplace. I think it is most important for people to understand early on whether they really wish to participate in this mania and make their professional (and personal) lives miserable. My advice would be, that if your personal values and standards don't agree with \\"corporate\\" standards, just get off the treadmill, instead of bending backwards and doing all that it takes to ruin your own health. It is a different matter altogether if you are a born corporate pig, in which case you'd love to hunt and thrive there ...Enjoy what you do and the people that you work with. Logout if you don't. I think thats more important than any sort of guerilla warfare technique ... btw, I have seen these being practised in western non-US corporations primarily. Surprised ? We've already seen the destruction of many corporations practising exactly this kind of warfare.Should I start naming all those institutions that failed.

If I have come across this book 7 years ago and read it, I would have side stepped most of the traps that I have come across; Cynthia mentioned these in the book.Imagine how your career would be by moving ahead without falling for unnecessary pitfalls! Although this book will not guarantee success in ones career, it will definitely provide foresight to plan ones career strategically.Hope that I am not breaching piracy here but I would like to share the main theme of this book. I fully agreed with the author that you are always on stage at all times. Most employees fall because they let their guard down where they are still on stage.Broaden this analogy, you could apply the same principle to all other matters in life; love, family, etc.Wish all readers to derive the best benefits out of this book and I hope the other million of employees who have been confused by their corporate life could lay their hand on this book and lead a comprehensive and balance life from here!"},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I've been working for 6 months as an engineer. In school, success (and respect) was directly driven from how many degrees you pursued, how challenging the classes were, your grades, and being a team player to get any job done. It was a pure meritocracy.Work isn't.This book fills you in on so many issues its breathtaking. She doesn't just fill you in on correct behaviors, but explains why. Many times I was acting correctly, but I had framed it completely differently. I'm sure that, following my old logic, I would have made a mistake down the road. But even more times I learned what not to do in the future.I read many technical and business books, but few really change how you frame the situation. Those that do are almost never on aspects that you can execute today and tomorrow. They also can rarely make a dramatic influence on keeping, and improving, your career.This woman knows what she's talking about.

It's scary how right-on she is. I don't normally work on-payroll for the kind of corporations she talks about - but I'm often inside their gates for long periods of time as a consultant, so I get to see their HR policy first-hand. I've been black-listed as a consultant because I took two weeks of vacation with the company I actually did work for. I've been fired from engagements because I called somebody two steps up the corporate ladder from the manager I was actually working for. It's nuts.Most corporations are about one thing and one thing only - returning value to their shareholders. Upper management have proven themselves to be the best carriers of the company line (of BS, usually) - so they run the show... and since you now work for them - they own you. Cross them, even a little - and prepare to be walking the unemployment line. The \\"teddy bear on your desk\\" is no joke. Keep ALL of your personal life - and I mean every last aspect of it - out of your workspace if you want to be employed long-term.That's right folks, nobody is in business for your self-actualization.

I have known dozens of friends and former co-workers who thought that HR was a combination of therapist/confessional/guidance counselor. IT'S NOT. They exist to flag the \\"troublemakers\\" and get them to open up. The same people who seem so kind and concerned are really documenting your every word, reporting back to your bosses and making plans to eliminate you. Don't believe me? Ask your unemployed friends.

Is the glass half empty or half full?In her new book, \\"Corporate Confidential\\" Cynthia Shapiro provides clues on slip-ups to avoid and attitudes to embrace to keep your career always \\"half full.\\" In an age of layoffs, she spells out the danger signs that you may be next. Want to wear pink hair to your creative job? Better think again..it could cost you..this is business and how the company's clients view you does matter. She reminds us that email is not private and needs to be treated with great respect. And finally, the best person to help you in the organization is your boss. And if your boss isn't a help, she provides excellent strategies for working a solution. On the other side, Shapiro saves the last chapters for helping aspiring managers become rising managers - and how to move from \\"invisible\\" from \\"indispensable\\" (hint~the four things that companies reward is: flexibility, sales, public speaking and high level goal achievement).The book is friendly, concise, easy to read, straight-out practical and well written. Inspiring, yes!! Shapiro starts her book by stating that she left a job as a VP of Human Resources to be an advocate, and wrote her book \\"from a genuine love for the HR profession, a first-hand understanding of what corporations are up against in our highly litigious society and the highest respect for hard working employees.I, for one, certainly respect Cynthia for writing such a useful book to getting through the week - and maybe even up the ladder.

That book was extremely useful to me in a recent job search.Cynthia's voice as a former insider in human resources is priceless. People pay big bucks for her insight, so we are lucky she keeps writing books. Her writing is a fresh, clear voice that is urgently needed for the lowly individual worker. Especially since so many are struggling to obtain and keep employment in this tough economy. The advice and information from her newest book completely matched that which was given to me by two career counselors on a variety of job-seeking and career related issues.I am enjoying \\"corporate confidential\\", but after reading the first half, I'm not sure if I can tell you exactly what I've learned. Perhaps I'm getting a more general \\"feel\\" for all things corporate, instead of specific tips, like the other book.This book does help one begin to understand why corporations seem to act in certain ways,for example, what they value in individuals (and what they dont!). Between this book and the newer book, one can gain a better understanding of corporate values and perceptions and how one can unwittingly undermine one's own career.I highly recommend the newer book \\"what does somebody have to do..\\" book and I so-so recommend this one. I do think the books go well together and I look forward to whatever Cynthia Shapiro writes next.Please note that the kindle edition of \\"Corporate Confidential\\" is full of typos and weird font problems that mainly can be ignored but at times can interfere with the reading.

Their mere mention of it doesn't do this book justice. It is outstanding, a must read regardless if you are new to the workforce or have 25+ years experience. I couldn't read this well written book fast enough.Discusses proper use of email, FMLA, how to motivate & inspire your employees, how promotions are given out, how to ask for a raise, the importance of being an optimist, and many other notions.Here are a couple of quotes: \\"Problems will always seem less daunting if you train yourself to se the positive instead of the negative. A positive attitude will also help you generate creative solutions to problems instead of getting gmired in the seeming severity of a situation. If you are able to inspire those around you to believe it can be done, it will be. It's one of the essential qualities of leadership.\\"On being a manager:\\"You will make your employees loyal for life if you stand up for them. Always. Especially in front of others--even if you think, or know, they've done something wrong. Assume that if they made a mistake, you have not trained them well enough. Either way it's an issue to be dealt with in private between you and the employees--no one else.

It's not your standard happy-cheerleader self-help book. Nearly every page contains solid advice in an unabashed how-to style. Shapiro makes no effort to soften her message. Like it or not, she says, here's how the world of work operates in the 21st century.Shapiro seems uniquely qualified to write this book, due to her background in Human Resources. And she's not afraid to say out loud what we've always suspected: The HR people are not your friends. They're protecting the company -- not you!Shapiro's message can be summed up in one sentence. Whenever you're dealing with your company you're on the stage. Don't let your guard down, whether you're at a party or a one-on-one informal meeting. Watch your email. Don't make waves, gossip or sound negative.If all this advice sounds elementary, you have never been a career consultant! Many of my savvy, sophisticated, experienced clients have trouble recognizing these rules. Even more resist. Some, like me, know all the rules but can't bring ourselves too follow them. Eventually we end up working for ourselves, with all the pluses and minuses.This book explains why so many employees hire coaches and consultants to gain access to a confidential confidante -- a safety valve, sounding board and objective outsider. When you open up to someone off the job, you're more likely to keep quiet on the job. That's worth everything you pay an outsider and more.Shapiro does not paint a pretty or pleasant picture. Need vacation? Take one week at a time. Take your second week six months later. Having a baby? You may or may not be eligible for Family Leave...and you have to work twice as hard when you return. Getting older? Take half your allotted sick days...fewer if possible.In some ways, I'd actually move to higher levels of paranoia.\\"Watch your expense account!\\" Shapiro urges. But I would go further. On the road, you'll often enjoy a couple of drinks and a movie in your room. Arrange to be billed separately so your company never sees these expenses. Alcohol should appear only as authorized client entertainment and nobody will believe you watched a G-rated Disney feature. Why give the accountants a good laugh?Also, I would urge employees to study their own cultures. Shapiro gives hints, e.g., qualities of promoted managers will tell you about a company's values (p. 44). But I'd be wary of blanket principles, like, \\"It's okay to refuse a promotion.\\" In some companies, you'd be signing your own pink slip.And if the boss works late on a big project, Shapiro says, hang around and offer to be helpful. Well, if you're a female, be extra careful about sending the wrong signals to a male boss as you hang around in the evening, offering to make copies and send out for pizza. Even if you're totally innocent, your loyalty could be misinterpreted.Finally, Shapiro continues to reflect the corporate party line, even as she's drawing back a curtain to reveal the truth. She encourages us to assume that companies make rational decisions, so if you follow the rules, you'll be rewarded.Most of the time that assumption will be accurate. Certainly expressing this assumption aloud will show you're loyal.But companies all too often have hidden agendas. You can be targeted for a layoff because your boss's boss wants to nail your own manager and you're a pawn. You may have been hired with the hope that you'll fail because management doesn't want to invest too much in your product line. You may be fired because of a merger arranged halfway around the world. You could be transferred to Outer Nowhere and fired two weeks later. You could take on a humongous overload in an emergency and then get fired because you didn't perform effectively.But as Shapiro says, most of time we sow our own seeds of destruction: a show of disrespect, an extra drink at an official party, a discussion of personal life, a toy bear on your desk, an offensive style of dressing or ...well, you name it. She could have underlined her warning to avoid hints of any illegal or unethical conduct, even jokingly. A friendly puff of illegal substances at a party and now you're labeled a drug dealer.To be sure, some companies can be incredibly warm, sensitive and caring. Clients tell me of getting amazing support during anything from nervous breakdowns to childbirth.However, if this book really makes you feel ill, I recommend picking up a handful of books about starting your own business. But leave them at home -- not even in your briefcase! And hire your own listeners to talk about your dreams. You'll save a fortune in the long run."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"DO NOT ASSUME YOU UNDERSTAND CORPORATE POLITICS AND HR POLICIES UNTIL YOU READ THIS BOOK. This book is by far the best book I have read on the subject and I have read many.The book specifies that the company draws a clear distinction, without telling you, whether you are someone the company wants to keep or get rid of. To make matters worse, in this highly litigious society, companies cannot and does not tell you which side you belong.If a company thinks you are an unwanted employee, the last thing they tell you is say exactly that in fear of getting sued. Rather, they use various tactics such as giving you too much work, giving you the most stressful projects, and just making life difficult for you as possible so you will leave voluntarily. If you are one of the unwanted employees, it is best to leave. What is the litmus test? If the employer doesn't give you a counteroffer or show strong regret that you are leaving, then they wanted to get rid of you anyway and you made the right choice.If you are one of the high performers who the company wants to keep, they make it as clear as possible. After all, no one gets sued for promoting an employee. The fact is companies identify employees who will never be downsized because they are indispensable. In effect, they are \\"Made\\" and they cannot be touched unless they really screw up their good standing with the corporation.If you want to move up the corporate ladder, not only must you show competence, but you must show loyalty. You must prove yourself as someone the company can trust with their business, money, and personnel.How can you prove yourself as someone trustworthy? Here are few pointers outlined in the book:1)Don't threaten the company or your boss. Don't go to HR with complaints (deal with issues privately). Don't make trouble, otherwise you are seen as a potential risk for lawsuits.2)Watch what you say. Do not be negative, and support the corporate policies and procedures. Do not gossip and speak out against the authorities.3)Cultivate good relationship with your boss. Do not fight your boss, you will never win.4)Keep personal life personal and do not bring it to work.5)Mingle with the right crowd. Do not mingle with the \\"downsizers\\" who will be axed the next time the company wants to cut people.6)Being promoted often means you have shown you are fully capable of being successful in the next job. Just being successful in your present one does not suffice."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"The book is essentially a user manual on how to survive, thrive and prosper within the institutionalization typically found inside large US corporations. Having worked in such environments for more than 20 years now, I can say that many of the 50 \\"secrets\\" in the book are indeed valid, although they hardly can be regarded as secrets. Most of the material presented will be already familiar to those having spent any length of time working in your typical US corporation. Nevertheless, many employees and first level managers will find the material entertaining - being laid out bare and shamelessly as it is.There are five chapters that cover various aspects of the subject matter, progressing from mere survival in chapter 1, to ensuring that one holds on to that important first level management position once it is achieved, in chapter 5.Early chapters rightly clarify the actual role of the HR department as protecting the corporation's interests rather than employee's individual interests - a common misconception among some employees. In addition, a whole array of undesirable traits and behaviors are identified that are likely to leave an employee sidelined or targeted for layoff.In later chapters, the author strongly advocates, as the primary (and only) means or achieving success, adopting a fawning, sycophantic relationship with one's manager (gatekeeper) in order to curry favor, and gain his approval and trust. The proffered outcome of this behavior is immediate promotion and entry into the Inner Sanctum of the corporation. The Inner Sanctum contains those indispensable employees who are the corporation, as opposed to those regular employees that only work there. Over the years, having observed many incompetent morons achieve management positions using this technique, I can vouch for it's validity. However, it is hardly a universal model - and there are no other approaches presented. In the end, the author appears to recognize this weakness and wonders what the resulting outcome would be like if all promotions in a corporation were based on this single approach. Well I can tell her - and it ain't pretty!!I would like the author to have explored some different techniques and types of manager/employee relationships that might result in success for the employee within the institution, rather than just focusing on one single obsequious approach. In my experience, corporate hierarchies based on this type of relationship also typically involve subjugation of subordinates by supervisors. That's just not a healthy trait to have repeated at various level throughout an organization - and unlikely to help it succeed in the long term.I think the lack of insight into other manager/employee relationships, that might result in advancement for the employee, is the main deficiency of the book and for that reason I give it 3 instead of 4 stars."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"Corporate Confidential is the kind of book that everyone who works in the corporate environment should have and review on a regular basis. Its primary strength is that is disabuses employees of their naivet&eacute; about working in a corporation. As the author states - the company employs you for their needs - not yours. Every day - an employee is on stage and every action, behavior, and attitude is being evaluated. You have no \\"rights\\" (to employment or even privacy) and loyalty to the organization (more importantly, your superiors) is paramount. All this would seem like a statement of the obvious, but it is amazing how many employees don't grasp these basics and get \\"downsized\\" or \\"managed out\\" - hence the need for Corporate Confidential.That being said, I found the author to be a bit too much of a corporate cheerleader, and the book neglected some important caveats. A major theme of the book is to determine the corporation's real (hidden agenda) value system, honor it, and put yourself in alignment with it. What is not addressed is if that value system, upon examination, is incompatible with yours or toxic and corrupt (re: Enron.) The book is rather silent on this key issue, but then again, it's more of a \\"go along to get along\\" guide.The book is also silent on several other key issues, such as a proactive career plan and exit strategy once a given job has reached diminishing returns for your career growth. Perhaps too many subjects for one book, but I thought it should be at least referenced. There sometimes (or often) comes a point that you simply won't be able to get along with the organization (or its culture or management), and it's time to leave. Better that you make that decision and select the timing rather than others, and have them wistfully saying that they wished you had stayed. As the author states - image is everything. I once heard of a \\"job\\" defined as what you do between job searches.Another point where the author is a bit too corporate is the issue of legal actions to confront illegal behavior (discrimination, sexist behavior, etc.) Although her point that your career with that company will be over at that point (why would you want to continue working for them anyway?) the oft-stated caution that such actions will follow you in your career is simply not true. I know of several such actions that were settled or arbitrated for significant sums (in other words, did not go to court), and a condition of that was that both parties remain silent on the issue. The employees (who were managers/executives) involved went on to other positions of equal or greater responsibility. They didn't need to provide any explanation in subsequent interviews of why they left because the prior company that they took to the mats (and its management) had an industry reputation (and large turnover) - no explanation necessary (and of course, they did not offer specifics.) The author does state that if you plan to take such actions - retain a lawyer early-on, tell no one - and initiate the action only after you leave (which is exactly what the above-referenced individuals did.)All in all - Corporate Confidential is a valuable reference - and one you should have if you work in the corporate space. Perhaps the most significant message it gets across is that a job is just a job, your fellow employees are not your friends, keep your opinions to yourself (and cautious when asked) and your mouth shut. I know more than a few people who are chronically unemployed because they simply don't grasp these truisms."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"In Corporate Confidential, Cynthia Shapiro teaches us how to survive the dehumanizing privations of employment in what perhaps has become one of the most pathological institutions in human history--the American Corporation. While Miss Shapiro's revelations and prescriptions may be advantageous in helping individuals climb the corporate ladder, many are antithetical to psychological well-being. Hardly a pragmatic long-term strategy. It's amusing that the cover of this book dons faceless images of corporate employees, as this is probably how many corporations view their workforce."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"This book could be turned into a musical ala \\"How to Succeed in job hunting\\" in disgusting \\"corporate america\\". Having retired from a career in HR/Legal for companies large and small, good and bad, I can't quarrel with the contents. But it still makes me sick to my stomach that American business has turned into the greed head enterprise that it is. We need to build more prisons to house the corporate criminals and Wall Street thugs who have destroyed the dignity of honest work. The least qualified inmates have taken over the asylum."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I recently lost my job at a large software company and did not understand why. My sales numbers were exceptional, my relationships with my partners were fantastic, my internal customers were happy, but my new management was being vague and distant. I did not realize that there was a serious problem with my management's perception of me and that there was a plan to move me out of the company. Three weeks after I was terminated, I found Corporate Confidential. I would have seen and understood what was coming if I had read this book even three months before I was terminated. And the worst part is that I could have turned the situation around and kept my job quite easily by following a few simple steps outlined in this book.You must read Corporate Confidential to know how to survive and thrive in the new corporate world that exists today. Rule number 1 is that HR is not on your side and number 2 corporations are more paranoid than ever about the legal ramifications (i.e. lawsuits and legal settlements) of terminating employees. So many of us are overly busy and working too hard to notice the rules have changed the employment relationship. It may take a year or so for this book to be noticed, but I believe Corporate Confidential is a classic. It gets to the point, gives very clear examples and addresses 50 \\"corporate sins\\" that you must avoid. Read it or pay the consequences."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"This book needed to be written. I am so glad that someone finally did.I am a intermediate level manager for a mid to large size corporation, and I need to admit that I have seen many things I wish I could say didn't exist. I can't count how many times I have been told that I can't give a promotion, or need to reduce someones annual bonus based upon things other than the individuals ability, efficiency, or productivity levels. The standard, you need to work harder to improve these areas ... in order to achieve what you are looking for, is just plain wrong.I can't tell these people to go out and get this book, but I can hope that others will tell them, and that you folks will understand how helpful this book really could be for you. After all these years at my company, I find many of the secrets useful for me and my career. I can't leave my copy out on my desk in the office, but I keep it on my shelf at home for quick access. I know it will help others as well. (I am sorry I can't state my name or location, but I don't wish to incurr problems at my company. I am sure many of you will understand).Good reading.."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"There is a very good reason it has a 5 star rating, it will absolutely knock you for a loop. Forget everything you thought you knew about corporate life and read this book. I used to have the feeling that I was very close to \\"getting it\\" politically around the office - but not quite there; that there was something I was missing. No amount of research, open-mindedness, mentoring or between the lines listening will get you to the destination this book will take you, and quickly.I started reading on Friday and was afraid to return to my high-profile job at a Fortune 20 company until I was finished. Being enlightened to the thought processes and inner-workings of management has made an immediate impact on my career. Imagine there being a fine line between yourself and a co-worker both considered for promotion and advancement. Coming in second by a nose means you lose. Not by a nose, you just lose. If you win, and once in your new office, then what? Answers contained within this excellent book. As well as how easy it is to blow it once you \\"arrive\\". If, like me, you expend significant effort, dedication and committment in a sincere love for your company and career to get ahead, why not take the extra time to get it right? And for less then $15.00. Hate to sound like a commercial, but WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?Expecting excellence, I'm rarely floored by products or services - and always too busy to write up those feelings. However, this is something I had to take the time to do - write a review and wholeheartedly recommend this book.Good luck in your career. -JB"},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"This book doesn't pretend that everything is perfect in our companies and if we just work harder in the workplace, spend more hours, and learn more skills, that everything will be okay and work out better for us in the end.I knew there was more to company motivations than just producing well, and the author had the guts to tell me both the things I knew were happening but couldn't prove, and things I was doing which were stopping me from the promotion I have been trying to get for the last year or two.This book isn't all fluff with the reader spending his/her time looking for the one piece of good information. The entire book is filled with substance, and is immediately useful at work. Everything in this book rings true, and makes a lot of sense.This is the book I have been waiting for. It is definately a keeper."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"Much of the first part can be summed up as:1) Watch your mouth;2) The boss is always right;3) Don't cause inconvenience.That much is pretty intuitive, though certainly (as she illustrates with several anecdoes) there are some newcomers for whom it isn't and would benefit from reading about it rather than having to learn the hard way. The book also describes ways you can tell if you've walked onto thin ice and what to do for damage control; these things are less intuitive and definitely worth noting.As for item 3, she often points out that \\"inconvenience\\" often includes things which are one's rights under the law -- such as family leave, workman's comp, legal redress of grievances -- which will get you on the short list to be laid off under a pretext. The book even warns against reporting harrassment. Okay, ringing up one's lawyer on speed dial needn't be the only way to handle things, but what are you supposed to do when it's particularly vile or telling the offender to cut it out doesn't work? It's fairly disheartening, actually, though I suppose I shouldn't blame the messenger.Still, there are times when it seems like the author has drunk quite a bit of the Kool-Aid. She has lots of experience and almost certainly has seen real-life examples of Bill Lumbergh from Office Space or Pointy-Haired Boss from Dilbert. Not much is written about them or what one should do in a toxic environment. If a second edition is written, what would be valuable is more practical advice on how to deal with difficult personalities, especially those who could wreck one's livelihood on a whim. (Hopefully the answer will be something other than to keep smiling and buy antacid in bulk.)At the end there is a section for new managers. That's definitely worth a read for anyone who comes into such a position for the first time, and may keep one from crashing and burning. I suspect this is a subject not often covered elsewhere, though that itself could be the subject for its own book."},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"The author does a very informed analysis of challenges in workplace which can help you in getting promotion.

I really don't think it's as awful as that.That said, I also feel that even if one follows her advice to the letter, one still might get downsized. After all, when the business heads south some one has got to go and bad things happen. In those circumstances, it might not matter how hard you've worked or how cheerful and appealing you are.Probably one should just concentrate on doing the best job possible.

It is a very practical and eye opening book. All people in their first few years of work should read it. It will save you from making mistakes.While her advice is generally sound and based on her experience, this book is not based on verifiable studies. Instead, most of it seems based on anecdotal evidence. Also, she makes some broad statements that are not supportable. On p. 159, it states that in order to be a manager and do it right a \\"full 75% of your thoughts, actions and life will be for or about the company.\\" The 75% is clearly an invented number. On p. 128, it states that you should carry around a planner because it will make you seem more important.

And, why should they when there are courses that teach the expectations of performance and its consequences?Confusing many employees and resulting in further workplace conflicts are administrator work speeches that focus on \\"the best workers,\\" promises of workplace betterment, and recitals of the written policies that clearly conflict with many standard operating procedures. Oftentimes, those very policies are practiced arbitrarily by those administrators, and at the consequence of the \\"best\\" employees.With 17-years in law enforcement and approximately four years working in Internal Affairs, my eyes have certainly been opened as to how the world of human resources works and how important internal relationships are if you wish to keep your job, and better yet, promote.This book is a must-read for those in law enforcement who hope to survive those internal issues, as well as any employee hoping to establish a long-term career and positive reputation. It is a fantastic book for association and union representatives to read, and one that could compliment any business course. And, mentoring others with it could only make the workplace a better place to work -- especially for those whose parents who didn't tell them (maybe their parents made those very mistakes themselves and never learned to do better.).There is a fine-lined difference between what is said and what is done. Anyone who wishes to keep their job, avoid initiating complaints and lawsuits, and wants to know what the unwritten rules of business are may find it here, and should be able to strategize their moves across their vocational landscape with success.Thank you, Cynthia Shapiro, for being so candid and for this excellent book!"},{"Title":"Corporate Confidential: 50 Secrets Your Company Doesn't Want You to Know---and What to Do About Them","review":"I am only about two years into corporate america, so this book was an amazing eye opener for me and a GREAT career booster.

I have read a ton of books on this subject and this by far is the best!

The book is all about the shadowy side of influence and career advancement. There is a bright, sunny side as well that is less Machiavellian, but that is not the topic of this book. The fact that the sunny, rosy side is missing is not a negative feature about this book, you just need to read that someplace else.Everyone who is building their career should read this and pay attention.

Now I know it for sure. Ms. Shapiro blew that myth wide open. I have never read a business book that was such a page turner. Reading this book showed me how to get ahead in my next job. I have made too many mistakes for that to happen in my current job! The favorite part for me was when Ms. Shapiro explains WHY tattoo's and piercings are not acceptable on the job, no matter how 'artsy' or 'creative' the environment supposedly is. I don't have either, but I've always thought they were inappropriate for work. I have recommended this book to every single one of my friends, employed or not. One of them is even experimenting with the ideas in this book for six months to see if it makes a difference in how she is perceived at work. If you have ever been unsure about how to use office email, or how to decorate your desk, who you should hang out with at work and how to handle those dreaded 'yearly reviews' then read this book.

He's decided that he's ready to marry his girlfriend Angela -- a fiery Greek-Irish executive assistant with amazing new components -- and start over. Divorce is not an option, what with half of his formidable assets on the line.So Max agrees to meet Angela's cousin's buddy, a hit-man named Popeye. What Max doesn't know is that Popeye is actually Angela's real boyfriend. He's a psychopathic Irish \\"proveen\\" -- a small-time enforcer for the \\"Ra\\" (IRA), who are smart enough to keep him at arm's length. Predictably, given this cast of characters, the hit goes down, plenty of things go awry, and things start to spin out of control.Compounding matters is a hood named Bobby Rosa, now confined to a wheelchair, who makes his living blackmailing couples engaged in compromising relationships. Through sheer coincidence, Rosa happens to snap some shots of Max and Angela \\"celebrating\\" his wife's departure. Once Rosa confronts Fisher -- who is already under heavy police scrutiny -- with the photos, the plot swings in a rush of completely unpredictable turns.You'll be hard-pressed to tell where Bruen's work ends and Starr's begins. The story is seamless and pulse-pounding. The characterizations are deep; you'll feel you've gotten under the skin of Max, Angela, and even the nutcase hit-man. My guess is you won't be able to stop reading until you flip the last page."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"BUST is the result of an unholy alliance between Ken Bruen and Jason Starr, two modern masters of noir fiction. They bring together a fearsome and wondrous mix of vile characters on the streets of New York City to create a caper novel worthy of Westlake or Leonard, but with the dark edge of...well, Bruen and Starr.Max Fisher is a software millionaire who's tired of Deirdre, his shrewish, ungrateful and unappreciative wife. The fact that Fisher is seeing Angela Petrakos, his Greek-Irish secretary, isn't helping matters. Angela is the perfect combination of angel and hooker, with a bit of gold digger thrown into the mix. When Fisher wonders out loud what life would be like without Deirdre, Angela wastes no time in setting up a meeting between Fisher and a very strange hitman known only to him as \\"Popeye.\\" The shooter is Angela's paramour, Dillon, fresh off the boat from Dublin. Their plan is to acquire Fisher's fortune for themselves. The only problem is that Angela is no longer crazy about Dillon, and Dillon feels the same way about Angela.Dillon is without question a bad guy, but there's no one here who is truly likable --- except perhaps for Bobby Rosa, a redoubtable paraplegic who spends his days brooding bitterly over his past career as a criminal and surreptitiously taking photographs of women. Rosa's likeability is only made possible by the revelation of a soft side one would not expect. When he has the chance to blackmail Fisher, however, he jumps at the opportunity. Everyone in BUST is caught in a dark, swirling whirlpool that takes everything and gives nothing.This is a dark, gritty and inappropriately hilarious cautionary tale --- exquisitely conceived and flawlessly written --- about getting what you think you want and regretting it, and the endless consequences of evil deeds.BUST may have spoiled me for reading anything else for a while. I haven't had a book make me feel this entertained in such a warped fashion since I read DIG THAT CRAZY GRAVE by Richard Prather at the tender age of 10. But that's another story. For now, don't let another sun set without reading BUST.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"BUST is a never-before-published book in the Hard Case Crime series. Hard Case Crime books contains classic crime novels as well as new thrillers. One thing all these stories have in common (I've read six of them) is that none of the characters are good people. Bust takes that to the extreme. Max Fisher is having an affair with Angela. Max hates his wife and hires someone Angela knows to kill his wife. Angela lives with Dillon and is only after Max for his money. Bobby is a wheelchair bound criminal blackmailing Max. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Each character commits a heinous act after heinous act, each plot turn worse than the one before, each character action is usually a crime to cover up a previous crime. None of the characters are sympathetic. All of them are clueless. And that is why I recommend this violent, gritty novel. It fits right in with the genre. If you like Hard Case Crime books, then you must read this one. If you are new to the series, I suggest checking out a classic to get familiar with what to expect. There is nothing uplifting in BUST, but that doesn't mean you still can't enjoy the awful selfishness of the evil characters."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"When I first heard of this Bruen/Starr collaboration, I was thrilled as this are two of the best (and two of my favorite) new master of the hardboiled tradition. So expectations were high when I sat down to read the result.Well, BUST delivers. In spades! Watching a \\"simple\\" murder plan unravel chapter by chapter is BUST in a nutshell. And what a ride! The pace is rocket speed, the characters wonderfully crooked, crazy, obsessed, inept and memorable. The dialogue is sharp and, at times, laugh out loud funny. If you like great hardboiled fiction, you can't go wrong with BUST. It's everything a great crime novel should be. Destined to be a classic. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"These three books -- BUST, THE MAX, and SLIDE -- by Ken Bruen and Jason Starr are good raunchy fun. They use the classic formulas of crime fiction and squeeze them for all the suspense and humor they can muster. I like these books much better than many hardcover novels, with or without crime elements. I was reading THE MAX for the second time and laughed out loud on every page of Chapter One, with Max in prison. (It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.) The second chapter, from Angela's POV, didn't work as well for me. Max Fisher is a high-flying coke-fueled loser with delusions of grandeur and one of the funniest characters I've met in fiction. These three books are definitely worth a look."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"I ordered Bust based on its Amazon rating alone when scanning Hard Case Crime books, not knowing what to expect. But the cover hardly encouraged me to dive in: it sat on my bookshelf, unread, for months.But when I finally dived in, wow -- what a surprise! Ken Bruen and Jason Starr combine to deliver a coherent, engaging story, the plot reckless enough to be funny without crossing the line of farcical. As the story alternates between the perspectives of four principal characters, as I reader I feel I am observing a developing train wreck, with the only thing certain about the outcome is it's going to get ugly.So while I wouldn't put Bust in the same top league as Hard Case Crime masterpieces Confession, Little Girl Lost, or Songs of Innocence, it's a highly recommended read.The sequel, Slide, goes even further over the deep end, edging close or maybe even crossing that boundary to farce. But despite their differences, each is recommended. Read Bust first, however."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"Ken Bruen is a fine writer with a gift for creating truly nasty villians and that surely accounts for the appeal his dark vision of the nature of some humans has for readers. But this book has the look of a story he knocked over a lost weekend or two so he could pay his bar bill. It's like a rough draft of the first book of a diabolically clever series. He just doesn't seem to have the time or energy to work out the plot details that sustain even a shred of credability. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"I should have read this book before I read \\"Slide\\", which is a sequel, of sorts, to this book. It can stand on its own, however, and be enjoyed even if you have some inkling of what's going to happen to some of the characters in the next book.These two gentlemen writers (Ken Bruen is one of my personal favorites) serve up another portion of murder, mayhem and madness. There is even a sentence or two that recalls \\"The Murder of the Tinkers\\" by Mr. Bruen, which tickled me no end.This is where we first meet Max and Angie and become drawn into their wild and crazy schemes. We also have a psycho hitman, a wheelchair-bound armed robber and pervert, and an over the hill bellman at a fancy hotel.The title of the book is somewhat of a double entendre, because most of the male characters are attracted to large, silicone-enhanced breasts, and Angie certainly holds their attention with hers. It's the usual nuttiness from these two fine writers, and I laughed my way all through the book. There is a third book in this trilogy, \\"The Max\\", which I must get and read to find out the ultimate fate of some of these characters."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"Something needs to be made clear about Bust: You will not like a single character in the book, especially by the end. This is far from a feel-good novel. It will drag you through the dirt more than once and leave you a bloody mess by the time everything is said and done. And, because of that, it's wonderful.The characters in Bust are all self-absorbed, and none of them are looking out for anything beyond their own interests. Every time Bruen and Starr give you some glimmer of humanity for a character, they make them do something despicable which firmly cancels out any sort of empathy you may have for them. Thus, Bust becomes a game of seeing who will get their comeuppance first...and believe me, they get it.In terms of plotting, the book is really solid. One would think a book with two authors and four points of view would turn into a tangled mess, but Bruen and Star interweave things perfectly, elegantly merging character stories and viewpoints with each chapter, leading to a tense plot where you wonder who's going to mess up next.The book will not make you feel good, but it is a tightly written gritty book that will keep you entertained for the short time you are reading it (it's a quick read, too...I read it over the course of a couple of afternoons)"},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"I found this book to be hysterical. I'm not sure how much you would understand if you weren't acquainted with Irish colloquialisms, which I am, maybe you would. I just laughed out loud every few pages at the relentlessly vulgar nature of all of these characters, conscious and unconsciously, how even the 'classy' ones were still common as muck. beautiful study of hard nut people tested to their limits in the most profane way."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"If sparse prosed, fast moving crime noir is your cup of tea then this is the book for you. Clocking in at just 250 pages doesn't leave much room for wordy exposition. Which is refreshing because they get to the heart of the matter real fast. There aren't any good guys here but there are some memorable characters and the plot just keeps twisting round and round. The most annoying thing in the book is that each chapter starts with some nonsensical quote that isn't germain to anything you're about to read. But don't let that minor bit deter you. There is style and substance here."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"Wow, I was blown away by this book. Going in, I wasn't sure what to expect because Starr and Bruen have such different voices. But the Publishers Weekly review puts it best--this is a seamless crime novel. It has a great characters, outstanding dialogue, and what a plot! There are many great twists and turns and toward the end I was turning the pages faster and faster because I just HAD to see what happened next. I've read a lot of great crime novels over the last several years, but this is one of the best. It's right up there with the best of Cain, Willeford, Leonard, etc. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"\\"Bobby came back from the supermarket and cooked himself dinner.... Even Def Leppard couldn't get him out of his funk. When the Def couldn't crank you, it was way past time to shoot someone.\\" -- from BustOften, two authors working together get in each other's way, cancelling out the individual contributions of each in favor of a homogeneous whole. But modern noir authors Ken Bruen and Jason Starr fit together like a married couple with complementary flaws -- all the pieces making a perfect jigsaw relationship, while still retaining those aspects that draw each author's particular cadre of followers.In the new Hard Case Crime offering, Bust, Bruen (who won the 2004 Shamus Award for The Guards and has another solo novel, Calibre, coming out this July) and Starr (2004 Barry Award winner for Tough Luck, with Lights Out coming in September) combine their dark talents to remarkable effect, resulting in a novel that is more than the sum of its participants. Bruen brings his skill at dark humor, downward-spiral characterization, and his familiarity with Irish culture, while Starr offers a simple yet familiar plot with plenty of opportunities for disaster, and characters with a tendency toward casual, unflinching violence. Put together, they make up an absolutely pitch-black novel that ranks with the best of their peers.That said, Bust was hard to get into at first -- I couldn't detect a consistent voice, as if the authors were writing alternating chapters (but perhaps they are merely writing alternating characters). Work your way past the first few chapters, though, and things smooth out and really get flowing.Max Fisher, CEO of NetWorld is having an affair with his Greek-Irish executive assistant, Angela Petrakos. Max wants his wife dead so he can marry Angela, and Angela's cousin knows a guy named Popeye who can do the job right. Trouble is, there is no cousin, and \\"Popeye\\" is actually Angela's boyfriend, Dillon, an Irish \\"Proveen\\" with an unpredictable streak. Meanwhile, Bobby Rosa, a wheelchair-bound ex-robber, is looking to get back into the game with his old pal, Victor, who has gone straight. When these stories come together, all hell breaks loose, and there's no guarantee who is going to come out with what, or even make it to the end with life intact. The limited third-person POV makes the events slightly distant yet still immediate enough to have stunning impact when several shocking events take place that even I, who have read all of the Hard Case Crime novels, could not have predicted. If you sit down with Bust, be ready to stay down for the duration.As a bonus (and a little unintended cross-marketing, perhaps), each chapter begins with a literary quote, like the Inspector Morse mysteries of Colin Dexter. Only these quotes are from other (mostly) modern crime thrillers, including one each from Bruen (The Hackman Blues) and Starr (Tough Luck) individually , as well as a few other Hard Case Crime authors like Allan Guthrie, Richard Aleas, and Domenic Stansberry. Some of my other personal favorites, like Joseph Finder and Joe R. Lansdale, are also represented. What is most remarkable, however, is how apt the quotes are to the chapter contents, considering how limited their sources were. This bit of unnecessary but much appreciated extra effort raises Bust even further above the fray by focusing on clever lines from other entertaining books that are just waiting for me to discover."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"As one of the characters would say - many things about this book are \\"fookin great.\\" I love Jason Starr, and I really liked his collaboration with Bruen here. I agree with a previous reviewer that you can see a bit of difference in tone between the chapters and characters as written by different authors. However, I thought it still worked really well. The chapters start to get in sync with eachother as the characters in them began to collide more, and it's fun to see this happen. As usual with both of these authors, the characters are very well-drawn and not what you'd call sympathetic, with great dark motivations, yet a couple of them still make you somehow want to root for them. The book also has a great plot, lots of wonderful snarky dark humor and double entendres, the promise of tons of twists and double-crosses, and a great if slightly twisted moral center. Basically, this book has everything a great noir book should have.EXCEPT...a killer ending that pulls it all together.This is really the only disappointment. But it's a big one. There were all these great hints of at least 4 or 5 great different directions this book ultimately could go for an ending. Any one (or even two! or three!) of these twists would have been awesome if they were executed in exactly the way the first part of the book was done. But unfortunately, instead, in the last 50 pages, all of a sudden the book tries to go in all 5 directions at once. It doesn't work, and for me, with those 50 pages to go, the whole book just started hurtling downhill fast and then crashed.I am a bigtime noir reader, esp. the classics, and I love dark material and twist endings, but like another reviewer, I have to say that the end of this one just did not work. Overkill on the twists, too many of them coming at you so fast and making so little sense logically, that you really just couldn't suspend your disbelief THAT much. Worse though was that as a result of the sudden HUGE change in pace, the book had to basically discard what was made it great in the beginning - the fun, tense, snarky psychological buildup. There was a total change of tone and pace just to cram in all the \\"action\\" and ultimately the \\"action\\" was convoluted and unsatisfying. This was a major bummer, because all of the ideas and twists were so great that if the authors had stuck to just a few of them and just kept up doing what they were doing, this would have been a near perfect book.I love Starr normally, and I know that other Starr fans are loyal and may not agree, but I had to write this review because this ending left me very disappointed. I would still recommend reading this book because a lot of it is great, but I agree with the other reviewer that it was ultimately unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"This is what I call a good \\"junk\\" read. That is, it is great for the beach, plane trip or business trip. It moves quickly and there is always something happening. There is no one to root for in this book. No hard boiled PI or grizzled detective you can root for. The book is full of sociopaths who the reader hopes eventually get their just desserts. Alliances between the dirtbags form and dissolve as the book moves along but the plot is easy to follow. It's my third hard case crime series book and the most fun read so far. I'm going to try both authors if their solo books look to be any good at all."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"Not quite as good as the 2nd and 3rd volumes of this trilogy. Still worth reading to set up those volumes."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"Great cast of characters; each one trying for the title of the most slimiest and each one convinced that they are not to blame.

How did she know Bobby's address? Was Max the one who told her?. And when she arrives at Bobby's apartment , why doesn't he ask her how she knew his address, how she knew where to find him, where he lived?I cannot find my copy at the moment, so I can't just dip back into the book to find out."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"A classic tale of a middle-age, egotistical businessman, Max, who wants to have his wife killed rather than give her half his money in a divorce. Max, ofcourse, wants to marry his young, sexy, half-Irish, half-Greek secretary. The secretary, ofcourse, has other plans, and enlists the help of her thug boyfriend. Numerous plot twists and unexpected events keep the reader entertained. All the characters are hilarious buffoons. The writing is modern and edgy, which I enjoyed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"This is an awesome book. It's darkly humorous, and the pacing is lightning-fast. The characters are not really likeable, but they are so crazy and funny you don't care. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter are great--I was always looking back to see how each one applied to its chapter. This is hard-boiled noir at its finest. Bust is one of Hard Case Crime's best books, and I will be looking for more books by Bruen and Starr."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"Hilarious! I started this novel on a sunny afternoon and didn't put it down until the sun was gone and I had read the last word. These Hard Case Crime novels have been growing on me, and Bruen and Starr have a winner with Bust. I'm a big fan of the dark, comic, quirky, everything-goes-wrong crime stories, and Bust does not disappoint. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities (you wouldn't want any of these people as your neighbor), the criminals are vicious but mostly bumbling, and each small event snowballs until it pulls in all the characters in total chaos.Good stuff!The quotes at the beginning of each chapter are a nice little touch (and led me to add a few more books to my ever growing wishlist), and Bruen and Starr somehow manage to work together to create a fast moving, interesting, funny, and dark crime thriller. I am now eager to read Slide, the sequel to Bust, and I'll definitely be moving on to other novels written by both of these authors. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"I have managed to down probably a dozen of the hard case books. Before 'Bust' I had enjoyed every one. What I didn't like so much about 'Bust' was the fact that it tried to pull the same moves as the 'real' authors in this series, only instead of noirish quips, all you get here is bathroom humor. This is also the first book that was written not decades ago, but here in the 2000's that I have read in the series. So this is not an uncovered classic that time has overlooked, but a book written to feel that way.I really tried to get into this book and give it a solid chance. I first put it down after 75 pages and came here to write a scathing review over its gibberish. However, I was sort of shocked to see all the great reviews, so I gave it another 75 pages. Then in disgust I flipped through the last few just to see how it would end. That's what this book is, a page flipper. If you read every sentence, your mind will go numb over the repetitive nature of Bruen's style and technique.Most definitely... read the HARD CASE CRIME books, just stay away from this lemon."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"The book was pretty standard noir, the only problem was that the characters were not very cool.

Although it is a humor/mystery novel, there is no doubt about how events will develop, and these characters are about as appealing as preservative-laced, plastic-packages versions of the foods that are cooked in the home. Not only is it predictable, but there is a dramatic lack of humor, despite attempts to the contrary. It is written in the style of a Donald Westlake novel, but without the spark of liveliness that makes those so distinctive."},{"Title":"Bust (Hard Case Crime)","review":"None of the characters were likeable, the story wasn't that interesting and it was really annoying how they tried to write an Irish accent.

Because it is entertaining and a joy to read (even when someone is telling the most depressing story about young hope cut short by unwanted pregnancy, spousal abandonment, etc.), I suspect that there was good editing done, but in the most unobtrusive way.I will never use the term Hillbilly lightly again.Good to read in conjunction with Warmth of Other Suns; that way I got the deep sense that there is \\"immigration\\" within America, between the states. Backwards blacks and whites had to escape from their backgrounds to the cities to improve themselves. Just because someone is a poor white doesn't mean they had it easier. Life is deadly cruel to everyone poor."},{"Title":"Hillbilly women","review":"I came across this book at a local charity book sale.My copy is a paperback published in 1972;no less than 33 years ago.I thumbed it open and just happened to land on page 54;and here's what I got:\\"While I was working in a restaurant,this guy come in here and he was drunk.He ordered ham and eggs.He ate about half the eggs and then he just laid his face right down in the plate,right in the eggs.I went over to him and I said,\\"You better better get your face up out of those eggs.\\" Well,he raised up and looked at me,then he reached over and pinched me.So I hit him over the head with a ketchup bottle.I never did have too much trouble when I worked in the restaurant.\\"So,I picked up the book and thought it would be folksy and humorous.Such was not the case,I happened to fall on the only thing funny in the book.This is a very serious book and is a series of interviews of 19 women telling about their dreams,hopes,fears,trials and tribulations,happiness,but more often sorrow and disappointment in thying to live,work,raise families,and obtain the great American promise of Life,Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.What we see it that promise was far from attainable for many who lived in those mountains of Southern Appalacia for several generations and continues today.The same thing has gone on,and continues to prevail in many parts of North America.Ghettos of many cities,Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl,isonated fishing villages in Newfoundland,Indian Reservations,and rural areas too numerous to list.It seems that the greatest barrier for these people to really change their situation is their great love of their countrysidecoupled with their love of family and friends.The only solution is migration and any idea that the government will look after you and solve the problems where you are is nothing short of fantasy.This has been proven by countless waves of emmigration from all kinds of oppressive systems and even governments around the world.I have experienced the same hopelesness of enjoying the good life where I was born.The solution was to get a good education and go to where the opportunities and justice can be found.I have no personal experiences with the Appalacians, but everyone knows that was where Dolly Parton,Lorretta Lynn and all kinds of successful people originated.I am sure there are all kinds of similar successes in every walk of life.Nobody who is mired down in these areas will tell you that you should pack up and leave;you have to figure it out for yourself.Overall an excellent portrayal but unfortunately no solutions are addressed.It would be a good topic for the author to find people who moved on and improved their lots and write a follow up book.The 19 women covered in this book are all beautiful people all in their own way.Shirley Summerour has a striking resembelance to Shania Twain ,another person who didn't have it handed to her on a silver platter.She knew from a very early age that the only one who was going to look after her --was herself!"},{"Title":"Hillbilly women","review":"Im looking for a copy of Hillbilly Women to buy for myself.

The simple prose has been admonished by some reviewers as poor description and character building, asking for more flowery language. First of all, this book is about the plague and from the perspective of a simple woman--not a noble woman with delicate sensibilities. I appreciated the down to earth style of writing, as the character, Anna, appears to be a \`down to earth' kind of woman.

Married off as early as possible - usually to someone they can barely tolerate - women do the dirty work (men's work is no better) of cleaning, cooking, finding food, submitting to a husband's desires, having babies and raising what children survive.Throw into this the spectre of disease - the plague! It comes in the guise of a tailor who rents a room from a needy widow with two young boys and quickly spreads throughout the village. People of 'substance and power' - the minister and the leading family - show their stripes in this terrible time. Each proves to be less than they represent and do so with consequence to all who surround them.If you want a read that keeps you turning pages and thanking your lucky stars that you live in modern times - this is it!

Somehow the idea seems more interesting in theory then it came across in the book. Some of the dynamics of the relationships Brooks explores are interesting, but overall, the characters are basically all led by the rector, who is actually the one that decides they should quarantine themselves. It's not until the very end that there is any question of where exactly he gets his authority to decide everything for the people. I would think there would be more controversy about this throughout the book as people start to doubt not just their faith in God but in one another. Most of the middle of the book just dwells (over and over) on the themes of why-do-bad-things-happen-to-good-people and how could a loving God send such a plague. The rector meets these questions by asking in return, who are we to question God's purpose. It seems a deeper exploration of these themes would also ask whether it is not presumptious of the rector to assume he is right in ascribing a heavenly purpose to the plague. This question does get explored, but only just before the end of the book, and not in much depth.** spoiler alert ** Brooks is a very engaging writer, though, and the story is interesting enough to keep reading. Although I don't quite understand Brooks' purpose in veering off so abruptly from the entrenched storyline in the last 100 pages. And having read (and disliked) Brooks' non-fiction work Nine Parts of Desire, where she places the blame on Islam for all the troubles faced by Muslim women, I found it very strange that Brooks would chose to give the main character of the Year of Wonders (Anna) a happy and peaceful life in her escape to the Muslim world. It is unfortunate that Brooks couldn't have shown that peaceful side of Islam in Nine Parts of Desire."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was reluctant to read this book, even though it had been highly recommended. The Black Death just doesn't make for enjoyable reading usually. However, I was hooked just a few chapters into the book. \\"Year of Wonders\\" is a great title - it's about seeing everyday miracles in the face of trying times, and the book manages to be touching and serious while not making readers too miserable to continue.Unfortunately, an unforeseen ending left me feeling disappointed. If there had been some foreshadowing before the epilogue, I could have been more accepting of the plot but such was not the case.I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this book to anyone, but if someone had already checked it out of the library, I wouldn't dissuade him from reading it - it's a good way to pass the time. I would be interested in reading more from Geraldine Brooks, but I hope in her books to come, she makes the plot more connected."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was loaned to me by a friend who thought I'd appreciate this powerful story of a young wife and mother who has no choice but to take charge and step outside the domestic boundaries of her life in a small English village, slowly and insidiously being invaded by the black plague. This story is grounded in fact as the village does exist today and historical records confirm that it was quarantined as a plague village, where provisions were left outside the village boundaries to keep the villagers from starving and the plague contained. This book really is about boundaries, physical, social, moral and personal. Ultimately it is a story of empowerment and triumph.Many historians credit the massive loss of life and devastation caused by the plague in Europe with the breakdown of the rigid social class structure,the rise of a sense of self determination in the lower classes and the first chink in the armor of the Church. People wandered the countryside in bands, flogging themselves and calling out to God to take pity upon them, believing it was brought upon them as a punishment for their sins. Wealth, power, social standing or a spotless soul could not protect them from the plague. The great leveler.As they watched their innocent children die, their faith died as well and they looked for those who lived at the fringes of society as possible causes of the plague, believing they were either an abomination to God or in league with the devil. The physically deformed, the mentally ill and Jews were tortured and burned as were women who had supplied their neighbors with herbal remedies, delivered the village babies and been the only source of medical help many had ever known. Such was the case in this small village and at enormous risk to herself the heroine in this story takes matters of life and death into her own hands as she watches those around her,including her small children die an excruciating death from the plague. She enters into a deep friendship and collaboration with a very wise woman,the wife of the village cleric, and together they breach the accepted boundaries of religious, social and medical practice of their day. Again at great peril, as they work feverishly to break the grip of the plague in their village. We're also reminded in a twist in this story that we often make assumptions about those we believe we know so well, and that a public facade can hide great private pain.In the end, the plague left unspeakable agony and chaos behind, but also the opportunity for a renaissance for the survivors. The complete breakdown of all of society's barriers, as happened throughout Europe in the time of the plague,liberated those left alive and changed the world profoundly. Our heroine is no exception and the ending is very satisfying if a little implausible. This is why I gave it four stars. Nevertheless, a very good read by a very talented writer!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book is itself a wonder. The attention to period detail and use of archaic, but accessible, language make it a pleasure to read. Having read about many \\"truth-is-stranger-than-fiction\\" events in the lives of real historical characters, I think some of the customer reviews are nitipicking the book's satisfying ending. I also think their quibbling over feminism in the novel is groundless. As a teenager in the 1950s, I was scoffed at for expressing some feminist leanings. Human nature remains the same throughout the times, and I felt nothing out of place in Year of Wonders.

The rector saved countless lives when he persuaded his townsmen and women to quarantine their village in hopes of stopping the spread of plague to nearby villages. That he reasoned quarantine might stop the spread AND persuaded his neighbors to \\"stay put\\" is truly a wonder.Brooks' journalism background provides the perfect marriage of research, detail and accuracy to a work of fiction.

But it didn't really sink in - the absolute horrific reality of people dying all around you, of isolating the well with the sick and abandoning them to their fate for fear of contagion, the search for blame and persecution of innocent people who perhaps were spared for some reason or other.&quot;Year of Wonders&quot; is a fictionalized account of a true event - it tells the story of a a small village in England in the 1660's which, faced with the devastation of the Black Plague, had the courage to seal the village off from the outside and thus contain the disease within. It is fascinating to read about how the villagers each cope with the illness in a different way, some turning to witchhunt, some to greed, some to flagellism.I gave this book 4 stars only because I felt that the end didn't seem to match up with the rest of the story - the author seemed to have run out of ideas of how to find a fitting ending to the story.

At the encouragement of its pastor, the town decides to quarantine itself in order to stop the spread of the disease. Throughout their year of suffering, villagers turn from medicinal remedies to witch-hunting to outlandish religious practices in hopes of ridding themselves of the disease. By the end of the year, only a third of the town survives, including Anna, a housemaid and the narrator of Brooks' tale.Brooks clearly did extensive research. I enjoyed YEAR OF WONDERS for its rich historical detail, and I felt I learned a great deal about 17th century culture, medicines, language, and foods in her text. I did take issue, however, with the fact that many of her characters seem quite modern, outspoken and corrupt, and thus I found some of them to be unrealistic for the time period about which she is writing. I suppose, though, that in creating liberal, modern-minded characters, Brooks is attempting to make the point that humanity surpasses the bounds of time, that, for hundreds of years, human nature has remained unchanged. The accessibility of the characters also serves to enable modern readers to sympathize with their incredible plight.Somewhat unrealistic characters, however, is the only flaw in this beautiful, well-written novel. For lovers of historical fiction especially, Brooks has offered an entertaining and heartbreaking, reasonably-paced, seemingly accurate read that, as the title suggests, I found to be truly wondrous."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Powerful.

The writing is fluid and easy. The story is well constructed. I like how she presents the real moral challenges when everyone around you is miserably dying but collectively you agree to a voluntary quarantine. It's impressive in fiction and in reality. I think Brooks does some great work encompassing the period - the lingering Puritanism, superstitions, social customs and daily struggles are all well developed and contributory. I was quite caught up in the story. The characters are somewhat idealized and more reflective of their circumstances than may be in real life but otherwise I guess we wouldn't have a story to read.I visited Eyam 15 or so years ago. While it is a beautiful and well preserved village, I really appreciate it more now as this book breathes life in that town and would love to visit again. As others have noted the story does take a serious turn towards the final 50 pages or so which are somewhat hard to grasp but having read too many novels over the past year where such plot turns are cynical and generally just a short cut to wrap things up I think in this case it's one plausible direction for the characters.I don't want to spoil any thing so I will just say I like how she wrapped up her story and would heartily recommend it.

Soon, villagers and whole families are dying in droves, and the parish minister proposes that the village seal itself off from the rest of the country.

In Year of Wonders, the first of her three novels published in this decade, she tackles the familiar territory of the bubonic plague, adding great emotional depth to the reader's understanding of its impact and the now-alien setting in which it appeared. This is one of at least four books I've read over the years that deal with the plague in England, both fiction and nonfiction, and it's by far the most insightful and revealing.Year of Wonders tells the tale of Anna Frith, an 18-year-old mother of two who is widowed when her husband dies accidentally in one of the local lead mines. Hired as a housemaid by the new Anglican pastor, Michael Mompellion and his aristocratic wife, Elinor, who teaches Anna to read and guides her to a more self-confident and sophisticated view of her abilities and the world where she lives. These three are the central figures in the horrific events that unfold when the plague descends on their village. Alone and together, they struggle with often-contradictory thoughts and feelings about faith, love, superstition, and redemption, as the plague strikes down one villager after another, felling whole families virtually overnight, and leaving barely one-third of its 400 inhabitants alive once it finally grinds to a halt.The very best historical fiction can teach better than any textbook or lecture, and Year of Wonders is a brilliant example of that ability. Read this book, and you'll gain a new appreciation of both the virtues and the failings of Christianity as practiced in 17th Century England, and you'll understand the depths of ignorance and superstition that reigned among the overwhelming majority of people living a mere three centuries ago.The title, Year of Wonders, was translated and borrowed from the Latin annus mirabilis of a John Dryden poem describing the year 1666, the setting of this novel. This was not the time of the Black Death that reduced Europe's population by a third but a more localized epidemic that took place three centuries later. Brooks grounded her story in the fascinating tale of the historical English village of Eyam, today called the Plague Village.(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is the story of a small English village invaded by the Plague in 1665 and 1666. The villagers quarantine themselves in order to stop the Plague from spreading to surrounding places. Told from the perspective of Anna, a young widowed maid for the rector and his wife, the story follows the village from the first case of the Plague until the infection and two thirds of the population are gone.This book captivated me from the very beginning. The fact that it's loosely based on a true story is a big reason that I found it so interesting. Brooks made you feel what it would be like to be there and to be one of those people. I felt their fear, their sadness, and their grief. My one complaint about the book, and the reason I didn't give it five stars, is the ending. I felt it was unrealistic and it seemed tacked on almost as an afterthought."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm writing this as a reader who went out and immediately grabbed \\"Year of Wonders\\" after reading and enjoying \\"March.\\"No doubt a ton of research went into \\"Year of Wonders\\" but I would caution potential readers with the fact that Anna Frith, the main narrator, is just too perfect. And this gives the book a strange quality. Anna tends the sick, she manages as a teenage widow and mother, she is dutiful, forthright, and everywhere. At the end, she is tending to the mental (and then physical) well-being of her employer, a vicar. The plague is all around her and she refers to her sadness but we never feel it. The voice is distant, disaffected. It's reflective. It's the old \\"and then something incredible happened\\" kind of thing. The incidents throughout the book feel set up to show us how much Brooks learned about the period--whether it's about alternative medicine of the period, flagellation, or bits about commerce and farming. There's no tension. Okay, there's very little. Anna never so much as coughs or has a bad health day. She seems to rise above the action, to float above it even as others around to depths of misery and despair. The last wrinkle, the bizarre turn of events with Michael Mompellion, felt tacked-on; the relationship between Mompellion and Anna only surfaces as a point of potential interest and conflict after the plague cloud has started to lift.Definitely worth reading if you are a fan of historical fiction. Brooks has a terrific eye for detail and creating a compelling backdrop. The main action just never seemed to rise and take off."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Brooks' Year of Wonders is almost a social commentary in the way it depicts the actions of people under the stress of a catastrophe such as the plague. Her prose is engagingg and haunting. Her detailed descriptions of daily life gave way to a beautiful line like this one: \\"The sun glinted off the serried instruments and then I could see the notes of music, molten, dripping like golden rain.\\" The entire novel is filled to the brim with such imagery, that one can practically taste the scent the apples bring in the vividly described orchards. Everything about this book is so well-imagined. But it falters. There is a chapter-long detour about mining that seemed misplaced, and the bizarre Epilogue is sudden and grossly unbelievable. That shift in tone was uncalled for, and makes one think that it is from another book entirely. Luckily, it is short, and one can forget about it when confronted with the previous narrative. Because until that point, the characters had roundness and well-developed backstories that explained present motivations. Brooks tells of a time that, though seemingly past us, yields emotions and actions that could mirror any disaster in the modern age. Wondrous and rich, Year of Wonders is a treasure that, like a living person, stumbles, yet delivers."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders was a really compelling read. I loved the detail of ordinary life in a remote 17th century English village and really rooted for Anna, the main character. All the characters were very well drawn and the action was believable and moving.My only problem with the book is the bizarre ending which seemed to take it in a 180 degree direction off into Romance Novel Land. The effect was to jerk me out of my belief in the characters and send me wondering what got into the author. And, no-- I'm not talking about the sex, as one reviewer was. I found that believable and satisfying (it's the 17th century, not the Victorian era, and these people were not Puritans!)-- until the sudden and not terribly believable reversal afterwards.I won't give it away and hope it won't discourage anyone from reading the book. I gave it four stars because the first 90% is so very good. The last bit has all been crammed into the final ten pages or so, so it's pretty easy to mentally excise from the rest of the novel."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought this book after reading and thoroughly enjoying Ms. Brooks' \\"March.\\" I'm glad that I did because I couldn't put it down!The story is set in the 17th century and is about the inhabitants of a small village in Derbyshire, England facing an outbreak of the plague. The narrator, Anna Frith, is a seemingly simple young woman who has lived all of her life in the village and knows nothing of the world beyond its confines. As a young widow and mother of two small boys, Anna works as a servant for the village minister and his wife.When Anna takes in a seamstress/cloth merchant as a boarder, it soon becomes evident that \\"plague seeds\\" were among the bolts of cloth he brought with him from London. As he makes clothing for the villagers, the disease spreads and, before long, there is a massive outbreak among the villagers. Collectively, the villagers decide to quarantine themselves so as to contain the plague and not allow it to spread beyond the village. Anna is the reader's witness to this grave sacrifice.\\"A Year of Wonders\\" is an excellent novel fraught with heartbreaking detail and very fine character development. My only criticism is of the ending, as many people have previously mentioned. However, I still recommend the book without hesitation and I look forward to reading more from Ms. Brooks."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I run a large book club in the north east. We hold elections each month for our new book and recently selected, Year of Wonders. Many people were not happy with the selection, as was I. Until we read it. That is the great thing about a book club, it forces you to read something which you may not want to read, only to discover a gem. Although criticism was rampant in our discussion (as is the purpose of a proper book club), all those who were unhappy with the choice, along with everyone else, had announced their love for this book. If you are wavering, please let me urge you to just pick it up. The literary content was delicious, superb and a breath of fresh air. You won't be disappointed.

The story of the villagers plight is gripping and readable, but overall, the characters are lack depth and became tiresome. They wer either near-perfect, virtuous people, stoics or downright evil, nothing in between. The last 80 or so pages are outright ridiculous, even laughable with gratuitous sex and a rather unbelievable ending. Like another reviewer said, maybe the author grew bored and just wanted to finish the story. In the end, the reader really knows little about how villagers planned to begin anew once the plague had passed. Yes, this is a good story that has \\"entertainment\\" value, but don't have high expectations that this is a truly great novel ."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I completely fell in love with this novel. I cried, I actually shed tears at the end of one of the chapters. The thing that stood out the most for me in \\"Year of Wonders\\" was the vocabulary. She really did her research to really make reading this novel feel like you were actually talking or at least watching this grim part of history happen.But then all of a sudden the book just fell apart. The last chapter had so much happen in it, it was just laughable. Like the author was on some kind of deadline and had to get it done in an hour. She could have left the whole last chapter out. I didn't understand it at all.All in all, it still needs a good review, because it really was a good novel. I will recommend it at my work."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It's 1666, and a young tailor visiting a remote English village inadvertently brings the plague when he receives an infected bolt of cloth from London. Anna Frith, his landlady, who is a young widow and mother, tends to him as he dies, and then gets swept up in the epidemic as it spreads around her village, killing everyone who is dear to her and leaving her community in shambles. Year of Wonders is written from Anna's perspective, as she tries to deal with the unbearable pain of loss while trying to bring comfort as a healer to the rest of the village. She becomes an unlikely heroine, learning herb lore and midwifery and joining forces with the rector and his wife to assist both the dying and the living.The villagers, with the guidance of the rector, make the extraordinary decision to cut themselves off from the rest of society, hoping to stop the contagion from spreading beyond their community. As the illness thrives among them, so too does madness, and soon Anna and some of her peers must confront prejudice, superstition and hatred that could potentially destroy the entire village.This is a sensitively rendered historical novel about how a community must cope with extreme devastation and loss, and how in times of crisis, people are capable of doing extraordinary things. Anna is just an ordinary person, a housemaid who is confined by her lack of education and her place in a society with a gendered division of labor. However, a time of plague is not an ordinary time, and Anna finds that she must accomplish things that she feels are impossible. She is a very likeable character, despite her weaknesses and vices being laid bare to the reader.If there are any problems with this novel, it's that Anna's sensibilities and those of the rector, Michael Mompellion, sometime seem too modern for 17th century conventions, although Mompellion's character is based on the real-life William Mompesson, who served as rector in the village of Eyam in Derbyshire during their plague outbreak in 1666. Anna, however, is a completely fictional character, and seems overly sophisticated and intelligent for her role in society. Also, the interesting ending seemed quite unrealistic to me. Anna, as it would be easy to guess, survives the plague outbreak, but how her life changes afterwards is beyond anyone's imagination.Still, despite the novel's flaws, it's an immensely engaging read. For anyone who has an appreciation of historical fiction, Year of Wonders is definitely worth picking up. That Brooks based this novel on the real struggles of Eyam, the Plague Village, makes it all the more fascinating."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel was so utterly absorbing I scarcely noticed that I was on a plane and in airports the entire time I was reading it -- the time flew (as did I). The first thing that struck me was the language: beautiful and sufficiently archaic to invoke the 17th Century, without being incomprehensible. The second thing I loved about the book was the abundance of vivid historical information, researched in marvelous detail, about everything from lead mining and commerce, medical theories and herbalism, to comparative religion. Some of the plot developments were so extreme that, despite often being moved, I occasionally felt a bit of ironic distance from the narrative, but overall I was fully engaged and just devoured this book and am currently enjoying Ms. Brooks' Civil War novel, \\"March.\\""},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Yes, why did I check out a book regarding the BLACK DEATH in 17th century England? Why? I DO NOT KNOW! I had never heard of the author {no offense, Ms. Brooks!!} or the book. The cover just jumped out, so the book came home with me.This is historical fiction at its BEST. You must read this book. This is based on a true story {!!!} and narrated delightfully by Anna. Anna lives in the village where the plague hits. Her story is full of happiness, sadness, and a hard life. She tells the story of the village, her friends and family, her hopes and fears, her losses and loves. She is one great woman, yet, just an ordinary woman who lives in a tough era.Ms. Brooks must have spent an incredible amount of time on research. You will learn so much about living conditions, the plague, people, and England. And done so skillfully. You can picture the people, the awful living conditions, the village, the animals, the houses. This was a time full of ignorance and superstition and Anna tells us her story grandly!!!The year this book will take you through was full of sadness, loss, hatred, love, and victories. You will come to love Anna and all of the challenges she faces every day of her life -- even before the plague hits her village, you can only imagine what her life was like.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ THIS BOOK.

Brooks creates an engrossing and enthralling world through the eyes of maid Anna Frith as she sees her rural english village ravaged by the plague. While some scenes are rather graphic about what the plague actually does to your body, they were done tastefully and in a way that is not meant to disgust, but simply to inform the reader. The plot is excelent, both interesting and well written. My one slight complaint is the ending which seems a bit unbelievable, but with the greatness of the rest of the novel, it is easily compenstated for."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is a touching and sad book about a small village in England that becomes infected with the Black Plague. In the course of one year, two-thirds of the village's population was wiped out. The author, Geraldine Brooks, based this book on a true story about a village she had visited called Eyam in Derbyshire, England. Eyam had really undergone this devastation and Brooks portrays the story very well basing the characters on actual people who lived in the town.In the story, the priest in the village decides it would be best if the village quarantines themselves, not allowing anyone in or anyone out. In the village's attempt to save the outside world from being infected with the plague, they all sacrificed their own lives and few were spared after this scourge ended. Some of the book is very upsetting and down-right gross, but it's all a part of what this book is about. If you think you'll be able to get through the book, you won't regret it. The ending takes a surprising twist, which I'm not sure was the best choice, but it doesn't matter too much to me because I loved everything else. Year of Wonders truly is a wonder in itself and definately worth reading."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a beautiful and haunting story ultimately about empowerment and salvation, a sometimes brutally descriptive plague-era period piece made contemporary by its suffusion of new age and post-feminist perspective. When the plague visits a small English village in 1666, killing half its population in the course of a single year while isolating the village from all outside contact, the narrator, Anna, rises from her humble, illiterate church servant position to that of community caretaker and, ultimately, savior. In losing her own husband and children, in addition to countless other relations, friends and neighbors, and through her subsequent ministrations to the dying and bereaved, she becomes intimately familiar with misery and suffering, and recounts it in moving, self-reflective detail. The church rector, Mr. Mompellion, and his wife Elinor, whom Anna ostensibly serves, become her partners in caring for a decimated and increasingly deranged community of God-fearing farmers and miners, who alternately see the plague as either a test or a punishment administered by either God or Satan. The Mompellions also complete an important character triangulation that finally represents the underlying conflict and crisis propelling this story.Anna's experiences and the effects they have on her personal evolution are the central story here, and though I found her character transformation predictable in many ways, I was nonetheless consumed by her plight and found myself irresistibly drawn to it, and, by extension, to her. The author Geraldine Brooks, a Wall Street Journal reporter who vacations in the English countryside and who quite literally stumbled upon the real-life Plague Village upon which this story is based, is so imaginative and descriptive in her storytelling that I truly lost myself in this book, despite its many gruesome and gut-wrenching passages. For a brief period near the end of the book I was distracted by a scene of forbidden love that I felt had been taken from a Harlequin Romance, but except for that one imperfection, this is an otherwise amazing piece of work, especially considering that it is Brooks's first novel. She is quite a gifted writer and storyteller."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In history class we all learned about the famous Bubonic Plague in Europe. But this book makes it more real than any history book ever could. This is the story of a small British mountain village whose inhabitants become infected with plague when a contaminated shipment of cloth arrives from London. They decide to quarantine themselves, to not let anyone in or out of the village so as not to infect the surrounding villages. A courageous effort, to be sure, even more so considering that this book is loosely based on the true story of the village of Eyam which did indeed decide to quarantine itself in 1666.Overall, this was an excellently told story. Brooks does a good job conveying the despair and exhaustion that comes after watching two-thirds of your friends and neighbors die from a horrible illness. It's a very real and moving story. However, I didn't like how the author started the book at the end of the plague year. The first chapter is the aftermath of the plague and the rest of the book is treated as a flashback of the year of the plague. I think it would have been more effective if the author had just started the story with chapter two, the introduction of the characters and the beginning of the plague. One other thing, the ending seemed out of place. It didn't really fit with the rhythm and story of the rest of the book. The fate of Anna Frith, the narrator, seems a little unusual and unexpected. But it's not a bad ending.All in all, I really recommend this book. It's a compelling story."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The editorial reviews tell the details of the story of Anna Firth's life in Eyam England during the year spanning 1665-66 so I won't go over all of the details again but I did find it very interesting and fast to read. The book is written as though Anna had written it down herself some years after the story took place, very well done and researched with even the wording taking on a 17th century flavor but with 20th century spellings. You'll read about her very hard widowed life, her trials and tribulations as well as those of the rest of the village. The story is very detailed and can even be unpleasant, definitely not a romantic novel but worth reading for someone who wants to know what life would've been like in rural 17th century England and the devastation brought by bubonic plague. The last chapter summarizes Anna's life as she tells her story, to me it veers away from the course of the rest of the story, perhapds reflecting the writer's Islamic interests."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of my top 5 books of all time.

But the oddest part of this book was the ending, which comes out of left field. Did any one else feel like they'd read this somewhere before? Like in a Diane Gabledon story? I wish I could put my finger on it, but by the time I got to the end, I was beginning to wonder if I'd read this book before!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I would very much like to give Year of Wonders a high rating, but cannot justify doing so. It is an entertaining story by a talented writer of a seventeenth century English village that quarantines itself for the good of those outside and also their own souls when the plague arrives. Besides being good material for a history buff, it also makes for an excellent study of human beings at their best and worst when placed in a horrible, near hopeless situation. Brooks does effectively convey the horror and heartbreak of watching one's family and neighbors die one by one. The individual portraits of the village inhabitants are the strongest part of The Year of Wonders and I will remember many for a long time. Unfortunately there is a severe problem with this historical novel that has been noted by many other reviewers. The main characters seem like modern folk transported to 1666. They are far too liberal, socially mobile, and sophisticated for a remote English village. It was almost like reading a time travel tale aimed at fantasy readers. The ending was first unnecessarily nasty and then absurdly whimsical and unsatisfying. In the end, the reader is left with the paradox of excellent writing, but a shallow connection to the historical subject. It should be great, but falls short. Nevertheless, Year of Wonders shows great promise and I will look out for new books by Geraldine Brooks."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"Book of Wonders\\" is everything a historical novel should be. It is based upon the true events of a small village which isolated itself with the outbreak of plague; it has finely drawn and believable characters; and the writing is of a style that you could almost imagine it was really written at the time (please don't let this latter point put you off - the writing is not in any way archaic, as is often the trend these days).It is also however, profoundly sad, and I found myself weeping with the characters at their loss in an early part of the novel. I always think that is is a powerful book that can make you laugh or cry.The story of the people of this small village and their trials and tribulations in this terrible time is absolutely mesmerising. We watch them cling to their faith in God, and then turn to earlier more earthy superstitions to help them deal with the wave of death that has struck so many of them down. We also watch the development of the narrator from a simple village girl who thirsts for knowledge into the strong character she is by the end of the novel.Some of the earlier reviewers have commented that the end seems a little pat, almost as if the author wanted to finish the book and be done with it. I must admit that it doesn't finish the way I would have liked it to, but having said that, I truly do not believe that it in any way takes away from the mastery of the book.It is a fascinating, well written and well researched book. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I enjoy historical fiction, but this book, which starts with such promise, becomes increasingly trite, and ends absurdly. I felt as if the author had a checklist of historical facts she wanted to include, and then randomly threw those anecdotes into the novel through hastily drawn situations or characters.

I agree with a previous reviewer that some fans of Anita Shreve will like this book."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders grips the reader in from its first page. This work opens the world of the seventeenth century to the reader and allows one to experience the horror, the fright, and the superstition that wreaked havoc across the plague ridden areas of Darbyshire England. The characters, to begin with, are intriguing. HOWEVER - The work suffers the most horrific anti-climax of almost any work that I have read. The story completely unravels at the end as the main characters make decisions that are completely out of keeping with the philosophies and the mindset of the seventeenth century. The ending of this book is not shocking, nor a bold twist in the tale - it is a pathetic conclusion that is so poor in its creativity that it diminishes the story that began so well earlier in the book. If you want an enjoyable read of this time period, I would reccommend that you real Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Oh my gosh golly! What happened after the first 20 or so pages? It started as a well-written little page riffler, promising a good account of the black death, but then descended into mediocre writing. Maybe the problem is that the characters remained 2-dimensional, never developed more than those you see in a pretty bad movie-of-the-week.I thought the author might compensate for her problem with character development with a ripping narrative of life during plague-time, but that curiosity stayed mostly unsatisfied. Her inability to step out of a modern frame-of-reference is crippling, and it consigns this book to bodice-ripping romantic fiction.Immediately after finishing this tripe, I pulled out Barbara Tuchman's excellent history, &quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; and reread chapter 5: &quot;This is the End of the World : The Black Death.&quot; If you want a well-written account of the plague, Tuchman's is the best out there.The inspiration for Year of Wonders is a gift on a platter to a capable writer.

It is gorgeously written, expertly researched, and filled with characters who seem to live and breathe beside you while you read. From beginning to end, the story arcs perfectly; Brooks gives Anna Frith a humble beginning and, after a year of sorrow and joy, a satisfying conclusion/continuation to her life. The text is filled with careful details regarding life in 17th century England, but information about mining practices and herbal lore are introduced in such a way as to enhance the reader's experience rather than overtaking the plot. As far as plague-era historical fiction is concerned, \\"Year of Wonders\\" functions as an excellent companion to Daniel DeFoe's \\"A Journal of the Plague Year,\\" written in 1722, and I highly recommend for any interested reader to read the two works in conjunction."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was completely sucked into the world of Anna Frith and the horrifying experience of the plague year. I couldn't put down the book, carrying it with me to appointments etc...It wasn't a mystery but it intrigued me with the same intensity. My heart ached for the characters, and I was fascinated by the endless details given of their lives. I've never felt so intimate with a time and place as I did with Year of Wonders. Some of the brutalities of the era were a bit hard to bear, but the story flooded me with rich emotion, and that is what makes a book good, even if the emotions are painful. Many parts of the story stung my heart with shock, amazement, compassion, fear and its over-all triumphant beauty. I must warn those with faint hearts. Some circumstances are bordering on disturbing (though they may be less troubling for some). Although I have made the story sound very dark (which it was), it has a relatively joyful ending.

Furthermore, her characters are deliciously well-drawn.Nevertheless, the final quarter of the book reads like a melodramatic soap opera. For a novel centered on something as heart-wrenching as the devastation of a small town, the author doesn't need to resort to far-fetched plotting to keep the readers' hooked.

However at timeswith a format that requires reading footnotes constantly as you readthe text, the subject matter can become less compelling than itotherwise would be. While I am in no way advocating that scholarlyHistory should be avoided, there are instances when Historical Fictionis so good it can act as a catalyst for more scholarly reading. Thisbook is a prime example, for though the Author has created names andadded to the Historical Record, she in no way strayed from whatreasonably could have happened.The Bubonic Plague is a horrificaffliction. I have read books on the subject that were fiction andnon-fiction, and while all are unsettling, this book gives the readerno quarter. I don't generally wince when reading descriptions ofdisease, however even with the first case that Author Geraldine Brooksdescribed, the book made it clear it is not for those of delicatestomachs. At the same time this is one of the aspects of the Novel Iliked the best. The Author related all the horror, suffering, andterror this disease represents, without being gratuitous or usingshock value in lieu of good writing.Ms. Brooks did a great job ofusing period dialogue, sentence structure, and words appropriate to17th Century England. The vocabulary was the only point of frustrationfor me. I do not mind looking up definitions, however some words werenot to be found, and trying to draw a definition from the context ofthe placement of a word was not always possible for me. I don'tbelieve this caused me to be denied critical events; it was just asmall annoyance.There are several very good writers that are writingin this genre.

I really wanted to enjoy it. However, the way characters speak or act at times seems in dissonance with how the vast majority of people at the time would act, especially if you compare most actual writings of the time to this \\"historical novel\\". Usually this dissonance is not too pronounced until p. 252, near the end of the book. Here it begins to get truly nasty and some characters phase in and out of going from bad to good to nasty to helpful, that the novel just completely seems to lose focus. It's one thing to have a \\"layered\\" character, and another to give characters so many layers that they lose distinction completely. The unusual ending made it seem complete fantasy. This book may well inspire interesting discussion, and it is in many ways well written, but coming away from it feels much more like reading a volume of alternate reality than any sort of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book for a book club. Otherwise I would have put it down long ago. Although some other reviewers take issue with the modern tone of the narrator's language, I was grateful that at least I didn't have to suffer through a phony 17th century voice. I even found the first part marginally interesting. But the book lost my interest when the protagonist and her Melanie Wilkes type sidekick go into the mine and save the day for the poor little orphan. I wondered if Anna was going to don a superwoman cape and start to fly. The characters seemed two dimensional and not very interesting. And I got really tired of hearing about the \\"plague seeds.\\" Although some scientists believed otherwise, in the seventeenth century the miasma theory (essentially a sort of bad air) was the accepted explanation for the way in which plague and other contagious diseases were spread. If you really want to read a book that has graphic descriptions of the effect of the plague on victims, the way in which plague was actually spread, AND gripping characters who both courageously work tirelessly against the disease and wrestle with its philosophical implications, then read The Plague by Albert Camus."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved the book, the story was riveting until the very abrupt ending.

Phooey!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I picked up \\"Year of Wonders\\" after reading Geraldine Brook's March 26th interview at http://www.noveljourney.blogspot.com/Maybe it's my background in medicine that makes the human body a fascination. Maybe I'm just twisted. For whatever reason, life, death, dying and the workings of the human body pull at me. Yes, I'm intrigued by the Body Farm. Never want to smell it, but the thought of it captivates my imagination.This is why I needed to read \\"Year of Wonders,\\" a book about the plague and how it changed one small village. If you share my interest as described above, you will find much to like.Brooks writes a beautifully tragic story. Through Anna's daily thoughts and experiences I was transported to 1666, and I grieved with her as life as she knew it crashed down around her, or ebbed away, or was stolen through horrible events beyond the disease that ravaged them.Of course, a novel detailing death and tragedy is going to contain elements of horror and gruesome scenes. Brooks provides both in abundance.\\"Year of Wonders\\" is a literary blend of elements as found in \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\", Patricia Cornwall's writing, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", \\"The Crucible\\" and \\"Peace Like a River.\\" If you like any or all of the above, I think you'll find much to like in \\"Wonders.\\""},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I know, a book about the plague, how depressing. Well, yes, it is a bit of a downer. HOWEVER, it is well worth reading. It gives us a realistic look into what life was like during the plague, delving into the isolation of not just one household, but an entire whole village, cut off from the rest of civilization and left to deal with the epidemic on their own, so as not to spread their 'plague seeds' to other towns.This doomed community struggles to carry on with their lives, while most fall victim to the infestation. They still had to work, tend the farms, attend to birthing babies, while nursing the sick, burying the dead, and taking up the slack of the fallen victims.There was also contraversy over the who was more effective - a medicine woman with her herbs and chants,or a doctor with his leeches.This book is well worth the read, and it really makes you think about how precious life really is. Thank God for modern medicine!!!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As an author, I wish that I could have written such a fine novel. It was just about perfect, and although the ending is controversial, I loved it and felt that it fit. I first read the book not long after 9/11, and I loved that author Brooks could draw parallels between that year in Eyam and our own time, that then as now there were ordinary people doing extraordinary things to save their fellow men. I have re-read this book many times since then, and it is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a special, special book. In its richness, attention to detail, vivid scenes, a depth of understanding and imagination, and a dedication to historical accuracy, it reminds me of another such work, \\"Galileo's Daughter.\\" Small wonder that \\"Year of Wonder\\" has been selected as both a \\"NY Times\\" and \\"Washington Post\\" Notable Book. It is the best single fictional work on the Black Plague - a phenomenon that depopulated Europe up to 50% in some areas such as Florence, Italy and surely 35-45% in other areas of Europe, wiping out at least 1/3 of Europe's population. This dreadful recurring nastiness, with a horror 20th century folks cannot imagine, ushered in a European mentality that shaped and molded the civilization of a Continent. And created the conditions for growth, increased wages, and labor demand.What Brooks does is reduce this century of astonishing death to one small isolated village in England. We live through the intimate details of the horrendous deaths and the living of those who survived in a way no one has yet captured so strongly. I would recommend that one read this jewel of a novel in conjunction with the work by Norman Cantor, \\"In the Wake of the Plague - The Black Death and the World it Made.\\" And perhaps, most important, to journey through the plague with \\"A Journal of the Plague Year\\" by \\"eyewitness\\" Daniel Defoe - enlarging upon his own childhood memories. Possibly the most important record of the Plague written, Defoe gives us the observer's incredible account, while Brooks shares a solid researcher's remarkable imagination and literary excellence. And captures the internal struggle occurring within so many thinking folks of the time about God as causation and Nature as causation. If God brought the plague upon the \\"house,\\" the solution is in prayer and lamentation. But if the Plague came out of nature, then the observing eye and a slight emergence of the \\"scientific method\\" might discern causation that has remedies based in reality."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I was first given this book, I thought, &quot;Oh great, a book about The Plague. How depressing.&quot; To be honest, if it had not been lent to me, i probably would not have even picked it up. But by the third page, I was hooked. Not only is the story, about a small English village that tries to control the spread of The Plague, brought in by a bolt of fabric, by quarantining themselves, it is the story of a remarkable woman, Anna Frith. Anna is a widow (her husband being killed before the Plague) who loses nearly everything-her children, her friends, her sanity-to this terrible disease. While The Plague ravages her friends and neighbors, Anna does everything she can to save them, and completes feats (midwifery, iron mining) that she never thought hersef capable of. The book is incredibly well written; Brooks uses the vernacular of the time to great effect, but in such a way that it seems completely normal. It sounds cliched, but I truly could not put this book down. A truly surprising delight; I recommend it for any fans of Anita Shreve (who gives an endorsement for the book.)"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There's a lot to like about Geraldine Brooks' _Year of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague_. At its best, this novel is an evocative, well-written historical fiction that skillfully conjures up the day-to-day hardships of living in a small village overrun by plague and watching two-thirds of your friends, family, and acquaintances die horrible deaths. I really liked the focus on the diurnal struggles of a village increasingly depleted of its human resources. What do you do when the women who always prepared herbal remedies are dead? When young children are left parentless? The main character, Anna Frith, is a strong woman and something of a feminist role model; the plague brings out resources in her that she didn't know she had.Unfortunately, this novel is itself infected in places by melodrama and purple prose. There are a couple of minor eruptions early in the novel, but the big problem for this book resides in the last 30-40 pages. If the novel had ended on page 272, it would have been a much stronger novel. Regrettably, it continues until page 308. About five HUGE plot developments happen in this short space, which is startling enough in a novel that has been so well-paced up until this point, and several of them seem stretch credulity thin. There is also a surprisingly misogynistic passage from a previously likeable character in these final pages which really turned me off and seemed entirely inconsistent with everything we've learned about this character up until this point.I would still recommend this novel, as it does so much so well, but with the caveat that its quality rather falls off in the end."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Based on an actual event and real persons, author Geraldine Brooks tells a fascinating tale of a village in rural 17th century England that experiences a sudden outbreak of plague. The citizens seal themselves off from the outside world to avoid spreading the disease to neighboring villages and to give themselves up to God's mercy. The &quot;year of wonders&quot; experienced by the residents of this stricken community is told through the eyes of an intelligent and couragous young widow, Anna Frith. Brooks' imagery is bright and alive - the reader experiences the sights and smells of this world, the hope and despair of the characters and the gradual disintegration of their faith. The plague brings out the noblest and the basest of human behavior and Anna herself achieves things she never would have attempted in any other circumstances.Because the majority of this book was so well written, I was quite disappointed in the ending which seemed rushed and contrived, almost as if the publisher had grown impatient and directed Brooks to wrap it up by the end of the day. I won't spoil the ending, but readers of Albert Camus' novel on the same subject will groan inwardly at Brooks' little joke in her placement of the final scene.Despite the ending, I recommend this book highly for its clear, concise style, vivid imagery, and realistic portrayal of human beings immersed in a long and tragic fight for survival and search for meaning."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks' Year of Wonders is a terrific novel. I encourage all to overcome the intimidating fact that the novel is about the plague and diver right in to the work. Year of Wonders is an intelligent, engaging, emotional read--very well done indeed. Anna Firth is a survivor, in many ways. She survives the plague which utterly decimates her village. When the plague arrives, she has already lived through much. Her father abused her and her husband has died in a mining accident, left her a widow with two young children, at the ripe age of 18. As disease rips through her village, Anna works with the minister's wife, trying to provide some solace, some comfort to the rest of the village. The plague is not the only killer in these times for several townspeople are killed by hatred, jealousy and prejudice. The plague ultimately leaves the village and Anna is a changed person, which sounds trite, I know, but in the novel, it's not. This novel is so fabulous, Anna's emotions so real. There were parts of this novel that literally had me in tears. I highly, highly recommend this novel. It is a wonderful and most enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders begins with a bang, letting the reader know that a catastrophe has befallen the inhabitants of a small mountain village in England. Seen through the eyes of Anna Frith, a young widow who serves the village's minister's house, we witness the horror and death sweeping through the area during the year of the plague, 1666.Brooks writes this story with an elegant, yet powerful touch. The details of village life and the real effects of the plague are tangible and stunning. This is literally a film played out on the page, with scene after scene so richly written that the line between fact and fiction becomes blurred. As the seasons pass, Brooks expresses the fear, anger and eventually, numbed grief turning to hope (some of it warped) of the village and Anna. The plague itself is written almost as a character; it lives and breathes and there are many times when I found myself holding my breath, wondering what it was going to do next.Anna is splendidly written, a mix of feminism and the Puritan values of the time. From the beginning, you know she's destined for more than working the fields or washing dishes. While it would have been easy to turn Anna into some kind of saint, Brooks does a wonderful job of showing Anna's flaws without making them larger than the story itself. In addition to Anna, the character of Michael Mompellion is compelling and strongly written. At the end of the story, I was shocked by some of the revelations about him but found them to be completely believable and relevant to the story.The one area (and it's a small one) where I felt this story veered off track was the final chapter. Maybe I was missing something, but given the year and the role women played in society, I found where Anna ended up to be implausible and a little bit too pat. Maybe it could and did happen, but compared to the tone of the book before it, it was odd. I did think that she ended up with the life she deserved, but the way it was written seemed hurried and needed a little more suspension of belief than I expected.This was an amazing book, one I will definitely read again and recommend to my family and friends. When I finished it, the one thing that surprised me the most was that the book was only just over 300 pages - this reads like a huge, epic story."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, as I enjoy (good) historical fiction and had previously read Geraldine Brooks' Nine Parts of Desire (which I do recommend.) I was disappointed in Year of Wonders, and I'd like to discuss why. This review contains important plot points, so if you haven't read the book, don't continue reading.This book is set in 1665; its heroine is Anna Frith, an 18 year old widow with two young sons. It is soon revealed that her husband was a miner killed in a mining accident. Anna is a servant in the household of the local Anglican priest and his wife, Elinor.As the book opens, it is clear that a) the \\"year of wonders\\" is almost over and b) Elinor is dead. Careful readers will learn in this chapter that Anna and Elinor were the bestest of friends and that Anna, despite the fact that she's a peasant in a remote English village, not only reads, but understands Latin. At this point, alarm bells started going off in my head. I'm always deeply suspicious of books that try too hard to make their historical heroines, well, heroic. Make the heroine smart, sure. Even let her have learned how to read on her own, fine - though it's unlikely that a young 17th century mother would have the time to learn and the ready access to books. But please don't make her an overevolved Rhodes scholar with modern sensibilities. Please. My pleas were not answered.Anyway, as the book progresses, it's clear that Brooks is imposing 21st century values on her characters. In addition, some very unwelcome Oprah-ization slinks in, mainly in the discussion of Anna's family, where it is revealed that Anna has an abusive father (with zero redeeming qualities) who is married to a woman, Aphra, who turns out to be bitchy, unloving, and also into witchcraft (?).On the other hand, Elinor is just as perfect as can be. She doesn't believe in social divisions. She literally looks like an angel, all wispy and with silvery hair and whatnot. She teaches Anna how to read and write and read great scholarly volumes. Apparently, Anna has plenty of time to indulge in all these scholarly pursuits. Anna, as I'll discuss later, also turns out to be pretty perfect herself. I actually laughed during Elinor's faux deathbed scene when Elinor basically congratulates both herself and Anna on becoming ever so wonderful.(The priest, Mompellion, is your average tortured artiste type. He is supposed to have chemistry with Anna. Scandalous!)Anyway, even though this is a novel of the plague, there isn't really THAT much about how horrible the plague is. Mompellion visits plague families. There's an interlude in which Anna and Elinor pluckily mine a vein so that a little Quaker orphan girl can keep the claim to the vein (Elinor and Anna are easily able to get beyond those silly 17th century prejudices about Quakers.) Anna's half-sister, Faith, is mentioned in passing about 300 pages into the book. Then she dies. Anys, a saucy herbalist chick, is hanged by panicked villagers. Boy, is Mompellion mad about that! (By the way, Anna is totally cool with Anys sleeping around, because she's moderne like that.) There are other random mentions of the village being deserted and various coping mechanism employed by the distraught villagers, but Brooks never really sells the reader on how horrible the Year of Wonders is. Rather, the Year of Wonders is more like a prep course to make Anna even more exceptional.Anna not only becomes an ace scholar, but she also becomes a terrific midwife in less than a year. After a very brief indulgence, she has the moral rectitude to primly burn Anys' poppy stash when she finds it, becuase opium is BAD. Her horrible father and horrible stepmother die horribly. Oh, she also learns to tame Mompellion's stallion, because she is just that good.Mompellion is written as an amalgamation of nobility and unexpected nuttiness. His abstinence from Elinor really doesn't make much sense, but it does mean that Anna can sleep with him without much guilt after Elinor dies.Anyway, Anna takes off at the end of the book. At this point, it seemed to me like the author sat around and thought \\"Hmm. I want my main character to continue her scholarly pursuits in medicine. Where can she do that? I know! Morocco!\\" Yes, Anna abruptly ends up as the wife to a well-regarded Arab doctor at the end of the book, where she studies in Arabic and raises her children (her new kids - her sons having died in the plague.) Wow, did that come out of nowhere.Brooks has clearly done a lot of research and the book is quite readable. But I found Anna and her friends to be too modern and too perfect, much like the protagonist of Pope Joan (another disappointing historical novel) or, dare I say it? Jean Auel's Ayla, the most perfect woman ever to exist in all prehistory.) If you want to read some decent fiction set in this period, I can recommend Slammerkin. The only diseases in that novel are venereal, though."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a great book! Year of Wonders is excellent in every way. It is beautifully written. Every page has some delicate description that made me stop to think of the simple grace words can have when they are in the hands of a talented writer. The story is powerful from beginning to end as we watch what happens when plague ravages a small, isolated village northwest of London in 1666. It is based on a true story and told through the fictional character, Anna Frith. She was a woman on an ordinary path in life who finds herself surrounded by death and discovers her own extraordinary strength. The story is well developed and builds with every page. There are unexpected and exciting twists in the end that lead to a very satisfying conclusion which holds up until the very last sentence. I was only sad the story ended and can only dream of what happened next to my beloved heroine. I say encore! What will Geraldine Brooks write next? I will definitely read it."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was a very difficult book to read. It wasn't the use of some archaic language that made it so hard, but the heartbreaking storyline. This book is based on the true story of the villagers of Eyam, who chose to quarantine themselves from the surrounding villages in order to stop the plague that had invaded their lives from spreading. We see the entire story through the eyes of Anna Firth. We meet Anna after her husband has died in a mining accident, and she is raising two young children alone. Anna takes in a boarder to help with her expenses, laying the groundwork for tragedy, because her boarder is a tailor. One day a bolt of cloth comes from London, bearing the seeds of plague.The year is 1666, and Anna will begin the most extraordinary year of her life, as she becomes a healer and a heroine. She will face the loss of almost everything she loves, and almost loses her own sanity during the year of the plague.Despite the many horrors of the plague depicted in the book, there are also tiny moments of joy buried beneath the pain, and this is a book you will not soon forget.As with most of the other reviews, my main complaint is the last chapter of the book, the Epilogue. It seemed a very jarring and rather disappointing ending to a wonderful book. However don't let that stop you from reading this book, because if you do, you will miss a beautifully written story, with a truly inspirational heroine."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I picked up Year of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks for two reasons: our school librarian highly recommended it, and I discovered that Brooks is the wife of one of my favorite non-fiction authors, Tony Horwitz (Confederates in the Attic and Blue Latitudes). Although a book about the plague in 17th century England, this is not just a story about disease and death, but also a moving tale about survival, passion, compassion and unlikely heroes.Based on a true story, this historical novel weaves a fabulous and heartwarming tale about how one small town in Derbyshire dealt with the plague. Year of Wonders is told through the eyes of a lowly and uneducated peasant girl named Anna Frith. Anna is a young widow with two young sons. She goes to work for the Anglican rector and his wife, Michael and Elinor Mompellion. Elinor takes Anna under her wing, and becomes not just a teacher and mentor, but also a friend. The town is thrown into chaos when it is discovered that the plague has struck. Rector Mompellion convinces the town that they must close their borders and that all residents must stay (to prevent it spreading to other villages). He also offers a promise that no one will suffer alone, and he convinces the earl from a neighboring town to provide food and other necessities. What follows is a tale of tragedy and triumph. The plague lasted over a year, and two thirds of the townspeople perished. Mompellion, Elinor and Anna take on the task of ministering to the town in ways that are heroic. They find themselves battling not only this dreaded disease, but also superstition, greed, and even murder. And despite their own tragedies, they discover that their efforts make them stronger and that they have more courage than they thought possible.Brooks' writing is truly elegant, and Anna's thoughts and words are written in the lyrical but simple cadence of the 1660's. Anna describes her husband; \\"his hands were big, cracked things with broken, blackened nails, and his idea of lovemaking was a swift and sweaty tumble, a spasm and then sleep.\\" I just couldn't turn the pages fast enough. There is also much historical research including not only the plague itself, but also of the living conditions in a small English village during the 17th Century.While this is Geraldine Brooks' first novel, she has two nonfiction books to her credit including Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women. I will definitely be reading more of this talented author."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When one sees the word, &quot;plague&quot; it conjures up images of those things to be avoided. Do not avoid this book for it tells the story of Anna Firth, and once the reader has come to the book's conclusion, it is impossible to put it down without having a deeper respect for life and the importance of not taking each day or those we love for granted.By eighteen years of age, Anna is a young woman already mature beyond her years. Surviving childhood abuse, the death of her husband and left to raise two young children, Anna can give us some very important lessons about love, life and death.The strong point of the book was Geraldine Brook's profound writing style. She has the unique gift to be able to make the reader feel each emotion she portrays through her characters. When the plague hits her English village, Anna pitches in with unfathomable heart and soul to help save her friends and neighbours. The characters are real and believable, the plague a reality and the story emotionally charged. Through Anna's eyes, we are left with a deeper respect for the meaning of life, the importance of living each day of it to the fullest, and how quickly and unexpectedly a loved one can be taken from us forever. This is a beautifully written book and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that Brook's style IS gorgeous, and lyrical. And I do hope that she writes other fiction, because I think she has a lot to offer. But I got bored with this story, and I'm not sure why. Maybe the plot was a little too sloppy, or the story iself just took too long to unfold.Her descriptions of the 17th-century plague that is carried from London to a small Derbyshire village by an itinerant tailor are indeed horrific in their details. As villagers begin, one by one, to die, the rest face a choice: do they flee their village in hope of outrunning the plague or do they stay? The lord of the manor and his family pack up and leave. The rector, Michael Mompellion, argues forcefully that the villagers should stay put, isolate themselves from neighboring towns and villages, and prevent the contagion from spreading. All this is seen through the eyes of the liberal minded narrator Anna Frith, and what a complex character she is.I can see why people loved this book, unfortunately, I didn't love it enough to give it a five star recommendation.Michael"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks has an amazing gift for storytelling and for writing lyrical, evocative prose about another era. Too bad she has wasted it with a cartoon ending. I agree with other readers who have remarked that the last 30 to 40 pages were so out of character with the rest of the novel that they appeared to have been written in haste by another author.

The author, Geraldine Brooks describes the struggles Anna and a whole town must go through to survive during the plague.

In this engaging work (her first fictional outing) she does a splendid job of delineating life in a Derbyshire village during the Great Plague of 1666.Brooks chooses to tell the grim story through the eyes of Anna a widow woman who loses her two young sons to the ravages of the bubonic plage. The village in which she lives )based on a true English village of the time) is led by a pastor who urges the people to remain in the town rather than carry the plague to surrounding villages and cities.Anna tells of her ministering to the dying and even delivers a baby. Along the way we see witchcraft accusations leading to a terrible murder of two innocent women by a rabble mad with fear.Anna is close to the clergy couple who aid the dying. Anna'sfather is a horrible drunk and child abuser who even attempts to bury a live man in order to collect the burial fee!Without revealing more of this wonderful story the reader should know that this novel is beautifully written in a stylefocusing on the sheer wonder of living life day to day. The flowers and food, music and myths, religious zeal and tragic days of England in the year of plague come vividly alive before the reader's eye.Daniel Defoe chronicled the Year of the Plague but his work dealt with life in London during the horror. Brooks who has done her research takes us to a bucolic village which serves as a microcosm of the human soul during criis. In our day of post 9-11 the novel teaches us how in times of crisis ordinary human beings can act angel and also bestial.Well done for a rookie novelist.

At this point he had got three done and he was working ib the fourth one. It was midday and he needed six graves to do for the day. One was of his friend Jon Millstone. He was working on digging graves and his heart gave out.In the Years of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks almost every single chapter is talking about some one new dying. The reason they are is because of the plauge of the 1666 in London. Most of the young people lived without pain. There were really bad storms to in like every other chapter. &quot;The storm that had threatend at morning in by early afternoon.&quot;The main character in this story is Anna. Well I should say she's the one who is telling this story. In the Years of Wonders, Anna Frith is a housemaid. Maggie which she is in this book a lot to she is the Bradfords cook. Then there is also Jane she is the Bradford's maid. &quot;Maggie had a small oak coffer wedged tight beneath her bed, but her girth, was such that she couldn't bend down low enough to get it.&quot;In the sections that we read the setting was in quite few different places at the first of the book it starts at the rectory cellar there is because it is apple picking time. Then further in the book its at the graveyard because so many people are dying because of the plague. The plague stared in London then worked its way up to the isolated Mountain Village. Like some of the chapters interested me like &quot;Venom in the Blood,&quot; &quot;Ring of Roses,&quot; &quot;Sign of a Witch.&quot; &quot;In the days that followed, I tasted what life would be like if i survived through this dying time to see my own old age.&quot; The setting right here starts out outside at the well-bucket.The plot mostly takes place at the chruch. Then in the store, and at Barmot court. Anna is the one who is still telling the story and it is in 1st person and 3rd person. &quot;And so is the rest of us set about learning to live in the wide green prison of our own election. The most magor events were Faith's funeral, then Elinor's burial place.The language in Years of Wonders were mostly Anna because she had been telling the story in all different types of P.O.V. we had four sections to read in and the first two sections were in 1st person and the last two were in 3rd person. &quot;And yet I found myself walking that Monday morning in the direction of the Boundary Stone.&quot;I think everybody should read this because it has to do with the plague of 1666.

She 'see's it...but she doesn't *know* it. She writes from the point of view of Anne, who is the young Christian girl in question, and no where is there a reference to any running dialogue between this girl and God himself. She doesn't talk to God, only about God...there is a lot of talk 'about God', but no personal interchange between God and her. And that just isn't the way it is. I don't know any real christian who doesn't have a simple running conversation with God. 'Good morning God, thank you for today\\"...'Did you hear what that person said Lord? Forgive him...\\" or any acknowledgement of a simple awareness of his presence...which is part and parcel of the christian experience....if you really know God.And because the book is supposedly about faith and how it is tried and shattered in tragedy I should think the book should at least start from a faith that is a real faith.The reality is that these people really did have a very simple faith, and a simple faith includes dialogue with God. And this town really did exist, and they were extraordinary people...Then there is the way she took a real characters that really existed and totally maligns his personal history. She justifies this by saying she changed his name and made her own rector up. She takes a huge twist of character and causes Michael Mompellian to turn out to be a monster, not a saintly Christian that he was, and in the end poor Anne is shattered of faith, used and abused by him and finds refuge among the gentle 'peaceful muslims' sheltered in a harem, but with 'no faith at all'. I found this shocking and contrived.ok...I know this is a major spoiler, but the ending was too outrageous and unrealistic, ESPECIALLY when in her own words Brooks points out that she modeled Mompellian after a real rector (a rector Mompesson) of a real town that really had the plague, and she owns herself that he was truly saintly by all accounts, yet says she \\"envisioned a man powerful conviction and charisma. Such personalities are *sometimes governed by unwholesome motivations, such as belief they are God infallible instruments. They can be dangerous, even deadly\\" end quote.So because she couldn't understand the real life historical rector who was a truly saintly man who really lived and suffered and was by all accounts good....she made up a monster to fit her agenda to smear Christianity. She judges these people while pretending to not, by making they weak and sniveling, dishonorable in every way. ...and blaming it on the Christian background....but I wonder if we placed a lot of secularists in such a town how they would endure.It will be a frightening and interesting thing to see if such trials are visted apon our modern secular America, what would happen.That is all this book was: a smear job.Whether it was intentional...I will not judge...but I will point out that Ms. Brooks knows less about the interior life of a real Christian then the poet of her book knew of the sea."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Thank you, negative reviewers!

It took place in the time of the plague, which was some type of disease that was going around and hurting many people in the town. This book to me was not so interesting. I told myself that I was not going to read it, but did anyway, I think that's why I dislike the book so. I mean don't get me wrong, there were some good parts in it like love, marriage and what not, but there were some bad parts. The deaths of the people were a bit harsh, and that Mr. Mompellion man I tell you, he was something else. He looked down upon women.....very bad. On the flip side, I do not recommend this book to those who don't like to read of course, and don't like long books. If you like to read about issues in the 1860's I guess this will be a good choice, but you will be sorry.

This was terrible, but when are you going to write scenes that are not just the repetitions of the relentless gore?&#34; I couldn't finish it.

I did my senior thesis on the history of the plague many years ago. The information I obtained then did nothing to inform me of the day to day lives of the people who suffered during this time. Yes it is fiction, but well researched fiction and the tragedies felt during those times became real to me.The characters were well developed and the dialogue touched on how women were treated in those days.

Many reviewers wrote that the ending was surreal and I agree.I am esp perplexed as to how Anna became superwoman. Yes, there are people who rise to occasions, doing extraordinary things; Anna is one of those people. Anna brings to mind the nature vs nurture discussion. Just how is it that Anna was able to learn everything, even Latin, and do everything? Anna is clearly superwoman without the outfit. She wasn't nurtured into this roll. Did she inherit her astonishing abilities or is she a genetic fluke? Interesting to speculate."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book. In many ways it's ugly, the pain of losing people one loves always is. But I so enjoyed the way the characters responded in crisis--good and bad.

I'd read it again, though and that's saying a lot because I'm picky!Anna is a strong character who's easy to relate to, which isn't always possible in novels like this. I like that it's based on a true story of a real village from this time and that just makes it even better for a history buff like me.

While it was upsetting in some of its descriptions, it certainly holds the reader's interest. Until the end, that is. A surprise ending is only fair if there are foreshadowing seeds planted along the way that the reader can reflect back on. To pull an ending out of nowhere that has no relationship to the story, is indeed unfair and very frustrating. The ending is such a stretch, that I found it to be totally unbelievable. Would a minister so steeped in his faith, really react the way he did in the end? Would a servant girl really end up where she did? Still the book is a good read if you can overlook all the improbables."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders was ok. It was incredibly predictable. I would call it very light historical fiction. Parts of it were good, but I was left wondering more about the real Plague Village servant instead of this trumped up fluffy character, Anna, who just happens to \\"blossom\\" into this superwoman heroine. Oh, please. For example, this woman was illiterate and within a few years she's reading and writing English and then understanding Latin in addition to holding two jobs, housework, managing a flock of sheep and raising two babies?!? Maybe they didn't need sleep back then or had more than 24 hours in a day. Oh wait...let's not forget nursing the plague victims. And don't get me started on the ending..... I won't spoil it, but it felt like it was the ending to a completely different novel with completely different characters. In conclusion, this is a good book to bring on vacation - an easy read with little substance."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was fine. Decent, but nothing special. It is the story of how one young woman in England, 1665 survived a year of plague in her village.It started off very promisingly, with beautiful visual and emotional description. We feel keenly Anna's sorrow and mourning, and are expecting a great book. But as soon as the story goes back a year to the beginning of the plague, all the emotion falls flat. Apparently, the author couldn't mantain the excellent writing for very long.Tragedy after tragedy happens to this poor little village, with gruesome deaths and gruesome events. All these happenings soon make the reader numb to whatever emotion the author managed to convey through the writing.There is nothing very original in the heroine, Anna. She comes from an unhappy family background, is clever and resourceful, and \\"very clever with a desire for education.\\" (told by the author, never noticed by the reader) And the ending!Despite its flaws, this is an entertaining, quick read that you won't feel wasted your time. If you need a nice,afternoon read or a book for the plane, get this. if you have a limited budget and time, go for something else."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"YEAR OF WONDERS held me spellbound like no other book has done in years! Like a Breughel painting come to life, the sights and sounds and smells of the little English village that quarantines itself with the plague in 1666 fly off the page and into your mind. The story is told by Anna Frith, a simple woman, servant to the rector Michael Mompillion and his delicate wife Elinor. Though Anna loses her boarder and her two young sons to the Plague she is not infected and spends the year tending to those in the village who fall victim. Elinor teachers Anna to read and together the two women experiment with herbs and potions to ease the suffering all around them. There is witchcraft and trickery and mob violence. But Anna survives the Year of Wonders, even as she learns the truth about the relationship between the rector and his wife.

It seemed tacked on to the book without really adding anything to the main story."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks' Year of Wonders is a superb novel. It's an intelligent, engaging, emotional read. Anna Firth is a survivor, in many ways. She survives the plague, which utterly decimates her village. When the plague arrives, she has already lived through various adversities. Her father abused her and her husband died in a mining accident, left her a widow with two young children at the age of eighteen. As disease rips through her village, Anna works with the minister's wife, trying to provide solace and comfort to the rest of the village. The plague is not the only killer in these times -- hatred, jealousy and prejudice have destroyed the lives of the townspeople. The unnerving experience makes Anna a stronger person. The aforementioned statement may sound trite, but said statement is the overall essence of this novel -- and it works. There are parts of the story that literally had me in tears. I cannot recommend Year of Wonders enough. It is a superb, beautiful and compelling read!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Read the book because my book club had heard about it on NPR.

It was written to ingrain us with the author's world views.

The ending is pathetic. I couldn't be more disappointed!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks' Year of Wonders is a wonderful read and tells an interesting story. The novel looks at the plague in England from the perspective (based on truth) of a town that closed itself off from the outside world so as not to spread the disease that reaches their town early in the plague and early in the novel. The novel whizzes by quickly and easily, the interest maintained both by the horrific events and the fascinating cast of characters. The narrator's voice may appear a little too anachronistic at times with the prescience of knowledge only learned much later in the scientific world but the voice of this narrator Anna Frith strikes the right balance generally between sounding of a particular time and being easily understood by the reader. This is a quick easy read that should be a joy for fans of English history or those seeking a gruesome, yet enjoyable, tale."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. Geraldine Brooks, a Pulitzer Prize winner, has written a deeply vivid historical novel about an English village, circa 1666, coping with the Plague. The story is loosely based on a real village that voluntarily cut itself off from the surrounding countryside rather than spread the disease; a disease the villagers didn't understand in the least. Consequently superstition competes with practical compassion in the self-imposed cauldron of brutality and gruesome death. The writing is magnificent, drawing upon the vocabulary of the time. If you're brave enough to read this book, you won't soon forget the drama, or fail to appreciate the wonders of modern medicine."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Vendor was exceptionally helpful and merchandise was delivered in an extremely timely fashion.

As many others have said, the entire book is anachronistic and implausible, with one-dimensional characters and so-so writing. I don't mean in terms of the setting, or Brooks' use of words (although the period words are used in an inconsistent manner), or description of the character's clothing, etc. Those all seem fairly accurate. However, the plot and characters were so implausible as to kill any enjoyment I might have gleaned from this book, which attracted me because I do enjoy historical fiction. Anna Frith, the main character of the book, has ideas and beliefs that are too modern for the time and she is able to learn a surprising number of skills on her own (midwifery, mining, riding a stallion, and herbalist skills). Her modern and progressive ideas include a rejection of superstitious beliefs, so much so that she defends the town's two herbalists, Anys and Mem Gowdie, who stand accused of witchcraft. The fact that Anys, the younger of the two, sleeps around with men and disdains marriage, doesn't seem to bother our heroine in the least: she has a very \\"live and let live\\" mindset. Also, despite the social hierarchy of the times, she and the minister (Mompellion) spurn the the main aristocratic family of the town.In addition to the anachronistic problems I found with this book, I found myself rolling my eyes a lot at the flatness of the characters, who are one-dimensional and simply constructed. Anna is a super woman, shunning all of those awful ideas, beliefs, and behaviors that us, in our \\"enlightened\\" views, disdain. Religious differences mean nothing to her. And, as I mentioned before, she is quick to pick up all those skills with little or no previous training. Similarly, Elinor Mompellion, the reverand's wife, is completely good. A learned woman who helps the poor and wealthy alike and who is indifferent to social status. It is her who teaches Anna to read and the two become very good friends. In contrast, her father and stepmother are portrayed as monsters with few, if any, redeeming qualities.Given that many of these indicators occurred fairly early on in the book, I was actually surprised that so many people were disappointed by the ending (which is, indeed, awful). To me, it didn't seem much more far fetched than many of the other things that had taken place in the book. I was really disappointed that such an exciting premise could be wasted and annoyed throughout the entire time it took to finish this book."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I will restrain myself from writing in bold letters: \\"I loved it!!\\" all the way across the top of the page. I will even restrain myself from saying this was my favorite book of the year, because it is only January and there are many books to read. Simply put, I loved this book.I will not argue the finer points of history. I want a novel that entertains, educates and encourages me to delve into the subject matter with furthur intensity. This novel did just that. I am newly interested in the plague and in the herbs and medicines gathered long ago and today to soothe the miseries of mankind. I appreciate being enticed to research these topics more thoroughly. I also relish a unique plot, and I found the story line powerful and the ending pleasantly unexpected. I found the story told through a young widow and housemaid, Anna, to be a colorful character that gracefully narrates the stories of the villagers plagued with a deadly disease but with the courage to quarantine themselves from the outside world.For those of you reviewers that had issues with the historical factual presentation, I say buy a medical manual and miner's history books. I daresay you won't find a finer fictional novel about the plague than Geraldine Brooks' _Year of Wonders_."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Several friends recommended this novel, so I read it. I was impressed by the extent of Brooks's research and the apparent authenticity of the setting. But I found the novel shockingly trashy. Not only is it over-written in a flowery, gushing style, but Brooks threw in an excess of grotesque, sadistic and gratuitiously violent events beyond her graphic descriptions of plague sufferings. You name it, it's in there, from witch lynching to a near-crucifixion, to madness, to abortion by hot poker, to child abuse, to countless other horrors.

I prefer factual accounts of history (if well written), but this novel was recommended by a friend and I persevered to the end--which gave the impression of being \\"tagged on\\". The novel itself was an unrelenting series of shock, horror, and death (to be expected in a novel about the plague, but some of the gory details seemed unnecessary). At the point where Anna and Elinor go down the mine to save the child's stake and the protagonist says something like, \\"Of course, we had no skill or knowledge in the ways of mining,\\" I said to myself: well, yeah! Apart from the death of her babies, I managed to stay dry-eyed throughout as I never felt totally drawn into the story.

It's a pleasure to read and there isn't a lot of silly, unecessary language. Brooks' style has a great clarity to it. I did like the book, for the most part.

Also, it got redundant at times, like ok this person dies and now this one dies and now this one... going to die....Oh, and there are also a lot of typos, which annoys me.Despite all that, though, I recommend it.

Anna works as a housemaid for rector Michael Mompellion. Villagers turn from prayer to drink, witch hunts, hysteria, and superstition in their attempt to deal with despair as friends and family die. Mompellion encourages his parishoners to quarantine themselves from neighboring towns and villages, in an affort to prevent the disease from spreading beyond their village.After suffering the loss of her children, Anna nobly tends to the dying while ruminating over punishment, sin and destiny. Ultimately a year of catastrophe becomes a year of wonders.

Geraldine Brooks writes with such clarity and beauty that the passages form clear pictures in your mind that are almost like you are recalling your own memories. She does a brilliant job of eliciting so many emotions in the reader that each character seems so very real. The central character is amazingly developed. I read this book as a childless woman and was so moved. I've since re-read this novel after having children and was moved more than ever. I was slightly disappointed with how the author chose to end the novel, as it didn't leave quite the impact I thought it should have.

When the people of this town are threatened by disease, death and isolation, their actions in the throes of terror is enthralling.Some become selfless. Some go crazy. Most re-interpret their religion. Some become mean, spiteful, violent. Many look for a scapegoat. A very few keep their heads, and just try to do the right thing.I will say that the ending seems to go beyond the reasonable story that leads up to it.

I guess because I didn't go into it expecting a historically accurate setting and plot. ( I honestly wouldn't know if there was anything false about the time period of the top of my head) The story was well paced, vividly described, and enough action to keep the reader interested. I think the language could have been a bit more elevated. The story line could have become somnolent after the affair but it didn't. I disagree with the other reviewer that the heroine was out of her time. I imagine there are liberal minded people in any time period.

George Viccars is a journeyman tailor seeking a small out-of-the-way place to put the hustle and bustle of London behind him. While there, George wins Anna's attention by showing an interest in her oldest son, Jamie. As they begin to talk, George shows even more interest in Anna and makes a dress for her. Just as Anna is entertaining thoughts that George might replace her husband Sam, killed in the lead mines, George falls victim to the plague which he carried with him in the bolts of materials. In short order, the pestilence surges over the village, breaking into every family and killing two people out of every three. The merciless tide turns every day men and women into superstitious and scared people, and only the stern words and brave convictions of Michael Mompellion, the village rector, can hold those people in a somewhat civilized and supportive society. Still, as the deaths continue to mount, hope dwindles and is replaced by vengeful desperation. Murders, thievery, and witch-hunting break loose throughout the village, and Anna struggles with her own dying faith the the lure of a forbidden love.Geraldine Brooks' YEAR OF WONDERS is a 2002 ALA Alex award winner. The Alex is given to only ten books every year that were written primarily for adults but will have high appeal to the YA readers. In addition to this novel, Brooks has also written FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE, NINE PARTS OF DESIRE: THE HIDDEN WORLD OF ISLAMIC WOMEN, IMAZIGHEN: THE VANISHING TRADITIONS OF BERBER WOMEN, SWAN WATCH, and DAMES AND DAUGHTERS OF COLONIAL DAYS. She based YEAR OF WONDERS on actual events that took place in Eyam, Derbyshire, which she researched thoroughly. She is a former war correspondent and NEW YORK TIMES journalist.Told in a rolling dialect that Brooks perfected, the opening pages of YEAR OF WONDERS are mesmerizing, drawing the reader into the bleak and desolate world that her village became after the Plague was unintentionally brought among them. Her characters are rich and full, surely wrought from the same flesh and blood of the poor people that lived and died in Eyam, Derbyshire, the place that Brooks researched and based her novel on. The whys and wherefores of the friendships and disapproval of the women for and against each other in the novel are accurately portrayed. Michael Mompellion's church speeches and the way he throws himself into his work are inspirational and heartbreaking, setting up the losses and the secrets that come tumbling out in the course of the story. Although the larger society of London is not detailed so that the reader can compare what is going on in the village regarding every day life, the village itself is uniquely done. Most readers will feel as though he or she can walk the trails back and forth between Anna's home and the church, or up to the lead mines, or down in the streets and cemeteries. Brooks has a natural gift for dialogue, displaying an educated and cultural ear, stating precisely how different characters would vent their thoughts, hopes, aspirations, and fears. The author is also very frank in detailing the sexual mores at the time while remaining true to the interest level of the characters involved and how women might think of such things. The greatest thing that happens is the total involvement of the reader with the heroine. When Anna cries, the reader will feel the tragedy. When Anna's heart fills and lifts with hope, the reader will feel the lift as well. When at last the plague breaks and people are free again to live, so are the readers then freed from the emotional and frightening burdens they have been carrying. The narrative provides an immersive immediacy that will have most people devouring the novel in only a few sittings.The only thing that didn't seem to fit with the novel was the final eight pages. Although the information was good and needed, the abrupt turn Anna takes and how she gets there is too obscure.YEAR OF WONDERS is recommended to lovers of historical fiction. Brooks' research and world-building skills are amazing. But the casual reader looking for something different, something that will take him or her away from most works they've read before will also enjoy this novel because of the pacing, the beauty of the language, and the total immersive pull of the story."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks, a foreign correspondent and the author of NINE PARTS OF DESIRE shows that she can also write great fiction. This story was inspired by Eyam, a real village in England which is referred to as Plague Village. Brooks visited there several times and did extensive research for this novel.This is historical fiction in it's purest sense. The author tells the story of one Derbyshire village that was devastated by the bubonic plague. The main character is Anna Firth, a maid in the home of the local vicar, Michael Mompellion and his wife, Elinor. When the plague arrives in the village, the vicar preaches that the town's inhabitants should seal themselves away from the rest of the country and stay in the village. As time passes, and more and more deaths occur, the villagers can no longer cope and start to become involved in witchcraft and other barbaric practices. The two women, Anna and Elinor are the true strength of the community, and learn as much as they can about herbal lore and try to ease the pain and suffering of the victims. Once into the story, I did not want to put it down. It really shows the strength of the human spirit and how we have a bond that is shared by those who went before us. Although, this is a very painful story to read, it's written well and Brooks conveys true compassion through her main characters. After reading this book, I feel like I really visited that place and that time in our history.The ending was totally unexpected, but all things considered this is a great read and an unforgettable tale."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was movingly written. The author's powers of description lead to a real sense of the people and place of the Plague Town. The tragedy she writes about is very affecting. For emotion, I would give it five stars.But heavens it is melodramatic in the extreme. People are either saintly or practically demonically evil. True to melodramatic stereotype, the evil ones runs to either the Imperious Rich Baby-Killing Aristocrat, or the Dirt-Poor Drunken Abusive Lout. For variety, sometimes saintly people turn demonic--which is certainly a shock to the reader--but it doesn't seem possible for Brooks' characters to have more than one characteristic at a time. In parts the writing is really over-the-top:... For the melodrama, I would reduce it to 3 stars.So it evens out to 4 stars - meaning you'll enjoy it very much if you don't take it too seriously. Read it on the beach."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After I'd heard of \\"Year of Wonders\\" but before I'd read it my biology class took a day to learn about the bubonic plague. It was fascinating really. The disease comes from a bacteria that is transmitted through flea bites (usually who live on rats but sometimes dogs, cats, other animals) but there is a gene component to how it affects individual people. There are three kinds of genotypes when it comes to the plague. Type one-if you come in contact with the plague you catch it and die. Type two-contact results in catching the disease but you live. Type three-no amount of exposure can give you the plague.That same day we learned about a British village that after contacting the plague isolated itself from the world for a year. That is what \\"Year of Wonders\\" is about-and why I read it. It's a little fictionalized-some names were changed so as not to offend long dead people whose characters were changed, but it's still the story of a village that sacrificed the lives of over half its inhabitant's life's so as not to infect a nation.Told through the eyes, ears and voice of Anna, the mad at the rectory and a farmwife we learn of the extraordinary suffering, courage and evil that the human spirit can endure and exude in times of extreme stress.This is a wonderful little novel that speaks very much to the human condition and just how much a person can live through and still go on with life. It's hopeful, uplifting, horrifying and very grim-but also wonderful. It is important to remember that wonders are not just the good things in life which amaze, but the terrible which try us.To speak to a common complaint about the book-yes the epilog is out of left field a little bit more than unexpected. But I liked it.Four point five stars."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is a terrific book! Up until the last 50 pages or so, that is. Then, it seems like another author took over entirely. Brooks spent most of the book creating a wonderful tale that I believe really captured the time and the people in it. Then, wham! Of course the rector turns out to be a fraud. Because where could you ever find a pastor, let alone a Christian, (Anna at the end) whose faith endures? And ending up in Algeria and marrying a Muslim? Way too much to swallow."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Although the story is grim, you are immediately drawn in by the evocative writing that takes the reader back to an English village in 1666 that has been overcome with the plague. Anna Frith tells the story of life in the village that had been so beautiful for her. She had married a local ore miner and had two small boys and she had escaped the unhappy home of her father and stepmother.However, her happiness is short lived because her husband Sam dies and she is left to raise her small boys on her own. Still there is hope, she loves her children, she has a small herd of sheep and she works at the rectory as a maid; she is getting by. Then a tailor comes to town from London and Anna takes him on as a boarder in her home. His arrival in the village will threaten the small happinesses that Anna has found for herself.This story is based on a village in England where the inhabitants contracted plague and Geraldine Brooks has imagined a dramatic story of the village and the people who lived there. There is much to enjoy in the reading ofYear of Wonders: A Novel of the Plagueeven though the tale is a sad one. The author has managed to bring to life a time and place where hardship was the norm and the few joys in life were to be held closely.

This is an excellent book for both book clubs and individuals."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book is very well written and referenced and provides insights on life during a dark period of our past.

She married young to escape her father's house and held hope that her adult years would be gentler. Within three years, she had born two sons to her happy, yet simple husband, but none of the peace and happiness of her newly formed family would stay with Anna for long. The first tragedy (and certainly not the last) occurs when a mining accident claims Anna's husband, Sam. Anna's fortunes seem to turn the following spring when a young tailor, George Viccar, comes to town, wishing to board with Anna and her sons. Kind to her children, helpful around the house, and paying good rent, Anna sees Viccar as a God send, but when a bolt of clothe sent for by Viccar brings plague to the small town, the people feel Viccar was sent by the Devil himself. When the town accepts the harsh reality of their plight, the minister begs them all to promise to stay within the town rather than run away and infect the surrounding areas with the horrible sickness. Nearly every family obliges. The plague ravages the town quickly robbing Anna, and many others, of everything they hold dear. And like most tragedies in human history, paranoia and anger bring out the worst in people while hope and the struggle to care for the most helpless victims bring out the best.Geraldine Brooks writes elegantly, inspiring awe through her imaginative, yet genuine descriptions. Never verbose, Brooks gives us exactly what we need, not a word more. She creates an unlikely heroine through the character of Anna Frith who starts as an unsure, demure girl and grows into a self-sacrificing, educated savior to those in need of healing. Told through her perspective, this tale gives us not only a window into Anna Frith's soul, but a window into the common thoughts and wonderings that bind us together as humans, especially during times of woe. Year of Wonders has all the making of an American classic.Review written by Andrea Cefalo, author of The Fairytale Keeper series and chief editor of Obelisk Review"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I couldn't wait any longer to write a review about this book. This is one of those books I've had on my read list for a long time, and I'm kicking myself for taking so long to pick it up.The reader is transported back in time to the year 1665, just a season before the year in which the plague ravages England. We are given the tale through the eyes of Anna, a young woman recently widowed who is trying to raise her two young sons by holding together her small flock of sheep and working as a maid on the side. When she takes in a traveling tailor from London to earn some more money, she unknowingly lets in the \\"plague seeds\\" (as they call it throughout the book) that are harbored within his cloth. There is a brief snippet of news that king and court have emptied out of London and gone to Oxford, where cases of plague have popped up.And so begins a year of hardships and horror that this little village goes through. Anna, so young, yet so resilient, must endure the disease along with her neighbors as one by one, people she has known most of her life are picked of in a matter of days, even hours. And when you think it is all over, there are some twists at the end that really knock you off your feet. It won't be too long before I will want to read this book again. WOW!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I never thought that I would love a book that was about the plague, but I did! What a great book. The story was interesting and sad. The characters well thought out. I would recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I eat up historical fiction, though usually more renaissance/medieval stuff, so I was anxious to read Year of Wonders, based on a true story of the events of 1665-66 in Eyam in Derbyshire, England. When the town realized that the Plague had arrived in a flea-infested box of cloth from London, sent to the tailor, they decided to quarrantine themselves, and avoid the risk of spreading infection further throughout the countryside.The novel is from the perspective of Anna Frith, a young woman, a widow, and a servant in the Rectory. Through her eyes, we see the destruction of the town, not just their lives, but also their spirits as they turn against each other, and to superstition to try to understand why they are suffering so. The fiction bit of the story really centers on Anna's relationship with the Rector and his wife, Elinor. Class divides stop mattering as Anna and Elinor become friends and partners in attempting to find a cure, and to keep the spirits of the townspeople lifted.All in all, a truly gripping story, and one I'm very glad I read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This first effort by this gifted writer is strongly supported by her talented writing. Her ability to create moods and her descriptions of the smells and sounds of the village are well done. Her efforts to create complex, contradictory characters with real emotional depth, however, falls a bit flat. But it is, nonetheless, a valiant effort. Her characters are superficially conflicted, but the reader is left emotionally apart from these characters. Anna, the protagonist, has 21st Century outlooks and at times her views do not feel consistent with what a woman would think or feel in the 17th Century. So, this book does have its problems. In particular, the epilogue is simply dreadful and ridiculous. I won't give away anything, but the book would have been much better off without this silly, tacked-on ending.The strengths of the book lie in its' lack of sentimentality and its graphic portrayal of a village gripped in the midst of The Plague and the resulting fear and behaviors it elicits from the villagers. The character studies of how individuals react in times of crisis make this book a worthwhile read. So, far from a stellar achievement it is a worthwhile effort and I hope to see more from this intelligent writer."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was very interesting to read.

It is, in a word (and I hope not an overly trite one), spellbinding. It has all of the important i's in spades: it is interesting, it is informative, it is imaginatively plotted, it is ingeniously constructed. And, as a reader particularly fond of both mysteries and historical novels, I found it immensely enjoyable. To the author: Thank you!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In Geraldine Brooks' masterful novel of the plague based loosely on real events in the village of Eyam, Derbyshire, everyone undergoes transformations. Not least the lead character, Anna Frith. As a servant to the rector and a miner's widow, she has her feet placed in two very different worlds. As those worlds collide, she learns the stern stuff of which she is made.At times in YEAR OF WONDERS, one is unsure how much more bleak description there is to be borne. You are warned right on the cover that it is a \\"novel of the plague,\\" after all. Then, as if to give readers a breather, Brooks offers passages of such simple beauty that I found myself re-reading those segments in sheer admiration.YEAR OF WONDERS is a surprisingly fast read, given the subject matter. I breezed through it in a matter of a few days of stolen moments. When I had to stop reading in order to attend to some task, I found myself wondering how Anna was faring, and looking forward to getting back to her.Will everyone love this interesting, startling book? The reviews here at Amazon would indicate \\"no.\\" Did I love it? Absolutely."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I don't usually read novels, but this one is exceptional and is based on historical fact. Hard to put down, I couldn't wait to get back to it. This is a mesmerizing story and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is a novel inspired by the true story of the little town of Eyam in Derbyshire, known as the Plague Village, during the years 1665 - 1666. Although the cause of how the plague showed up in their village is still unknown, the villagers' decision to quarantine themselves in order to stop the spread of the deadly disease has sealed their place in history.Geraldine Brooks provides us with a fictional account of what life looked like from within the Plague Village and gives us insight into the human nature that accompanies tragedy.Anna Frith is a widowed housemaid busy raising her two sons and working in the home of the town's priest and his wife, the Montpelliers. When Anna's lodger dies she suspects the plague to be the cause of his awful death and it's not long before her fears are confirmed. The spread is rampant and the fatalities of the villagers grow daily. No one is safe from the disease and every Sunday the church pews get emptier. Anna and Mrs. Montpellier team up to care for those afflicted while Mr. Montpellier works tirelessly bringing comfort to the dying.What really fascinated me in this novel was the human factor - how the villagers dealt with the constant death of their loved ones and neighbors, the trauma of self-exile and how their faith was tried. They sought a reason why this plague had come upon them, to understand...why was God punishing them or was he testing them?My favorite part of the novel was the friendship between Anna and Mrs. Montpellier, which has been strengthened by the tragedy is really beautiful to read and you can't help but love both of them and stand in awe of their strength.The ending is a bit of a rollercoaster with the revealing of secrets and hidden desires realized. Brooks ties the ends up nicely and while I was a little surprised by the ending, it was a pleasant surprise and I felt a great way to say goodbye to Anna, knowing she would have the happy future she so deserved.This poor book has been sitting on my TBR tower for ages and I could just kick myself for waiting this long to finally read it! Brooks' writing is brilliant, I can't wait to read more from her. Do yourself a favor and read this! You won't be sorry you did =)"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had heard about this book from some book buddies, and decided to give it a try. I have always been fascinated with literature about the plague, so this really looked like my cuppa.Brief summary, no spoilers:The story starts out in the fall of 1666, and we are introduced to our protagonist, Anna Frith. We know she has been recently widowed, and we suspect that she has lost her two young sons to the plague. We are also introduced to a young Rector, named Mompellion. We can feel the attraction that Anna has for the young man, and we also know that he was suffered a terrible loss.The narrative then goes back to Spring 1665, and we found out what has happened during that terrible year.There are many things to recommend with this book. For one thing, I found it a page-turner and a quick read. I read it in two sessions.I also learned a bit about the plague, and it was interesting to see the attempts made by a community at isolation. So little was known about the plague and what made it contagious - and when you couple this with the deep religious fervor of that time, in particular Puritanism, you can see that the situation and the blame-game can run amok.I did have some problems with the book. I thought there were certain anachronisms that temporarily threw me out of the story. Sometimes, even if a term may be technically right in the sense it was in common usage at that time, it can still be distracting for the reader, if the reader isn't aware of this. As an example, this is what happened to me whenever I heard the characters use the word \\"prick\\". They are a few other examples of this type of thing in the book.I also thought that Anna (and another female character) showed certain modern sensibilities. She always seemed like she had one foot firmly rooted in the mid 1600's, and the other in modern times.Lastly, I was a little thrown off by the end of the book. Not necessarily upset by it, but it seemed as if it were from a different book, and seemed like a quick wrap-up by the author.Still, despite these quibbles, this was a quick fun read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A fascinating book, wonderfully written, that was completely different to anything I expected. Hard and harsh, yet at the same time full of hope and joy, however hidden these may be by the struggles the plague brings to an English village."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders [pulled] me in. I enjoyed the first person narrative. Anna, the main charcater is memorable and the loosely-based-on-truth story line is fascinating. Only downfall is the ending - which was weak - out of place - like another author wrote it. I highly recommend it overall."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks' novel YEAR OF WONDERS is a rich reading experience, one which quickly and easily transports the reader to the time and place of the story - a rural village in England, 1666 - and establishes a wonderfully varied set of characters. It is part historical novel, part mystery, part love story - and has a strong element of the \`coming of age' story about it as well, even though the central character is an adult, has been married, and is a mother.The story's narrator, Anna Frith, is a simple woman - poor, but happily married and ecstatic to be a mother. She works as a serving woman in the house of a wealthy local family, and comes to work in the home of the new minister and his wife as well. She finds a friend in Elinor Mompellion - the rector's wife - that she will cherish for the rest of her life, a friendship that will enrich her and change her life in ways that she could have never imagined.After the death of her husband in a mining accident, Anna takes in a lodger to help her with the few expenses of her life. He is a tailor, and a decent man - she is happy to have found such a tenant. When a bolt of cloth arrives for him from London, however, it carries with it the seeds of a disaster the likes of which Anna and the rest of the villagers could only envision in their worst nightmares of hell - the cloth is infested with fleas, which carry Plague. The disease kills the tailor himself first, then insidiously spreads throughout the village, claiming the lives of over half of its inhabitants by the time it runs its course. The story so well-told in this novel concerns the villagers trials at the hands of this demon - they are gripped by fear and preyed upon by not only their own superstitions and ignorance, but by those in their midst who would profit from their pain and suffering as well.Anna's journey - and the journey of the other villagers - through these trying times make for a very compelling read. There are horrors to be found here, as would be expected, but there are moments of epiphany and great joy as well. Brooks, an experienced journalist who has covered Bosnia, Somalia and the Middle East for The Wall Street Journal, has put the observational skills she has honed in that profession to good work here - even though is it set in another era, human tragedy, suffering and happiness are universal. The faces and the customs might change, but tears and a smile are recognizable anywhere - as are the deeper emotions of the heart and soul, which Geraldine Brooks has so aptly portrayed here. I'll be very interested to read her next foray into fiction - and from the quality I see in her writing, I hope there are many more."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"THe book was eloquently written.

When I began reading it I found myself saying, \\"Okay, when are people going to start dying already?\\" Stick with it. When the plague does strike the town there is a constant flow of drama and excitement, making it an entertaining as well as a quality read.It has been critisized that Geraldine Brooks made Anna too modern of a character.

Audio Cassette version read by Josephine Bailey, Books on Tape/Penguin Putnam, Inc. Book Number 5708Set in England, in1665-1666, this book recounts in vivid detail the effects of the plague on a little village whose main industry is lead mining. On one level, it is entirely too detailed account of how so many people sickened and died from the plague, spread by rodents and their fleas. On another level, it is a love story of the village minister and his wife, Eleanor. On a third level, it is a story of the achievements of the young housemaid, Anna, who becomes the central character recoding the events of the \\"Year of Wonders\\".The minister's wife, Eleanor, recognizes the intellectual ability of the recently widowed Anna, and begins to teach her reading and writing. Anna's husband had died in a lead mine cave-in. The young minister, who takes the place of the older Puritan cleric, preaches a sermon which causes the village population to quarantine themselves after they discover they are infected with plague. During this year of quarantine, Anna, the housewife, grows from a simple village girl, (who suffered the loss of husband and then her two sons), into an established mid-wife, with a knowledge of medicinal herbs, the ability to ease both child birth and the birthing of lambs, and a the ability to understand the motives of so many of her neighbors.In some ways, this book is too gory: the details of the birthing of both lambs and children are far too vivid. The details of the death of Anna's father, as punishment for cheating his neighbors when he dug the graves for the dead, are too vivid. And, the attempt to drown the newborn daughter of Lady Bradford is described too vividly. Some of this I ascribe to the ability of the reader, Josephine Bailey, whose skill in making you see and feel the scene is a wonder in itself. Ms. Bailey, the reader for the audio book, has a wide vocal range, so that you can almost hear the preacher exhorting the villagers to establish their self-imposed quarantine. I enjoyed the book as I commuted around I-495, the ring road around Boston."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. Geraldine Brooks, a Pulitzer Prize winner, has written a deeply vivid historical novel about an English village, circa 1666, coping with the Plague. The story is loosely based on a real village that voluntarily cut itself off from the surrounding countryside rather than spread the disease; a disease the villagers didn't understand in the least. Consequently superstition competes with practical compassion in the self-imposed cauldron of brutality and gruesome death. The writing is magnificent, drawing upon the vocabulary of the time.

There are several parts throughout the book that are not for the faint-hearted so be forewarned. This book not only educates you on how people lived in this time period and how they handled disease but also the emotional aspects of being a woman during this time period.The only issue I had with this book was at the end. This rather tentative woman who hesitated to wear anything brighter than the &quot;sad&quot; colors accepted a living arrangement (which I won't detail to give away the ending) that I think she would have found unacceptable being the person she was. Also, the person who she had this living arrangement with may have been someone famous but is not someone I am familiar so this part of the storyline was somewhat confusing.However, despite these concerns, I enjoyed this research, the writing and the historical fiction very much and i believe that you will too."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A beautifully written and fast paced novel that wisks the reader back to a small village in England during the mid 1600's.

This is one of those rare books, that you can't wait to find out what happens at the end, yet you really don't *want* it to end because you know you'll have &quot;nothing to read&quot; once you've come to the final page. Yeah, the ending was a little bit of a let-down, but not *that* much, not enough to recommend to readers to just forgo that part of the book. It obviously didn't leave me disappointed.

I checked it out from the library, and returned it two days later.For a novel that is so dark, and depressing, there is a lot of joy, and happiness as well.You don't know what is going to happen, and although the prologue does talk about a characters death, when it happens, you are suprised, and saddened.I have recommended this book to a couple of co-workers, and they have both thanked me (After having run out and bought it that evening)Strong characterizations, where even the most vile show some good, and the most saintly hide a dark past.WOnderful wonderful read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Inspired by the true story of a rural British village's plague year, 1665 to 1666, journalist Geraldine Brooks' fiction debut recreates a story of heroism, horror and death, narrated by a young woman, Anna Frith, widowed at 18 and maid to the village's two prominent families. The novel opens in the plague's aftermath with the apples rotting on the ground for lack of pickers. Two thirds of this village of lead miners and shepherds have died. Roused from his bitter torpor by the return of the squire's family, Michael Mompellion, the rector, emerges to deliver a tirade of recriminations on the family which abandoned its people to their fate.It all began with Anna's lodger, a tailor whose cheer and tales of travel enlivened her household. Her husband dead in the collapse of his lead mine, Anna supports two small children with her domestic work. A woman of no education but great natural gifts, life is looking up for Anna - Mrs. Mompellion has taught her to read and the tailor has proposed - when her young suitor is felled by a horrible disease. Anna cannot bring herself to heed his dying words and burn the new fabrics sent from London. Cloth is dear and the villagers' money has been spent.Brooks (&quot;Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women,&quot; &quot;Foreign Correspondence: A Penpal's Journey from Down Under to All Over&quot;) hauntingly imagines the creeping progress of contagion, the dawning terror and bewilderment of people who regard God as a daily presence. After a mob attacks an old woman as a witch, the rector calls upon the population to accept plague as a gift from God, an opportunity to shine with noble sacrifice and seal the village so as not to carry infection to the countryside. Arrangements are made for provisions to be left at the boundary and the villagers, who mostly have nowhere else to go anyway, hunker down. All except the squire's family, who slip out of the church during the sermon, turn off their servants, and flee.Anna's growing role as midwife and nurse leads her through crises, illuminating the generous, the craven, the devious, the weak and the strong. Religious fanaticism (this is after the Restoration and the ousting of Puritanism) rises; crops rot in the fields; the young die and the old live on. Brooks' journalistic eye seamlessly integrates details of 17th century life - household furnishings, food, the labor of lead mining and husbandry, and the rural worldview of God and superstition - into the drama of tragedy. If Anna sometimes seems to good to be true, this is a story that benefits from a strong beacon. So many of the secondary characters are helpless, already too beaten by their hard lives to rise from another blow, that Anna's character leavens some of the bleakness.Highly visual, with well-drawn characters, a vivid period sense and strong dramatic tension, Brooks' first novel is more than promising."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Overall, I did like this book. I find myself quite intrested in the years of the plague. So It was with intrest that I picked up a copy of The Years of Wonder. I found it to be a charater driven romanitic tale wrapped around a time of great diffuculty. I would have liked a little more detail about the Black Death in Eyam and a little less about the&quot; living&quot; survivors. Its a good twist on a romantic tale though."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Haunting and beautiful!

It's beautifully written. As a parent and grandparent, I dreaded reading the inevitable parts about the deaths of children.But the novel has problems. First, and not so major, is that the principal character, Anna, is a bit too savvy for her time and place. Authors often are unable to prevent their 21st century views from creeping into the portrayal of a character born in an earlier century. I found the philosophical leanings, feminist awakening, and medical insights of this peasant woman of the 17th century too modern and uncredible.Second, and more importantly, this novel had an implausible and ridiculous ending. The author loses control of her story about page 290 and goes off into flights of fancy for the last 15 pages of the book. It's not a bad novel until then."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks' Year Of Wonders pairs Stina Nielsen's smooth and clear voice with the story of an isolated village where a housemaid becomes a healer and heroine during the 1666 plague year.

This story offers good insight as to what situations may have occurred.I gave it 4 stars because the writing was just plain excellent.

Set in the plague-ridden village of Eyam, the story unfolds and is told in the voice of eighteen (eighteen!!) year old Anna Firth. Through Anna we experience what it was like to care for those infected by the plague, grieve for those killed by the plague, and experience the madness that overcame its victims (witch-hunting, self-flagellation, and sorcery).Inspired by the true story of the villagers of Eyam and their extraordinary choice, Geraldine Brooks does a phenomenal job of recreating this piece of history. She uses dialect and description that will thrill historical fiction readers and vocabulary that is fun to sort through: garret, masty, placket, croft, whisket, gritstone, and boose. She provides ample detail of the time period and all of its horrors, but also allows for good storytelling and character development. Most importantly she captures the disintegration of the time and makes us hurt for its victims. That said, the ending is a bit too pat (the reason for the four star rating) but this is such a great book otherwise it is easy to forgive.This is a perfect read for those who are interested in historical fiction or looking for an engrossing read. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is in reference to the slightly abridged audio edition of Year of Wonder. I loved the story ... being taken back in history during a time of such dread (An interesting comparison to what we are faced with today.) The narrator was sensational ... with a wonderful, flowing English accent ... she brought so much emotion to the story. I so enjoyed Geraldine Brooks' writing; however, I was very disappointed with the ending. Ms. Brooks took so much time developing her characters and her account of the plague; I wish she had carried it through to the end. I look forward to her second novel."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While it is not my habit to write book reviews, it is my occasional habit to recommend books to others which I have found to be worthwhile. I truly enjoyed Ms. Brooks' Year of Wonders for her simple but elegant writing style and her touching and sympathetic main character, Anna Frith. I won't comment much on the plot (since others have already done so) but I would say that Ms. Brooks' descriptions of Anna's life and times are very haunting and evocative. I normally don't like to become too bogged down with description, but I think the reader really becomes drawn into the sights, sounds and smells of Anna's 17th century world and her personal struggles which often seem uncomfortably close to our own modern ones. The epilogue did seem to be somewhat of an unlikely plot twist, but I am willing to put that down to my own prejudices.I enjoyed this book very much. Perhaps you will as well."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a beautifully written book based upon a real English town that dealt with the plague in 1665. Geraldine Brooks' use of language, much of it from old English base, makes a dictionary a must. Reading this on my Kindle was perfect as I could look up most of the words, even though there were a few that even the Kindle did not have. Brooks weaves a very realistic picture of time and place. The actions of the villagers could be in any time but the lack of any outside information as the epidemic goes on hightens the effect. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In 1665, the bubonic plague grips and holds hostage a community in the remote English village of Eyam. The villagers led by their minister decide to quarantine themselves believing that their sins must have brought down the wrath of God upon them in the form of this plague. The villagers then seek to appease the wrath of God by begging forgiveness and practicing self-torture. As a sense of isolation and panic set in, villagers turn on one another depicting the worst of human nature as well as the best of human nature as some seek to minister to the fallen sick. The author's choice of Anna as the narrator and heroine of the story was appropriate for the times as Anna had access to the gentry of the village as well as being part of the ordinary life of the villagers. I thought the dialogue exchanges between the players in the story was proper too - some of the phrases were a bit antiquated for our modern times but quite suitable for that era. It is a wonder indeed when Anna emerges as a stronger and an independent woman despite her personal losses."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders took me on a fantastic journey into an age I didn't know much about.

Otherwise, great book!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a terrific read. It deals with the arrival of bubonic plague in a small village in northern England. Based on a true story, it is a study of what happens to the social and emotional fabric of a tightly knit community when a dreadful series of events occurs. It is written from the point of view of Anna Frith, a recently widowed servant woman with two young children. She serves in the house of the local priest (Church of England) and his wife. She is depicted in the early portions of the story as being very limited in her horizons, having never left the village in which she has spent her nineteen years. She does not read at the beginning of the story. Her world consists of her two children, a few farm animals she keeps, and her work with the priest and his wife. Then all hell breaks loose. A border she has taken in collapses and dies from the plague. Soon other members of the village are hit with the disease. From that point on there is a pandemic. The story deals with Anna's growth during the course of the year as she works with the priest's wife and moves from sufferer to sufferer giving as much help as she can. She grows in strength, in courage, in perception of herself. She learns to read. She faces the horrendous loss of her two children and somehow survives. Anna's emergence into full womanhood occurs against the backdrop of a near total breakdown of the society around her. People come to shun the company of others, for obvious reasons. They seek scapegoats. They move away from traditional faith and seek help in the occult. They condemn two women as witches based on the flimsiest of \\"evidence.\\" Desperation and fear, in short, drive them to ever more irrational behavior, not untinged with greed and opportunism from time to time. It is truly the year from hell for all of them.The essence of good historical fiction is that it produce a realistic and believable past ambience and people it with characters with whom the reader can identify and a story that draws the audience in. This book does all three wonderfully. The ending is weak and stretches the imagination almost to the breaking point. But with that one caveat, this is a great story and great history written in beautiful prose."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I finished this in a day. Although the subject matter is dark and the content is intense in places, Geraldine Brooks' writing propelled me forward and I didn't want to stop reading.

Although I wasn't completely sold on the ending, I enjoyed this book immensely and I would definitely recommend it to fans of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"**Spoiler Alert**I had never read anything written by Geraldine Brooks, so I had no idea what to expect. I enjoyed her writings about the plague during the 1600's and its toll on a small village outside of London. The village became known as \\"Plague Village\\" was quarantined due to the serious outbreak of plague that killed over half of its population. The story of a young girl and the part she played in the survival of humanity when it felt there was none. Anna suffered more than most with ghosts from her past and present to haunt her sleeping hours. Anna was a great heroine of the village but few recognized her as such, as she was humble and didn't conduct the selfless acts for any reason other than the kindness towards another.Though it was a short book 255 pages it took me a while to read, I had to take it in pieces because parts are so honest and graphic."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This story depicts the lives of one community in England that is challenged and destroyed by the plague.

Though Anna's life is not free from struggle, as her young husband is killed in a mining accident, she begins to be happy again as her boarder, George Viccars a talented tailor, boards in her house and begins to instill a new happiness in her household. This happiness is short lived, however, as a bolt of cloth sent from London is infected and starts the spread of the plague. George Viccars is the first victim and as people begin to covet the beautiful dresses he made from the cloth, the disease is spread from farm to farm and rampages its way across the Puritan village.The Rector of the town is Michael Monpellion who lives with his wife Elinor. He decides to close off the town so the plague does not spread to other places from its infected population.If a town in 1699 sounds boring, you'll be surprised at the amount of drama and horror the village undergoes. Anna transforms during the year of wonders as she turns from being a shy, reclusive young woman to a healer of sorts. When the town's midwives, the Gowdies, are accused of witchcraft, Elinor and Anna take it upon themselves to learn the ways of the healing arts amidst the gardens and herbs of the Gowdies' garden. They gather herbs to strengthen the bodies of the citizens as well as try to ease the suffering of those with plague.This is a slim volume but it is full of action and drama. I felt myself feeling very happy and fortunate to live in this century versus one full of useless superstitions and ignorance. The characters are well drawn and when you read the book, you can only hope for the best as you see how difficult it must have been, especially for women, to survive in such a brutal time.Add this book to your fall reading list - I had it on mine, but when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks' novel, Year of Wonders, offers a compelling story of considerable hardships, trials, and experience of human nature under extreme circumstances. There were several strengths to the novel and a few flaws that in my mind kept the novel from obtaining 5 stars.One considerable strength to the novel is the development of the character of Anna Frith, one of the most level-headed female characters in English literature since Elizabeth Bennett in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. We see the world through this woman of high intelligence and astute observational ability. Brooks develops a cast of characters that is broad and compelling. Even though there are multiple characters of all classes and dispositions, the reader seems to be able to visualize them and keep them straight.There are however a few weaknesses to the novel that keep it from getting a 5 out of 5 score. One of these is that there often too many heroic actions on the part of Anna Frith, making her seem unrealistic at times. I am certain this aspect of the novel may make Anna a highly compelling and likable character for many readers, but too much heroism becomes suspect. For example, Anna and another woman put on men's clothes and mine ore so a poor orphan girl doesn't lose her inheritance. Having never been in the mines, they obtain a full day's worth of ore and use a highly dangerous method of mining with no experience with explosives. Unfortunately the ending is also highly unlikely and is actually the most unsatisfactory portion of the novel.I remained entertained throughout the novel but I reached several points in the book where I became frustrated with the heroine engaging in too many deeds that were unrealistic and which bordered on fantasy."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am an avid reader of historical fiction and have always had a facination with the plauge.

It is based on the true story of a small town in England during the plauge outbreak of 1666 that choose to quarteen itself so as to not spread the plauge to other towns.

You are struck by the horror and devastation, but not totally repulsed by the gore of so much death.I have wondered how people who survive something like this (seeing almost all of their family and friends die) do so without serious pyschological damage. They don't. Even those who seem strong cannot, in the end, withstand the trauma of it all. Their grief leads to some very strange and out-of-character actions. I highly recommend that you put enough time aside to read the last 100 pages without interrruption because you will be rivitted.

Some of the old dialect she uses, is sometimes confusing....Me and my English friends had to discuss some of the words, but you can put them into context of the sentence and be right.great book..disappointing finish....All in all, a good read..it was passed around a lot and everyone enjoyed it.."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have recently read the novel, Year of Wonders: a Novel of the Plague by Geraldine Brooks, and I found it to be a delightful and realistic story of the plague that struck Eyam, Debyshire in the mid 1600's. The first symptoms of the plague were found in the house of Anna Frith who was a household maid for the town's rector and his wife amongst other families. By the time it is confirmed that Anna's lodger did indeed die of the plague, the symptoms had already begun to spread. With the help of the rector, the town made the decision to barricade themselves until the plague left them entirely, which took about a year. They decided that no one was allowed in and no one was allowed to leave so that they might protect the neighboring villages and the rest of England.Throughout the novel, Anna learns the most out of all the characters. Year of Wonders is the story of her growth throughout the time of their besiegement. She becomes so much more independent and learns what is really important to her after losing so many of her loved ones. It is very interesting finding out how she chose to act upon the cards that were dealt to her.After reading this book, I would say that the most important themes are those of self-development. Every single character - no matter what the size of their role was - grew at some point throughout the novel. The characters all learn from their mistakes and from those of others. Anna in particular learns about herself by trying to prevent others from making bad decisions. All of this has taught me that anyone can make a difference - no matter how large or small their contribution is.I would definitely recommend this book for anyone age fourteen and above. Anna's narration is absolutely perfect - it makes the whole story come to life with all of the realistic detail Brooks puts into it. One thing to be careful about, however, is that some of the plague scenes in the beginning of the novel can get pretty graphic. Once the mood is set, though, there aren't as many scenes like that. My only other suggestion is that you don't read the epilogue. The novel has a satisfying ending, but I felt as if the epilogue ruined the ambience of the whole story. Everything changed so much that I felt like I didn't know the characters anymore, which was a let down after reading such a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it made me read more about the period and setting.

It's certainly the best book I've read in the past couple of years.Even though the protagonist is living in a completely different time and place, I felt as though I knew her. The character development is INCREDIBLE. I also am rarely ever moved to tears while reading, but this one tore me up in more than one spot. I found myself re-reading certain sections just to hear the words again, and I re-read them aloud. It's gorgeous writing. I'm glad I bought this one, instead of getting it from the library, because it's a keeper.

During the course of the illness their faith and sanity is tested many times beyond the point of breaking.I loved the female protagonists of Anna Frith and Elinor Mompellion. Elinor seems to know no limits and does anything to help those in need.

The dreaded disease spreads throughout the village, and within weeks, there is scarcely a household left intact.To her ultimate horror, Anna's boys take ill, as well as many of her relatives and friends. For some odd reason, she herself is untouched as she moves about them, struggling - mainly in vain - to save their lives.Alongside her survivor's guilt is a newfound strength, which continues to grow with help from Elinor Mompellion, the wife of the vicar for whom Anna is a maid. Before the plague, the two would never have been able to bridge the social gap betwen their life stations; but in 1666, everything is different.Brooks has done a commendable job, personifying a horrific period in European history and making its tragedies and changes accessible to 21st century readers."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was excellent.

I am a historian and find most historical novels jarringly full of anachronisms and inaccurate information. This book was recommended highly by someone whose judgement I trust, and I found it to be very well written and for the most part, quite accurate historically. Some reviewers find the book inaccurate, but I didn't see anything glaringly wrong factually (in terms of the general historical period, not the particulars of the history of the town), and this period of European history was a large part of my graduate studies. The ending maybe a bit improbable (and I must admit, the episode between Anna and the Rector grated on me), but the journey (Spoiler alert) at the end was not as improbable as some seem to think. There were British women who made similar journeys (some alone even--although somtimes clothed in native dress), although the ones I know of were in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is a novel afterall, and the author does indulge in some melodramatic tactics, but if that bothers you forget fiction and just read history (that's what I usually do). One reviewer may have a point that the \\"consciousness\\" of Anna, the protagonist, is modern--more feminist and secular than a woman of her time and place would be. That may be fair up to a point, but I was actually quite impressed with how well the author managed to enter the mindset of a woman of that period---reasonably well, I thought, and certainly much more effectively than other historical fiction I have read. As for the person who thought it was a \\"bodice ripper\\"--I don't know what they were reading. Unless one sex scene make a book a \\"bodice ripper\\"? Maybe this person thinks people didn't have sex in the seventeenth century?"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you approach this novel looking for historical veracity, you'll be disappointed, for the narrative consciousness is entirely modern. Inspired by the true events of a 17th-century English village that was 'quarantined' due to a localized plague epidemic, the story describes events in the life of a young woman who loses her family to the disease but herself survives, befriending an Anglican priest and his wife, who dedicate themselves to nursing the sick, burying the dead, and keeping the community in check when anger and horror at their circumstances lead some villagers to seek revenge on the traditional healers, also women. If you like stories of strong women, then this one has plenty of appeal. The characters are all larger than life, some of them more caricatures than characters, and there are some plot twists that stretch credibility, like the priest's love interests and his temporary insanity. As others have mentioned here, the ending is so improbable as to disappoint, but until that point, I found the book engrossing. Maybe its appeal is precisely how far from historical accuracy it strays in that the heroic and hopeful efforts by the main characters, and their discoveries of modern medical cures in the herbal remedies of the time, make the suffering and death by plague less grim than the true historical events would suggest."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was well written and seemingly well researched. Major characters, Anna Frith, Elinor and Michael Mompellion were well drawn.

You'd probably call it historical fiction, but it's just literature at its best, a seamless vision, amazingly free of artifice for something that is ultimately imaginary. Anna (the heroine) may have come from Brooks' head, but she's totally believable as a young widow whose home is invaded by plague. People start dropping dead right and left, but Anna's courage and resolve give the reader the emotional resources to face the terrors of the narrative. This book is a time-tunnel to an English village in 1666, a year of wonders. Jump in."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I would not normally pick up this type of book, but it was our selection for book club, so I did. It hooked me immediately and I had a hard time putting it down. What sounded like a dreary subject (the plague) was so well written that I think it makes it on my \\"all time favorites\\" list.This is a fictionalized true story of the plague overtaking a small village in the 1600's. It was brought in on a piece of cloth by a tailor in the town. The townspeople, mostly the younger ones, start dying a horrible death. Most villagers evacuate, but a few diligent souls stay, quarantining themselves and rendering to the sick.It was interesting to read about what they had to use in the way of medicine back then, the herbs and poultices they made, and the botanical background of the plants available to them - the writing was so good as the reader gets educated about these things and it is never boring. You are in awe of what these people had to go through at the time.The personal stories of the characters were also wonderfully crafted and the reader is drawn in very quickly. Sub-plots, drama and emotion prevail to a satisfying conclusion. We had a wonderful discussion about it in our Readers Group. It prompted me to pick up her autobiography as well, which gives you an insight into the author's background, but it was not nearly as good a book as this novel and why that year was considered a Year of Wonders. Read it - you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The mood of the novel is sad and depressing but the author does a wonderful job of creating a character that you connect with. She is human, has her own faults which she is aware of, but has an amazing amount of internal strength to accept and move on from what life has dealt her. However, this book changed halfway through and the ending was completely ridiculous. It lost that historical atmosphere to the book where you felt like you really could be reading about someone's life during 1666. By the end, I felt angry like I wasted my time since the author shortchanged her own work with a stupid ending that fits nowhere into the rest of her book. Its as though she got tired of writing her own book and just wrote anything to finish it. Don't waste your time...I hate to say that because I really did like the book until midway."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After all the praise I heard from usually reliable sources, I picked up this book. That's a couple of newspapers, magazines, and a friend whose recommendations will be suspect from now on.Brooks commits (over and over) what Patricia Finney (author of some wonderful Elizabethan historicals) calls \\" the sin of psychological anachronism.\\" Over and over. Her narrator/protagonist is heroic in the mold of an ... heroine; the Anglican minister and his wife could take up residence at any suburban Episcopal church in America. About the time the minister's wife and our plucky protagonist climbed into the mine to save the little Quaker girl's claim, I did some advanced book-flinging.And it's not just the ludicrous anachronisms; the writing sytle is also ponderous and wearying. Brooks apparently never heard the writer's maxim \\"show, don't tell.\\" We are TOLD, in no uncertain terms, where each poor character stands in the Anna-ordered universe. No character -- not even the beloved Mompessons -- gets a voice of his or her own.There is a revival going on now of really good historical fiction, probably in reaction to the tiny, solipsistic novels that pass as literature today. Brooks tried to catch that wave, but missed. ..."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I can't believe I just read ANOTHER truly horrible plague book. This is just not my year. Ken Follett's World Without End was ... looking back, I would have rated it only one star.At least this little piece of fiction was short. Ugh, the characters!Year of Wonders.Plague hits one little lead-mining town in northern England, because the itinerant tailor imported some infected wool. The town decides to isolate itself in order to prevent the spread of the plague.Our narrator, Anna, is the daughter of a poor lead-miner. An alcoholic one, at that.But her narration reads just about like Jane Eyre throughout the book, which sounds jarringly \\"off\\". This is supposed to be a peasant here. The narrative style was not peasant-y.Take page nine. \\"I open the door to my cottage these evenings on a silence so thick it falls upon me like a blanket. Of all the lonely moments of my day, this one is always the loneliest.\\" Oh, I think it's pretty prose, don't get me wrong, but peasants don't talk this way, let alone really behave with as much introspection. Peasants don't EVER use the word \\"zephyr\\" -- you can take my word for it. Check out this turn of phrase: \\"Our village is a thread of dwellings, unspooling east and west of the church.\\" It's a little highbrow.The narrative style was so distracting, that I couldn't enjoy the book. Way too literary -- she should have chosen a different narrator.This rural community was ... too new-agey to be believable.Oh, sure, they kill the midwives in a stereotypical witch-hunt.But these are lead miners. Rather than all this peace, love, and understanding, these folks *should* have been dull-witted and violent to a very high degree.The whole bit about (I'm paraphrasing here) is the plague sent from God? Is it the work of the devil? Or is it just the natural order? Is this a test of our faith or just a circumstance of life? What is faith, and what is superstition? Why do we spend so much time pondering these imponderable questions? Maybe our time would be better spent figuring out the causes and contagion patterns of the plague. (end paraphrase) These are fairly 20th-century thoughts for a (probably lead-poisoned) servant in 1666 to come up with, eh? But you can read them for yourself right there on page 215.And then Mr. Mompellion -- really, he seems modeled on the uptight cousin from Jane Eyre -- handsome, stern, forbidding, unforgiving of himself and those closest to him. A gifted orator, perhaps, but rather a sorry Christian. Oh, and his sermons are called \\"hectoring\\" -- because, you know, that's how Christians are.I just think Geraldine Brooks borrowed too much for her characterizations, without really making up new people of her own.By the time we get to the end of the book, we have totally abandoned the idea that Anna's narration is coming from a 17th-century servant, and now she seems to speak with a proper university-educated post-modern American sensibility. Suddenly, and very clearly, Anna knows that she does not want to walk each day in yet another place where Elinor had walked. For I am not Elinor, after all, but Anna. Check out how she makes a deal with a Muslim doctor to live in a sexless union in his house. Very likely!Bah. I'm going back to non-fiction. This was a bummer year for fiction for me. And it's only April!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Absolute trash, modern-day PC mentality masquerading as 17th c. England. There are several great one-star reviews on here that are totally correct about her flaws of style, psychological anachronism, etc. To these, I would like to add one more: her Christian minister has never heard of Christ, to be able to utter a phrase like \\"Repentance is one thing, Anna, but atonement is another!\\" (and proceed to impose his own Oprah-like version of \\"atonement\\" on the sins of his wife's youth). And, of course, having given up on the oppressive men of England, the heroine finds her haven with a tolerant, enlightened Muslim in Algeria who is apparently equally ignorant of the basic tenets of *his* religion, at least as regards to women and infidels, that are so amply attested in the news today. Laughable.Ah, but that's Geraldine Brooks for you. I actually picked up Year of Wonders after gagging my way through the awful \\"March\\" because an Amazon reviewer contrasted the former favorably with the latter. No, she is as true to herself in \\"March\\" as she is here, hijacking someone else's story only to populate it with the most extreme deformities of the post-modern worldview.

I had found it in the library, and returned to get it. I read it in perhaps two sittings. It was gripping, moving, but...in the end, it fell completely apart. The heroes turn out to be monomaniacal hypocrites, I almost felt sorry for the heroine, only I could not conceive how she had succumbed to such stupidity. The rectors wife was perhaps the only person to draw from me any great sympathies. Her life is a tragedy in more ways than one, and as the wife of the rector, is perhaps more so now, though they seem a happy couple. Until she dies.The story is set during the true horrors of the plague but the web of entanglement is just a bit too contrived to be believed. I closed the book feeling cheated. In the end it felt a bit like a renaissance soap opera. I'm sure HBO could have a field day with it. All in all, a disappointing read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"The Year of Wonders\\" tells the story of a small village in the 1600s afflicted by the plague. The villagers are convinced by their charismatic rector, Michael Mompellion, to isolate themselves in the hopes of keeping the plague from spreading outside of their community. The book is written through the first-person viewpoint of Anna Frith, a young widow who sometimes works for the rector and his wife, Eleanor. Although unschooled, Anna is bright, brave, and compassionate. As the plague affects more and more people, Anna works closely with Eleanor, both in nursing those that are ill and in trying to prevent the spread of the disease to others. While the plague brings out the worst in some people, in Anna it brings out an extraordinary capacity to grow and change; she becomes capable of accomplishing things she would never have thought possible.Anna's relationship to Michael and Eleanor Mompellion is an important part of the novel. Anna greatly admires both Eleanor and Michael, but at the same time she is somewhat jealous of their love for each other. She sees their marriage as a perfect union, while she is all alone in the world. Anna will discover that Michael and Eleanor's relationship is much more complex than it appears.Geraldine Brooks uses some archaic vocabulary in the story, which adds to the authentic feel to the book. To me, \\"The Year of Wonders\\" is definitely one of those novels where you really feel transported to another place and time. \\"The Year of Wonders\\" is well-written, thoroughly engaging historical fiction."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just this moment finished reading Year of Wonder.

As a matter of fact I scarcely imagined Anna & Michael's rendezvous, though I hoped for it once Elinor was gone.The story is fluid & engaging & it drew me in like a friend confessing a her truth to me in confidence. I am glad that I generally choose what I read based on the way the cover looks. Year of Wonder like the painting on the cover is a sensual, full-bodied tale chocked full of historical references & language (including idioms that I had to research)that made the story most believable.

As conditions in the town worsen and the residents begin to die overnight and in mass numbers, resident and widow Anna Frith must help the Mompellions cope with the disasterous effects of disease, fear, religious zeal and murder.

Having recently read The Great Mortality by John Kelly, I found the intimate details of life in these times even more fascinating."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After readingMarch, I had to immediately read this novel by the same author. It's the story about the plague hitting a small village in England and how the people in the small town change as a result of it. I've been fascinated with historical fictions about plagues since reading Connie Willis'Doomsday Book. I still think I enjoyed Doomsday Book a bit more, but they are, after all, two entirely different stories.I found it interesting how this particular plague tale focuses on a real plague in a real town. The Puritans of the town don't know whether to blame God, Satan, or witches for the plague. It's interesting how they looked to their pastor (who wasn't a Puritan) as a leader to tell them what steps to take next: quarantine their town, burn all their possessions, etc. The main character, Anna, was dreamed up by the author when she read that the town's minister's servant was spared in the plague. Curiosity about the servant led to the author creating a historical fantasy in her mind about the town, its inhabitants, and the ministers servant.This was a great first fiction novel for Brooks. However, it doesn't have nearly the power that March has. The only semi-unfulfilling parts for me were the unfinished relationships and an ending that felt rushed. Of course there are going to be unfinished relationships in a time of plague, but there are too many that are senselessly cut short. And when the main character is suddenly thrust into a new life toward the end, we merely get a detail-starved synopsis that leaves us wishing there was more. I suppose that an author has the prerogative to end their story however they want, but I wish they wouldn't take the story to such a different turn and then just stop."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A story about the plague that is set in England in the 1600's isn't one that I would have likely read had it not been chosen by my book club. However, I'm glad that I read it, and highly recommend it to others. Even if you're someone who doesn't generally read books set in a different time period, don't shy away from this one. It may take a few pages to adjust to the language, but the story is compelling and moves quickly. Dire circumstances bring out the best in some people and the worst in others, and this author does an outstanding job of demonstrating this through the experience of the residents of a small village that is nearly decimated by the plague. Based on a true story and told through the eyes of Anna, reading about this small village is an emotional experience that offers opportunities to examine ones own reactions to the decisions and actions of the village members."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was wonderful to read, especially the ending. It tells the story of a woman, Anna Firth, who moves back and forth in society between the villagers and the decision makers during the plague year. Her observations are the heart of the book. The ending is particularly moving because all her prior beliefs about right and wrong are completely turned upside down. She must create a new sense of morality for herself in a new place and with a different religion (or lack of religion). The ending is difficult to accept, we want something else for her, we want her faith restored and in tact. The author was very brave to end the novel the way she did. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in the past year.

Very, very informative.You really feel for the inhabitants dealing with the scourge.I would give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"You have to wonder what happened while Geraldine Brooks was writing this novel. The first three-quarters or so are anchored solidly in realism, exploring the physical and emotional reactions of a seventeenth-century village in central England decimated by a Plague epidemic. The story is based on a true one -- the entire village cut itself off from the outside world to keep from spreading the infection while the disease stalked through their community, killing them one by one. The point-of-view character is perhaps a bit too intelligent and perceptive, but this is a common failing in this kind of historical novel -- the novelist needs to insert their point of view, and it's easier if the protagonist can serve as an intellectual stand-in, even if they become a bit of an anachronism.However, after the Plague has just about run its course, the novel hares off in quite another direction. Our first warning of this is that events suddenly become much more dramatic -- madness, torture and murder erupt, playing out in some truly harrowing scenes. Then the muted, hitherto unconsummated romance that has been smoldering in the background bursts out in a literal bodice-ripping frenzy, giving our protagonist one well-deserved moment of unabashed carnal bliss. But wait -- the male love interest proves, against all previous evidence and character-building, to be an utter rotter, so she sets off with his horse (which previously only he could ride) and a baby -- not hers, it's complicated -- with assassins on her trail, to end up in North Africa, nominally married to an Islamic doctor and studying medicine. It's fortunate she's a whiz at learning languages.I give the book four stars because most of it is magnificent. It's well-researched and well-written, and as far as I can tell it accurately describes the world of rural 17th-century England. It's just that last part... (shaking my head). Well, I'm sure there's a reason for it. Sometimes a book can get away from you, and your characters take over. It's just that it feels a little bit, if you'll excuse the expression, \\"Mary Sue\\"."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"From first to last, this book was magnificently written -- I just love it.

Is it a depressing and laborious read? Absolutely not. I read it four times now. I am certain I will read it many more times over the years to come.

The cover art is quite nice."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I went into this read really wanting to love it since I've heard such great reviews. While there were aspects I greatly appreciated, I was sorely disappointed. The main reason lies in the plausibility of a multitude of circumstances. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the concept of suspension of disbelief. However, for me, I tolerate it less in historical fiction than other genres.Inspired by actual events that occured when residents of Eyam Derbyshire voluntarily quarantined themselves in response to an outbreak of The Plague, Brooks allows the full range of human responses to play out. Some residents see the outbreak as a punishment from God and commit to extreme penitence such as self flagellation, others turn on their neighbors, others collapse under their own greed, and some focus on service.There are some things with which Brooks does an excellent job. Within a fairly short novel, Brooks aptly develops rich characters that truly reflects human nature. Her protagonists have flaws. That was refreshing, particularly when contrasted with their extreme heroic actions. The story itself is well developed, and she is able to portray the emotions of the characters in a vivid manner.Where she lost me was in the intuitive knowledge that with which Anna is imbued. It just really irritated me. I couldn't figure out why Anna had not discovered a cure for The Plague. Further, the historical context for some of the medical knowledge seems a bit stretched by about 100 years."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After reading Chevalier's \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring,\\" which I thought read like a Fodor travelogue, I was wary of reading this novel. From the instant I began \\"Year Of Wonders,\\" I was engaged by this brutal and moving story of the plague. Brooks deftly informs her characters with passion, suffering and hope. While one may question Brooks' title as misplaced because of the unrelenting grief that hangs like a shroud over her characters and her readers, one realizes that the title aptly captures the meaning of her work: That there is wonder and even glory in the human will to survive and prevail."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book. It is one of my all-time favorites.The book is a fictionalized version of the events surrounding the last township affected by the plague.

The main character, Anna,starts out as a hardworking, illiterate widowed servant with small children and grows to become the mainstay of her plague-ridden village despite her own horrible grief. People do have potentials that only become evident under disastrous circumstances.The book is extremely well-written, giving the reader a strong send of place, and the isolation of the village, shut off from the world by contagion. Reading it was extremely enjoyable despite the sadness and the graphic descriptions of deathand violence.The final section seemed to come a bit out of nowhere but provided an amazing contrast to the rest of the book. I strongly recommend this book to those who, like me, are drawn to the plague as a metaphor for the human condition. If you enjoyed this book you might also enjoy Connie Willis' \\"The Doomsday Book\\"."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm a sucker for historical disasters, so of course I had to read this fictionalized account of the \\"Plague Village.\\"The story is told through the eyes of Anna Frith, a 22-year-old widow with two small sons. Anna makes ends meet by working as a domestic servant for the charismatic vicar; and becomes close friends with the vicar's wife, who teaches her to read. Anna rents out a room in her cottage to a tailor, who receives a shipment of cloth from plague-ridden London and sparks an epidemic of bubonic plague in the village. The villagers, at the vicar's urging, bravely quarantine themselves to avoid spreading the plague throughout the countryside.The first few chapters of this book are truly heartbreaking. I found myself sobbing more than a few times, and I am not the sentimental type. Those who do not succumb to the plague find themselves caught up in other tragedies brought on by fear and despair. Ultimately, Anna survives the epidemic (which leaves most of the villagers dead) and discovers strength within her that she didn't know she had.The writing is wonderfully evocative and the author does not shy away from the awful details of watching helplessly as ones you love fall ill.The story did stray into unbelievability a few times. Anna goes from an unskilled, barely-literate farm girl to an accomplished healer, midwife, etc., in a very short period of time. Still, I can forgive a bit of excess since the story works so well up til the final chapters.HOWEVER...(spoilers alert!)I had to take off a few stars for the ending, which is just plain bad. I came away with the impression that the publishers must have said \\"Great story...but you need the vicar to have some sort of terrible secret, and we need some gratuitous sex.\\" And I found Anna's decision to flee into a North African harem rather unbelievable.

And then I read the last section and epilogue and cringed as a great story became nothing more than a soap opera.Survival isn't just staying alive, it's keeping the values of your society intact and passing on the learnings from one generation to the next. With her botched ending, Brooks undercut this theme and destroyed Anna's integrity as a character.I wish I could rave about this book-and I can, three-quarters of it is outstanding-but Brooks fell down on the last part and shortchanged her readers.----------------------------------Most haunting image--when Anna described her mother looking through the bars of the branks that her father put on her for cursing him in public.

Set in 1665-66 this book not only tells the story of a community dealing with the crisis of the plague it also sets us to wondering about epidemics over the ages. Our world has delt with a multitude of virulent diseases such as smallpox, polio, influenza, and leprosy (to name a few) and has managed to conquer these diseases that were once considered a death sentence. More recently AIDS and Ebola have reared their ugly heads and presented a challenge to men of science. In todays world we realize that these diseases have a scientific basis and potential cure. Year of Wonders examines the thought processes of our ancestors who believed that disease and natural catastrophes were caused either by an angry God seeking retribution for our many sins, or were the works of the devil bestowing his evil via an earthly vessel, ie., a witch or warlock.Based on the actual events that took place in the English mining town of Eyam, we observe the people of this village through the eyes of Anna, a housemaid at the local rectory who, following the death of her husband, takes in a border in the person of a tailor who has fled London and the Black Death. He becomes the first plague victim in Eyam. As the disease begins to spread, the villagers lead by their Vicar, decide to quarantine themselves in order to prevent the disease from spreading . Like a creeping fog, death visits each house in the community and as it does, the reader becomes an active participant in the panic, despair, rage and superstition that overtakes the village and drives its people to commit heinous acts in their futile attempt to survive.While the vicar is instrumental in the decision of the village to quarantine itself to prevent the disease from spreading to other towns, it is the women of this story, Anna, Mem Gowdie, and Mem's niece Anys who are ultimately the shining stars of this drama.If you experience a vicarious thrill by immersing yourself in historically based fiction, then you are in for a real treat with this offering from Geraldine Brooks"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"Year of Wonders\\" is an incredible novel. Geraldine Brooks manages, somehow, to gracefully intertwine incredible scholarship, thoughtful philosophy, compelling characters, and an engaging plot into a unified whole. The quality of Brooks's research and of her writing style makes it difficult to conceive that this is fiction. Anna Frith is an intelligent, believable, compassionate narrator, and it is her perspective that makes the novel come to life. The effects Brooks imagines of such a catastrophe on a village are entirely believable.My only desire is that Brooks would have had a different ending to her epilogue. Yes, it is necessary that Anna should find a new direction and meaning to her life, but the path that Brooks creates for her is highly unlikely and improbable and ruins the artistic unity of the novel. Otherwise, in my perspective, the book is almost flawless."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a teacher, I am always looking for books that can be used across curriculums. This is a great literary read, with good plot and character development. Additionally, it provides historical insight of the plague and its effects in England and Europe. And finally there is a modern scientific tie-in through an episode over the Black Plague from the PBS series Secrets of the Dead which examines this town and some of its present day descendents of those who survived the outbreak. It explores the genetic research has been done to find out why a small number of the townspeople did not fall victim to the plague. The speculation is that there is a genetic mutation responsible for their immunity which seems to also be the case in some people seem to not develop aids despite exposure."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"*Year of Wonders* is a potent piece of historical fiction. I was mesmerized by Anna's story: even though she's an 18-year-old girl, a farm girl who's never ventured outside her village, she makes powerful observations about both the beauty and ugliness of human nature. She receives Elinor's knowledge, sees the goodness in Anys the \\"witch,\\" and constantly turns her mind to the words of the charismatic Mompellion, while the other villagers grow more and more hysterical, superstitious, and violent. Thus, one cannot help but respond to Anna's feelings, and read on impatiently to see what she will do next.Beside the characters, I was also morbidly interested in the detailed descriptions of plague. And Brooks doesn't spare any details: she unflinchingly writes about the horrors of the disease and the psychological damage it wreaks on the quarantined (and let's face it: ignorant and stupid) villagers.One small point of contention: as so many novels tend to be these days, Brooks is quite persistent with the feminist themes. There are very few, good men in this novel, as if men in this story, in this time and space are too far removed from the human heart to be of much help. Notably, Anna's father is a complete pig, and the other men in her life are either ineffectual, weak, or perhaps, evil. However, I kind of understood where Brooks was coming from when I read the interview at the back of tthe book. She says that as a foreign correspondent, she chanced to see many instances of ordinary women doing extraodinary things in the desperation of the situation. How true, alas."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Sometimes you'll read a book and it will stay with you for a long time. Other times, you'll read a book and it will give you one passage, or one scene, that keeps coming back into your mind. This book has done both for me.

It was moving beyond words.Now, for the bad...the ending did not disappoint me to the degree it did some of the other reviewers. I think maybe because someone gave it away in their review and so I was anticipating it all along (shame on you!!!!).

Brooks is operating in a modern frame of mind and narrative with Anna, which I was willing to forgive, but Anna is SO giving, and understanding, and noble that you really feel she as a character has nowhere to go - except for her faith, which she questions almost as an afterthought in several points in the book. The right way to end this book would be to have this questioning become a real crisis for Anna, and have her transformed by that crisis in some way. Instead, she quite literally rides off into the sunset away from the plague village, and even more unlikely, ends up with two daughters to replace the two sons she lost in the epidemic - all without ever really dealing with the one point - her faith - which would have made her an interesting, well-written character. What could have been a wonderful insight into the seeds of thought for the Age of Reason became a contrived happy ending. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"YEAR OF WONDERS by Geraldine Brooks is a trip in time back to l666, the plage year, in Eyam, a small English village. The villagers are convinced by their rector, Michael Monpellion, to quarantine themselves when they figure out that the Black Death will decimate their village and spread to other areas. Anna Frith, a maid in the rector's home is the narrator. She suffers the tragic deaths of a male tenant friend and her two young boys. The desinegration of the villager's psyches is frightening. Ignorance, hatred, and mistrust bloom evilly like the nasty rose-colored sores on the bodies of the dying. Anna Frith's growth throughout the narrative is phenomenal. From a simple maid and shepherd she moves into the forbidden and risky area of herbal healer. Two women healers, Anys and Mem, are murdered because of the villager's superstitious beliefs regarding witches and their evil intent. So Anna's transformation is courageous as well as beneficial to the villagers.Brooks, a journalist and war correspondent, lived in England in l990. While hiking through the English countryside she came upon a sign pointing to Eyam with a note beneath: Plague Village. Brooks found the sign intriguing and couldn't let it go. YEAR OF WONDERS IS Brook's first leap into fiction.Many incidents in the story are documented in manuscripts from the times making this story believable. It's a great trip to a terrible time and place and Brooks made the villagers of Eyam live again.The use of archaic terms keeps the reader reaching for a dictionary. For example: \\"He was fevered, his mouth caked with SORDES, struggling for breath.\\" Three thick dictionaries later and the word--sordes--still hadn't been found. Working with context seemed to be the best bet on finding the meaning of some of the words. The archaic words did lend an antique flavor to the book that is not out of place. The ending seemed to come out of left field with many questions left unanswered like--Why didn't Anna stay in England in another small obscure village where she could have become the local midwife and healer?YEAR OF WONDERS is a wonder-filled story. It's elegant and convincing. Other books by Geraldine Brooks are NINE PART OF OF DESIRE and FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel is a beautifully written, detailed account of the plague in a small English village in the 1600's. It is hard for us to imagine an illness that spreads so rapidly with such deadly effect; indeed, today a course of antibiotics results in a speedy full recovery. Brooks is a reporter with a great eye for detail and a sensitivity to the devastating emotional, sociological and economic impact such a disease had on this tiny community. I listened to the very lightly abridged CD/Audio version of the book, which I highly recommend; parts of the story moved me to tears. Like other reviewers, however, I was quite bothered by the ending of the novel, which was not in any way anticipated by the rest of the story, and was simply not credible given who the main character was, and the historical setting. Other than that, however, well worth your while."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really loved this book until I reached the last few chapters. The majority of the book is well written and has wonderful character development and historical information about the plague and its affect on a small town's population. However, the last few chapters read like a gothic romance novel. It could be an entirely different book. Despite the disappointing ending, I would recommend this book to my friends."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"-- On the surface, few tales could be more appealing than this one, which was loosely based on an English town which quarantined itself rather than take a chance on spreading the plague to nearby villages. The heroine, Anna Frith, is an appealing and dauntless character (although the story is told completely from her point of view, with little understanding of the conflicting motives of any other characters). The author generally writes well and the story moves with the intensity that you would expect from the plot's appeal.-- Nevertheless, the ending of the story seems so badly botched and becomes so unbelievable that the tale's credibility simply falls apart. For one thing, a villainous upper-class family handsomely pays Anna to run off with one of their newly-born illegitimate children, which is about the least-likely scenario possible. The town's previously-heroic minister is found to carry a rather unbelievable secret which has little to do with the story. Finally, life in an Islamic harem (to which the heroine escapes) is portrayed as the answer to nearly every woman's dreams, when the reality was probably quite different.-- In short, if you read this one, skip the ending. You'll save time and you'll have a much better read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am a sucker for anything historical, so I knew Year of Wonders had at least that aspect going for it. And by novel's end, I felt very satisfied. It was everything I expected, and even a little bit more. And as depressing as this book may seem, I had a fantastic experience with Year of Wonders, and am looking forward to another book by Geraldine Brooks.Set in a small village in England in 1666, Year of Wonders tells the story of young Anna Frith, a widow with two small boys. When Anna takes in a boarder, an experienced tailor from London, he unwittingly brings with him the Plague contained in a contaminated bolt of cloth. As the infection spreads throughout the village, the rector, Michael, asks the villagers to quarantine themselves in an effort to keep the sickness from escaping into neighboring communities. And Anna soon finds herself in a position of healer, comforter and companion to the many families in which the Plague affects.This was an incredible story. And at first, one is puzzled regarding where the \\"wonder\\" fits in. Then by the close of the book, it all becomes clear. I was utterly fascinated by the struggle and strength of the Plague community. I will remember this novel for a long, long time. I hope there is another great story coming soon from Geraldine Brooks."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I read the first chapter, I was not sure that I was going to enjoy the book. But then I became thoroughly involved...in fact, could not put the book down. Then came the final chapter...a true disappointment. It did not leave you hanging, but it just did not seem a part of the story. I would recommend the book.....but omit the last chapter."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Anna Frith is a servant; she is poor, illiterate and she is the daughter of an abusive drunkard. Getting rid of another mouth to feed is his goal. Anna is married young and is widowed shortly thereafter. Her only respite from her terrible loneliness, especially after the death of her two babes, is the hours she spends in the home of Reverend Mompellion. He is a pensive, studious man, married to a gentle, nature loving wife, Elinor. Anna knows her place as a servant and at first finds it uncomfortable to respond to the friendly overtures made by her employer's wife, who also teaches Anna to read.Elinor is an enthusiastic gardener and has a growing interest in the herbs being cultivated by an ostracized family of women who are suspected of being witches, despite the fact that many of their herbal preparations have proven beneficial to the local villagers. From the beginning of this engaging novel the reader experiences a growing tension and increasing realization that something will happen to this tiny village and its mostly poor inhabitants. And that \\"something\\" is the Bubonic plague that in reality struck an actual English village upon which this story is based.Anna is so key a character that it is within her household that the person carrying the plague, a vagabond-type tailor, actually sets in motion the larger plot. How will persons of varying socioeconomic levels and belief systems deal with a plague? Will it force some to rely on their destructive superstitions? Will it be a catapult to positive change? What will its devastating force do to the small minded, the idealistic, the religious minded?These questions are all dealt with in this beautifully written novel. Reverend Mompellion is a good, idealistic man. Because he's educated, he and his wife are invited to the homes of some of the area wealthy. It is at these gatherings that he first learns that those \\"who have\\" will flee the area for London, expecting to escape suffering and death. Because the plague struck during 1655 and 1666, there was no understanding that the Bubonic Plague was carried by fleas from infected rats. Undoubtedly, escaping the poor, dirty peasants would bring a higher social strata some insurance from being affiliated with and, therefore, infected by the underclass!Death escapes no family. Some are decimated within days. Yet various neighbors assist one another, nurse one another, one another's children...and ultimately bury them. Others are convinced the witches are the cause of the plague; a murder takes place. All the while Reverend Mompellion keeps his head and is a strong, persistent leader who convinces his parishoners of two things: God is testing them; and they should voluntarily quarantine themselves so as not to spread the plague any further.Reverend Mompellion strikes a deal with a leader of a neighboring community to bring food and supplies to a certain point beyond which none of the villagers will stray. The community continually shrinks as its inhabitants die in increasing numbers. Church services are eventually stopped indoors, hoping lack of close proximity will quell the plague. Services are held for decimated numbers outside. Yet, Reverend Mompellion prevails in his unflagging belief in God....until tragedy strikes his own household and his own faith is crushed.The novel's ending is very much a surprise. As I earlier indicated, some grow in knowledge, spirit, understanding and generosity. Others do not! Belief systems are shaken but the results are not necessarily negative! Well written; well told; engrossing!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Beautiful language, great setting and history mark the beginning of this novel, and I enjoyed it till almost the end.

Led by their minister, the villagers subjected themselves to a quarantine to prevent the spread of the dreaded pestilence. Many villagers died. Brooks has written a work of fiction rather than a historical study. The book captures well the death, dread and superstition the plague engendered in 17th Century England. Less successfully, Brooks' novel is also a character study of its three major protagonists.In Brooks' novel, Eyam had a population of about 320, with most of the residents engaged in farming or in lead mining on the hills. The story is told in the first person by Anna Frith, age 18. Married at 15 to Sam, a miner, Anna has two young boys by the age of 18. When Sam dies in a mining accident, Anna takes a border, a tailor named George Viccars, to help with expenses. Viccars soon proposes to Anna but contacts the Plague the following morning. He soon dies as do Anna's two small sons. The contagion spreads to the community.The other two primary characters in the novel are the minister, Michael Mompellion, 28, and his wife Elinor. Anna is a servant to the minister. Elinor takes an interest in her, sees her intellectual curiosity and ability, and teaches Anna to read. When the plague ravages the town in earnest, Mompellion persuades the town to impose a quarantine which is observed by all but the wealthiest family, the Bradfords. Rector Mompellion pledges to attend the dying while Elinor and Anna work assiduously with the living, including offering care to Plague sufferers as well as delivering babies.The book is at its best in showing the death and the brutality resulting from the Plague. Brooks shows a community wracked by both religion and demonology as many townspeople accuse a woman and a young niece, the Gowdies, who live unconventional lives and study herbs and remedies of witchcraft. The novel depicts violent scenes brought in the wake of the Plague. Anna's father is impaled by knife outside a mine after he confesses to stealing while his stepmother, who sells false amulets to ward off the plague, suffers madness after she spends an evening in a deep vat of pig excrement. The scenes of the Plague, which ultimtately takes the life of one-half the residents, are graphically described.Anna, Elinor, and Michael Mompellion behave heroically in tending to the town. Anna and Elinor try to capture the medicinal knowledge of the Gowdies before their deaths to save lives and ease suffering. Mompellion, stern but apparently compassionate, keeps his promise to attend and assuage the dying. As the story develops, Anna becomes close to both Elinor and Michael and gradually gains confidence in her abilities, her medicinal skills, and her talent for midwifery. When Elinor dies late in the novel, Anna tries for a time to bring comfort to the depressed Michael.Brooks brings an avowedly secular understanding to her story. In a strong scene in the book, Anna is made to realize that neither God nor demons -- goodness or sin -- hold the key to the Plague. She concludes that the disease is caused by natural circumstances, and that efforts spent in prayer or demonology would be better used in searching for the cause of the disease. In a lengthy, thoughtful meditation draws what seems to me a still valuable lesson in thinking about the Plague and similar scourges and natural disasters. Anna concludes:\\"For if we could be allowed to see the Plague as a thing in Nature merely, we did not have to trouble about some grand celestial design that had to be completed before the disease would abate. We could simply work upon it as a farmer might toil to rid his field of unwanted tare, knowing that when we found the tools and the method and the resolve, we would free ourselves, no matter if we were a village full of sinners or a host of saints.\\" (p. 215)A degree of anachronism in the telling detracts from Brooks' story. Some readers might be unconvinced by the sophisticated secular approach that Brooks gives to Anna. More broadly, some of Anna's intellectual and physical accomplishments in this story strain credibility. Anna undertakes a difficult, dangerous mining operation of the sort that would have stimied her husband and other skilled miners in the town. She learns a degree of Latin and develops, in Brooks' story, high medicinal sophistication in a matter of months. Her medical skills increase to a dazzling degree as the novel works to its conclusion. In addition, under the influence of the Gowdies, Anna develops a sense of personal and sexual independence that would be bold enough even in early 21st Century America let alone 17th Century rural England. Anna's development, and to a lesser degree the unfolding of Elinor and Michael's characters seem to me ahistorical and geared towards the values of many contemporary people.I had questions, as discussed above, about character development in this novel as well as about the rapid denouement which seems forced in many ways. Yet, \\"Year of Wonders\\" is a gripping novel which offers an account of the Plague and its terrors and of human vulnerability.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks debut novel, \`Year of Wonders' is one of my all-time favourites. The book was published in 2001, and I read it when I was about 15/16. The afternoon I first read this book is imprinted on my memory forever - it was during the summer school holidays; I read it on a swing chair in my backyard and cried and cried and cried for a whole afternoon. But when I finally closed the book I breathed a sigh of relief and knew I had found a \`keeper'. And in the years since I have gone back and re-read the book for the comfort and sadness it brings. Geraldine Brooks has gone on to become a famed literary author - winning a Pulitzer for her novel \`March' and the Australian Literary Fiction Award in 2008 for \`People of the Book'. But for me, \`Year of Wonders' will always be my favourite of hers.\`Year of Wonders' is a fictionalization of a true historic event. It tells the story of an English village in Derbyshire called Eyam. When the black plague swept across England in 1666 this little village did something that is still heralded to this day as a great feat of courage and sacrifice. When a travelling tailor called George Viccars unwittingly bought plague to Eyam via flea-infested cloth, the townspeople and their vicar, Reverend William Mompesson, made the decision to quarantine the village to stop the infection from spreading to the rest of Derbyshire. By the end of the plague Eyam had suffered greatly for the bravery. The plague raged in the village for 14 months and killed at least 260 villagers with only 83 villagers surviving out of a population of 350.The novel is told from the perspective of one Eyam resident, Anna Frith. Anna is the housekeeper at the Eyam rectory, working for the Reverend William Mompesson and his wife. Anna is also a mother and widower, having lost her husband to a mining accident a few years before the plague breaks in 1666.Geraldine Brooks created Anna as a character accidentally at the centre of it all. Anna happens to rent a room to one George Viccars, the man who accidentally brings the plague to Eyam. By working for the Reverend Mompesson, Anna is also privy to the many discussions and strategies concerning Eyam's isolation.Anna may be a fictional player in the grand true story of Eyam, but she is a wonderful narrator. Anna's brilliance lies in her ordinariness; a mother hopelessly trying to protect her family and survive during the end of days. Through Anna and her relatable struggles, Geraldine Brooks asks of her readers; \\"what would you do?\\" and \\"how would you cope?\\" I loved the fact that Anna was just an ordinary woman living in extraordinary times.The entire story of Eyam is at once heart-wrenching and inspiring. Geraldine Brooks started her life as a journalist - she was once a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. This means that Brooks pays attention to detail - she thrives on facts and weaves a fascinating fictional narrative from her historic research. The ins and outs of Eyam's isolation are fascinating to read - everything from Reverend Mompesson's decree that family's bury their own dead, to the system they worked out to buy food supplies from surrounding villages (a little well was filled with vinegar for outside traders to clean coins in and food was left at the town's entrance). But these are just the bare bones facts that Brooks researched. The really magnificent storytelling comes from her imagination - as the town downslides into paranoia and leadership struggles, as whispers of witchcraft threaten the townspeople's sanity and Mompesson struggles to keep a hold on his parish and Anna witnesses it all. . .First and foremost however, \`Year of Wonders' is a bitterly sad tale. The book opens in the aftermath of plague - when we meet Anna she is alone and struggling to cope with all that she has lost. In fact, the entire town of Eyam is devastated in the wake of plague.Then the book back-tracks to tell the story of the town's isolation. . . It's an incredible literary feat that even though Brooks starts out by telling us Anna suffers greatly, every single blow and loss she bears is a blindsiding curveball. You will bawl your eyes out in this book - fair warning. Not to give anything away, but there is light at the end of the tunnel (and even a growing infatuation between Anna and the Reverend)...but it's a long, dark read to get there.Geraldine Brooks is a beautiful writer. Really, her prose is magnificence on the page. . . but when coupled with her unflinching ability to wring emotion and empathy out of her readers she is a literary powerhouse.This book is sad - there's no getting around that. But at its heart, \`Year of Wonders' and the story of Eyam is one of humanity and hope. This is a town that isolated and sacrificed itself for the sake of community. Eyam saved countless lives with their martyrdom, and when you read \`Year of Wonders' and remember that this courageous act actually happened. . . it is heartrendingly incredible. And the true story of Eyam village lives on to this day. A play called \`The Roses of Eyam' by Don Taylor tells the plague story. And Eyam has gained scientific notoriety - research has been done into the DNA of Eyam plague-residents who survived, particularly those like the town's gravediggers who were repeatedly exposed to the bubonic plague but were one of the few town survivors.I will always hold a special place in my heart for \`Year of Wonders' - a little unassuming book that I can't even remember what compelled me to buy it. But I spent one glorious sunny afternoon crying through this book, and discovered a favourite amidst its pages."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What an enjoyable read. I am glad I had my iPhone nearby whenever I read this book, as I found myself doing quick research both on the plague and on some of the 17th century vocabulary I was delighted to find within. This is truly historical fiction at its best, and the protagonist is a true heroine, realistic and full of life even when she least realizes it.While the ending has a few twists and brand new turns, one has to end a book somewhere. I forgive the author for changing it up so much at the end, because the story of the village was so beautifully woven. This is a book ostensibly about the plague, but ultimately about faith, birth, death, love, and the human condition. She's a highly gifted writer."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel about the plague is both harsh and inspiring. The story is told through the life of Anna, a peasant in a small village in the English countryside. The plague comes to their small village far away from the London plague. I do not want to tell too much of the story because the writing is so powerful and unwraps the story beautifully.Through the terrible deaths that come to the village, Anna's heroism in visiting the sick, finding new homes for orphans and caring for her fellow human beings astonishes even Anna. This heroism is set against a village that is falling apart at the seams; neighbors and friends start turning on each other during this horrendous ordeal.I was very disappointed in the end of the book. The characters do things that do not match their own temperament we have read about for 300 pages. It was so abrupt and out of character, it left me dissatisfied with an otherwise great book.

Year Of Wonders, a novel about a small mountain village north of London which is stricken with the plague due to a bolt of infected cloth, is captivating and poignant. More than merely a story of devastation, Year Of Wonders is a glimpse into 1666, enabling readers to emerse themselves into this intriguing novel. Brooks elicts the emotions of all her readers by using beautiful language and having a great deal of knowledge about the seventeenth century.As a person who enjoys reading historical fiction, I was impressed by Geraldine Brooks. She truly is a great storyteller. I recommend that any person who is interested in history pick up this book.

However, I was not surprised to read, after I finished the book, that the author Ms. Brooks was a Washington Post correspondent in the Middle East. The ending almost seemed like a way for Brooks to somehow include her knowledge of Islam in a novel about 17th century England -- it was a bit disenchanting, and subtracted from the believability of the novel. However, the rest of the novel was enthralling - I would still highly recommend the book to other readers."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is based on a true story that occurred in England during the 17th century. When the plague comes to a small village, the villagers, at the urging of their preacher, decide to barricade themselves in to prevent the spread of the disease to other places.Brooks focuses on a likable, intelligent maid, Anna, who provides a link between all of the village's residents. Most of the novel provides a retrospective narrative of the year or so that the village struggled with the plague, while the rest of the novel reveals Anna's situation following the reopening of the village.Brooks's style is elegant and lyrical and the subject is fascinating. It is also interesting to see how Brooks imagines characters' reactions to such a horrifying situation. It is unfortunate that the plot is not as deep as it could have been. Certain plot twists, such as those involving the village's preacher, Mompellion, and Anna's life at the end of the novel, seemed a bit out of place and too extreme.The quality writing and the unique subject matter definitely qualify Year of Wonders as a &quot;good book,&quot; but the sometimes weak plot keeps it out of the &quot;great books&quot; category."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have been to the village of Eyam,UK several times and thought I knew the story.

The book purports to be a story of one town's heroic decision, but only passing mention is made of that happening. Most of the novel focuses on the protagonist's &#34;heroism&#34; (She treats plague victims and learns how to deliver babies.) and her dime-novel, bodice-ripping love affair. If we want to read about the plague, why not pick up Defoe's JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR (he knew how to write) or PEPY'S DIARY. Either is far more entertaining."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Brooks is able to weave beauty into a story of death and despair. You find yourself reminded of those simple joys of living we all take for granted. We are also reminded that our future is in our own hands insomuch as we have the ability to keep fighting and living, or give up. This book explores the consequences of both."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"You are there in the time period (1600s) and feel as if you are dealing with the world of the plague yourself.

I thought what a good way to show how people suffered during the plague. However, the further I read on the more disgusted I became. First, she placed her 20th century philosophy into this century late 16th century. For any historian that is a big mistake it makes you judge people and blind you to the true facts. Her way of sneaking in feminism was disgraceful sense it had nothing to do with the plague. Second, she disgraced the memory of the rector of Eyam. Though has far as I have studied their is little known about his personally life we do know that he helped the town in it's time of need, also that his wife (whose name was Catherine) had two children and died of the plague. The author changed his name but made him out to be some monster in the end. Also, when you read the book you think what a nice man then she hastily turns him into a monster. It just didn't make any sense.The ending was hastily written and historically did not make any sense. It is has if the author couldn't figure out an ending. Also, her fascination with witches was silly. It is obvious that the author did little research into this book. I would highly recommend that people do not use this book for research or for helping themselves to better understand the plague. The author used this book for her own purposes. It is a waste of time and money!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The author pairs up actual historical facts with unbelievable historical fiction to create a Hollywood book if there ever was.

Other reviewers were puzzled as to why the odd ending - and why not? She couldn't let the story end with even one man (the viccar) being remembered as a decent, loving man of faith and integrity - he HAD to be exposed - as ALL men obviously are! as deep-down being an utterly repulsive, flesh mongering animal.The story had so much potential. She did have a good use of language, but come on, this book was lightweight. OK I guess for the beach but if you are looking for an intellectual read, pass this up - definitely not worth wasting on a book club discussion."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The author seems to try too hard to find a story in her research.

In 1666, a small English village quarentines itself to keep the bubonic plague from spreading. I couldn't wait to start it. However, the unsetting discription of a plague boil popping (only like 20 pages into the book) kind of grossed me out. Anna, the protagonist, is a young widow. She becomes enamored not only with the minister but his young wife. I thought her relationships with them would be interesting, but they actually weren't, and I was bored by the descriptions of things that didn't seem to matter.

Most of the book describes the year of the plague and all the villagers that died (I'm not spoiling anything with that information). It felt like \\"Groundhog Day\\" -- the same set of events happened over and over with various villagers dying. I realize that each villager was a different character with different circumstances, but all the deaths just ran together at a certain point. The book just didn't have enough of an interesting storyline to draw me in.

I have been checking the bookshelves religously awaiting a new novel by Geraldine Brooks, but sadly I keep on looking. Please write another novel. Please! P.S.

Everyday we walk this Earth our faith in God is tested by one affliction or another. Some cower and run, some lose faith and slowly disintegrate, and the rest (empowered by faith in God/Science) persevere and deal with it. The plague of 1666 can be easily compared to the AIDS of 1981. People are falling left and right and no one knows why, and even worse, how to stop it!The book is definitely expressive and doesn't shy away from describing horrific accounts relating to plague symptoms, ignorance-driven killings, crazy atonement methods and sheer madness induced by despair. The details, told so vividly, can be a little gory for the squeamish of us.The story has many subtexts that you will find to be very intriguing.

But recetly having read other books by Geraldine Brooks, I decided I did need to read her first histroical fiction book. And for the most part I am glad that I did read this well researched book.Year of Wonders takes place in a small English village where a bolt of fabric is brought which contains the bubonic plague. Anna Frith, an 18 year old widow will lost her two children and watch her neighbors become ill and then die. As a cleaning woman for the the vicar and his wife, Anna learns to read from the vicar's wife and draws close to the two of them. When the two women who used herbs and other cures are accused of being witches it becomes apparent to all that emotions are running high and when will the plague end. The vicar then decides that rather than the village people leave thy stay in the village walling themselves off from others. Now Anna and the vicar's must tend to the ill hoping they will not be felled by the plague.The book moves swiftly and at times is rather graphic. I fell in love with Anna and hiope that someday her life would become better. The ending was disappointing. It was as if the author found a really bright red ribbon and tied up her package. Still, this is a worthwhile read although her subsequent books are much better."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I doubt I would have read this book had it not been a book club selection. A book about the plague....no thanks! Actually, the book was beautifully written (despite a few melodramatic scenes and rushed ending) and offered an interesting look at what village life was like in the 1600s. The book is based on an actual town that became infested with the plague and consequently decided to close its gates so as not to infect neighboring villages. Anna Firth, a young widow, tells the moving, very readable story."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book.

To me, this was not as good as March. I enjoyed reading about the plague, and I thought the writing and the character development in Year of Wonders was, for the most part, good. The main flaw of the book, in my view, is that the author goes for a thriller-like, unexpected twist near the end that doesn't make sense for the characters. It isn't merely a case of disappointing readers who had come to like or expect something from or hope for something for a character; rather, it is a case of a character acting in a way that is not believable for reasons that are not believable. (Trying not to be a spoiler, here.)"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a good read overall. Moreover, all fans of Brooks should read it. However, the subtlety and craftsmanship that is seen in March is not as evident in this novel. Some aspects of characterization are rather rough and sometimes unrealistic. Yes, humans are complex. But an abrupt revelation of one of the main characters' terrible sin is less convincing than the skill Brooks shows in developing March, who is remarkably lifelike."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Intriguing historical basis of the fiction with characters representing human decency, as well as insane behaviors and extreme religious practices when people are faced with a catastrophy. There are amazing and shocking stories, some gory but fantastically crazy. The protagonist raises doubts and questions about religious interpretations of courage, humanity, forgiveness, punishment and sufferings which seem rather complex and even inconsistent at times. Fundamentally challenges---why human convictions, sufferings and triumphs cannot be meaningul enough by themselves without having to be attached to religious cause and effect? In the end, she decides to follow her conviction, onto a path of independence, a true wonder of all."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is a fictional account of Eyam, the plague town of England.

As the plague devours the town, Anna develops a friendship with the rector's wife and together they discover the shortcomings of humanity along with the medicinal cures of herbs.Often literary works such as this become bogged down to the point where the plot gets wrapped around the axle of the author's verboseness. This book however does not. The beauty of the writing adds to the complexity of the characters without hindering this fast-moving plot. The ending for me was prior to the strange left turn the author takes, but overall, this story was a joy to read and the secrets kept from Anna were great plot twists that blew me away.Great read!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Pleased with fast delivery and book was in condition as was stated.

I just HAD to rush and order the other works of fiction by this author. However, the author couldn't leave well enough alone and provide a simple, plausible way in which to end the story.

For one year death lives within this little English village. Many who are alive during this year will be dead before the coming of the next year.The characters in the book are more than lifesize. Anna Frith is too good, too well educated, too intelligent and too happy for her age and place in life. The Mompellions, Michael and Elinor are too saintly. Michael is the young church rector and his wife comes from a wealthy family. The couple is well educated. All three work hard and tirelessly to aid the sick and dying. They never seem to get discouraged with all the death, sickness and unending work in the village or with those who are angry and bitter about the plague. Anna Frith's father is a coarse. evil man. He has mistreated, beaten and put down his daughter, but she carries no anger or bitterness against all the evil he has done her. Her stepmother is almost as bad as her husband but she does love her kids in her own strange way. The couple is alcholics, child abusers, and had kids every year but many did not live. Anna's mother died in childbirth and Anna, herself, married at fifteen to get away from that family.She marries a good man, a miner, a profession many villagers followed if they were not farmers. Sam beats her father up when he heard how badly he has treated his daughter when she was a child. This good man dies in a mine accident and leaves his wife with two beautiful little boys whom she adored; both children die of the plague. The plague is brought in by an itinerant tailor and a bolt of cloth. Michael Mompellion closed off the village and noone is to leave in order to contain this terrible sickness. But is this the right thing to do? Villagers could have run from their village and possibly have saved their lives. But again is this the right thing to do to spread this illness? So many villagers lose their lives. The characters meet every Sunday at church services and atendees become less and less. Finally after a year the plague ends.The main characters, those who are left, change their lifestyles drastically. So things and events are not always what they seem.

You won't be able to put it down. I cried, laughed and held my breath. I wish it could have been longer so I could keep reading it.

We see the true horror of the disease and the changes that occur to the villagers as their isolation and fear infects their minds. There are graphic depictions of death, disease and the conditions found during the historical period. I enjoyed a historical perspective of the Black Plague, but found that by the end of the book, I didn't find the main character was as believable.

The language and writing was exquisite. Though the story of the plague was horrific, the reader was able to endure the sadness just as the heroine of the novel was. At times, the reader certainly would like to cry out from all of the pain in the novel but there is so much hope that it keeps the story moving and surprisingly upbeat.My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit far-fetched. Still, it left me with a great feeling."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Using this horrible era in history as the basis of the book, it takes you into the homes and into the lives of the people in the 1600's who had old myths about witchcraft, awful ways of curing illnesses, and describes their ignorance of medical procedures and cures and lack of them.The main character Anna Frith takes in a lodger, George Vicars, after her husband was killed in a mine accident. He was an itinerant tailor and had a bolt of cloth delivered from London to Anna's home. The cloth had the plague fleas and eggs inside and thus began the epidemic. The tiny, remote village had entire families wiped out from this one incident.The clergyman talked the townspeople into isolating themselves from the rest of the surrounding villages to protect others from the plague...no one was allowed in or out of the village. Anna, the clergyman, and his wife helped with all the deaths and also births that occurred during this year of death and mourning.The characters are described in detail and are quite interesting. It definitely isn't a boring historical account of this epidemic...the weaving of the lives and the history makes you aware of what it was like to live during that period of time in Europe and encourages you to continue reading.Geraldine Brooks definitely did her research.ENJOY...you will love the book."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I could not put this book down.

Brooks creates an engrossing and enthralling world through the eyes of maid Anna Frith as she sees her rural english village ravaged by the plague. While some scenes are rather graphic about what the plague actually does to your body, they were done tastefully and in a way that is not simply meant to disgust, but simply to inform the reader. The plot is excelent, both interesting and well written. My one slight complaint is the ending which seems a bit unbelievable, but with the greatness of the rest of the novel, it is easily compenstated for."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This fascinating historical novel is based on a true story. It takes place in the mid seventeenth century in a small British village that succumbs to the plague. It's told through the eyes of a young widow, Anna Frith, whose two sons die from the plague in as sorrowful a recounting as I would ever wish to read. The author effectively, with rigorous attention to detail, captures what it must have been like. Anna works as a maid for Vicar Michael Mompellion and his gentle, selfless wife, Elinor, who has taught her to read.The rector proclaims the plague to be a scourge sent by God, and the village voluntarily agrees to seal itself off from the rest of the world. The deaths begin to mount, and superstition and mob psychology seek vengeance on those they have decided are witches or guilty of devil worship. There is a horrifying scene, worthy of an Ashcroft creation, when the drunken townfolk decide that a local herbalist is a witch and they put her to trial by ordeal. They throw her into a deep well, bound hand and foot, only to be terrified that that might have murdered her when they watch her sink (in the classic water trial by ordeal, if the accused sank and drowned, he/she was considered innocent, i.e., accepted by God; if one floated, the accused was adjudged guilty, i.e. rejected by God, and then hanged or burned. It was the classic no-win situation for the accused.)Anna suffers from a twentieth-century kind of existential angst, but the reader remains riveted to the story, haunted by the flawed and despairing humans trying to deal with a terrifying and inexplicable disease."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book, but would have loved a more substantial ending. Anna's Frith, the book's main character, was amazing. She was the backbone of a very desperate society. Ms. Brooks language transported me to another time and I felt as if I were really in the village, suffering right along with my neightbors. Her descriptions were stunning, her prose beautiful. It is highly unusual for a book to stir a desire to &quot;learn more&quot; through research, but this book did just that. It was truly a difficult time, compounded by ignorance. &quot;Year of Wonders&quot; is a heartfelt work, right up until the last chapter. Was it the publishers idea to stretch the book out? The ending did not flow with the rest of the book and left me wondering what happened to Anna. Bad ending and all, I would still recommend this book."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders, an imaginative work of historical fiction by Geraldine Brooks, is a captivating journey into a time and place so different from our own. Brooks originally became enthralled when, after visiting the town of Eyam in England, she read a plaque about the 'plague village.' When researching the history and medical aspects of the plague, Brooks came across a note from the wife of the village pastor about her maid's continuing good health. It is through this maid, mentioned only briefly in a letter, that Brooks gives voice and life to this period of time.Anna Frith is a simple widow living with her two sons, working in the town rectory, and learning from the pastor and his wife a great deal about life beyond her little town. She is encouraged by the pastor to take in a boarder, a tailor from London who does fine work. When he sickens and dies, however, the town is loathe to call his illness what it is -- the plague. Soon, entire families become ill, and the village realizes that it must stand forth against the disease. Their pastor, Mr. Mompellion, urges everyone in the village to vow to remain within the confines of the town until the plague can be eradicated, to prevent its spread to the rest of England. All the villagers but one agree, and so they take a Sunday Oath to begin their year of confinement, or year of wonders.Anna is our constant companion through this year. She shows us how the confinement and illness bring out the best in some of the townspeople, particularly Mrs. Mompellion, who are willing to go the extra mile for their beloved neighbors by caring for them when they are ill. The plague, however, also brings out the worst in some townspeople, especially those trying to make a living off of the misery of others. Anna's faith during the year both sustains her and gives her reason to pause. Anna's growth as a person throughout the book is a wonderful look into how tragedy and hardship can forge a character, and bring them into the greater good.The end of this book is certainly unexpected, and perhaps overly dramatic. However, it does bring closure to an outstanding read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is quality historical fiction.

This is a rich and powerful piece of historical fiction, based on the quarantine of a British plague town in the 1600's. Geraldine Brooks' years as a foreign journalist have equipped her with all the qualifications to develop such an amazing central character as Anna, whose generous spirit is palpable through the pages. Every time Anna is forced to endure the worst despair that you could possibly imagine she somehow finds the strenghth to carry on by helping someone else. My only criticism is that the ending stretched credibility a little over the top but see for yourself."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Truman Capote said about _On the Road_, &quot;That's not writing, that's typing.&quot; Oh, how apt is this comment about so many modern novels, but in _Year of Wonders_, every paragraph is worked and polished. It has the cadance of poetry. &quot;When you've got the reader breathing with you, you've got them.&quot; Also Capote and also this book's beautiful prose.I read this book, one chapter a day, to a blind man. What a pleasure to read this aloud! He hung on every word.I see from the book jacket Ms. Brooks has traveled to many disasters. She quite clearly fully understands what it is to witness the end of the world and examines here the quality of life force required to carry on without bitterness. I suspect many nameless women in many desperate places have looked her in the eye to great good effect because her understanding is authentic and powerful. Ms. Brooks, we, the blind man and i, will never forget the voice of your Anna. The image of a village stepping round a walnut sapling will be forever with me."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I won't give a synopsis of the book as that has already been done.

I would still recommend the book and am glad I read it."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks sets \`Year of Wonders' in the \`plague year' of the 1666 (a year which also featured the Great Fire in London). Although the plague recurred frequently in England throughout the 17th century, in this particular plague year a plague-infested village decides to seal themselves off from the rest of the world. Brooks discovered this real \`Plague Village' of Eyam, Derbyshire on a walk around the English countryside and that discovery eventually led to this book.I was prepared to love this book; it's set in the fascinating 17th century and I find the plague and its impact on society, economy, and religion compelling. I can only give the book a modest recommendation because Brooks' story telling is toneless and few of her characters held the reader's interest . Brooks uses one of the plague survivors to tell the story retrospectively, but this narrator is remains emotionally distant.The elements of great story are here. Unimaginable loss and suffering, madness, hysterical searches for the plague's cause (witchcraft? God's disfavor? Nature?), heroism, sacrifice, avarice and the whole human array. At least for this reader, Brooks rarely connects in a way that makes the reader care about these poor people. The contrived and improbable epilogue mars what had otherwise been a strong ending. Others may appreciate Brooks' writing and find this book to be sublime, but this reviewer finds it merely subpar."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This has been my most favored historical fiction read of this year. I came upon the novel while substitute teaching in a history class in high school. While students were testing, I read a chapter from \\"Year of Wonders\\" which would be their next year's read for history class. I was totally captivated by this author's impressive writing. It is a powerfully written story about the hardships, lives and deaths of a Derbyshire village, where almost half the population is succumbed by a contagious bout of Bubonic Plague during the year of 1666. The author tells this compelling story through the main character, 18 year old Anna Frith. Her and her villagers voluntarily seal themselves from the rest of the world to try to stop the spreading of this contagion. There is a variety of lives, not unlike our own and the struggles they endure with both despair and courage. This book was impossible to put down from start to finish. I felt like the author had explained a piece of history she had personally lived. It is a must read for every history teacher and student as well as historical fiction lover like myself."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My goodness, this was a marvelous book! As other reviewers have mentioned, I was hesitant at first to tackle a book about the plague. I was so pleasantly surprised upon beginning it, though, that I finished the book in three sittings. Ms. Brooks is a marvelous writer -- her plot and characters are well put together, and the book reads so smoothly it just flies by. I found myself telling others about Year of Wonders, and thinking about it here and there long after I finished. I find that the mark of a good book is how many times it makes me think back and reflect on it, and Year of Wonders is right up there with Corelli's Mandolin in that regard.I won't recount the plot yet again, as amazon and other reviewers have done that admirably, but I will throw a few more compliments Ms. Brooks' way. She does not shy away from the visceral -- the novel feels solid and real, even if sometimes the subect matter turns to somewhat gruesome things. As always with a good historical novel (also see The Dress Lodger by Sheri Holman and The Conspiracy of Papers by David Liss), the read is educational as well as entertaining. I even learned the origin of the phrase \\"still wet behind the ears,\\" though apparently my coworkers were not as excited as I was about the news when I passed it on. In any case, I recommend Year of Wonders very highly -- it has wonderfully unique characters, an interesting plot, and is a surprisingly easy though dense read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is a well-crafted work of historical fiction that will definitely appeal to lovers of the genre. Set in the village of Eyam, Derbyshire, during the English plague of 1666, the novel explores the consequences of the policy of isolation pursued by the villagers at the instigation of their charismatic pastor. Although there are all the usual gory details of births, deaths and exploding plague sores that one might expect from a novel set in this period, they are not especially gratuitous and don't detract from the wider story, which is well-paced and sympathetically written. The story is told from the perspective of Anna Frith, an engaging heroine whose struggles with temptation and defeat in various forms provide the impetus for her development thoughout the course of the novel.If the novel has a flaw it is perhaps that it occasionally tests the readers credulity. Anna gets involved in everything from medicine to mining (and flirts with feminism and recreational drugs for good measure) and, as a result, can seem an implausibly modern heroine at times. However, by and large the characters and their relationships with each other are well drawn, and the period itself is so interesting that even a less accomplished writer could probably have produced a decent novel. Geraldine Brooks has written a moving and thoughtful account of a devastating period in human history."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Wall Street Journal chick Geraldine Brooks comes back from Bosnia and other front-line trouble spots and takes a short hiking trip in the UK. There she comes upon the historical marker for the 1667 AD &quot;Plague Village&quot; of Eymm (emmmm). The seed is sewn for an engaging and brilliantly researched novel taking us right into the 17th Century English village. The challenges faced by the rapidly diminishing population where skills suddenly vanish as people vanish, endless challenges result in tremendous growth of character for many individuals. Sure, I only read 15 novels this year; but this was hands down the best. [Shame on the airheads at the New York Times for their negative review; in which they questioned Anna's ability to even read, let alone cope with challenges.] The New Yorker and the Washington Times (and Post) reviewers were more positive. Me, I reek praise in buckets! AAAAA+++++"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Let me say at the outset that this is a pretty good book. Its title, however, is somewhat misleading. It is really not about the plague. It is more a coming of age story about a woman confronted with the disintegration of the world as she knew it. The fact that the catastrophe causing the disintegration is the Great Plague is almost incidental. Brooks has certainly done some homework on the subjects of the plague and seventeenth century England; and the results of this homework give context to her story. However, I didn't exactly feel transported to the time and place described. As historical fiction, the book has its failings. Many of the characters, the heroine Anna in particular, are anachronistic in their thinking and manner of expression. Anna is a mere widow of a poor lead miner in a small village. Yet by the end of the book, she has come to question the traditional social order and religion, including the very existence of God. She has also come to reject the age-old folklore basis of caring for the sick and, virtually on her own, developed scientific methods of thinking about the problems of disease prevention and cure. Such a transformation is way too much to expect of a seventeenth century peasant.All that being said, I enjoyed the book even though it wasn't exactly what I expected. I am actually pleased that I picked it up under sort-of false pretenses. It's almost a &quot;chick book&quot;, which would normally disincline me to read it with a ten-foot pole. The story, however, of how Anna and the other members of her village handle the catastrophe is well written, interesting and insightful. Human reaction to disaster is a universal and timeless story, as we, unfortunately, know only too well these days."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks is a skilled journalist and she brings her talent of keen observation and attention to detail to this, her first novel, based on the true story of the English village of Eyam, Derbyshire. In 1666, when plague was running rampant, these people voluntarily chose to quarantine themselves and tend to the sick and dying rather than take to the road and try to run from this awful disease. Ms. Brooks does an outstanding job of getting into the heart and soul of what this experience must have been like and has created some full-blown and very human characters to tell her storyThrough the eyes of Anna Firth, a young widow who is a servant to the minister and his wife, the happenings of that fateful year are recounted in excruciating detail, using the rhythms and language of that long-ago time. As her children and neighbors suffer and die, she is witness to the extremes to which people will go in a time of crisis. I winced at the some of the supposed cures as well as some of the barbaric customs and punishments. I watched her friendship with the minister's wife flourish. I felt the torments of the flawed human beings who struggle with dark inner turmoil. And understood the role of religion in their lives. These are deeply complex characters and unexpected secrets surfaced as I got more and more into the story.I felt I was riding the wave of the book, unable to put it down and feeling I was walking right beside Anna in that small sad village with its shrinking population where fields lay fallow and apples rotted on the trees because everyone was either dying or tending to the sick. And then, just at the tide was turning and I felt the story was coming to a satisfactory conclusion, the author took me on yet another roller coaster ride as the last fifty pages changed directions, unearthing even more secrets and taking a turn that thrust Anna into a whole new adventure.I recommend this book highly even though I understand it is not for everyone. It is indeed upsetting. But it also shows the resiliency of the human spirit and adds perspective to what is going on in the world today."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There is so much wrong with this book that one has to wonder if any able editor at the publisher bothered to read it. First of all, the first person narration by Anna, a peasant and servant, absolutely does not work; I mean she's illiterate for [most] of the book and yet her flowery language and observations are astute and modern. Unconvincing. Second, the author brings in so many characters that one loses track of who is who and eventually many just become names, undeveloped. Third, too much of men bad, women good. Dad is a caricature of the nastiest of fathers, Anna is saintly as is Elinor - ugh. Anna and Elinor can do anything and take care of everybody - one wants to scream. Fourth, the author doesn't really have much of a story to tell - what exactly is the conflict? The book is mostly about people dying either by the plague or some other unpleasant way but one never gets the sense of what the issue is - there is no clear climax or resolution as far as I can see because the ending is so ridiculous and disconnected with the rest of the book.

But, alas, there is very little there, there. The characters are formularized and therefore predictable. The historical background presented is sparse.And no, the fact that it takes place 350 years prior to the book's publication shouldn't matter. There is no excuse for all of the politically correct anacronisms in 'Year of Wonders'. Great historical novels, no matter which century the story takes place,(or how many decades/centuries prior to the lifetime of the author) allow the reader to understand how the characters were formed by that era. I'm talking about anything from 'Wolf Hall' to 'War and Peace' to 'Gone with the Wind'.

It took me a week (I'm a mom so I don't have that much time to read) but for those with more time you could finish this in a few days if you're a power reader. For 6 days I thoroughly enjoyed every single page. It is a rare occurrence to joyfully soak in every word and realize not one of them is superfluous. However the 7th and final day I was terribly disappointed when the storyline dramatically changed in such an uncomfortable and jarring way I was left beyond disappointed, confused and wondering why.Please believe me when I say every character detail and plot line was very well thought out and explored with wonderful precision so that by the time the storyline changed so bizarrely it really was (for me anyway) a complete slap in the face.**Spoiler** - don't read this part if you haven't read the book - if the Rector had an unconventional relationship with Elinor why had we not been given more detail in previous pages? It could have been still been suspenseful and a surprise if Geraldine had thought it through enough. Anna's change from doting servant/friend to jealous & spiteful didn't make sense. It came completely out of left field. Then when Elinor dies all of a sudden her feelings of the friendship/memories she had with Elinor border on the fantastical. If they were such good friends Elinor would have shared the truth about her marriage to the Rector. As for Anna taking off to another country and becoming part of a harem, well that was too far off the map for me to even begin to enjoy it.I had so much hope for this book but the ending spoiled it completely for me.

However, the ending was just totally out of joint with the rest of the book - it was like a soap opera where the improbable was followed by the unbelievable then by the completely ridiculous. This was totally taken over the top with the heroine moving from her Christian faith to a sort of Wicca, proto-feminist empowerment and eventually wind up with a bizarre Muslim twist. I don't want to give away anymore. A good read with some really touching portions and a sense of being in 1666, but some eye rolling and outright head shaking sections of unbelievability."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I work at a bookstore while going to college. My manager was kind enough to place the advanced reader at my feet. From the moment I opened the cover...I was hooked. How can you not be? I fell in love the simple yet elegant writing style of Miss Brooks. I grieved along side Anna when she lost her family, her children, a potential love interest ( that we all secretly wanted to work out ), friends. I don't know how or where to begin describing how much I loved this book. But I do know this IF YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ONE BOOK THIS YEAR PLEASE LET IT BE THIS ONE. You will not be disappointed with the writing style, character development, or the emotional commitment you can't help but have with the characters. Geraldine Brooks weaves an intricate web of humanity at it's worst and at it's best with Anna.One more thing. I hate to compare any author but if you love YEAR OF WONDERS then I suggest you pick up a copy of GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING by Tracy Chevalier or THE BONE HOUSE by Betsy Tobin. I definitely not would pass up the chance to read YEAR OF WONDERS. Hopefully you won't either."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This story follows the tale of an English handmaiden named Anna Firth during the year of the plague, 1666. The plague seed arrives to her secluded village via bolts of cloth sent from London. As the residents begin to fall ill and die, one after the other, those that remain alive make the vow to remain in the village, because to flee would only spread the disease further.This is a historical novel but it's not a dry, boring read. It's based on the true account of an English village that did impose a self-inflicted quarantine, but much has been invented to make for a more readable story.Undeniably, Anna is made into a heroine as she goes to the rescue of her fellow villagers, delivering babies, tending to the sick, helping those that cannot help themselves. But Anna is also made human by a few rare emotional choices she makes. After losing her husband in an accident and losing the prospect of new love with another man, quiet Anna feels a sudden surge of jealousy at the love between the village rector and his wife. That they should have each other and she should be alone is too unfair; so she smashes every single dish she had close at hand. That was in 1666, but by today's standards, I would imagine this to be akin to pushing a car off a cliff just to watch it be destroyed. Her loss of control was a small passage in the book, merely a paragraph, but it brings Anna down from the saintly, iconic picture that she has been painted into throughout the whole story.I've heard people say that they didn't enjoy the ending of this book. They thought the ending was too abrupt or a \`cop out'. Yes, the book wrapped up quickly, but it wasn't \\"...and then she woke up. The End.\\" This book was following Anna and it went where she went. It could have continued on, covering the aftermath of the plague and all that entails, but then the book would have been 10 volumes long.I call this book &quot;Lite Historic Reading&quot;. If you want something more substantial, pick up Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose or Iain Pears' An Instance of the Fingerpost. Both are extremely long, erudite, satisfying works of fiction that one could write their Master's thesis on. The Year of Wonders is a good book to read during a rainy weekend."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I don't get it. This book is consummately researched, richly detailed, and pretty damn enthralling. Yes, the good/evil delineation of characters is a bit unbelievable, and the ending is positively ridiculous, but most of the story is incredibly absorbing and well-crafted.So why isn't this book a bigger hit? When I compare it to Girl With The Pearl Earring, it's amazing. That book is simplistic, trite, and obvious -- this is a far more engaging exploration of human nature. It's better written, especially in terms of conveying the historical period and setting. So why has the more simplistic book been such a smash hit? It makes me despair about most readers' intelligence."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks' A Year of Wonders is a short and interesting read, with major flaws that threaten to remove all hopes of its being enjoyed.The most major flaw is the book's anachronisms, which, instead of seeming innocent or charming, appear to be intentional and included for the purpose of expounding the author's philosophical views, which themselves do not belong to the time period.Sometimes the views that Brooks chooses to proclaim are quizzical as well as anachronistic, because they are already generally accepted by modern society anyway. Witch burnings, flagellation, and withholding sex completely from one's spouse as a punishment for sin are all condemned by Brooks through the mind of her main character, Anna, who is horrified as these events unravel throughout the course of the story. The first question is why Anna should have been so against these things in her situation as a young Christian woman in mid-seventeenth century rural England. The second question is why Brooks presents the readers with these events, except if to provoke horror on the part of the reader.It should be noted, of these three things that Brooks/Anna condemns, the evil withholding of sex is revealed in the climax of the story, and regarded with the most horror. I found it extremely disrespectful to the memories of the victims of witch burnings that the no-sex arrangement was portrayed as a worse crime than the burnings, and that it in any case made for a very lame high point of the story.As a result of these disasters, which take place in a small town in 1666 England where the plague has struck, Anna questions, and eventually loses her faith. This process is utterly unconvincing, partially since she demonstrates little evidence of being a Christian in the first place. Throughout the course of the book, due to plague's ravages on her town, she stumbles upon some rich bits of post-modernist theology, shedding her traditional beliefs without so much as nostalgic look back, in favor of ones that were to first become widely popular about three centuries later. It would seem that the author's assertion is that such post-modernist views are the natural result of experiencing calamity, regardless of social and historical context. This is quite irritating, not to mention painfully and unwittingly ironic (that is, post-modernism appearing to promote itself as the one true or natural philosophy).Aside from Anna's improbable philosophy, there is also the fact of her wonderfulness. Not only is she of course immune to the plague, but she is also uncannily intelligent, free-thinking, hard-working, morally perfect-though-anachronistically prurient, selfless, and rides the horse like a Modern Pentathalonian. She is the ultimate judge of Truth, through whom the author is neatly able to cast her own doubts on the seventeenth-century English version of Christian faith.All told, while Brooks takes pains to set the book accurately in the past, she makes no front that Anna belongs to that time period. This is less the story of a Restoration-era girl in a plague-ravaged town, than that of a time traveler from modern society to that in England 350 years ago.Brooks' style of writing is fairly light and attractive, but is here riddled with arbitrary archaisms. This has the positive effects of bringing the reader into the past, and of being pretty, though of course the narration and dialogue are nothing like the speech of her story's mid-seventeenth century characters would have been. It is reminiscent of Tolkien's half-archaic style in Lord of the Rings, though the old language is a little more haphazardly applied in this novel.The ending is arguably the very worst part. It is at best a whimsical turn from away historical fiction towards fantasy, and at worst the author's having given up at the end.This is a quick, light read (if one ignores the suffering) with interesting writing, but the serious incredibility, and the painful effort to promote the author's philosophical positions are potentially enough to take the fun out of it for many readers. I'm afraid it did for me. Nonetheless, this book may be enjoyable for some looking for a quick read, who would like a taste of historical fiction without experiencing the real, occasionally nerdy thing."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"..I absolutely loved this book-- despite it's odd ending. Geraldine Brooks' description made me smell the rotting apples, feel the cold English wind and fear the &quot;seeds of Plague.&quot;My heart hurt as I read about Anna's trials and tribulations. And I don't think enough pieces of literature really reach into your heart and make you feel what the characters feel.With all of that said... my few criticisms. First of all, as a Christian, I'm always annoyed with secularist thinking-- that which attempts to make everything as simple as &quot;it's just nature.&quot; This book is written by a self-proclaimed secularist, and it is evident-- so if that sort of thing is too much for you to handle, you should probably just stay away from this book-- as enjoyable as it is.My next complaint is that I don't buy the ending. It seems that towards the end of the book, Brooks just got tired of writing so she decided to just wrap things up all of a sudden-- and she tries to pull in some sort of influence from her journalism work (you'll see what I mean when you read the book) and it really is just inconsistent with the feel of the novel. It sort of jolts you and makes you feel a little disoriented. I'm have a B.A. in English, so of course the author could say, &quot;Well... I meant for you to feel disoriented.&quot; I don't think this was preconceived, though. I think it was just she was tired of writing and wanted the book to hurry up and be done. The ending is just too unrealistic.Other than that, I'm still recommending this book to all of my friends who enjoy reading, especially historical fiction. I think I'll forever treasure this item on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I heard an interview with Geraldine Brooks, the author of the book, in which she discussed her motivations and perspectives in writing this book. It sounded interesting, so...Actually, it's fascinating and very well written. It's told from the perspective of Anna Frith, a young servant to the town minister and his wife, who, as we learn in the first chapter, is a recent widow who has also lost her children. The book is written &quot;in media res,&quot; (remember your 11th grade English?) in that it begins in early 1666, in the full grip of the Great Plague, and then goes back to the early part of 1665 and begins at the beginning.Briefly, and not to give too much away, it is about a small village in the lead-mining district of England that is exposed to the Plague by means of a flea-infested bolt of cloth that is brought into the village by a tailor who boards with the narrator, Anna. He is the first to die, followed fairly swiftly by about half the population of the village in one year. The village minister suggests that the village quarantine itself, so as to protect its neighbors from the Plague, and the villagers agree.Thus begins a year of horrors... and wonders. The Plague leaps quixotically from house to house, picking off some residents and sparing others, with no apparent rhyme or reason. Led by the minister and his wife. the village tries to unearth God's will and purpose in besetting them with this affliction, but nothing they come up with seems to work, and the body count keeps climbing. The Plague finally looses its grip after a year and some very unexpected revelations.The book is very well written. You can clearly hear the voice of the young narrator, a 20-year-old widow who has lost everything but her common sense. As she moves from crisis to crisis, you watch her grow from a fairly 2-dimensional character to a fully realized one, until she takes her destiny into her own hands in an action that would be unusual today, let alone 350 years ago.The book uses the vocabulary of the time, which includes many words that are no longer in our vocabulary, and are therefore unknown to us. The book offers no glossary, so you are on your own to figure out their meaning. This has a 2-fold effect: on the one hand, it slows down the reading somewhat, and makes for a certain degree of frustration because you don't really know what these terms mean. On the other, it certainly lends authenticity to the narration, and if you stop and think about it, you can probably figure it out. (The most exciting aspect of the book is that, after many, many years of crossword-puzzling that called for &quot;adit&quot; as the obsolete term for a mine entrance, this is the FIRST time I've ever actually seen the word used - puzzlers rejoice!)Partly because of the use of contemporaneous vocabulary, you get a real sense of what it must have been like to live in a small, poor village in the mid-17th century. Life was difficult at best, and this book brings that every-day-ness to life better than any other I can think of. It exposes the daily life of common people, under extreme duress, certainly, but still quite authentically.What makes it really interesting is that while presented as fiction, the book is based on fact; the village of Eyem quarantined itself, at the suggestion of its minister, during the Great Plague of 1666. The character of the minister in this book, Mr. Mompellion, is based on the real minister.I recommend this book. It's a fairly fast read and will leave you thinking about it at the end. I went back and reread some passages several times, just to make sure I had understood them properly - if you read the book, you will too, and will know which passages I'm referring to. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I very much enjoyed this piece of historical fiction from journalist-turned-novelist, Brooks. In our book group we discussed the fascinating parallels the book draws between Christianity and Witchcraft during the time of Plague and how these spiritual elements effect the various characters in predictable or unpredictable ways.But, oh, the ending! What happened? Anna's harem life seems like a jerky, incongruous segue into a completely different novel! I wondered what Brooks and her editor were thinking by leaving this segment in. It makes the ending seem rushed and inconceivable, and serves only to remind us that this author is well-versed in Islamic and Middle Eastern culture. That's well and good, it just didn't work for me within this piece of writing."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Although the premise of this story is intriguing and the story is written in an engrossing manner, I was very disappointed with it's ending and almost felt betrayed by its totally contrived and ridiculous second half.

To that point, this book delivered on every level. Unfortunately, the denouement was a little to convenient and way too 20th century in its sensibility. I don't want to give away any plot points, but it was almost like Brooks felt compelled to break the spell of the 17th Century with some 20th century &quot;having it all&quot; thinking. I just don't feel that anyone with Anna's background and experience (life-changing though they were) would be where she was (either physically or psychologically) when the book ended.Having said all that, I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes beautiful writing (this may be Brooks' first novel, but she writes like a dream)and the feeling of being transported into another time and place--if you want to feel good about living in the age of antibiotics, read this book.Anna is a great character, and is rendered in a wonderfully intimate manner by Brooks. Other characters shine as well (most notably the luminous Elinor).So, despite my minor, but not completely insignificant, quibble, I hope this book is widely read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Picture this: the city (or town) in which you live in is overcome by a fatal, ugly disease. The leader of your community (in this book's case, the pastor) asks you to quarantine you and your family--while you don't know how the disease is spread. Would you willingly sequester yourself with people who might spread the illness to you?Such is one dilemma that faces the characters in this book. It's not the only dilemma, by far, but the one that compelled me the most.This book is multi-faceted in the layers it explores. It is character- and plot-driven, but also manages to weave in historical aspects and, thus, credibility. And it reads like a novel!I don't like &quot;historical novels&quot; as a rule. They oftentimes take too much liberty with the history and focus on the characters. This one does in a way, too, but with a subtletly that belies the research and the well-written dialogue.

The author allowed me to get a glimpse of what it might have been like not only living in a small town during the plague, but also of what life was like for all of its inhabitants before the plague as well. It provided seemingly realisic insight into the morals, education, religions, and daily experiences that one might have had in the 1600s in England, and I found the entire book fascinating. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars, was that there were a couple of parts in the book wherein it felt like the characters might have more slowly arrived at their conclusions; in other words, it almost seemed like a scene or two was missing from the book in some instances. Nonetheless, the book was great, and I would highly recommend it.I agree with another reviewer that the 300 page book had the feel of an epic, and I am surprised how well the author packed so many personal tales into a mere 300 pages."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After reading this book ten years ago I still think about it several times a year.

Exceptional writing and plot. A+"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As I enjoyed Geraldine Brooks' People of the Book, I decided to try her debut novel - Year of Wonders.Year of Wonders is inspired from the author's visit to the village of Eyam over twenty years ago. Whilst out walking in the English countryside, she came upon a finger post pointing the way to the PLAGUE VILLAGE, and there she found the true story of the Eyam villagers' ordeal, and their extraordinary decision, set out in display in the parish church of Saint Lawrence.It is 1665 when an itinerant tailor brings the plague from London to the small Derbyshire village of Eyam by means of a flea-infested bolt of cloth. The tailor, who is the first to succumb to the plague, boards with Anna Frith, young widow and narrator of the story.Anna works as a maid for the rector, Michael Mompellion and his wife, Elinor, who has taught her to read. As the villagers die, one by one, those who remain face a choice: do they flee Eyam in the hope of escaping the plague, or do they stay? The rector suggests the village quarantine itself, so as to protect its neighbours from the plague. Obeying the rector's command, the villagers voluntarily seal themselves off from the rest of the world.Cocooned from the outside world, the plague deaths mount, and grief and superstition lead to mob violence, accusations of witchcraft and devil worship. Ravaged by the disease, the people of Eyam struggle to retain their humanity in the face of this disaster. Anna Frith is a sympathetic heroine as, with Mompellion and Elinor, she tends the dying and battles to prevent her fellow villagers from descending into drink, violence and superstition. She must also struggle with the intense, inexplicable feelings she develops for both the rector and his wife.With an observant eye, impeccable period detail and poetic prose, the author skillfully portrays this moment in history; this story of ordinary people struggling to cope with extraordinary circumstances.Because I found this story so well written, I was just a little disappointed in the ending, which seemed a bit rushed and contrived. However, despite this small reservation, I would highly recommend Year of Wonders as a spellbinding and unforgettable tale of love, loss, and learning, throughout this tragic historical era."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Incredibly imaginative historical fiction.

I need high quality but accessible writing and strong believeable characters so that I can lose myself in the narrative. I really enjoyed 'Year of Wonders' because I was able to do just that. I also really enjoyed 'Caleb's Crossing' and in both of these books, I have admired the skilful way in which Geraldine Brooks has used language to anchor readers in the 1660s and evoke images of long distant times and places without allowing her archaic word and phrasing choices dominance over access to the story itself. Without researching the history of the plague in England and the first native Americans' enrolment in Harvard in the case of 'Caleb's Crossing', I cannot say whether either book is factually correct. For me that is irrelevant. I wanted to be taken to another time and place and I was."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I would never have picked up this book about the plauge if it hadn't been a book club assignment, but I'm so glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. On the plus side, I loved the writing style -- it has a mild old world flair that lends authenticity. And the pacing is quick and non-stop, yet slow enough to be thought provoking and beautifully descriptive. The reader comes to know and care about the villagers. We worry about some of them. We hate others. The historical aspect was intriguing and made me want to know more. On the down side, the characters are either backward and ignorant or unbelievably modern and liberal. (Guess which ones are the \\"heros\\"?) But I didn't mind, because I'm a modern woman and could more easily empathize with the characters when they were given modern mindsets. If the heroine had been true to a 1666 female, I would have found her unbearably ignorant, subservient, and backward. The modern type-casting was necessary for a modern audience. The religious attitude of the novel also has a modern, liberal slant which annoyed me, -- Christian faith is not shown in its best light. Also, the novel is moderately graphic regarding illness, death, and sex -- but only moderately so, not overly. I only list these negatives because this is a critique. None of these negatives ruin the fun and I still give it four enthusiastic stars. \\"Year of Wonders\\" is a great rainy-day read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I liked this book, and loved the premise, and found fascinating the way the author came to conceive of the book, after stumbling in her travles across the 'Plague Village' I also like Geraldine Brooks' writing, having previously read Foreign Correspondence and Nine Parts of Desire.Brooks has brought to life a time which at once is very dissimilar to our own, yet has disturbing parallels. Anyone who remembers the early days of the AIDS crisis in western countries will remember the misinformation, the 'witch hunt' aspects, the manifestations of ignorance. In my country a little girl was banished from kindergarten by a braying mob, for example. She was forced to retreat with her family to another country (New Zealand) to escape the oprobrium. I couldn't help thinking of this as I read this novel.Brooks has been very skilful in her use of language, and I found it poetic and lyrical...she has managed to give an IMPRESSION of the use of language as it may have been. However, it would not have been wholly like that - for a start it was a remote corner of a remote northern outreach of England. Nevertheless Brooks has managed to make it sound uncontrived (most of the time - there were a few lapses where it started to sound a bit self-conscious). In the same vein, the author's point of view, as it emerges through the central character, is never less than anachronistic - she displays attitudes that are those of a 21st century woman. I don't think that is a problem - I think authors are alloed to use historical fiction genre in order to express contemporary viewpoints.What disappointed me most was the final chapter. I think it lets down the rest of the book. Don't let that stop you reading it, but I you are a fan of the more breathless bodice-ripping romance genre, you won't be disappointed! I feel a far less unconventional future for the main protagonist would have been truer to the character and the times."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;Year of Wonders&quot; is a beautifully imagined, well-researched book about a small village in England in the Year of the Plague, 1666. Told by the intelligent, observant young woman, Anna, this book will grab your interest and make you want to read straight through. Some of Anna's words, phrases, and verb forms are antiquated, although you will be able to grasp the meaning quickly, and take note in passing, of the richness of our English language. The village characters are well-defined, although each character has mysteries of his own, just like the people in our own lives. The theme is bleak and the losses are many, although there is lightness and joy as well. You'll become very familiar with this little medieval English village, and the turn of events at the end will come as a surprise.Kudoes to Gwendolyn Brooks, a gifted writer, on her first novel!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"Though shalt not be afraid of the terror by night,nor for the arrow that flieth by day,nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness,nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.A thousand shall fall at thy side,And ten thousand at thy right hand,But it shall not come near thee...\\"Psalm read by Rector MompellionGeraldine Brooks' \\"Year of Wonders\\" is rich in its details of 17th century English life. One feels embedded within, and enveloped by, the small village human existence during that time, and of a people put through extraordinary circumstances.Brooks tells the story of a village where 2/3 of its inhabitants are wiped out by The Plague within a years' time in the mid 1600's. Anna Firth is the chosen narrator, a woman of great intelligence and emotional strength, who inadvertently looses the disease upon an unsuspecting town. Recently widowed and raising two small boys on her own, she invites a traveling tailor to board in her home. Within a few weeks, he's dead, and The Plague starts to spread.The narrative follows Anna, the rector and his wife, as the town pledges a collective oath to remain quarantined until the disease runs its course. Brooks uses this plot to explore themes of cultural disparity, religion, love, guilt and human nature.I'm always drawn to the contradictions in, and evolution of, religion in historical fiction, and novels based in the British Isles are rife with that theme. The \\"old ways\\" is represented by magic, spells, superstition and brute force, while \`modern' religion, almost always represented by Christianity, is focused on austerity, self-control, unwavering faith, and innumerable rules.In a number of ways, Brooks shines a spotlight on the townspeople's struggles to try and enact some measure of control over their lives, environment and fate. While many fall \`in line' with rector Mompellion's pragmatic and Judeo-Christian ideals, others hold onto the vestiges of older religions where superstition was openly accepted, and where thoughts of inexplicable magic ruled the hearts and minds of these pastoral peoples.In one monologue, Anna considers, \\"Dark and light, dark and light, dark and light. That was how I had been taught to view the world. The Puritans who had ministered to us here had held that all actions and thoughts could be only one of two natures: godly and right, or Satanic and Evil.\\" Anna ponders, then, how one could reconcile the shadow that resides and grows aplenty in the grey area between those dark and light places.The key tension-driven theme in \\"Wonders\\" is the aspect of human nature that grapples with understanding the natural world, and how people can survive under such extreme circumstances. In one scene, Anna reacts to a woman, Lottie, who bought spells and talisman to keep her family safe: \\"Why, I wondered, did we, all of us, both rector in his pulpit and simple Lottie in her croft, seek to put the Plague in unseen hands? Why should this thing be either a test of faith sent by God, or the evil working of a Devil in the world? One of these beliefs we embraced, the other we scored as superstition. But perhaps each was false, equally. Perhaps the Plague was neither of God nor the Devil, but simply a thing in Nature, as the stone which we stub a toe.\\"In another scene, Anna sits next to an ancient gravestone so old that it's creation and creators has been long forgotten. Here, Brooks continues to explore old and new; paganism v. Christianity; and fears tied to realities and faith. \\"I wish I could talk to that long-ago craftsman. I wanted to know how his people had coped with what God had sent them. There were angels carved into the cross, but also strange creatures whose nature I did not know. Mrs. Mompellion (wife of the village rector) had told me once that the cross came from a time when the Christian faith was new to Britain and had to vie with the old ways of the standing stones and the bloody sacrifices...Had he fashioned it out of faith that was hard and certain? Or had it been the gesture of a man seeking to appease a God who seemed to want not the love and awe that the Scriptures asked of us, but an endless surfeit of our suffering. \\"The story is beautifully written, and Brooks is at her best in creating a world that feels very real and alive. I enjoyed the story, and feel that my understanding of that historical era is more fully developed in my mind. Without revealing any details, the conclusions simply didn't touch me. Some of the secondary cross-character tensions never fully formed and I left the story feeling unfulfilled. Some may feel that this is exactly what Brooks was aiming for, but it simply didn't connect with me.This is a good read, and despite my own misgivings, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Beautifully written. I could not put it down. Ms. Brooks skillfully paints a picture of a village that sacrifices itself to contain the plague under the firm but loving leadership of the local minister. As the death toll mounts, the social structures within the village shift, and Ms. Brooks skilfully reveals these changes.Then in the last 40 pages or so, the horse-driven cart veers off the road, into a ravine, and overturns. There is an almost inconceivable shift in one of the main characters and a whole cascade of events occurs in a rushed and unbelievable manner. Reading, I felt so discombobulated!

It was very interesting that the story took place in a small village where most of the inhabitants are miners: many of us today don't think of mining first when we think of England. In addition to the captivating location, I loved the main character of this novel. She was the perfect mix of dreams and wishes and practicality to be believable and realistic. This may just be a personal preference, but I was fascinated by the discussion of medicinal herbs and the different cures each one could provide, both in the context of the plague and more common illnesses. The reason I don't give this novel a 5 is the ending. Many other reviewers have mentioned the inconsistency of the ending with the rest of the novel, and I agree with them. The epilogue, especially, seemed so far off the deep end that I wonder why the author decided to use it to tie the book up. Ah, well: no one's perfect.Final Verdict: You should still read this book, ending and all."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Having a particular penchant for 'plague' books, I came across this read.

The problem with this is that it is quite unrealistic for the time and place of this novel, not to mention the gender and status of the main character especially since this is supposed to be based on historical events. I was able to look past this issue (and a few other others) to enjoy the plot, sub-plots and various characters in this small village, but just couldn't in any capacity excuse the ending that seemed not only rushed but quite thoroughly ridiculous - this time not only for the time and place but even for the character herself."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As a fan of historical fiction, I picked up Year of Wonders because I was intrigued by the premise. What would people's experiences be like in the isolated, fearful environment of a town quarantined for plague. What inner and social turmoil would that tension generate? Unfortunately, I found only superficial, trite answers to these questions in Year of Wonders.For the first third of the book, I was quite interested. Yes, Anna's attitudes and actions were sometimes anachronistic. I prefer historical fiction that doesn't deliberately impose such anachronisms, but it is *fiction* after all.As it became clearer and clearer how thoroughly one-dimensional the characters were, though, I steadily lost interest. The minister's character contains some twists, but they involve trading one caricature for another, not development of nuance in a character. In retrospect, this isn't much of a surprise, given the melodramatic tone of the work overall. But the flatness of the characters made the anachronisms stand out even further. Anna regards Anys as a free spirit who just needs room to express herself. Anna has unexpected and improbable skills. And so on.But the ending is just absurd. Anna recognizes that England is too confining for her capacious, newly-opened mind, and so she decides to go to the Arab world? Of course, the Arabs were great mathematicians and scientists while Europeans were largely engaged in less rational pursuits. So presumably the argument here is that Anna flees to reason from passion. But 17th Century Moroccan society was hardly a gender-egalitarian place. Anna was at least as likely to find a forward-thinking doctor in London as in Marrakesh. So why send her out of Europe? If there's symbolism here, it's either entirely lost on me or quite misguided.I enjoyed Year of Wonders enough to read through to the end. But then I felt terribly unsatisfied and eagerly sought out something more rewarding."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This exceptional fact-based novel of the Bubonic Plague epidemic of 1666 is narrated by 18 year-old widowed mother, Anna Frith, house servant of the local rector, Michael Mompellion. While lodging with Anna and her two young sons, George Viccars, a journeyman tailor, earns a place in her heart (and eventually in her bed) due to the great rapport he has with them. He soon shows symptoms of the Plague, pus filled bacteria-laden boils forming at his lymph nodes in conjunction with a fever, which burst and become necrotic. Viccars, seemingly aware of the cause, insists that his things be burned after his death. Instead, his customers collect their items of clothing, thereby helping to spread the disease (which was determined in 1898 to be transmitted through fleas on infected rats in 90% of cases). Mompellion, in proposing the quarantine during a sermon says, \\"Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for a friend,\\" and suggested that \\"the boundary of this village become our whole world.\\" Of the 300 villagers, all but one family agree to and stay. By the time it has run its course, over a year has gone by and two thirds of the villagers have perished.The cast of characters includes a woman and her aunt who practice homeopathic medicine and are suspected by some villagers of being witches (because of the incantations they employ in conjunction with their herbal remedies), Anna's alcoholic depraved father, an orphan girl trying to retain the rights to her dead family's mine, and a mysterious ghost. The story follows the happenings in the village, secrets being revealed along the way. Geraldine Brooks seems genuinely skilled at keeping to the spirit of the time during which the novel is set, employing the use of dozens of words that have since been abandoned or superceded. Additionally, she convincingly employs the use of religious themes and beliefs, even though her own are secular.

When the town is quaratined, Anna helps out by tending to the sick. It is a beautiful novel, about devotion and love in a time of sorrow, during a turbulent century in England's history. The ending is unexpected, but on second thought is an inevitable one for the family.A highly reccomended book for anyone who is interested in this time period, or for anyone who likes historical fiction in general.

This is not just another tale of the horrors of the plague. It is a tale that instructs us, as it entertains, about what rural village life in the 1660's was like, about the potential for courage inherent in every human being, and about how to live honorably in the face of death. Brooks's main characters are full of the spirit and contradictions that draw us into a good story, yet it's her skill in creating a whole cast of wonderful supporting characters that has won my admiration.I won't argue with those who criticize the ending; while it may not measure up to the rest of the novel, I didn't find it as feeble as some other critics here. To my way of thinking, the abrupt change of locale serves as a contrast that jolts us out of our smug beliefs in the superiority of western culture.

Along with the priest's help, the villagers decide they must close themselves off from the rest of the world, in order to stop the Plague from spreading. The choices people make and the way people act when they no longer they have anywhere to turn is downright shocking, and extremely interesting too. My only problems with this book is that sometimes I felt Anna was too &quot;modern&quot; for her times, like she was telling the story in the modern day.

However, infected bolts of cloth arrive by coach, ordered by the village tailor, George Viccars, a man whose needlework is in great demand. Even when Viccars sickens and dies of a mysterious plague-like ailment, the villagers are loathe to name it Plague. They demand their new clothing, unwilling to pass up the rare opportunity for new clothing in their humble lives. They refuse to credit warnings that their clothing may contain the seeds of contamination. Later, as whole families perish, there is little doubt of the source of infection.The Puritanical church-goers band together in the beginning. The rector, Mr. Mompellion, preaches that they are, indeed, the \\"chosen\\". Only if these poor people bear the wrath of God's curse upon their uncleanness of spirit, via the plague, will His thirst be slaked. A poverty-riddled, God-fearing flock, the congregation agrees to voluntarily quarantine themselves from the surrounding villages. By the time that over half the villagers are dead, the congregation rebels, turning to witchcraft and superstition, anything to ward off this monstrous death.Anna Frith, a young widow, tells the story of these people she has known all her life. After she loses her own young children to the plague, she becomes a nurse/helper wherever possible, working with the minister's wife to decipher herbal remedies and curatives, soon adept at the healing arts herself. Yet the plague will have it's deadly quota. Well-researched and detailed, it is through Anna's voice that we learn of these village folk, who is merciful and kind, and who is vile and ruthless, including her own father.With such thorough research and careful accounting of facts, the novel is sadly lacking in any real passion, although Anna is swept into a misguided romance after all her trials.

The pastor and his wife, Michael and Elinor Mompellion are not much older than Anna, but much more educated and genteel. Elinor befriends Anna and teaches her to read.To supplement her income, Anna takes in a boarder. He is an itinerant tailor come from London. He works for the local tailor during the day, and does more sewing in the evenings. He is the first person in the village to succumb to the plague. Shortly before dying, he commands Anna to \\"burn it all\\", apparently referring to the bolts of cloth and partly finished clothes he is making for the villagers.Anna cannot stop her neighbors from retrieving the cloth that they have paid for. She does burn the dress that the tailor has made for her. One by one, the villagers sicken and die, beginning with the very young and the elderly. There is knowledge of how the plague is spread nor how to treat it. (We now know it is spread by fleas that feast on infected rats, and can be treated by modern antibiotics).One Sunday, Reverend Mompellion delivers a sermon appealing to the villagers to isolate themselves from the surrounding town to keep the plague from beyond the village. While they reluctantly agree to this the local lord and his family hastily quit the village, firing their servants and leaving the town stranded and demoralized.As the weeks turn into months and more people keep dying of the plague, the villagers are grief-stricken, weary and superstitious. They turn on one another, and accusations of witch-craft begin. Of course many of them turn to witch-craft in the hope of saving their own lives.Year of Wonders is based on events in the real-life village of Eyam, commemorated in Derby to this day as the \\"Plague Village\\". Brooks brings her journalistic skills to this tale. She has done extensive research into this sad period in England's history. This is a moving and effective novel.I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A good book, well written with a great storyline. I love reading books set in a time hundreds of years ago and found this book hard to put down. The characters were imaginative and I found the story quite tearful at times while laughing at others. It's got a bit of romance thrown in, witchcraft, religion and a mother's love for her children. I would rate it as a novel more for women, being written from a woman's perspective. An easy read, perhaps between two \\"heavier\\" novels."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a novel worth reading, it's not a 'You've GOT to read this' book but it does give a few hours of pleasure and increases your knowledge on about the 17th Century plague. Brooks is a fine wordsmith and the narrative flows easily, pictures of what you are reading about form easily in the mind and it is a pleasure to take up where you have left off. For all that I thought some of the ideas, eg the celibacy one was rather extreme and the exotic ending far too stretched for the times."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I had a fairly hard time getting through this book...not because it was technically difficult to read, but because of the subject matter. This is definately not for the weak hearted. This story follows Anna as she tries to save her fellow villagers from death by the plague. The story pulled me in, which was a very good thing since some of the details made me squeamish and not a little in awe of her will to live. This is one of those books I am very glad I read, but will probably not read again. It really brings the horrors of the time alive.The book was fanatstically written, at least up until the epilogue. I found the ending to be too jarringly sugary sweet for the overall tone of the story. Although, I must admit, after all Anna had been through, I was very happy she was able to find peace and fulfillment."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"'Year of Wonders' was one of five books chosen for the recent Books Alive campaign, which was run by the Federal Government and designed to promote reading across Australia. It is, as it says, a novel about the plague of the 16th century and the story of one brave village that chose to isolate themselves from the rest of the world rather than risk infecting anyone else.This novel is (I think) all the things a first class novel should be... witty, well researched and beautifully written with an enticing storyline and well developed characters that demand emotional involvement from the reader. 'Year of Wonders' is unusual in a number of ways. The first is that it grabbed my attention from the very first page, which a rare occurrence in my experience. The second is the language used in the book which is meant to reflect the written account of the main character and makes use of old words and phrases.Reading a good novel is like eating ice-cream with sprinkles. Reading -this- novel is like eating ice-cream smothered in whipped cream, hot chocolate fudge, and chocolate flakes. It's -that- tangible and that good."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Set in the Derbyshire countryside in 1666, THE YEAR OF WONDERS details the accounts of a small village ravaged by the Plague. Told exclusively from the first-person account of Anna Firth, a young hardworking widow and mother of two young children, who is employed in the residence of Michael Mompellion, the rector, and his wife, Elinor. After the Plague was incidentally transported to the village inside a bolt of fabric the disease spreads fast and eventually kills one third of the population of the village. The village voluntarily quarantines themselves from any outside contact in a hope to contain the infection. During these desperate months Anna takes it upon herself to help ease the pain of others. In her efforts she forges a strong friendship with Elinor while learning and studying natural remedies and therapies. Helping others aids her in helping ease the pain of her own loss to the Plague.THE YEAR OF WONDERS is not a typical work of historical fiction. According to the book's Afterword this story was inspired by the true story of the villagers of Eyam, Derbyshire and their own historical account of the Plague. While hiking through the English countryside Geraldine Brooks encountered a finger post pointing the way to the 'Plague Village'. Months of painful research concluded in the writing of this book, and a recreation of how a village struggled against a deadly disease while trying to maintain social order. While Brooks took some liberties in the development of the plot, but some aspects are rooted in truth including several true identities and names. The title of the book reflects worldly events and the strong belief that God works in mysterious ways.I only wish that Brooks included more social and historical background to the events that were simply alluded to. This would strengthen the plot and make reading more beneficial. Otherwise, I felt left in the dark when events such as the war with the Dutch were briefly mentioned. A very brief summary was included in the Afterword but it seemed too little too late. Otherwise, Brooks did a good job recreating the events occurring in Eyam during the Plague year of 1666."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While this book is chock-full of fantastic, Jane Austin-esque characters, I found the pacing of the book to be full of energy and enthusiasm. The last chapter and \\"epilogue\\" (pages 261 to 304) were perfectly described by another viewer as being straight out of \\"a bodice-ripper romance\\" completely out of sync with the 90% of the book.The rest of the book (pages 1 to 259), while short, was a very well-crafted, page-turner, powerhouse of pure schlock. Who needs believable characters in fiction? I've got enough \\"real\\". I'm reading fiction for a reason, baby! It's basically literary television... Right up to the end where you stand up, outraged, and yell, \\"Noooooo! Whadya mean?!\\" because the writers ran out of time and had to have someone die to tie up all of their floating plot strings before the end of the show.In the end, however, I was left with a sour taste in my mouth. I felt a little cheated. Still, I have hopes for Ms. Brooks and hope her talent for crafting a nice rhythm to her language carries into future projects!I say, read this pop-literary joy pages 1 to 259, then put it down and make up your own ending.

Never did I think I would even want to pick up a book with such subject matter.But, I picked it up and started to read and could not put it down!Why? Many, many reasons!The prose is beyond reproach, the story all-encompassing, the historical background impeccably researched, the characters compelling and it wrings every emotion possible from your being.How skillful! It is no wonder it was chosen by The New York Times and Washington Post as NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR!A young wife and mother,Anna Frith, caught up in the devasting destruction of the plague in England is the more than competent narrator. The occupants of this small town must either chose to stay and try to survive without spreading the plague, or leave and save themselves perhaps but pass on this horrible monster to other souls in other parts of their country.The Pastor asks them to make a pact that they will stay and in doing so they make the choice to imprison themselves in their town with the plague as their cellmate.You will enjoy this book in many ways, despite it's subject, and will want to tell others about it. I urge you to read it and enjoy the finesse of Geraldine Brooks, whose works I look forward to reading."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Brooks, reporter turned novelist, shows we haven't really come that far when it comes to catastrphe and illness. We still need enemies to blame and our main weapon is ignorance. Taking what she learns during her day job, Brooks cleverly slices through the 17th century's problems with plagues and relates it to our problems with September 11 and every other tragedy that befalls us as a society. Knowledge will set us free might be her main theme."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I listened to the book on audio. The first issue encountered is that the narrator/author's voice does not have the depth and timbre needed for the male characters. Her voice is pleasant enough, is a good fit for the female protagonist, and does justice to the other female characters. The voice does have the feel of one who has been given a drubbing in life. The reader/listener takes quiet a drubbing in what follows.The narrative is essentially an unrelenting sequence of depressing and horrifying events which reveal the worst in humanity. If you're feeling too enthusiastic about the goodness of your neighbors or the nobility of human being, this Year of Wonders will rid you of such sentiments. Keep your Prozac handy.The horrors are leavened by the growth of Anna from uneducated peasant/servant to educated healer and by the saintly Elinor. The trouble with Elinor is that she is too saintly to be believable. The attempt to humanize her by revealing a terrible sin in her past makes her even less believable. Anna, the main character and narrator (the literary style of the story is a first person narrative), also has problems as a believable character. One does come to care about Anna and sympathize with her. Her struggle to survive and find meaning in the suffering of her plague-infected village is compelling.However, she is so conflicted and guilt-ridden that she is rarely able to simply act and feel. Not to say that that in itself is conducive of inauthenticity; rather, it just makes the reader/listener want to slap her at times. I won't go into the problems with the hero, Michael Mompellion, because it would give too much away. Oh well, okay, he too, like his wife Elinor, is too perfect, except --Other critical reviewers complain that Anna is a 21st Century feminist inserted into a 17th Century village. There seemed to me to be several anachronisms in the medical knowledge and holistic practices of the herbalist healers and midwives, however, I don't have the knowledge to confirm my suspicions. I do agree to a degree with the quite critical reviewers regarding Anna's sensibilities as being anachronistic. On the other hand, do the reviewers really know that it is not possible for a 17th Century peasant woman to have \\"a feminist attitude and sensibility\\" toward such issues as abortion and child care?The most unbelievable aspect of Anna's development for me is her almost super-human ability to learn anything at the drop of a hat. She picks up multiple languages and gains the knowledge of a herbalist healer and midwife with little effort. She is able to ride with advanced skill a great galloping race horse of a steed, unsaddled, although she had only ridden a scraggly pony as a girl. Yet, she is a shy, mousy unschooled peasant woman. There are jewels in the rough, and Anna may well be such a one. I needed more than just Elinor's influence to make Anna's transformation believable.

Sensitive and completely engaging. A historical novel that is riveting and relevant today."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"Year of Wonders\\" tells the story of Anna, an 18 year old mother-of-two, who lives to witness a horrible period in England's history: the Plague. In the period of one year, she watches as her friends, neighbors and family succumb to this horrible disease. The novel is as much about the Plague as it is about the struggle of mankind to survive in the face of such overwhelming horror.I'm extremely fascinated by the plague, so I found the subject matter of the book captivating. I also thought the historical research was impeccable. The way Brooks described life in a small village in the 17th century was enchanting. The characterization was good, for the most part, as well. I also really liked the ending.However, I disliked the writing style. It was flowery, poetic, lyrical, but too much so. I found that reading \\"Year of Wonders\\" took a lot of my concentration, and I found myself easily bored by the flowery descriptions. I also had a hard time keeping track of all the villagers. There were so many names mentioned in passing, and when they were brought up again chapters later, it was hard to remember who the person was, and why they were important.Unfortunately, I also didn't like any of the characters very much. I was unable to relate to Anna. She seemed too modern at times, while other times she would cower in fear at the slightest threat. For a \\"strong\\" heroine, her character traits were surprising and unrealistic. Elinor seemed like the incarnation of a saint. She was utterly perfect, and once again, unrealistic. Mr. Mompellion rubbed me the wrong way from the start, and it became increasingly clear to me that I didn't like him at all as the book drew to a close. At least his actions and dark side are explained.If you're looking for a light-hearted novel, this isn't it. I would recommend it only for those who enjoy flowery descriptions and poetic language, and are drawn to the subject of the plague."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought this book after seeing it on a list (Amazon Listmania) recommending great historical fiction novels. I was expecting to learn about what it was like to live in the time of the plague, and how people dealt with contagious diseases while having a limited level of scientific knowledge, etc. But instead it was an unbelievable \\"bodice ripper\\" and I was completely, utterly disappointed."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It is difficult to categorically damn such a well respected book as Geraldine Brooks' Year of Wonders as a completely futile effort in the mealy, airless medium of melodramatic pulp fiction, but that is the image I have in my mind after reading the book, and it is not one of those confused images that will be shaken off by contemplating the work or by a second reading, as there is nothing substantial to think about. It is impossible to think that the author did not have a good deal of knowledge about the Black Death and medieval culture, but it almost appears that her apparent goal to portray the life of a simple peasant during the great plague was a coldly disingenuous ploy to tell a lurid and totally unbelievable tale.Use of facts about that period of history were heavy-handed and appeared to be stuffed into the narrative until every available character and event had been gorged with contradictory and unexplained caricatures of historical events. In one completely isolated mining village there arise flagellants, witch-drownings, saccharine oaths among the dying to not spread the plague and to remain steadfastly in their village, men and women driven mad and to witchcraft, the arrival of science and medicine, maps drawn by a lightly educated preachers wife showing how the plague spread, a stunning appearance of the belief that God was not the author of the plague and that maybe he did not exist, and so on. This may represent an unmagnified picture of the year 1666 were the stage expanded to include most of Europe, but in the confines of a small village, they are laughable. The heroine begins superstitiously leery of medicine and herbs, but, in the course of the year, becomes a master healer and pharmacist. The preacher has time to reason that the plague is carried by the people's belongings which must be burned or boiled, but he still has time to endlessly tend to his flock, prepare fiery and lucid sermons, regain and lose his faith, lose his wife, administer justice by force and by words throughout the town and fall madly in love with the heroine.As if to hide her garish literary showmanship, the author narrates as a simple peasant in a small village and does not reveal herself beyond her characters. This decision proves fatal, though, since Brooks has a great deal more to say than a medieval peasant could ever comprehend and with every lofty contemplation or ridiculous action, the character becomes more and more transparent and silly. The real intention of the book becomes clear at every turn of the page. Brooks is looking at history and the ignorance of the people and, with 20-20 hindsight, she commands her literary time machine to take her back to plague-riddled England and runs wild in the ever-popular daydream of how great one would be if one could exercise his too-common 20th century knowledge in ages past before the awed primitives. She, of course, cannot make this journey alone lest the superhuman aspects of her heroine become too clear so she brings along a strong, handsome, equally wise, philosopher-king of a preacher to help her hide among the serfs. The whole narrative smacks of politically correct feminism (Which has an important and vital place, but not in medieval minds) and totally worthless PC theology. The characters, particularly the female characters are obviously 20th century figures hammered into the story like the old square peg in a round hole. In addition, there are a number of \\"sex scenes\\" which I have nothing against in principle, but these were torn right from the pages of those books with shiny airbrushed covers depicting muscular long-haired heroes and glamorous heroines on a four-post bed draped with pink satin - true verbal garbage.Brooke's heroine, a bright but illiterate, superstitious maid, blends beautifully with the narrative in the early chapters while the story talks of apples tumbling into apple bins and the smells of Autumn and the simplicity of medieval life. It seems as though the Author might have started along a safely navigable course or, perhaps, was wise enough to lure readers in with a genuine setting before subjecting them to the most finely written episode of \\"Days of Our Lives\\" ever penned. What better setting could she have chosen? The plague swoops in and out of her story killing children so that the mothers can eloquently weep and run about howling fury at God. It takes a potential husband away from the widow that loves him the moment after they first admit their mutual love. It clears away wives and husbands so that the chosen characters may follow their passions. It provides a fittingly terrible, awe-inspiring background to allow these stomach-turning scenes to blend into an emotional and colorful stew rather than standing out as repugnant trash reserved for popular bestsellers, romance novels, and daytime television.In trying to look at the Black Death from the perspective of one who lived through it, it is possible to imagine a story far darker and far more compelling than this blunt caricature. I am tempted to judge this book as somewhat allegorical, but it lacks the power and ambiguity in language that might have made it rise above a paperback love story.On the whole, I think this book wildly and inexcusably distorts any view of real life in 'The Plague Years.' A reader who has no knowledge of the historical background of the book will have a tremendously skewed perspective of the condition of the people who lived in those times and a reader with even a modicum of knowledge must either laugh at it or choose to simply note the brief glimpses of reality found in the pages. In my own experience, I found the text to be so shallow that I was able to read it in one sitting without pausing once or re-reading any section and I arose from the experience with no lasting thoughts beyond the idea that maybe I should be a writer if this nonsense gets such a pretty cover and sells so many copies. But, of course, so do Tom Clancy books and romance novels, so I must content myself with warning off any reader with even a stub of intellect from this tepid verbal diarrhea."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\`Year of Wonders' is a complete waste of time.

However, Ms. Brooks does not quite know what to do with her story and characters and takes too easy a road to finish the book.It's like drinking a wine with great potential, but lousy finish."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Journalists have a knack for writing wonderful fiction--especially historical fiction. The gift of words comes easily, the research is adequately completed, and the details are written in a way to transport the reader. This novel took me immedately to 17th century England.Anna Frith, at the ripe old age of eighteen, finds herself a widow with two very young sons. When an affable man knocks on her door one day offering money in exchange for room and board, she thinks God has sent her an end to her destitution. She couldn't have been more wrong, for that man, a traveling tailor, brings Plauge to Anna's tiny Derbyshire village. He is the first to die, followed quickly by Anna's children. The rest of the novel is a haunting description of the tumult that Anna and her neighbors endured during that terrible year, 1665-1666.Anna herself, under the guidance of her boss and confidant Elinor Mompellion, helps ease the suffering as best she can with herbs and ointments. She emerges as something of a heroine, though her sacrifices are largely unrecognized by her peers. Because Anna's life becomes so entwined with the lives of her neighbors, the reader is able to get an all-encompassing look at the horrors of an entire village, not just one person. Anna's neighbors become almost as real and cherished as she herself does as this novel progresses.My favorite aspect of this book is Anna's religious perception of the events of the Plague year. Though a devout Christian (her Master Michael Mompellion is the town rector), Anna slowly accepts the Plague as something of nature, not of God, and places more emphasis on the healing powers of herbals and other concoctions deemed devilish by her more devout acquaintances. At the novels end, Anna finds her niche in the world of medicine, healing, and midwifery.Brooks' attention to detail in this book is astounding. As only a journalist could, she reports everything from the style of dress to the color of the landscape to the varying religious oddities of her neighbors. This book is a rare treasure in the world of historical fiction, and I can't recommend it any more enthusiastically."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was a wonderful novel of the Plague year in a little landlocked village in England. The story is told by an 18 year old widow and mother of two, however her voice seems to be from a woman much older. The author does a wonderful job with the language, transporting the reader to the 1660's. Never once did I question the authenticy and intelligence of the work, which is a hard thing to pull off in historical fiction.Although the main character Anna is the narrator, we get more than just a glimpse into her life, but of the entire life of the village. We see how the Plague destroys not just the physical lives of the ill, but the emotional well being of their family, friends, and neighbors. And of course we see the destruction of the humanity. If you are looking for a perfect ending, then I warn you that it took a twist that I found a bit off. However, I guess that makes this a good ending in the fact that it was not anticipated.I highly recommend this, and look forard to other novels by this author."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I agree with Rebecca, whose review criticized the ending. The novel is immensely satisfying if one stops reading just before the &quot;surprise&quot; ending that unnecessarily -- and unjustifiably, in terms of character development -- complicates the story. The story sends a beautiful, fully human, fully feminist, life-affirming message which comes to a &quot;wonders&quot;-filled resolution in Anna's promising new relationship, if only the story had ended before the startling &quot;confession&quot; which (I think) is unfounded throughout the rest of the book. My advice to a reader (which I wish had been given to me) is to read about Anna's return from her ride on the horse, read what happens next and then stop reading. It'll leave you feeling good about life."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a marvelous job done by the advertisers of this sad, pathetic story: passing a trashy pulp fiction as a historical drama! There are too many factual mistakes to count, anyone with a little time and access to Wikipedia can find those (mining, herbology, history and geography; try for example history of Oran, ran by Spaniards, not Arabs in 17th century) But all mistakes can be forgiven if story holds the higher truth, if the characters true to their environment, to their background. And they are NOT! Heroine is 18year old maid from small village in 1666. Yet her eloquent speeches and feministic views come straight from 21st century. Even gruesome (a la Hollywood) scenes of blood and mud in which the heroine constantly involved did not convince me that this girl could be a 17th century peasant. Author tried to raise some big and important issues (love and self-sacrifice, Nature and God) but they quickly made space for scenes of horrible physical mutilations and pathetically banal love scenes. \\"Adventures of the flesh prevailed over the adventures of the spirit!\\" So, the all righteous, all powerful, impossibly courageous heroine saves and soothes and helps everybody while the awful men try to stop her. There is not a one single good male character in this story! The ending is truly spectacular, the heroine/author decides that England is too oppressive for feminist spreading her wings and upgrades her to more progressive environment...harem!!! (It just happened that nice doctor in Algeria are looking to hire a female doctor/assistant/one more wife )What a WONDERful serendipity!I wouldn't be so outraged by this book if it sells, as it supposed to, in a section of soap/beach/soft/pulp fiction. But it was advertised as a historic novel and mandatory for reading at my son's high school. So sad! Sorry for my mistakes in English. It is not my first language.

Brooks manages it, and I'm impressed.We all have a hard time grasping emotional devastation, so successful stories focus in on one small set of people. Brooks tells the story of a town that made the hard choice to close its borders after the plague arrived, so as to keep from spreading \\"the plague seeds,\\" and she accomplishes it all from the viewpoint of one young woman. Brooks draws believeable characters: people who worry over the daily details of their lives, who have petty resentments of one another, who mourn their children and stumble through their lives.In her tale-telling, the author reminds us that we're all just people. Folks weren't \\"simpler\\" back then, or more innocent, and they laughed no less often than we did. They were just like us, only they had to contend with stricter social rules, fleas, and the necessity to do difficult jobs well. Brooks made me wonder how I would have coped with as awful a situation as did the people in her novel -- and quite a few coped poorly -- which helped to bring the town alive.It's a serious novel, but not as \\"heavy\\" or depressing as you might imagine, and it was a quick read.If you enjoyed this book too, and you discover you're interested in learning more about the Plague years (at least from a fiction perspective), you might also like Connie Willis' The Domesday Book. It's very different, of course (it involves time travel, and a \\"modern\\" person's observation of the era), but it, too, gives you a sense of \\"we're all just people\\" that I think is important."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book did more than explain the situation of living in a small town devastated by the plague was like-- it put the reader into the situation and made you truly understand the time period and circumstances involved.

Overall, this was the best book I read this summer."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"For its historical detail and the aggregation of fear and suspense, \\"Year of Wonders\\" is surely a book of wonders. \\"Based on a true story\\" (although very loosely), the novel relates the events of 1665-1666, when the villagers of Eyam, in Derbyshire, agree to isolate themselves from the outside world after several residents come down with the plague.The tale begins at the end; the reader finds out right away that nearly two-thirds of the town will die, including all the loved ones related to parish rector Michael Mompellion and his servant Anna Frith (who serves as narrator). The book, a true page-turner, is at its best when depicting the town's claustrophobic fear and the ease with which its inhabitants become self-centered and turn on each other (including an unexpectedly gruesome end for Anna's alcoholic father and a harrowing scene in which one of the neighbors is accused of witchcraft).Brooks clearly means to offer us the town of Eyam as a microcosm of late Renaissance England, as well as \\"a distant mirror\\" of our own society. It's the latter aspect that can be, at times, jarring. Both Anna and Michael are 20th-century personalities trapped in 17th-century bodies. Anna, conveniently, has learned to read and write and her outlook on life is anachronistically progressive; she and the minister's wife even serve as the town's unofficial medical scientists. And, in spite of a chauvinistic about-face in the last scene, the rector preaches a very modern gospel indeed. There is very little \\"fire and brimstone\\" and far more along the lines of this sentiment conveyed to an adulterer: \\"Who made our lusts, our low ways and our high? Did not God? Is not He the author of it all? The appetites we have all come from Him; they have been with us since Eden. If we slip and fall, He understands our weakness.\\"Brooks' depiction of Eyam is of a village with a far more diverse sample of English society than any small rural town actually would have had, and the thoughts and deeds of its heroes are beyond the reach of its post-medieval pastoral setting. Instead of historical fiction, \\"Year of Wonders\\" is best described as a modern-day parable with historical elements: a soap-opera thriller with a message for our own times rather than a true-to-life novel in the tradition of \\"The Name of the Rose.\\""},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I couldn't put this book down, so intent was I on discovering the ultimate plight of the heroine and her village. However, as I neared the end of the book, what began as a believable work of historical fiction abruptly transformed itself into a ...fantasy/romance novel. The characters, whom I felt were relatively well-developed up until the last few chapters, suddenly behaved in ways incongruous with their previous selves. As a reader, I felt a bit betrayed. I found myself saying \\"on, come on\\", you don't expect me to believe THAT\\". What started out for me as a great book wound up being only mediocre."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I will restrain myself from writing in bold letters: \\"I loved it!!\\" all the way across the top of the page. I will even restrain myself from saying this was my favorite book of the year, because it is only January and there are many books to read. Simply put, I loved this book.I will not argue the finer points of history. I want a novel that entertains, educates and encourages me to delve into the subject matter with furthur intensity. This novel did just that. I am newly interested in the plague and in the herbs and medicines gathered long ago and today to soothe the miseries of mankind. I appreciate being enticed to research these topics more thoroughly. I also relish a unique plot, and I found the story line powerful and the ending pleasantly unexpected. I found the story told through a young widow and housemaid, Anna, to be a colorful character that gracefully narrates the stories of the villagers plagued with a deadly disease but with the courage to quarantine themselves from the outside world.For those of you reviewers that had issues with the historical factual presentation, I say buy a medical manual and miner's history books. I daresay you won't find a finer fictional novel about the plague than Geraldine Brooks' _Year of Wonders_."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders is a book I would never have picked up if left to my own devices. I tend to steer clear of too true-to-life accounts of death and despair. Having recently joined a new readers group, and this being the first official selection, I felt duty bound to read it from cover to cover. And I'm glad I did. Sort of.The story is all about the Black Plague and its effect on the inhabitants of a small town that decides to close itself off in order to avoid spreading the disease. The story concentrates on a young woman who endures more loss and grief than it seems one person should ever be forced to bear. But bear it she does. As the plague spreads, it brings with it fear and superstition, and brings out the worst in her neighbors. Startling secrets come to light as many of the inhabitants of the small town succumb to the plague.The book is extremely believable, the characters act realistically and the book moves along at a brisk pace up until its last quarter. As the book progresses the secrets and plot twists become increasingly over-the-top and it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief and my interest began to wane.I did find most of the book utterly fascinating but can't say that it was a pleasant reading experience. The plague and all of its ugliness are described in living detail and I read with a continuing sense of dread. Still, this story is one of the few that really made me sit back and appreciate my life."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"YEAR OF WONDERS, a historical novel, is based on a year in the life of the villagers of Eyam in Derbyshire, England in 1665. When the plague breaks out the summer of that year in the novel, the villagers seek to prevent the spread of the disease by making an oath to isolate themselves from outlying towns, agreeing to remain in the town and allowing no one to come into Plague Village, as their town becomes known. The rector of the local church, Michael Mompellion, leads them to make this difficult decision, and as more and more people become ill and die, the villagers often respond in volatile ways. A mob hangs a young woman who is thought to practice witchcraft, some \\"slake their dread in drink and their loneliness in wanton caresses,\\" and others steal from those near death. Anna Frith, a young widow with two small sons, tells the story, which includes her pain over the loss of her own sons and her agony as she tries to learn how the plague is spread and the best way to treat it. Although Anna is an uneducated housemaid, she is taught to read by Elinor Mompellion, the rector's wife, and her relationship with the Mompellions evolves from servant to friend as they work together to fight the disease and keep the emotions of the villagers from escalating into violence. In addition to coping with physical exhaustion, they must also face their own fears and losses.Between assignments as a Middle East correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, Geraldine Brooks discovered the town of Eyam and learned the history of the villagers' ordeal. She was touched by their decision to let the boundaries of their village become their whole world, and YEAR OF WONDERS grew from her research of actual events during 1665-1666. Although this is her first novel, Ms. Brooks is the author of two acclaimed works of nonfiction, NINE PARTS OF DESIRE: THE HIDDEN WORLD OF ISLAMIC WOMEN and FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE: A PENPAL'S JOURNEY FROM DOWN UNDER TO ALL OVER.YEAR OF WONDERS is a fascinating story of desperate people who lose control of their lives as they see those around them die and face the fear of their own illness and death. Anna, the strongest character, is complex. She lacks formal education but is intelligent, eager to learn, and loves language. Her actions reflect her strength, but like the other villagers, she is fearful of the plague as well as her own sanity. She says, \\"I fear the line between myself and madness is as fine these days as a cobweb, and I have seen what it means when a soul crosses over into that dim and wretched place.\\" Anna develops an intense relationship with both Michael and Elinor Mompellion, and she has a tortuous bond with her drunkard father, whose depraved behavior includes burying a man alive. She is fascinated by the village healers and comes to their defense when they are attacked by the mob. The Mompellions have an unusual relationship with one another as well as with Anna. The author's writing is descriptive, and it is easy to visualize the people, the place where they live, and the events in this tumultuous year. Her description of the emotions of the villagers is especially strong, and it is evident that her research was extensive.The ending is not one most readers would choose and is somewhat disappointing. The path Anna's life takes certainly can't be called predictable! In spite of this minor flaw, the author has written a story that keeps the reader involved until the very end, and her epilogue makes one hope Geraldine Brooks will reveal more of Anna's story.Geraldine Brooks weaves a fascinating story of this YEAR OF WONDERS, and her well-researched, well-written account of this time in history is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"and historically accurate.Brillantly written with the help of the muses.

She tells the story of what happened on the inside after the villagers voluntarily seal themselves off from the rest of the world.

The final scenes--I won't ruin them for you--tested my credulity even further.Nonetheless, I think Brooks has a future as a writer, and has better things ahead of her.

The story revolves around Anna Frith, a housemaid who loses her two young children to the plague and emerges as a heroine during this terrible time. Anna assists the town rector and his wife, Michael and Elinor Mompellion, and together they tend to the sick and dying while also trying to keep the peace in their crippled village. As numerous people succumb to the terrible illness or face other challenges, Anna manages to find the strength within herself to carry on.I was blown away by this book. The story is based on the real town of Eyam, which experienced a massive plague outbreak in the 1600s. Amazingly, \\"Year of Wonders\\" is the author's very first novel, and it's filled with memorable characters, challenging moral dilemmas, and incredible stories of loss, love, and determination.The final 40 pages of the book were rather disappointing, as I was horrified to see what eventually became of Michael's character, and I though Anna's story came to a very rushed and somewhat unfathomable conclusion. However, those shortcomings weren't enough to spoil this novel for me. \\"Year of Wonders\\" is one of the best, most engaging books I've read in a long time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While hiking in rural England in the summer of 1990, Geraldine Brooks stumbled upon a small village that has come to be commemorated as the Plague Village because of what happened there in 1665-1666. She was so deeply touched by what she learned of the events in Eyam during those plague years that a decade later they served as the basis for her first novel, Year of Wonders. Her novel begins with the few known facts about Eyam's plague year and puts a human face on the village whose people made the decision to quarantine themselves for however long it took to protect neighboring villages from spread of the disease that threatened Eyam's very existence.Central to the story is young Anna Frith, an 18-year old mother of two young sons who has been widowed by the mining accident that took her husband's life. Unable to work the mining claim that had provided a decent living for her family before her husband's sudden death, Anna is reduced to working as a servant at the village rectory and to taking in a border sent her way by Michael Mompellion, the rector. Unfortunately for everyone in Eyam, the new cloth that was brought into the village by this traveling London tailor was infected with the \\"seeds\\" of the plague that was soon to devastate the village.Eyam, a village of less than 400 citizens, had only one church and Michael Mompellion, its rector, was depended upon for his moral guidance and leadership. So when he asked his congregation to close the village off, with no one allowed in or out until the plague had run its course, they reluctantly agreed that it was the right thing to do. Little did anyone expect that two-thirds of those sitting in the church that day would not be alive one year later.Year of Wonders is a fascinating look at what happens to this group of people who have made the decision to cut themselves off from the rest of the world to await their fate. As more and more people die the painful death that comes with bubonic plague, some find a strength that they never knew they had and others become filled with doubt and all of the worst aspects of human nature. Some turn to self-flagellation in an attempt to appease what they see as a suddenly wrathful God, some to witch hunts within the village population, and one or two even to devil worship. Soon it is up to Anna, and Michael and Elinor Mompellion to provide the care and comfort that makes it possible for the village to live up to the pledge that it made to protects its neighbors.Geraldine Brooks fills the Plague Village with very real human beings who, in barely twelve months, display all the best and all the worst that human beings have in their nature. The people she describes in Year of Wonders are no different than the people you might run into the next time that you find yourself in the middle of some natural disaster that temporarily cuts your area off from the rest of the country. Sadly, some things never change."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In a Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks portrays a small town in England during the year 1666 - The Plague Year.

To look upon such a year of loss and devistation with anything but sorrow would be difficult. But Anna goes even further to find it a year of discovery, learning and growth.

This fictional account of events in the tiny English village of Eyam in the year 1666 left me with an insatiable desire to learn more about the Plague in Europe.A young servant woman, Anna Firth, narrates the story. Anna is a full-bodied character with a strong narrative voice. However, her somewhat feminist viewpoints are hard to accept in a 17th woman. In fact, there are a few women in the book with feminist leanings, and they seemed false and contrived to this reader. This shortcoming did not spoil my reading, however.Brooks created a complete world in &quot;Wonders.&quot; The town and its people are well drawn. Brooks rendered detailed scenes of horrible suffering as the Plague attacks family after family.Through Anna's eyes, we watch the village fall prey to superstitions, witch hunting, and illicit love. At times, I felt that Brooks attempted to incorporate too many Plague-related catastrophes into the story. She clearly did her research, but it seemed to me that she wanted to include everything she learned in this book, even if it meant straining the storyline a bit far.I highly recommend this excellent piece of historical fiction. Mothers may find certain scenes emotionally challenging, so keep your Kleenex close at hand!

It is a beautiful and inspirational book, that discusses with great depth how a tragedy can reveal the worst and the best in each individual, and how it can also transform people. Many passages appeal to motherly instincts, which touched me deep, and in general the book is full of subtleties more easily understood with a feminine approach.

Plague is not my thing. But the personal story of the narrator, and the tone in which it was read, made all of it bearable and at times quite beautiful, this description of a year with plague in an English village.I got a good sense of the history and times without any forced date-listing, etc. There were some change-ups in character towards the end which mark the new novelist (isn't this her first novel), but the writing in this book so far transcends almost all best-sellers that that's a minor issue.It took me a day to realize why I liked this book so much - it's a woman's perspective, many women's perspectives. Again, not forced, but simply stated from within a character whose life (lives) are believable. To see every day life from half the population - completely unrepresented in history books and \\"great\\" fiction - was an eye-opener.A simple recounting of the cook who spent her life working at a manse, only to be thrown out when plague came, was an excellent reminder of how a lifetime of labor can be so instantly dismissed and has been for ages (thank you, Social Security and the even-better European retirement and medical plans). The clothing, the food, the housing - the simple details of everyday life - tied this together with a compassionate main figure whose growth you see during the book.The ending sped things up, and added a tinge of romance novel to this, but in a way I found an agreeable extension of the narrative. a few more seeds could have been planted to make the ending smoother - references to the beauty or lovers of the mansion's mistress, maybe a nod to other medical traditions or travels abroad - but I enjoyed the whole thing."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks always does great historical research, and for that I am grateful.

It's not the only dilemma, by far, but the one that compelled me the most.This book is multi-faceted in the layers it explores. It is character- and plot-driven, but also manages to weave in historical aspects and, thus, credibility. And it reads like a novel!I don't like &quot;historical novels&quot; as a rule. They oftentimes take too much liberty with the history and focus on the characters. This one does in a way, too, but with a subtletly that belies the research and the well-written dialogue.

This book, based very loosely on real events in the 17th century, is a poorly veiled attempt at trumpeting the author's viewpoints and opinions. The ending is nothing more than the author showing off her knowledge of Islamic customs.This book includes a heroine who is saintly, intellectually brilliant (she learns to read in a couple of months, learns Latin too, and becomes well versed in herbalism - I kept waiting for her to invent the airplane and penicillin) and remarkably resilient in the face of a village-wide plague. She nurses tirelessly, she overcomes personal tragedy, she has insight into the motivations and actions of people that Sigmund Freud would envy, she can mine lead and she can ride a highly spirited horse at a gallop sans saddle. All in all - absolutely unbelievable, particularly for the time period and the social status of the main character.Add to that a feminist witch, abortion, women who don men's clothing and successfully mine lead in an afternoon though they have never done such work in their lives before, children's rights, alternative medicine, and wicked men who restrict and make miserable their wives and all other women within their sphere, this book is a nauseating airing of modern politically correct thought, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the mindset of the historical era it supposedly portrays. The smear campaign done on the character of the village minister (based on a real person) alone is such an act of libel that I'm surprised the real man's descendents haven't tried to sue Ms. Brooks. She has taken a selfless act on the part of a real person and his wife (who lost her life as a result of their determination to stay in the Plague Village rather than fleeing at the first sign of the plague) and turned it into a perverse attempt on the part of an evil man to punish his wife for having had a premarital affair and abortion.The descriptions of horseback riding are absurd, and Ms. Brooks could have gotten more accurate information by speaking for fifteen minutes to any child in a pony club. Her grasp on herbalism is equally ridiculous - a few hours with any of hundreds of well-researched books on the subject would have helped her avoid a number of ridiculous gaffes.And the ending, where the main character travels, on her own, with a newborn baby in tow, via ship, unmolested, to North Africa where she then enters into a platonic marriage with a great Muslim physician (who just happens to be conveniently right there) and becomes his assistant, helping Muslim women and living in his harem - well, it's the stuff of cruddy bodice rippers, and so strains the already insulted intelligence of the reader that high blood pressure is the result. How Ms Brooks thinks that anyone with any knowledge or capacity for critical thought would swallow this absurdity is beyond me. She seems to forget that her protagonist lives in a time where a woman would not have been permitted to travel alone or given passage on a ship by any captain at any price, and would most likely have been killed or sold into slavery had she actually managed to find her way to North Africa and walk around the streets in her English clothing.This book is an insult to the real people of the Plague Village and their descendents. It is chock full of repulsive images that are obviously added simply for shock value, and go far beyond any realistic portrayal of plague symptoms or historical fact.It's fit only for outhouse fodder, and I don't mean as something to read. Save your money - skip it. If I could give it a negative rating, I would."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this beautiful little book several years ago, but remain impressed by the vivid and moving depiction of a remote English village, isolated and a world unto itself, which is obliterated by the inexplicable and inexeroble march of the plague which one-by-one decimated the population. The writing was melodic and fluid, and I was greatly moved by the picture drawn of the bucolic, pastoral life the people lived until Death arrived seemingly out of nowhere and transformed everything. It is this portion of the novel I rate four stars. HOWEVER - I simply have to add my agreement with those readers who were shocked and rocked by the absolutely out-of-left-field, astonishing, impossible and totally unbelieveable ending. Did the author hit her deadline? Begin binge drinking? I felt as if the jack-in-the-box clown suddenly popped up and began sticking out its tongue. The ending is unforgiveable. I didn't know whether to burst out laughing or throw the book across the room. It was that upsetting. To be captivated by the beautiful flow and feel of that age and place, then be unceremoniously dumped into an entirely unrelated situation seemed incredible and unkind. I have no idea what caused this insane disruption of the book's poetic mood, but this is easily the most absurd and pathetic attempt to \\"finish\\" the story of any work I can recall. Read the book, but be prepared for the final crash."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just finished this book and felt the only way to deal with my disappointment at its ending was to share my thoughts in a review. I hesitated to add one at first since there are so many and many of them express the same shock and dismay over the ending but have decided to go ahead anyway.I was extremely disappointed that Ms. Brooks found it necessary to add in formulaic elements like the romance/love triangle along with the absurd fate that Anna Frith ultimately experiences. To me, it took so much away from the provocative questions underlying the story about the nature of faith, loss, and what humankind is capable of - both for good and for bad. The basic plot is one fraught with so many tensions, conflicts, and moral questions that it has the potential to be so much more than Ms. Brooks ultimately made of it. I felt this even before reaching the end of the book where everything really goes awry but it was much more apparent when these events were added in.In addition to my issues with the end, I was also somewhat dissatisfied with the elements of feminism that I felt were too blatantly presented throughout the narrative. I think the exploration of a woman's role in this period, the options (or lack of them) that were available, and the dangers of independence/knowledge/strength are all essential to Anna's story, however, I felt that Ms. Brooks had not immersed herself enough into Anna's character and perspective on these points to be able to examine these issues in a way that was realistic in light of the time and place in which she was living. I felt that there was too much of our modern point of view blatantly evident in these sections.All of that being said, I did enjoy most of the book. Ms. Brooks, as one of the professional reviewers notes, provided a level of detail about the period that added greatly to the feeling of authenticity and helped to recreate this foreign world for me. It was generally a compelling story that gave rise to many questions about human nature and the role of faith in our lives - especially through crisis. I felt very invested in Anna's story by the end and perhaps that is why my disappointment, along with that of others, was so great."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Everyone I ran into while reading this book had the same comment: \\"A novel about the plague? How depressing!\\" To which I had to assure them, \\"No, really! It's very inspiring and touching!\\"The book is basically about how extraordinary situations bring out the best - and worst - in people. It's less about what the plague does to the victims than what it does to the survivors, who now must take up the burdens of the fallen 2/3 of their small village. No one in Eyams was left unaffected by what occurred in 1666. Parents lost children, husbands lost wives, servants lost their jobs and their homes.Anna Frith, the narrator of the story, is uniquely poised among the village's occupants. For one thing, the tailor whose shipment of cloth ends up being the plague carrier was her boarder, making her house ground zero. She comes from a lower class family, yet works as a housekeeper and servant in the homes of the pastor, Michael Mompellion, and the richest family in the town, the Bradfords. As such, she offers us a cross section view of the plague year that is gratifyingly comprehensive - she knows everyone, from the mineworkers' children to the wife of the pastor, and can comment on all their plights.The ending comes a little bit out of left field, and doesn't quite ring true. There are a few stories and characters I wished Brooks had spent more time with - at times the book felt a little rushed. The central characters of the novel - Anna, Pastor Mompellion, and his wife, Elinor - form a triad of flawed heroes. The confession of the dark secrets of both Michael and Elinor to Anna works well in one case, and not so much in the other. The pastor had it in him to be a truly great tragic figure - it is he who orders the quarantine of the town, condemning most of the townspeople themselves but probably saving countless other lives. It's this conflict, rather than the anticlimactic marital secret Brooks reveals in the final chapters, that makes for the most interesting portrayal of Mompellion, and it's this I wish she had explored further. Elinor comes and goes - at times a complex and fascinating character, at others just a smiling, meek wife and helpmeet. Oh, well. You'll find yourself loving (almost) all these characters, despite their flaws, and truly mourning those who don't make it. I would highly recommend this novel of \\"annus mirabilis\\"."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks certainly couldn't have anticipated that her book about the plague coming to a small town during the middle-ages would have such relevance today.Her well-crafted tale of a small village's decision to quarantine itself and the resultant behavior of it's inhabitants as they face the implications of their decision kept me turning the pages. Admittedly, the book starts at a brisk pace and falls of somewhat towards the end. But the conclusion is satisfactory and the characters and their behavior under such enormous stress is believable.If I had doubted the latter, I would have been convinced when SARS hit Asia last year. I lived in Shanghai then, which was not a hot bed for the pandemic, but you would never have known it from the behavior of the community I lived in. I recommended this book to many of my friends at that time as they wrestled with the problems of whether to flee the region or stay put, whether to go out in public places or stay home and with whom to associate....all issues Brook's addresses in &quot;Year of Wonders&quot;. While Shanghai didn't turn as violent or deadly as events in &quot;Year of Wonders&quot; the emotions Brooks evoked were spot on.This one came close to 5 stars and I've read my copy twice. It's a quick, evocative read with surprising modern relevance."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is an elegantly written novel based on a beautiful and remarkable true story. The characters are captivating and the narrative is intellectually rich.I just wish that the ending were not so badly botched. The book has so much to say that is brilliantly conveyed. It was sad to see the novel falling apart as it approached the final pages. Reading the far-fetched &quot;Epilogue&quot; almost ruined everything: my last impression is that the author a.) didn't know how to stop, and b.) wanted to make some additional socio-political point that was simply not supported by either the history or the fictional story-line."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book takes a fascinating and imaginative look at human survival in the village of Eyam during the plague year of 1665 where the odds for death are 2 in 3. Despite taking on as morbid a subject as this fateful epidemic, the novel manages to keep up our interest in our heroine's fate. We follow her proactive adventures and attempts at midwifery, herbal medicine, and even mining as she and the rector's wife stay actively involved, aspiring to humanitarily aid the sick, orphaned, and dying through this ordeal. The language Brooks uses lends realism to the setting, especially her utilization of Old English words no longer part of our modern day vocabulary. It is clear that this author did a good bit of historical research.One unrealistic element present is a \\"time machine\\" sort of phenomenon. Our heroine's attitudes, thinking, and comprehension are a reflection of our own times. We find her to be surprisingly modern rather than medieval in character. For example: Anna unquestioningly and promptly attributes abberent behavior to mental derangement, although the woman in black along with her incantations, chants, and charms would most likely be labelled a witch in those times which preceded the development of psychology and psychiatry.Some very colorful characters are created such as the greedy gravedigger and the flagellante ascetic which add flavor to this novel. In fact, this book reads very well and quickly until we come to its weakest link, the incongrous ending, so far fetched as to be implausible. In many ways the conclusion seems borrowed both in subject matter, setting, and style from a chapter in some romance novels. After reading such a great, fast moving, and very well written story, our anticipation results in disappointment. The ending is so troubling as to motivate this reader with a desire to rewrite it."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"No epidemic has equaled the devastation of the Bubonic Plague, which decimated between one-third and three-quarters of Europe's population in the Middle Ages and continued to flare up in destructive pockets for centuries after. In Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks eerily captures every aspect of life during the plague -- the gruesomely painful death, the speed with which the disease spread and the superstitions surrounding it, which rivaled the plague itself for horror.Brooks takes as her inspiration the town of Eyam, a real-life village in England's Derbyshire countryside. The skeleton of her novel comes from history, from a mysterious and unpredicted outbreak of the plague in Eyam. For reasons we will never know for sure, but which played fiercely on the writer's imagination, the people of Eyam took a vow not to run from their village in the hope of saving themselves. Instead, they stayed put and nursed each other until death did them part. It is reasonable to view this extraordinary sacrifice as a public service, as the inhabitants of Eyam thus kept the contagion within their village when they could so easily have panicked and, in fleeing the scene of death, taken the infection all over rural England.The Bubonic Plague may sound like a morbid subject. Yet the topic fascinates, in part because a study of the plague is always a study in human nature, revealing the extremes of nobility and depravity people are capable of when faced with pain and fear of the unknown. Brooks uses the story of Eyam as a backdrop for characters and stories that illustrate these extremes.Year of Wonders could not have been an easy novel to write. In the ordinary disaster narrative, suspense comes from not knowing whether the community under attack will survive its menace. But anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the Black Death knows from the beginning how Year of Wonders will end. At least two-thirds of the village will die. As a microcosm of the epidemic, Eyam's death toll will mirror the plague's overall totals.So Brooks must create suspense elsewhere, surprising us by how this character rises to the challenge with tireless dedication while that one succumbs to depression and another loses her mind. The full range of plague-related superstitions finds its way into Brooks' Eyam. Some villagers look for a witch to blame while others dabble in witchcraft, hoping to ward off their fate. One character takes to self-flagellation in the hope of placating an angry Christian God.The story is told through the eyes of Anna Frith, a young woman with two boys to raise. Frith is the widow of a miner, and she works as a servant in the homes of the village squire and rector. In most ways, she is a conventional, if unusually quick-witted, woman. She married young, her education is haphazard, and she is disinclined to question the religious beliefs that serve as the town's infrastructure. Were it not for the plague, she would no doubt have lived and died in the same 17th century English country village, without leaving a detectable trace. The extraordinary circumstances of the plague derail her from this path of least resistance and evoke a heroism in her character of which even she herself is only vaguely aware until the novel's last pages.A native of Australia and a former correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, Geraldine Brooks has previously written two critically acclaimed works of nonfiction, Foreign Correspondence and Nine Parts of Desire. With Year of Wonders, she proves equally adept at writing gripping historical fiction."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Set in the year 1665, 'Year of Wonders' is a fictional account of the historic 'Plague Village' of Eyam, as remembered by Anna, a maid in the household of Minister William Mompellion. With the emergence of the plague on White Peak, Mompellion persuades his followers to quarantine themselves within the town borders. As the pestilence takes its deadly toll, the faith and courage of ordinary people are put to the test, and a spiritual dilemma arises: how can a loving God allow such pain and misery?'Year of Wonders' is a remarkable work, for Brooks writes shimmering, elegant prose. Her knowledge of 17th century England is authoritative, and the medieval setting is carefully rendered. Yet this is the type of book that one admires more than loves, for 'Year of Wonders' is relentlessly bleak; social order breaks down in Anna's village, engulfing the characters in a collapsing world with little hope of escape. The mere act of daily living becomes a trial of courage, and as the plague ravages her village, Anna's despair is evident in the passage below:\\"It became impossible for me to look into the face of a neighbor and not imagine him dead.\\"As the death toll mounts, Anna and the Mompellions show gritty heroism, as they tend to the sick without thought for their own well-being. Yet fear and superstition exacerbates a desperate situation; the two women who could have helped the most--the town herbalists--are suspected of witchcraft and murdered. One gets a keen sense of the precariousness of medieval life, where doctors are no more than butchers, and frightened people turn to sorcery and magic to combat an invisible killer, which Mompellion describes as \\"a venom in the blood\\".Despite its contrived ending, there is much to admire in 'Year of Wonders', with its sheer narrative power and sense of place in a distant past, and for the life-affirming message it shares."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As my paperback copy of this novel was looking rather tattered, I was happy to be able to buy it again on kindle. Some books are worth buying twice and this is surely one of them. This is the story of Anna Frith, the widow of a miner, daughter of a boorish drunk and living with two young sons in a small village. She works for the manor, for the Bradfords in the big house, and for the rector Mr Mompellion and his wife, Elinor. From the start, we warm to Anna Frith. Her life has been hard, but she adores her two young sons and goes about her work with cheerfulness and kindness. Elinor Mompellion recognises Anna's intelligence and begins to teach her to read properly, becoming her mentor and friend, as well as her employer.Into Anna's life comes George Viccars, a tailor looking for a room. A lodger gives her a welcome extra income, and George is a kind man who plays with her sons and brings happiness back into her home. Unfortunately, he brings something else - plague. Anna had thought she found love, but instead finds death, as plague quickly sweeps through the village and her house, taking her sons. Mr Mompellion asks the villagers to have no contact with the outside world, to contain the plague by withdrawing and not going beyond the village boundary. Even as the villagers are being convinced, the Bradfords have sneaked back to the big house and flee. Everyone else is left, while the plague prepares to decimate the village.This is the story of that year and of the inhabitants of the village during the time of the plague. A time which brings out the best and worst in the inhabitants that live there. The ending is utterly, breathtaking and the shock of it, upon all those Anna has already endured, is brilliantly written. If you haven't read this before, then enjoy. If, like me, you are reading it again, nothing is lost in the re-telling. Fiction at its best and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.

Brooks goes into so much detail about the main character, and her day-to-day life, and then at the end, she crams a bunch of major events into a few pages. It feels like Brooks just got bored, and wanted to get it over with. Really enjoyed it up until the end though."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Even though I don't usually read historical fiction, this one peaked my interest. I had no idea that the village of Eyam actually existed when I read it, but the idea of a village instituting a self-imposed quarantine seemed both plausible and intelligent. Watching the village through the eyes of Anna was a bit like the morbid attraction of a massive car crash. In addition, I knew so little about the Black Plague that I thought this would give me an imaginative recounting of living during such a tragic time in history.I found the opening to the book to be confusing and seemingly irrelevant to the main plot - only at the end is the opening scene explained, but the complete scenario still seems disconnected from main plot and an added tool to simply move the main plot along by giving Anna a way to leave the village. At the same time, the faith and endurance that some of the characters exhibit is both profound and inspiring. I don't know that I could have had the same courage to face almost inevitable death as these characters did, or even with the same attitude of complete acceptance that Anna displays."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I wasn't particularly excited to read a novel about the plague, but I really enjoyed this book.

The main character is a widow who ministers to a man boarding with her who succumbs to the disease. Eventually so do her two young sons and many others in her village. Most of the book is an easily read and well-thought and well-written tale. The protagonist and the reader learn much about the disease and its affect on human nature. The last two chapters of the book seemed to be hijacked by a schizoid writer who veered so far off course the story ended on another continent. Maybe Brooks decided to use reverse psychology - if she ruined the ending of her book, Hollywood were change it to what she wanted all along.

I was chosen to lead a discussion group after reading it. There were about 15 members of our Reading Club, and the reviews were unanimous, in that everyone enjoyed the book, which is an unusual occurrence in our Group.The comments which were given by the group are shared by me. I felt that the book personalized a true historical event...the Plague which ravaged Europe in the 1600's. It explained how this could have happened, and how it managed to kill so many people, and it described the fear and horror that the people felt, and the fact that they had no ways of battling or curing the people who were struck by the disease. The other thing that struck most of us was the way in which the heroine showed such a strength and courage in the ways she was able to help and lead so many others and was able to give them some of her strength. She was indeed a very strong personality, especially given her station in life, and the times in which she lived. The only criticisms that some of the people had were with the ending of the book...that it was too abrupt, and in some cases, not really believable. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone, especially someone interested in history. I thought the author brought her characters to life, and personalized the event, so that I was able to imagine what it must have been like to have lived through those times. It made me realize how very lucky we are to have the treatments and drugs we now have in this modern age to battle diseases which were formerly responsible for the deaths of so many hundreds and thousands of people.

But, I was greatly disappointed in it. I came to the book knowing of the sacrifice of that village and knowing, too, that when people sacrifice in such a way they are abundantly blessed by God. Unfortunately, the latter was completely missing in this book. It is easy to be an onlooker to suffering and assume that you've seen the injustice and the loss and the pain and that there is nothing else to see. This is not only completely at odds with everything I believe to be true but also at odds with people I know who have suffered and the tales they tell of the comfort they have received. In the not too far distant history of my own people there is a sad tale of suffering and deaths of the daily \\"will this never end?\\" type. However, unlike the survivors of Eyam, we have their own words of the experience and as one survivor said, \\"The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay.\\" Surely there were miracles in that village as they sacrificed for the good of their people. Surely God walked with them. Surely there were wonders. Unfortunately there was nothing of this in the book. We are left only with what the author assumes would be left after such a year - a rector who no longer believes and a village that doesn't either. You can write a lot of things from our atheistic, modern standpoint, but in the matter of a village who sacrificed for their fellow man in the name of a God in whom they all believed, you can not write and get it right. You can not write of such things and leave God out. It leaves out half of the story and the most important half at that. My guess is that those villagers were never the same, but not in the hopeless way the author assumes. My guess is that for those villagers, they never had to look to the skies and wonder anymore if God was there and if He were listening, because my guess is that for them, all doubt had been swept away. They now knew He was there because He had walked with them in their year of wonders. That was the story I wanted to hear."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book could have been so good.

The theme was emotional and depressing, which wasn't entertaining for me to read for a free reading book. The book expresses feelings toward death, love and working together through such a difficult time. By reading this book you feel Anna's emotions when those close to her, such as family and loved ones, die because of the Plague. The plot captures a unique and mind-twisting love story that is looked upon as rebellious during that time period, along with a society working together and fighting to stay alive. Families have to decide whether to stay in the town or move out, risking spread of the Plague. Any decisions would hurt those around you, and death was a common outcome. Read Year of Wonders to find out if the society works together to overcome the Plague or are families selfish about surviving this tragedy."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Can someone please explain why I am unable to buy the kindle version of this book from Australia?Thanks"},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The most important thing for me was to receive the book quickly, and it came even sooner than expected."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Product in excellent shape and was shipped faster than I had expected.

Over the course of one year she sees the disease take the lives of two thirds of everyone she knows, including those of her own children, but she is sustained by the support and friendship of the rector's wife Elinor. In many chapters the author introduces another family or individual of Anna's acquaintance, which to the reader feels a bit like getting to know the other townsfolk, both likeable and otherwise, in the village. A book about plague would probably not generally be described as feel-good, but for me this story, especially the satisfying twist at the end, was very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;Year of Wonders&quot; was a great read.

I was excited to read it, but was not impressed with the story once I began. I felt like it was too sad to comprehend. All the pain and sorrow these characters went though, it was so intense, it's hard to capture it. The main character, Anna, has a life-changing event that ends in a very unexpected way. I feel that she is overwhelmed with pain from losing her family, then randomly changes her life around. This book is definitely interesting, and I would recommend it to anybody patient and emotional enough to feel the characters' pain."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"year of wonders is a great book! i really enjoyed! geraldine brooks uses elegant language, which i like, i learned new words reading this book. a thing that pushed me to read this book is that i love historical fiction and plague periods. anna is a brave and courageous character (i imagined her to be like drew barrymore). elinor mompellion is a kind and wonderful character, my favorite character. rector michael mompellion remained admirable to me throughout the story except at almost the end (i imagine him to be a tall, handsome, intellectual young man with intense eyes). i was dissapointed with the character, i used to like him a lot.i finished this book the sunday before the release of the LOTR-the return of the king. i feel i can somehow identify myself with anna and elinor. i really enjoyed and got lost in the book. i would spend hours reading it and wanting to know more about what came next. i must say the ending was, let's say, not the best and most likely to happen ending. i didn't like the ending.i recommend this story to all who can identify with a character who goes through a lot of life-changing events; to those who like historical fiction; and to those who like surprises in real-life like stories, i belive you may enjoy this book as i did. but you also must know that this story is depressive and sad.if you would like to discuss or talk about this book with me you may e-mail me at Aqua7799@aol.com or IM me. :) i would like to talk with someone about this great book."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A great read from start to finish, I want more!

It's not too long, not too preachy, and held my interest throughout. It's funny that a book with such a depressing premise(a village dealing with the Plague during the 17th century) could turn out to be an enjoyable read, but it was just that.I liked the writing, I liked the voice the author used, I liked the main character(s). I'll definitely recommend this to others, and I'll check out another of G. Brooks' novels in the near future."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The year is 1665 CE. A traveling tailor named George Viccars finds himself in a small Derbyshire village located in central England. Unknown to him and the village that takes him in, his residence being with a widower named Anna Frith who has two sons, he is carrying the plague. After his death, his goods spread and with them the deadly plague. The town vicar, Michael Mompellion, and his wife Elinor convince the people of the village to contain themselves within their walls in order to keep from spreading the plague to the rest of England. As the author states, this story is based on an actual event that happened in a village aptly known as Plague Village. Though the village people could very well flee and perhaps outrun the disease, they (for the most part) remain in their village to wait out the disease. Convinced that this plague is a trial sent by God, the people come together even as some of them fall apart. Innocent herbal women are beaten as witches, men and women seek to repent with violent means of self-mortification, and anger runs rampant. In the face of oblivion, moral codes and personal virtues are abandoned for pleasure and destructive behavior makes it all the easier for people to forget. The people of the village struggle with each other, their personal connections, and their connection to God. Eventually, they begin to question the nature of their suffering and God's ultimate plan.This story is how people manage. It is about how people stay strong and how they break down.Personally, I liked the story. I think anyone who has read my previous reviews knows how I feel about accuracy in historical fiction: while I enjoy critiquing historical fiction for accuracy, I also don't expect it. I'm realistic and perhaps overly forgiving in that I accept details must be altered or exaggerated for understanding or dramatic effect. After all, we don't want fiction to read as a tedious textbook! Attentions have to be grabbed, held, and kept until the end.Did this book that? Yes and no. Sometimes I felt the story dragging on and on. For the first few chapters, I read very slowly. Eventually, though, as the story moved on, I found it becoming more interesting. About the middle to nearly the end, I couldn't put the book down.Nearly the end.I found myself wondering if Anna were superwoman for all she had managed to do in that time between the plague coming and finally disappearing. She was a simple peasant and servant, yet she could interpret Latin, create herbal remedies, ride a horse like a man, act as a midwife and deliver a breech baby, set a fire to mine iron even though she herself stated that she'd never even seen the inside of a mine... yes, the woman can and does do everything. Even those things well above her station as a servant. I think it was the excessive nature of her talents that started to annoy me and grate on my nerves. If not for Anna's shows of occasional modesty that seemed sincere, she would have been a Mary Sue. After a while, I began to wonder if Anna was going to start to sparkle and cure the plague with her tears. When she began yelling at her former masters and acting well out of her station, I had to wonder if Brookes was paying any attention to realistic social boundaries of the time. Again, this might not have annoyed me had I not grown weary of Anna's super talents. Though I say annoyed above, I mean it in a very amused way. I don't get angry about books, at least not often. I just found myself shaking my head and snorting at certain parts of the books. And why would a rich Muslim doctor marry a widowed infidel from England?There's also much romance to be had. Okay, there is supposed to be romance. Up until Anna and the vicar Mompellion connected eyes over a shave towards the end of the book, there was absolutely no chemistry between them. Yet all of a sudden the two of them were copulating on the floor in a manner totally unlike an Anglican man of God and a modest, holy servant. The romance between them came completely out of nowhere. I guess I should have seen it coming when throughout the book Brookes dedicated countless lines of adjectives and praise for things like the commanding boom of the Mompellion's voice, or his strong arms, or his dominating nature. I thought it a bit odd that he was being described in \`romance book terms,' yet there was absolutely no personal intimate chemistry between him and Anna.And I am still disappointed in the turn Mompellion's character made towards the end. It was so completely out of his character that I had trouble accepting it. Twists are one thing, but making a character into something opposite with no hints to his true nature is just out of the blue and confusing.I know that I sound overly critical, but book readers know that a book can be flawed while still being a very great story. I liked the morbidity of the story; witnessing the breakdown of the people in this town as they battled adversity and death was fascinating. It was unreal to me to submit myself to death in the way the town people did. I had to commend the bravery of Brooke's characters, even as I condemned them for their actions in other regards. Yet, it was understandable how they behaved under certain circumstances. When faced with death, who knows what one would do or how to cope? And yes, Anna had her moments, but I found her a very likeable character.This book was like sociology and morbid psychology in action.Year of Wonders is actually a very good book. It is a good and interesting read. You will read the book and find yourself captivated by much. I didn't grow bored with what I read, even as I snorted in mirth. If you like historically based novels with a lot of drama and a fair mixture of people going absolutely crazy, you'll really enjoy this one. I did."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a beautifully written, compassionate novel of the 1666 plague in a small English village. The story centers around the life of a housemaid, Anna Frith, and how she and her village inhabitants responded and met the challenge of this horrific event. It is a story of courage and hope without undue sentimentality. Attention to historical detail, authentic characters, and a dramatic plot make this a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"At first, I didn't think I was going to like this book. The first few chapters are a little slow-paced. Now I realize that the author's intentions were to show the contrast between life before the plague and life afterwards.

This a very good book filled with horror, lust and surprising twists."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Geraldine Brooks really did a superb job with YEAR OF WONDERS.

The story was excellent.Well written. Not a grabber; not engrossing. Not a \\"I am dying to read this right now\\" book. But all the same, its well written, seems like its well researched, well thought out. I agree with my fellow reviewers and say I didn't care for the way the book ended. I see Anna in a different place that would've been more in the context to the story. But the ending does make sense.The story is about a woman who takes care of the preacher, his family and her whole town during a year of the plague. Man, its terrible. The suffering is brought home, literally. The author doesn't skip on the vivid descriptions. But we want that. I mean, why else would we read this if we didn't want to know what the heck was it like for people during the a plague outbreak?This story is believable and based on actual events.Sometimes the character herself gets a little thin on personality, for example, I don't recall ever reading a physical description about her. But...I guess the focus was more about the social atmosphere and how people dealt with their beliefs about God at that time. I was especially impressed by how she could continue to reiterate certain points and overviews; mentioning the title in the context of the story. Not many authors have the quality to do that anymore. QUALITY. Very interesting; indeed, very well thought out book.

I first read \\"People of the Book\\" and loved it. Then on to \\"March\\" and her new one \\"Caleb's Crossing.\\" Yet I was hesitant when a friend loaned me this one. I thought how can a story about the plague be interesting? I am so grateful that I read it in spite of my misgivings.This is a fantastic book that I could hardly put it down. The idea of a town that would voluntarily quarantine itself to stop the spread of plague seemed improbable. It would seem that the first reaction would be to run away and some tried that. But as it was explained, the town's reaction seemed perfectly reasonable. I wondered what we would do now? Could we be that brave? Then I thought of 9/11 and the airline passangers that crashed the plane so it wouldn't kill hundreds or thousands. Or how about the firemen who ran up the steps of the Towers? And the book took added dimensions to me in that context.Others have summarized the story and I was totally surprised at the criticism but each reader brings his own prejudices and backgrounds and reads the book through different eyes. I can tell you that through my eyes, this was a wonderful book that spoke to me on so many levels and actually made the plague, of all thing, interesting."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Years of wonders is a great novel which tells of the story of a young mother who lives in a village in England, which was recently hit by the plague.

If you have not met Anna in this book or Bethia in Caleb's Crossing, do yourself a favor and read both back to back.Criticism of her female characters for being too smart or too literate for the times only punctuates the need to expand upon what we've learned in the traditional history books, which often minimizes the roles of women in favor of grander narratives of war and plunder.Anna is a strong character making choices that are unconvential, but completely in line with her integrity. The ending is exquisite and while it may seem incredible, the value of Brooks' stories is that we can imagine what a better place the world could be if women were allowed to follow their heart's desire."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The plague lives and breathes it's deadly force through the small towns, huts of straw, homes of stone and wood equally.

The Students and Staff of the Dept of Microbiology greatly enjoyed this book and the online live discussion held at the end of the semester with Ms. Brooks. She took the time to study the life cycle of the microbe and because of that, this book is much more than just a time-period piece.

This man had a bolt of cloth that he didn't know was infested with plague seeds.I enjoyed learning the life of the village people in England.

It is a rich and intimate novel, one that makes you feel personally connected to the main character.

The pace speeds up unnaturally. Still, it is worth reading."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Year of Wonders was actually a good book. It talks about how people grow closer together and farther apart. It teaches people how hard it is to cope with being alone and scared. It also shows how to deal with these hardships. It tells about how old comforts that one has can easily be turned into something someone dreads. This is a really good book, and has an ending that to most would consider to be predictable but has many different twists that make you question what the ending is really going to be like. It is a book that is spiritually enlightening when you learn of the commitment that some of the characters have to God and their religion. This is the type of book that you would curl up with on the couch in your pajamas on a rainy day, sip on hot chocolate, and manage to not put this book down for hours."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There are many reasons to like this book. I enjoyed the unusual \\"out of order\\" sequence of events. The story starts after the worst of the plague has passed. We find the rector a widower, and Anna very worried about his state of mind. He is grieving, and appears to have lost his faith. Then the story backtracks to a time when Anna has a content life with husband and boys. Then the plague appears, and finally the story catches up to the beginning, with Anna watching as Montpellior sinks deeper and deeper into his own pity. I thought that the sequence of events in that fashion made for a very entertaining story line.I loved some of the language used: \\"one and twenty years old\\", \\"my feet are unlovely\\". These are unusual constructions and words in today's English, and it was refreshing to hear them.Another thing that I really appreciated (and that I wish more authors would do) are the author's notes at the end. Of course, after finishing the book, I had questions about the plague, about Puritanism and so forth. On the notes, Geraldine Brooks explains how she came to the true story of a village in England which decided to lock itself in as to avoid spread of the plague. She explains some things about the disease, and has a chance to talk about why she decided to have the characters do this or that in the book. That was very satisfying.I have to admit to be rather surprised with the events that take place in the end. Yes, some of the imagery would be perfectly at home in a romance novel. So what? As lurid as some of those scenes are, they do not detract enough from the book as to make anyone toss it into the fireplace. Also, the motivations of Anna and Montpellior to behave a certain way are perfectly clear: no, they were not hypocrites. Montpellior was blinded by his own faith, and Anna decided to be Anna, not to try to emulate her soulmate Elinor. Fate or serendipity or whatever you want to call it placed her into a path that truly allowed her to become her own person.I'd be hard pressed to say this was a beautiful book, but there were many beautiful moments in it. The friendship of Anna and Elinor is reason alone to read it."},{"Title":"Year of Wonders (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I agree with the reviewers who found fault with the ending of this novel. It is out of place with what went before and not really believable. However, I still think Year of Wonders is well worth reading.

Surprise, I loved it! LaVyrle Spencer has never let me down. This book moved me. I felt for the characters. I agree that Maggie and Eric should not have started their affair while Eric was still married, but I felt the author did a good job of making them realize this. These characters grew as people throughout this story and they paid dearly for their mistakes. I hate when a book seems to have bad people in it just to excuse bad behavior from other characters. I didn't get that from this book. Yes, Nancy wasn't a good person and she didn't love Eric (Nor was she faithful to him),but the story didn't use this to excuse his mistakes. I really sympathized with Katy. I was very self-righteous when I was her age. I saw things only in black or white. I think she should have tried to understand what her mother was going thru and offered her support if not her approval. We are raised to offer our children unconditionally love, I think as parents we should get the same whenever possible. I loved the character of Anna Severson. She put Eric in his place whenever he needed it, but was supportive of her son as well. I could understand Maggie's dad doing what he did at the end of the story. It was great to see that Roy was so supportive of Maggie when she needed him most.

Since he is married, it would have been better for Maggie and Eric to just have a friendship. I liked the grief issues that Maggie was facing in the beginning of the story.

It is a wonderful work of fiction by Mrs. Spencer.It is a very quick and good fictional read. No reason for any one who is so up-tite with them-selves or life to get their panties in a bunch.I recommend also Her book Morning Glory, wonderfully written."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"...unless that is, you love Door County, Wisconsin, especially 20-25 years ago before it became REALLY overrun with tourists. This book was recommended to me many years ago simply because it is set in Door County, a magical part of Wisconsin I know very well.The plot is simple: A 40-ish widow returns to her home town to start a bed-and-breakfast inn in a charming old Queen Anne house and finds herself again attracted to her high-school sweetheart. Although the characters are fairly well fleshed out, there isn't much depth here. The characters are just to pat, too stereotypical. That's not to say it's a shallow book. It just doesn't have much weight, and the thoughts of its characters aren't very complex. It's not as flighty as \\"chick lit\\" (lit? You call it literature? How about escape from life?).However, the book drew me because I knew the setting and because it its a great representation of life in Wisconsin in the 1980s, in a way.Yes, the heroine does become pregnant by her ex-boyfriend while he is married to someone else. Obviously from reading some of the other reviews, many people find that distasteful. I wonder if that was the reaction 20 years ago when the book was published, or if it's a reaction that could only happen in today? Not a choice I would make, but it's only a story, readers.LaVyrle Spencer was very popular in the 90s because she understood and spoke to the average Midwestern woman. Her plots are usually good. I just wish her characters had more meat on their bones."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I know that this is a book about a adultery, but it is also about a first love and finding love again. I think that the villian is the \\"wife\\" and that makes it easy to pull for these forbidden lovers. Really good romance."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Here we have a romance that involves a triangle, the man, the wife and another woman. How will it all end? Where do our sympathies lie? This is a thought-provoking story with lots of twists and turns, filled with heart-wrenching suspense. Interesting story!Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"The first time I read Bittersweet, I borrowed it from the library. I borrowed it 2 more times and then finally bought my own copy. I loved this book and most of Ms. Spencer's books. Yes, sometimes she's predictable, but I laughed and cried everytime I read Bittersweet. I was introduced to this wonderful author by a dear friend and now have the pleasure of passing on her books to my daughter, when she's older, and my mother. The romance genre lost someone special when Lavyrle Spencer put down her pen."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This book didn't sound appealing to me but for some reason I picked it up and started reading. I couldn't put it down. Two days later at 2:30am I finished it and pressed the book tightly to my chest. I already miss Eric and Maggie, Katy, Roy, Suzanne . . .It has been a long time since I laughed out loud when reading a book. Spencer put these characters together well. Not only did I laugh with them, I also felt their pain and heartbreak.There are holes in the plot and it's fairly predictable, but I found myself wanting to be carried on this journey. I couldn't wait to read what I knew was going to happen.I did look for some elements of the plot that magically disappeared (the grief group, the suicidal girl, etc.) but I soon let it go.This isn't a deep book. It isn't filled with metaphors and age-old wisdoms, but it contains fairly realistic people with realistic problems. For all practical purposes I shouldn't have enjoyed it. I am much younger than the age group of its characters. I was an English major in college and love the deep discussions books can evoke and I generally don't like flowery writing. Even so, I can appreciate it for the fact that it's easy to read. It's an escape I will remember. I can't say that about any other &quot;escapist&quot; novel I've ever read.I loved this book. It helped me see that there is beauty in her writing. It doesn't have to be deep and metaphorical. Bitter Sweet touched me; it renewed my faith in romance."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"For years I've been searching for a romance writer who is even comparable to Judith McNaught. Well...I just found her. This book was touching and sweet and yes...bitter. Love, loss, human frailty, and the will to survive were all emotions realistically tapped into in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be checking out everything else LaVyrle Spencer has written."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This is my all time favorite book and I don't generally read romance novels - it should be made into a movie (who would play Eric, Maggie, Nancy?) The reason I read the book was because it was about Door County. I enjoy my yearly visit to the Door and my goal is to someday own a B&amp;B or a retail store there so enjoyed that aspect of the storyline. Door County is truly a beautiful place. I loved the grief counseler's idea of contacting old friends - they do remind us of simpler times. I do wish a little follow up would have been given to the grief group friends in Seattle such as what happened to all of them after a few months. I loved all of the characters, but especially liked Anna, Brookie, and Roy. I wish LaVyrle Spencer would write a follow up to this book - what happens to Katy, Roy, Vera? Definitely a good read for a snowy, winter, weekend!"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"- I GOT TO KNOW HER BOOKS WHILE I STAYED IN THE STATES, AND BACK IN MY OWN COUNTRY I'M WAITING FOR THEM AS I WAIT FOR THE HOLIDAYS. - MY COPY OF BITTER SWEET IS SO WORN OUT BECAUSE I'VE READ IT SO OFTEN, I ALWAYS ENJOY IT. LOOKING FORWARD FOR HER LAST BOOK. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THOSE BOOKS"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I first read Spencer's Bitter Sweet about 3-5years ago. It is a beautiful love story, andeffected me in a way that is truly hard todescribe. It was a powerful book, becauseI go back and read it over and over again eventhough I know what will happen. Spencer is awonderful author, and I have read every bookshe has in print. I highly reccommend BitterSweet to be a first read by Spencer if younever read any of her works. Once you readBitter Sweet, you WILL come back for more."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"The story, at first, was off at a great start. I really liked how Maggie was slowly beginning to come to accept her grief and grow from it. At times, she felt one dimensional becaus eo fhte hatred she felt toward her mom. For crying out loud, she's nearly fourty. I think the least she could do is voice out her feelings instead of saying 'oh my mother is jealous of me... blah... blah.. blah...\\"Anyway, for Eric, his marriage unravel way too fast. I mean, in less than half a year and already he's dissatisfied with his 18yr marriage? I don't know... it just seems to move way too quickly.Also, both of the characters are not teenagers. They're adults and therefore should be more sensible. She knows that he's married. He knows that he's married. He sleeps with her then sleeps with his wife. That kind of sh.t is kind of a no-no. The whole making a mistake like that but still having everything is okay is not really life.Anyway, this book is a disappointing. I had great expectation before the whole cheating thing. It's rather tasteless."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I'm beginning to realize just how many LS novels I dislike. But for those I do like, they're top notch.Maggie's affair with Eric was flat out wrong. There's no way around that fact. I really didn't expect the entire book to based around it. Eric's wife Nancy wasn't much better herself in that regard, but she shouldn't have been villified for wanting a career and NOT wanting children.Once again, LS came close to turning the male hero into a wimp. Nothing wrong with a guy cooking dinner, but for some reason, the scene with Eric making the cornish hens for dinner with Nancy didn't sit well. He was too wimpy.Maggie's teenage daughter's behavior seemed typical; the girl DID have a point, didn't she? She was appalled and embarrassed the whole town knew her mother was having an affair with a married man."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"The storyline of this book is excellent(high school sweethearts reunited). Even though I didn't think I would like this book, I had a very difficult time putting it down because the majority of the characters including the leads were very likeable. However, I can only give this book four stars because there were a few things in this book I just didn't like. First of all, I do not condone extra marital affairs. Eric and Maggie should have waited until he was divorced before they had sex. Second, I am from the Seattle area and I did not like the author's references to the Pacific Northwest as a depressing, gloomy place. The part of the book that took place in Seattle also took place during the month of August which is usually our driest month. However, in this book, it was always raining. I also did not like the depiction of Katy as a brat, she had every right to be angry at her mother. Lavyrle Spencer did do an excellent job of describing the setting in Door County; it is now one of the places I would most like to see. I would recommend this book for &quot;good&quot; reading but it's not her best."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Bitter Sweet is a love story about a pair of high school sweethearts who rediscover each other after many years. Recently widowed Kate contacts former high school friends on the advice of her grief therapist and meets Eric,her first love,now married to a dedicated career woman who refuses to consider starting a family,although why this wasn't discussed before marriage,one can't imagine! She sells the family home and returns to her hometown to open a B and B,much to the horror of her teenaged daughter,newly at college. After many trials and tribulations(including an unexpected pregnancy) everyone lives happily ever after. This was,I thought,a fairly typical soap,until the last pages of the book,when I found that I couldn't swallow the huge lump in my throat as I read the wedding scene,and found tears of happiness trickling down my cheeks. I'm not a book crier and haven't felt totally choked up by a book since the attic scene between Jo and Beth in &quot;little Women&quot; which I read when I was 12. So what was it about the wedding scene that was SO moving? Just Ms.Spencers wonderful ability to get right into the emotion of the moment and make you feel that you were there in person. I'll NEVER sneer at romantic stories again-promise!"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This novel explores the interesting scenario of being reunited with a lost love. I think many people wonder what happened to individuals they've known earlier in their life. The idea of reuniting with an old flame is particularly intriguing. It took a lot of guts for Maggie to initially contact Eric. I think the story would have been much better if Eric hadn't been married when he received Maggie's phone call. Single, widowed, divorced, it wouldn't have mattered, just as long as he was available to love Maggie. Even though Eric's wife didn't love him, it didn't excuse his behavior. The author did an excellent job in the beginning of the story when she related what it felt like to lose a spouse. If Eric had been widowed too, it would have been a much more interesting dynamic. Overall, the book was a good read, and one I'd recommend."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Being from near Door County Wisconsin this book was wonderful and made me homesick.

It is a wonderful romantic story where the characters grew on me and I couldn't stop thinking about them. You have to read this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I can't believe how many good reviews this book received. It was an insult to any woman living in our modern world. Eric and Maggie have an affair and that is just fine. But Nancy is supposed to be evil because she is attractive, has a career she enjoys, and doesn't want to sit at home and pop out babies. And Katy is depicted as a brat because her mother uproots her entire life and she dares to say how she feels. Another thing...abortion, and Ms. Spencer's views on it...has no place in a romance novel. This novel did nothing but annoy me and turn me off of reading anything else written by Lyvyrle Spencer."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Love Spencer's concentration on character development instead of just plot development. Instead the two are intertwined & rely on each other to fetch the readers attention. I have read similar plots in many of her books but because of character development I was not bored or felt that the story was just rewritten. I found myself crying with the heroine & getting angry at the hero's wife. I love her writing & though I still haven't found a story better than Morning Glory, this is a close second."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I've read this book several years ago and loved it.

It's one of the few books that I can pick up every couple of years and re-read. So I decided the most efficient way was to get it on my Kindle Fire. I was stunned when I saw the number of mis-spelled words! Page after page!I'm concerned about getting other Kindle books. I expect when I pay for a published piece that it will not contain errors. Or certainly not the number of errors that Bittersweet has."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I've re-read this book many times since its original publishing. I enjoy that the author presents a main character who tackles issues head on, with little self doubt. Even so, she is just as emotionally vunerable as any normal human being & is lousy at at resisting temptation. I was suprised, however, that the author did not have the main character even consider an abortion as a viable option to her unplanned pregnancy. Sure, it's easy to just ignore reason and go along with the statis quo, but it takes real guts to stop and make one's own adult decision. I thought there was room for the main character to consider & choose abortion as the best option. Other than that old-fashioned solution, I really loved this book and its cast of characters."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This is one of the best love stories i have ever read.

Even though what Maggie and Eric did was wrong(i didnt think so at first,not with his wife) once i got married my feelings changed. Now if you want to read a book that will Keep you up all night reading because you can't put it down, then read this one. I fell in love with these characters. ESP Ma who tore into Eric like she loved him! I loved Maggies dad for standing beside her,even though she was wrong. And for giving his granddaughter a wake up call.

Maggie Stearn deals with the death of her husband with weekly group counseling sessions, and as the story opens, she is finally saying \\"goodbye\\" to Philip. At this same session she, along with her other group-mates, learns that one of the group's members had just attempted suicide, and this leaves a heavy feeling of sorrow among the group. Maggie goes home depressed with the knowledge of Tammi, but also knowing that Maggie's only daughter Katy is about to leave home for college. The house, and her life, will soon be empty.Maggie remembers something her counselor advised: sometimes one can help ease the pain of grief by contacting old friends from years gone by, rekindling old friendships from the past. Feeling this is a good idea, she immediately telephones her best friend from her childhood, Brookie, and after all these years they reconnect. It's been over 20 years since Maggie and her high school \\"gang\\" had been together in one place, and it was about time she called to tell them how she was doing. As she pours her heart out to Brookie, Maggie feels happy again and she finds herself laughing over old times.Brookie gives Maggie the phone numbers of all their friends, and soon, Maggie is talking to each one of them on the phone. She finally comes to the last name, Eric Severson, who also happens to be her first love. She forgets about the time difference and wakes up his wife and Eric who are fast asleep in bed, and with apologies to them both, she and Eric talk and start their long road to rediscovery.Maggie loved her husband Phillip deeply, but Eric was her first love, and knowing he was a married man, she put thoughts of him out of her mind. However, that soon becomes difficult when Maggie decides to move back home to Wisconsin to buy an old building and renovate it into a bed and breakfast. An obvious turning point in her life, Maggie finds something to live for. She puts her life with Philip behind her, and despite her daughter's protests, begins her new life back in her hometown, where memories of childhood and first love surround her.Despite warnings from family, Maggie renews her old friendship with Eric, and with his help they rebuild the old historical home together, making plans and feeling energized and excited about the future. Maggie knows her future lies alone, but is this what she really wants? She does not want to admit she still loves Eric, and his place is beside his wife Nancy.I've read several LaVyrle Spencer novels, but I have to say this was by far my favorite. For a romance novel, it wasn't the typical sappy sweet tale. This story had twists and surprises, and it kept me in suspense until the very end. Read about forbidden love in BITTER SWEET."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Bittersweet is my favorite book of all time. I have read it over and over. For anyone who knows the true meaning of&quot;first love&quot; this book is surely to be a heartwarmer. I know there are lots more intellectual books I could be reading, but, this is pure enjoyment for me."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I came across this book in some items I 'inherited' and decided to read it, not really know what to expect. I guess I expected a romance, and I guess it is...but not the typical, you know what's gonna happen romance. Not even the typical you know how it oughta end romance. The book was long..almost 500 pages. And like a typical soap opera, every time you think it could be resolved a new twist comes along. I'm not complaining...that is why we watch soap operas...right?We pick up the story with Maggie, a widow in grief therapy. Maggie's husband was killed in a plane crash and the result is she has all the money she will ever need. She also has a daughter about to leave for college. Her therapist recommends getting in touch with old friends, and boy, does she ever. She ends up moving back to her home town, where her HS sweetie now lives with his wife and troubled marriage. He wants kids...she doesn't. He wants a small town life...she wants a cosmopolitan area. He wants a domestic woman...she wants a jet-setting career. Oh, and she is specatacularly beautiful; she doesn't like his family and they don't like her. The truth is, this marriage probably should have ended a decade ago, as they seem to have nothing in common.Along comes Maggie, and though they seem to have good intentions in honoring his marriage vows...of course it doesn't work out as they plan. On one level, the whole story is about Maggie and Eric resuming their relationship. But at another level, it is about coping with change, and forgiveness. And a wise old woman...Eric's mom, Anna.A couple of things about the story bothered me, and if you don't want to know....stop reading now. I don't want to spoil this for you if you plan to read the book.Ok...first, though I do agree that Maggie, and any adult, has a right to do what is necessary to move on with life, I did think it was a bit selfish of her to pick up and move across the country 2 months after her daughter left for her freshman year of college. Not that she didn't have that right, because she did, but...she was ripping her daughter's life apart and didn't even acknowledge that. Yes, she moved back to HER home town where she spent her HS years, and it was comforting to HER, but in return she uprooted her daughter from HER hometown and HS friends...AND she didn't even get to say goodbye to them. She left for college assuming she'd be home at Christmas and probably hanging out with old friends next summer, not even SUSPECTING she'd be moving. I thought Maggie should have discussed it with her before she put the house on the market, and maybe offered to fly her out to see her friends, or even keep the house for a year, since she IS a millionaire now.The second thing is that there were a lot of unanswered questions about Eric's wife, Nancy. The implication was that she'd had several one night stands while traveling for business, but that was dropped. The baby she aborted could have been the result of one of these, but we didn't get told about that. Neither did Eric. He was left feeling guilty because he cheated, and never even realized she did first. Also, we know that Eric and Maggie reunited and presumably lived happily ever after, but we aren't really told what became of Nancy. Did she return to Chicago? Did she find a partner who was enthusiastic about sharing her lifestyle and dreams. Nancy wasn't really a bad person...just scared. Once she was forced to acknowledge that Eric wasn't the right partner, perhaps she was also freed to find a man who was, but we don't know."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This book has to do with moving on from catastrophes in life (Maggie's husband died the year before) and doing what is right for you, not those around you. Maggie is a strong, yet gentle woman who goes back to her hometown after a lot of convincing from some old friends that she just got re-acquainted with. Maggie buys a fabulous old house and begins repairs on it so that she can open a B&amp;B. Along the way she runs into Eric, her high school beau, who is in a loveless marriage but committed to staying. The story is Maggie's and it includes growing after 40, falling in love the second time and dealing with all that life has to throw at you. The connection between Maggie and Eric is electric and deep and so real that everyone can relate to that special someone that they have or have had in their life that makes them feel this alive. It is a great book that has such detailed descriptions that I can still picture the house and the driveway, the town, Eric walking across the street, Maggie in her pink jacket and rosy cheeks--it's great. Enjoy."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"The character in Bitter Sweet whom I liked most was Katy. I like a romance novel but of all the major characters ,Katy was the only one who disapproved of her mother having an affair with, and getting pregnant by, a married man. Basically,she is the only one with any real sense. Of course, at the end, she assumes a &quot;if you can't beat 'em, join 'em attitude&quot; because she loves her mom. Rekindling a high school romance is always a good story, but I would have liked the story, and the characters, much better if both Maggie and Eric were bereaved spouses. The soon-to-be-ex-wife in all these stories-Nancy, in this case-is always portrayed as an ice queen who destroyed her marriage because she had a career, not because her husband was sleeping with another woman. I can understand why Roy walked out on Vera, but we are supposed to sympathize with Maggie and Eric, whose relationship is built primarily on sex-and shake our heads at stubborn, deluded Katy, who rightly disapproves of her mother's behavior. Katy is far from a perfect daughter, but we are not permitted to sympathize with the fact that she has recently lost her father, and consequently watches her mother sell the house, move to Wisconsin, and start an affair with a married man, within a matter of months, and Katy is just supposed to cheer and say, &quot;Way to go, Mom!&quot; I don't think so. Having seen a close friend in such a situation myself, I know how that hurts and so I can identify more with her than with Eric and Maggie, who find sexual fulfillment first, and actual love later. It would be interesting to see a sequel in which Katy starts an affair with a married man and see how her mom and stepfather react to that. Now, I don't think Katy should have boycotted the wedding because Maggie was still her mom, but there is no reason in the world why she should have to think this whole thing was just terrific. I guess I'm one of the few people left on the planet that feels adultery is still sordid and wrong, and whether the two mai! n characters were in love or not, that's what it was all about."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"From the reviews, this one tends to be an \\"either you like it or you don't\\" kind of book. But I am glad I read it. I am now at the age of the main characters. And though I, too, don't agree with pre-marital affairs I am not going to judge those that fall into it. Maggie and Eric should have gotten together back in high school. But \\"long-distance romances\\" are hard to maintain and apparently over time they grew apart. 20 years later Maggie is a fairly recent widow trying to cope with the loss and get on with her life by getting in touch with old friends. Eric is \\"happily married\\" at least he thinks so- even though there are parts of his marriage that he still hasn't been able to accept and hoped they would correct themselves over time. But flames start up when he sees his high school sweetheart for the first time in years. Maggie visits the old hometown. They try reallllllll hard to hold feelings back but time keeps putting them together. Eric's wife Nancy is more interested in her career and self-image than starting a family that Eric has desired from the beginning. Oh there were parts that I did not agree with. As far as some reviews wanting Eric to be a widow too- well, that would have made a different story. I still would have liked Eric to have called Maggie towards the end to let her know what was taking place with the divorce instead of making her suffer for 6 months. And thank heavens there was a momma (Anna Severson) that had good sense to speak up to Eric and make him come to a decision. It was a hard book to put down!!! And I will read it again."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This is just an awesome Book! Lavryle Spenser has such a way with words that she makes you feel like your there! Very good reading! Just pick up this book, grab a cup a tea and sit by the fire and indulge with this book or any of her novels! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This is the story of a widow who gets pregnant. Her lover is a married wimp. In the end, the reader is called to show a bit of compassion for human frailty. It would make a good story for Tolstoy, it does not make a good romance. Reading all the Amazon critics of the book, I realize that human frailty is not what the readers look for in a romance novel: they look for comfort, they do not want sin and real-life situations; the book does not fill their expectations, they have a right to complain. It is not a good book because every character is isolated from the others: nobody communicates. Nobody makes an effort to see the other person's point of view. The lover wants a quiet life in the country and a wife who stays at home (why not? So why does he stay with a wife who wants the reverse?) His wife wants a career and the excitement of the city and no children (well, she has a right too, isn't it?) The widow wants company before it is too late(it is a legitimate wish.) The widow's mother wants everything and everybody perfect(the poor woman is criticized throughout the book, but what is wrong with wanting a neat house and a good reputation? Many women are like that.) The widow's daughter struggles with the loss of her father and hates the idea of moving away from her childhood home (it is natural, of course, so why the author describes her as selfish escapes me.)So all characters are well described and their needs are clear, but they do not interact at all. It makes of this a book about the rigidity of a self-centered crowd instead of a request for compassion. This autistic world is very unpleasant. I give it five stars because it is bound to make for lively and intense conversations in book clubs."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Lavryle Spencer's 'Bitter Sweet' brings you to a place that we all come to in our lives....Change is inevitable and we all must either go with it or fight to keep things the same...

It always installs hope in many hearts when high school romances are rekindled because they can be the ones to last a lifetime!"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"BitterSweet was the first Lavyrle Spencer book that I had read. I have been to Door County and could easily identify the places that Maggie visited every day in the book. I have read the book many times over and still get emotionally involved each time.The plot of this novel is predictable but it is also a story that every woman can relate to either through the high school first lost love, losing and finding best friends again, a rocky mother-daughter relation, a close father-daughter relationship, or a trying romantic relationship; and the story is beautifully told.I will continue to go back and reread this wonderful book, and every other book written by Lavyrle Spencer. I am sorry to hear that she has written her last book!"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I read That Camden Summer while on vacation last year and I read it in one day. The book was so good I bought another Lavyrle Spencer book immediately! I read Bitter Sweet by the pool and I was crying within a half hour! The bond that the reader will feel with all the characters is instant. This book is dear to me because I live in Wisconsin and I am very familiar with Door County and its irresistable charm. Brookie so reminds me of my good childhood friend, Mona, with her never ending wisdom and support. This book will make you laugh, cry, smile, and will touch your heart. I have bought all of Lavyrle Spencers books and lend them to Mona right away. We both enjoy her work."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This was a really great book!! I love everything I have read by LaVyrle Spencer!!! She has the ability to take you into the characters' lives so much so that you feel as if you really know these people....makes you really sad to have to say goodbye to them when the book is done. This is a book I really hated to see end!"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Yes, it was my first time at picking up one of Spencer's books, and believe me when I say, I could not put it down... I have all of her books now (hardback) EXCEPT this one, I leant it to someone about 5 years ago, and they LOST IT! AGH!!!!! So I cannot re-read it, like I have some of her others...as I do not buy paperbacks. (Well, maybe I will have to make an exception in this case)"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Thris was the first book I read of LaVyrle Spencer, and the first one to be published in Sweden. I couldn't help but crying when I read it and honestly i still do. LaVyrle has an abbility to write about ordinary people that fall in love. It's realistic and I guess that's why I love it so. Every time I read it and comed to the part where they are charing lunch on a bench I get lost picturing him, how he looks in that exact moment. And another favorite part is when she describes the feelings that they are having. I have yet not read another author's book where the felling are so real and... Well I just don't know how to say it. Just plain wonderful."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"As others have said, I disliked the character of Nancy. Ithink she got overloaded with bad characteristics to make the affair(and Maggie) seem like a great option. I kind of felt sorry for Nancy, getting stuck with a guy who harped all the time about having kids and quitting her job (which provided insurance for them!) Maybe he should have discussed kids with her before marriage...instead of assuming things!Aside from that, I enjoyed the book a lot. I got it as a gift when I was about 14 (23 now), and still pick it up occasionally. I am also from near Door County and am familiar with the settings of the story.I would recommend the book as good light reading, nothing that will shake your world but pretty good . And enjoy the settings--it really is beautiful in Door County!"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I just finished reading the book tonight. I was very into the characters. I feel as if I know Eric and Maggie personaly. I would suggest this book in a heart beart. Lavryle, if you are reading this, I want more books from you! I cannot get enough of your beautiful stories."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"As most of Lavyrle's books this is as good as the rest. It is a classic love story with all its twists and turns. Old lovers rekindle their passions to only have a party fighting to keep them apart. Just a fabulous book"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Enjoyed this book. It wasn't the typical love story where girl gets boy - it actually had me guessing whether the characters would end up together. The was a selection for our book club this month and I am anxious to see what others thought abut the story line."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"as always she does not dissapoint in her stories. I love her books so much I just wish she did not quit writing."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I actually read this book years ago, but enjoyed it so much the second time around. LaVyrle Spencer is an amazing writter and just transforms you to the different places in the story, I love that in a writter. There were several places in the book that just made me cry,happy tears and sad ones. Thank you for an awsome job."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"All of LyVerle Spencer's book are wonderful but this is one of my favorites. I have read all of her books at least 5 times and have enjoyed them immensely."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I have read this book numerous times because I live in Wisconsin and this book takes place in beautiful Door County in Wisconsin. I wanted the book on my Kindle, so I can read it again. A nice romantic lovestory."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"It was not a page turner, but it was okay. Our hero and heroine were older lovers, but just as silly as some of the younger people we often read about."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I recently visited Door County after reading this very romantic book. I felt like I was in the story. I usually do not care for romance stories but a neighbor said it would describe Door County and after getting half way thru the book...I was hooked. I cannot imagine any woman not really enjoying the story. Excellent writing and I'll read more from this author."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This was a good, predicitable novel by LaVylre Spencer. Just be prepared for alot of misspelled words throughout the novel. Otherwise, no complaints."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I really enjoyed this book.Great story line. It was hard to put the book down. I am sure i'll buy more titles from Lavyrle Spencer."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I live near Door County and have alway enjoyed my once-a-year week in the Door. Reading the book, I didn't have trouble working out in my mind just what was located where (I like to nail down these details). LaVyrle Spencer has a way of reaching the average American woman - that's why her books are so successful. But I look for characters with a little more depth. Also, Spenser's pattern of writing is very predictable. She uses lots of parallel structure - almost too much. But I still enjoyed the book - in factl the first time I read it, I couldn't put it down. I've read a few more of her books, but I just can't wax dramatically about them. I need a meatier story and Spenser doens't provide one."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Bitter Sweet is the first Lavyrle Spencer book that I had the pleasure to read. It was during my first summer break from the University I attended, that I discovered the special people and places she creates in her novels. I myself was hooked immediately. As soon as I was done BITTER SWEET, I went back to the book store and bought YEARS and HUMMINGBIRD. I have enjoyed LaVyrle Spencer's books so much that I have recommended them to family and friends. These wonderfully crafted books draw you in to the story like no others have done for me. LaVyrle takes such time and care in researching plots, and reinventing times in which we could only wish we could relive. LaVyrle Spencer has created a world for myself (23), my mother (50), and even my grandmother (75) to enjoy and feel good about reading. Currently I am reading NOVEMBER OF THE HEART, and as soon as I am done, it's being passed on to someone else who will enjoy it just as much as I do."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I read this book five years ago, but I really enjoyed it"},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I enjoy a good romance novel as much as the next person and I don't think one need feel apologetic about reading them. I've read several of Spencer's books and have enjoyed them. However, I found this one intolerable. How can I feel the sense of escape, comfort and romance that I hope for when reading this kind of book when the major plot turns upon an extramarital affair? Like some other reviewers, I thought the portrayals of Nancy and Katy were disturbing; Nancy is depicted as such a bitter cold shrew (because she likes her job and has the self-awareness to know she wouldn't be a good parent) that she &quot;deserves&quot; to lose her husband. Katy is a selfish, rigid and unloving brat because she believes in obscure moral tenets such as &quot;don't sleep with married men.&quot;The novel does feature lovely descriptions of Door Country and some engaging humorous moments. Overall, though, I can't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I am a huge fan of LaVyrle Spencer and find all of her books touch me in some way. Bittersweet touched me especially with the mother and father that she returned to in Wisconsin. Her mother was my mother. I shed many tears over those sections of the book. The love story was good but not one of her best. The relationship with her mother is what made it so real for me. I have all of her books and will miss her writing."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This book is an insult to women everywhere. First of all, why on earth did Eric stay married for eighteen years, waiting for Nancy to change, instead of finding out what her views on child care and giving up her career were BEFORE he married her? Second, I find it interesting that he automatically assumes that he has the right to stay in the town he loves doing the work he loves, yet assumes that Nancy should be willing to give up both? Third, having Nancy be unfaithful is an insult to career women who love their jobs and their children - in fact, her whole character was. I can't believe that a classy woman like Maggie would be dumb enough to fall for a jerk like Eric, nor does Maggie's lack of sympathy with Katy really resonate. Here's a young woman who loses her father, yet she's expected to put a happy face on it when her mother sells the house the minute she leaves for school, has an affair with a married man AND gets pregnant? The whole book did not resonate with me at all - the only characters I like were Roy, Anna, and Mike. This book almost put me off LaVyrle Spencer for life. A real disappointment."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"This book disturbed me at so many levels. First, I read romance novels to escape reality and realistic situations. I dont need books that deal with so-called \\"complex human emotions\\". This book was about adultary and its justification. I have seen so many situations where men and women walk out of enduring marriages (even when they have kids) because the couple has \\"grown apart\\" ..if that is an excuse to divorce or have an extra-marital affair, why marry at all knowing that we are all likely to become different than what we started out as being. I really didnt see the hero Eric try hard at saving his marrige, let alone give some indication to his wife, Nancy, that his marriage was in real trouble. The second thing that bothered me was what bothered a lot of other reviewers. Nancy didnt want children because she wanted a career. She doesnt sound any different from many other men who are so driven by career that it consumes them. Is that a reason to paint her as a villain? If you are an independent woman , with a career that gives you as much emotional satisfaction as a marriage, then DO NOT read this book. And heaven forbid if you even decide to have an abortion!I landed up sympathizing with Nancy (who the author tried very hard to paint as a bitch), the heroine (Maggie's) daughter who is rightly mortified by her mother's behavior, and even Maggie's mother Vera whose marriage was destroyed (even unintentionally) by Maggie. I hated Maggie. What kind of a woman resents her daughter's presence in her house because she cant carry on her trysts with Eric), and what kind of a woman hates her mom simply because she rightly questions her moral judgement. In the end, Maggie--who has caused two marriages to break--gets a very happy ending. Her baby, a wimpy husband who will of course now fully turn out to support her business because she will be there for the kid and not hire a nanny, and of course her daughter, who dared to question to her mother's behavior. If tomorrow, her daughter got dumped, who will Maggie side with? will she be \\"understanding\\"?Most disturbing of all was the fact this regressive book was embraced by so many readers. Anything can be justified , I suppose, if written eloquently, even an extra marital affair that can lead to so many complications. This is the first book of Spencer I read and will be my last. I happened to pick up Bygones (as it was next to this book in the library), and it looks like that book too talks eloquently about \\"forgiveness\\" and such. I am skipping it and had enough of this author."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"I was at the library when a woman who was standing at the romance section grabbed this off the shelf & encouraged me to read it because it was so wonderful. I started it and realized I had read it years earlier. I remembered it well because of my extreme negative reaction to it. First off, I NEVER read a book condoning adultery. There is no excuse for betraying the trust that a spouse places in you--I don't care why. After a divorce is one thing, during the marriage is another. I also hate how society seems to think an affair for a guy is one thing and an affair for a woman is totally another. When Eric has an affair with Maggie, I lost all respect for him. When it turns out that Nancy is having an affair, somehow that's supposed to be way worse than Eric's affair. Huh? Maggie gets pregnant & rejects her first child because of her love for Eric. Huh? What parent would turn their back on their child at a time when they are emotionally destroyed because of the loss of a parent? I have children & can tell you that no lover of mine would ever come within a million miles of my children's need for me. This part of the book is totally off base. My biggest complaint with this book is its ringing endorsement of the little woman who wanted to stay home & be the happy housewife while condemning and villifying the career woman who is up front about not wanting children & enjoying her career. Women do not have to be broody hens to be complete as women. I know many women who did not want to have children of their own, but do much to mentor and care for other children through family connections, their careers, and volunteering in the community. This is not the 1800's and women have many more options than they used to. This book reminds me of the awful romance novels my grandma used to read in the early 70's with nurses marrying doctors or secretaries marrying the boss & then quitting their jobs to be homemakers--ick! Give me a torrid contemporary romance any day with a sassy heroine & a modern hero. This book is just one big ick."},{"Title":"UC_Bittersweet","review":"Right up front I'll say I didn't finish this book. I was so upset that Ms. Spencer could write a \\"Romance\\" that included and condoned adultery and turning your back on your own daughter that I could not finish the book. In the past I have read several other books by this author and enjoyed them, but next time I pick up a book by her I will research the subject before purchase."},{"Title":"Dawn and Too Many Sitters (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 98)","review":"&quot;Dawn and Too Many Sitters&quot; has a great plot, and that's why I rate it a 10. It's funny. Dawn Schafer's younger brother, Jeff, and Mallory Pike's younger brothers, Adam, Byron, and Jordan, decide they want to be baby-sitters too. But there are some drawbacks: Jeff hates smelly diapers, and didn't want to change Andrea Prezzioso's; and Adam goes with Stacey to sit for Matt and Haley Braddock and Adam and Haley get into a fight. It probably happened because Haley is nine and Adam is ten. I think that maybe Jeff, Adam, Jordan and Byron are too young to baby-sit."},{"Title":"Dawn and Too Many Sitters (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 98)","review":"This book is really adventurous.

They do a terrible job even when the Baby-Sitters Club has to pay them. I think the book was one of the best in the series!!!!"},{"Title":"Dawn and Too Many Sitters (Baby-Sitters Club, No. 98)","review":"(A kid's review) I liked this book overall, except for the fact that the baby-sitters wanted to tow Dawn along on that school Hawaii trip- and she was on their side. I felt terrible for Dawn's mom- all she wanted to do was spend time with her daughter and WHOOSH! back to the west coast goes Dawn, without a care in the world about how her mother feels. There's even a paragraph in the story that goes like this: A trip to Hawaii? I'd already flown clear across the country. I'd been looking foreward to a nice, relaxing New England summer. Did I really want to go back out West so soon? You bet I did!That is terribly cruel and makes Dawn sound like a snobby brat without one care about her mother's feelings.

Thus, this book might be worth reading for you!"},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"I found Susan Wiggs and her books late last year. Since then, I have read about a dozen so far. Each one has been charming, interesting and unique. She is a very talented author and her characters and story lines always come alive for me each time I open a book and begin a new journey through her eyes, thoughts and hands. My favorites so far in order are The Horsemaster's Daughter (h), A Summer Affair (h), Halfway to Heaven (h), The Firebrand (h), Enchanted Afternoon (h), An Ocean Between Us (c) and then Miranda (h). She mixes historical romances (h) and contemporary (c) plot lines. My favorites so far have been historical in context.In this latest book I selected, Home Before Dark (c) , I felt similar enjoyment of reading a new story line and discovering the wonder of new characters, new setting and new developments. Although I found the story line interesting - wild sister comes home after years away - running from her past of course - to enter the lives of her family again. She returns due to a personal trauma that is happening to her to find forgiveness and acceptance. The family has to deal with her past mistakes, her current situation and planning for the future. She creates chaos for everyone - her standard role in the family. But...for once, she can't run from the past. She must meet it head on as time for once is against her.I had trouble connecting with the lead heroine Jessie and her eventual beau Dusty. She reminded me of so many girls I know who are pretty, spirited, have all the guys after them and spend their lives on the go - never being serious or dealing with reality - because they can't deal with it and often don't have to. So...they travel the world and hide behind their looks or talent as inside they are fragile and easily crushed. Jessie had it all to the outside world but, inside she was struggling to find herself and her place in life. Although I appreciated her struggle and journey, I simply never felt emotionally tied to her as the main character, even with her progressing blindness and disease. Instead...I kept seeing how selfish she was from the time she was a teenager, through her 20's and 30's and so on. I was irritated with how much she took from people and often how little she gave in return. This made it hard for me to connect with her, feel sympathy for her situation, etc. I warmed up to her more by the end but, she still had a lot of making up to do than the book would allow. I liked Dusty - her future man but, he came in and out in sections and scenes and I could have used more of him to really feel for him as a leading man. Much of what we learned about him came through telling his story to a magazine to publish - it was a little clinical for me. He was a good hero - just not there enough.I enjoyed reading more about Jessie's sister Luz as she was stable, reliable and trust worthy, the rock of the family - both in the younger years and in the middle years. Luz could be depended on as a daughter, sister, wife, mother and co-worker. She was not perfect - in looks, brains or skills but, she had a heart of gold and gave everything her all. She took and gave back - much more balanced. I even liked her husband Ian...he was her perfect compliment. He was handsome, intelligent, solid and kind. Not exciting but, someone you could have fun with, change with the seasons and grow old with great comfort. That has its own appeal.There was so much going on in this story - kids getting in a car crash, a death, disclosure of who Lila's real mother and father were, relationship issues with Jessie & Dusty and Luz and Ian, the activity of kids and parents and careers in photography, etc. that the story line almost got away from itself at times. Not because it wasn't told well but, simply because there was too much going on. 2-3 stories lines might have been enough - that was power packed by itself. But...to have a dozen big events going on in one book put it a little over the top. I would have felt more emotion for all the characters had I more time to spend on each one of them. Instead, each section and chapter went from one event and person to another and then more changes and developments happened - a bit of a whirlwind if you ask me.I did find a few parts a little unrealistic - 1) Lila getting the news she was adopted and who was her real mother and father - she took that news a bit lightly for a girl who seemed to be having growing pains already and simply took this huge issue in stride 2) that Luz would have no jealousy over knowing her husband and sister had been lovers - what sister would not find this an issue? 3) that no one in the family ever truly told Jessie off and called her to task on her constant selfishness - having affairs, having a baby out of wedlock and then running out on the child in ICU and leaving it to her sister to raise, never being around other than a few calls or letters over the years, loving and leaving people when it was inconvenient for her (Ian, Simon, Dusty, etc.). 4) that Jessie, Glenny or Lila never really thanked Luz for all she had done over the years - she bore the families burdens often single handedly - she deserved more thanks than she got from everyone. Luz wasn't a martyr - she simply did the right thing when others did not. As the old saying goes - Good people do things right....Great people do the right thing. Although many of these important issues were addressed, it seemed on the surface and nothing truly deep as a real family would have to deal with over time. That was the only thing I found lacking at times.Although this is the least favorite of my books by this author so far, it is still a gem. I don't think SW can write a bad book. When you are as good at story telling as this author is, even her least appealing works rank above other authors best attempts. I would recommend this book and the other ones even more. Give her a try if you haven't yet. You'll be glad you did. She is great at tapping into human emotions and the complexity of relationships - man/woman, adult/child, female to female and more. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Jessie Ryder and Luz Ryder Benning are two sister that could pass as twins but couldn't be more different.

Throw into the mix, a hunky widowed neighbour who has taken a liking to Jessie and you have got yourself a great novel about two sisters and finding true love."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Out of all of the Susan Wiggs books I've read so far, and that would be seventeen, Home Before Dark tops my list. Not only are the characters, every one of them, believable, but each is an individual story in his or her own way.This was one book I found it very hard to put down, it kept me that engrossed.From the love between two estranged sisters, Luz and Jessie, to the often-annoying teenage daughter, Lila, to the men in their lives, Ian and Dusty, they kept me totally engrossed in a way I haven't been in a while.There is a richness to this book which is hard to describe, but it's well worth the time it takes to explore it.As much as I've enjoyed many of Susan Wiggs' books in the Lakeshore Chronicles series, I don't feel that any of the books in that series have equaled this book, which stands alone."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"I read and re-read all her books I can find and have for many years. She is always fresh and doesn't rely on the same phrases or shocking love scenes. I've never been disappointed in her characters. This novel is truly an original concept told with unfliching honesty. I'll be reading it again."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Great book for a quick read. Loved the story and I really wish there was a second book to it."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"My second book by this author, a very talented storyteller who weaves deep characters with the flaws to match. Welcome to real life. For those who care, the language is troubling, even though one character actually knows Jesus is not a swear word. As is typical in a novel of today, the married people sex is boring or non existent, while, of course, the unmarrieds are full of unbridled passion. Too bad that's not real life."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"A heartwarming story about two sisters and their very different lives and the circumstances that bring them together after many years of being apart. A really nice story about family and love."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"I have read nearly every book that Susan Wiggs has written and I have yet to be disappointed. Home Before Dark is filled with compassionate characters that become \\"part of your family\\" as you read this great story."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"My first book by this author. I did find the book very boring and easy to put down at times. I did not really like Jessie. Her actions annoyed me. I felt she was a user. The romance with Jessie and Dusty developed too quickly. I liked Dusty more before he fell for Jessie. I did cry a few times in the book and read it to the end in hopes of something. Spoiler Alert.... Some unrealistic situations - Like an aunt would get her niece a tattoo without the parents permission. Lila accepted the fact she was adopted so well. I felt there was no development in the relationship between Luz and Lila. I guess this book was just not for me. I will try another book by this author in the future and hope for better."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"isn't this the same book from a long time ago?

This one is no different and a story of two sisters as their adult life intermingles with the past. One sister a famous photographer with an exciting world of travel, and the other with a dedcation to her family. The one big secret that eventually brings them together again and an opportunity to help one another through a devastating life-changing diagnosis, gives the story some emotional revelations."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"I'm no longer buying books that say \\"Best Seller\\" because I've been disappointed too many times as with Susan Wiggs, Home Before Dark. I truly did enjoy Ms. Wiggs descriptive writing of a Texas Hill Country and some parts of the characters. Their emotional reaction to HUGE issues, such as narcissistic self-absorbed main character, Jessie, a world renowned photographer who comes \\"home\\" to her older sister Luz's ranch in Texas because her own life is in shambles and after leaving her mess behind her for Luz to pick up the pieces. I don't know, Luz reminded me of a half-daft martyr vacant, please abuse me some more. And the teenage daughter, okay, per a teenager, but when news of her birth \\"issues\\" are revealed the reaction? Yeah, like, can I go meet my friends. Sorry, Ms. Wiggs, the characters are NOT believable to me, or I just haven't met folks like you wrote of. But then again, fiction, so the moral of the story is forgiveness, I'm sure.I like dialogue and if a story doesn't have believable or near believable conversations going on, I'm zone out, as I did too often, skipping over it in this story.There's love too with Jessie and Dustin, a hunkie widowed single father of a toddler, again, I don't get him or their relationship. Everybody is too nicey about major human problems. What's really going on here, Dr. Phil?Luz's teen daughter, Lila, is really Jessie's daughter - Jessie flew out of the hospital because she couldn't deal with a premie, and no husband and basically Jessie wanted her own life, not a kid. Luz who just met Ian, who within months they marry to take in this baby and oie, oie, oie. \\"Thngs are going change in a big way from now on,\\" he (Ian) said.

Younger Jessie is facing a life-changing problem just at the moment she learns to fall in love. It all sounds pretty schmaltzy but trust me, it's not. The sisters are hip, funny, sad and altogether human. You'll never forget them, and the lessons they learn along the way."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Many a historical romance author has tried to make the crossover to contemporary fiction. In rare instances, authors excel equally in both genres, and Susan Wiggs is one of those rare exceptions. With her latest novel, she explores the bond between sisters Jessie Ryder and Luz Ryder Benning.After almost sixteen years traveling the globe on photojournalism assignments, Jessie is back to see her beloved sister Luz, three nephews, and fifteen-year-old niece Lila, who is actually the baby Luz and husband Ian adopted from Jess who took off years ago. Through the pain of separation and untold secrets, the sisters try to fit into each other's lives again, as Luz and Ian must decide whether to tell rebellious Lila the truth of her birth. And even Jessie has some secrets regarding Lila's conception. Amidst this very realistic glimpse into one family's drama is the surprising romance Jessie finds with local pilot and widower Dusty Matlock, who has a tragic story of his own.Expertly drawn characters set against the beautiful Texas landscape are the life force of this compelling novel. Not only is the reader entranced by the unearthing of past secrets, but present-day secrets come to light in this thought provoking read with a unique and believable view of one family's ability to stay together despite personal trauma and tragedy."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"I feel almost guilty reviewing Susan Wigg's \\"Home Before Dark\\" because I like her writing so much, her evocative descriptions of place, in this case Texas Hill Country, and her characters are very real and delightful, as is the dialogue. It's just the plot and the theme or through-line were, for me, obvious, trite, unbelievable, and simplistic. By Chapter Three, it was all so programmatic, as if morality and justice were simple equations that could be added up to create \\"fairness\\".First we have the ambitious, selfish, talented, sort of bad girl photographer sister, who slept with the guy who eventually made a good husband for her good beyond belief sister, and got pregnant by him, and left the child for her good sister and her ex-husband to raise. And the photographer sister goes off to New Zealand without telling her sister that the child is her husband's or I mean that her husband is her ex-lover who fathered the child she leaves behind for them to raise. Get it? I mean, really, I know people have secrets, but this is ridiculous. This sort of thing may happen on Oprah or Dr. Phil, but those people are on those shows because they have huge problems. Fact is stranger than fiction, and it's allowed to be, because it's fact and you can't dispute it. But fiction, unless it's fantasy, has to be a little closer to normal, in my book, anyway.Anyway, the selfish but talented sister is going blind, just so she doesn't get off scot free after committing the the sin of dumping her premature baby of her illicit affair with her sister's soon to be husband, on her poor sister, who is also talented, but gives it all up for family. But never fear, the soon to be blind photographer comes home to help and finds the man of her dreams before she loses her sight. Whew! Everybody gets their just desserts in this flamingly overblown world of REALLY BIG PROBLEMS, in case you were worried.And on and on Wiggs goes, parsing out moral punishments and rewards for good and bad behavior like a trainer doling out dogie treats.I have no objection to the morality of what she advocates, or to her actual writing, I just can see it all coming from page 2, so all her pretty descriptions and fun little scenes feel like emotional manipulation to serve Wiggs' prim, little moral universe. Sorry, can't recommend it"},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"After living for the past fifteen years in New Zealand and photographing much of the world, Jessie Ryder returns to her hometown of Edenville, Texas near Austin. Jessie suffers from a debilitating illness that will leave her blind, so she needs to see her biological daughter Lila one last time. Years ago Jessie became pregnant after making love to Ian Benning, who later met, fell in love with, and married her sister Luc. Jessie hid the father's identity from everyone and her newly married sister and husband adopted Lila and loved her as their own.Jessie wants Ian and Luc to tell Lila the truth about whom is her biological mother. As the trio struggles with what is best for Lila, the teen engages in hill hopping which leads to the death of another passenger. Meanwhile, Jessie falls in love with widower neighbor Dusty Matlock and his little girl. However, Jessie does not trust relationships so as she loses her sight she flees, but not before the Bennings tell Lila the truth.HOME BEFORE DARK is an engaging relationship novel that contains a delightful extended cast. Much of the tale focuses on Jessie, yet readers also learn about the other key characters. Although why Jessie felt that Lila had to know the truth is never fully explained, the audience will savor this warm modern day family drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Losing her sight, Jessie Ryder returns to the home that she left fifteen years before--and to the daughter she left, adopted by her sister, Luz. Jessie has been a photographer, taking pictures of the world, rescued from her mistakes by her sister, but her sister can't rescue her from blindness. Jessie intends to see her daughter, visit her sister, and then vanish again. She doesn't count on meeting a handsome pilot with a story of his own, or on her daughter Lile's decision to sneak out of the house for a night of joy-riding. When she must leave, the pain is more than she can stand--still, Jessie leaves, it defines who she is.Dusty Matlock lost his pregnant wife but kept her on life support until their child, a wonderful daughter, could be born. For two years, he's retreated into himself. But when the pretty photographer comes to take his pictures for an article, he feels the stirrings of desire--and love. Dusty may have lost his love, but he isn't the kind of man to swear off love for a lifetime--and what he feels for Jessie is the real thing. Of course, the onset of Jessie's blindness is a secret--will Dusty be able to survive another terrible blow?Author Susan Wiggs turns up the emotional intensity with this gripping story. Jessie is believable and thee-dimensional as the woman who sees herself as trouble, runs from her problems, yet who has punished herself more than anyone can. Luz is interesting and an apt counterpart to Jessie's flamboyance (three tattoos?). Dusty breaks the stereotype of romance heros by being confident of his emotions and certain of what he wants. Jessie's blindness is handled sensitively and realistically as she deals with the loss of this critical sense, the loss of her career, and the realization of all that she lost by walking away from her daughter at birth.Susan Wiggs is a wonderful author who seems to grow stronger with each novel. HOME BEFORE DARK is an important achievement. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Home Before Dark is a romantic story about the difficult choices we face in life and about family reconciliation. Filled with love, joy, and heartache, this is a book that simply cannot be put down.When faced with impending blindness, Jessie Ryder returns home to her family to get to know the daughter she gave up to her sister. 16 years earlier her sister left college early to adopt Jessie's child, marry and raise a family, giving Jessie the opportunity to fulfill her dream of becoming a photojournalist and traveling all over the world. Each, however, longs for the life of the other-Jessie envious of the secure family life her sister has had while Luz pines for the seemingly exotic and exciting life Jessie has led. Secrets abound, and a tragic accident makes this book a real heartwarming page-turner."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"I have very much enjoyed the two previous books I had read by Susan Wiggs - they were Historical Romances - but when this book arrived from inter-library loan and I read the blurb on the back it seemed I'd picked the wrong sort of book for me. The story was evidently about family relationships and tensions following a woman adopting her sister's child at birth. I put off reading the book for a while but when I finally started it I was immediately engrossed.Jessie Ryder is a successful photographer but with secrets. The first secret is that Lila, her niece, is actually her daughter. Her sister Luz and her husband Ian took Lila the moment she was born and have brought her up as their own child along with three sons that came along later. But there are more secrets that Luz doesn't know - Jess and Ian had a brief fling before he got together with Luz and Ian is the father of Lila - both adoptive and natural. But there are even more secrets; Jessie is visiting them now, after sixteen years, as she is losing her sight and wants to take a final \`look' at her family, particularly her daughter, before it all goes dark.Jessie is an interesting character and I wasn't always sure I liked her. She deals with emotions by running away and never seems to stick with anything. She comes like a whirlwind into Luz and Ian's life and appears to be causing disruption - teenager Lila is becoming wayward and ends up involved in a tragedy, and even the grieving widower next door gets sucked in to Jessie's mayhem. And yet she's also a woman who feels greatly for the mistakes that she has made in her life and who wants her family to be happy and does what she can to further that.Despite me not really being interesting in family relationship books this one was very good - I wanted things to turn out well, for Jess and her sister to go back to the close relationship that they formerly had, for Jess to have the support she would need in her future. This book portrayed the complex family dynamics that can take place in what seem to be ordinary lives and the ways in which those we love can hurt us as well as heal us. There's a gentle and sweet romance in the book too, as well as a fascinating vignette into what it must be like to go blind as an adult. I recommend this book as an enjoyable and excellently-written read."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"I loved this book. I particularly loved the relationship between the sisters, which I found completely realistic and exceptionally touching. Although they had their differences and were envious of each other's lives and choices, their love for each other shone through.Ms. Wiggs is a wonderful writer. I don't agree with the Publisher's Weekly reviewer who said she tends to overwrite. The thing some reviewers don't get is that descriptions of emotions are to a romance what descriptions of gore and mayhem are to a thriller.The only thing I'd have done differently had I written this book (and I sure wish I had!) would be not to tell Lila the truth. Ian needed to know, yes, but I don't think any higher purpose was served by telling Lila.But that's a minor point in an otherwise totally engaging, intense story that gave my box of Kleenex a workout! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"If you like books by Barbara Delinsky, Kristin Hannah and other contemporary stories that cover more than just romance, you'll love this book. Susan Wiggs creates very human and complex characters and then she writes about love between sisters, family members, men and women. A woman comes home to the family she left behind ten years ago for reasons that become clear as the story unfolds. All the characters grow and change. Nothing is tied up neatly, it's all believable, but it's a very satisfying ending. Worth your time."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Anything Susan Wiggs writes is wonderful, but I particularly appreciate her contemporary romances. She so deftly portrays the issues that confront her protagonists that I am compelled to consider the effect that such issues (wether commonplace or unique) might have on myself or those whom I love.In this story Jessie Ryder, an accomplished photojournalist, returns home to her family after a fifteen year absence when she learns that she is going blind. There she must face the rebellious daughter, Lila, that she gave up to her sister, Luz, at birth and resolve the differences that have grown between herself and the sister she respects and loves. She must also confront her own demons and deal with the fate that she has been dealt.Wiggs creates a world that is as real as your own and populates it with strong and complicated characters that you will readily embrace. The major issues such as living with the decisions we have made and with the things in life we cannot change that Wiggs addresses are so truthful and well considered that you will think about this book long after you have finished reading."},{"Title":"Home Before Dark","review":"Perhaps I just don't like this author's style.

It's a very helpful tool both for brushing up on the gospels before reading the other book under the cover and for individuals who might be confused about how the timelines of the four gospels fit together.Josh McDowell's book is something of a watered down version of his texts \\"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\\" in which he researches the Christian Bible. Due to his educational background the texts \\"Evidence that Demands a Verdict\\" came out something like a legal textbook and many find it both difficult and boring, but \\"More than a Carpenter\\" summerizes the results of his research in a format that is easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"The Life of Jesus / More Than a Carpenter","review":"\\"Why don't the names of Buddha, Mohammed, Confucius offend people? The reason is that these others didn't claim to be God, but Jesus did,\\" Josh McDowell presses. Additionally men like to attack the religious truth more than that which is clearly fallacious. And in \\"More Than a Carpenter\\" one finds proof that Christ is God along with reason, and fine prose that will convince or distress the reader.* This volume has additionally Life of Christ story.Chapters include:- What makes Jesus so different?- Are biblical records reliable- Is there some other way?- and more.McDowell notes: \\"Jesus had various credentials to support His claims to being Messiah, God's son. One credential often overlooked, one of the most profound, is the fulfillment of prophecy in His life.\\"And beginning with Moses and with all the prophets He explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures\\" (Luke 24:27).\\"In the Old Testament there are sixty major messianic prophecies and approximately 270 ramifications that were fulfilled in one person, Jesus Christ. It is helpful to look at all these predictions fulfilled in Christ as His \\"address.\\" You've probably never realized how important the details of you r name and address are -and yet these details set you apart from the five billion other people who also inhabit this planet.\\"He adds: \\"With even greater detail, God wrote an address in history to single out His Son, the Messiah, the Savior of mankind, from anyone who has ever lived in history -past, present, or future. The specifics of this address can be found in the Old Testament, a document written over a period of a thousand years, which contains more than three hundred references to His coming. Using the science of probability, we find the chances of just forty-eight of these prophecies being fulfilled in one person to be right at one in 10157 (a one followed by 157 zeros!).\\"Additionally: \\"The task of matching up God's address with one man is further complicated by the fact that all the prophecies of the Messiah were made at least 400 years before He was to appear. Some might disagree and say that these prophecies were written down after the time of Christ and fabricated to coincide with His life. This might sound feasible until you realize that the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, was translated around 150-200 B.C. This Greek translation shows that there was at least a two-hundred-year gap between the prophecies being recorded and their fulfillment in Christ. Certainly God was writing an address in history that only the Messiah could fulfill. Approximately forty major claims to be the Jewish Messiah have been made by men. Only one-Jesus Christ-appealed to fulfilled prophecy to substantiate His claims, and only His credentials back up those claims.\\"And \\"Isaiah 7:14 adds that this man will be born of a virgin -a natural birth of unnatural conception, a criterion beyond human planning and control. Several prophecies recorded in Isaiah and the psalms describe the social climate and response that God's man will encounter: His own people, the Jews, will reject Him and the Gentiles will believe in Him (Isaiah 8:14; 28:16; 49:6; 50:6; 52:53; 60:3; Psalms 22:7,8; 118:22). There will be a forerunner for Him (Isaiah 40:3; Malachi 3:1), a voice in the wilderness, one preparing the way before the Lord, a John the Baptist.\\"\\"Notice, too, the seven ramifications of a prophecy (Zechariah 11:11-13; cf. Psalm 41, Jeremiah 32:6-15, and Matthew 27:3-10) that narrows the drama down even further. Here God indicates the Messiah will be (1) betrayed, (2) by a friend, (3) for thirty pieces, (4) of silver, that will be (5) cast onto the floor, (6) of the Temple, and (7) used to buy a potter's field. In Micah 5:2 God eliminated all the cities of the world and selected Bethlehem, with a population of less than a thousand, as the Messiah's birthplace.\\"Dr. McDowell continues: \\"Then through a series of prophecies He even defined the time sequence that would set His man apart. For example, Malachi 3:1 and four other Old Testament verses (Psalm 118:26; Daniel 9:26; Zechariah 11:13; Haggai 2:7-9) require the Messiah to come while the Temple of Jerusalem is still standing. This is of great significance when we realize that the Temple was destroyed in A.D. 70 and has not since been rebuilt. The precise lineage; the place, time, and manner of birth; people's reactions; the betrayal; the manner of death. These are just a fraction of the hundreds of details that made up the address to identify God's Son, the Messiah, the Savior of the world.\\"The author quotes Peter W. Stoner:\\"The manuscript for Science Speaks has been carefully reviewed by a committee of the American Scientific Affiliation members and by the Executive Council of the same group and has been found, in general, to be dependable and accurate in regard to the scientific material presented. The mathematical analysis included is based upon principles of probability which are thoroughly sound, and Professor Stoner has applied these principles in a proper and convincing way.\\"McDowell comments: \\"The following probabilities are taken from that book to show that coincidence is ruled out by the science of probability. Stoner says that by using the modern science of probability in reference to just eight prophecies, \`we find that the chance that any man might have lived down to the present time and fulfilled all eight prophecies is 1 in 1017.' That would be 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000.\\"Jesus said: \\"I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\\" (John 14:6).\\"This book is a smooth read loaded with evidential arguments and persuasive prose: perfect for a new Christian, teen, or your unsaved loved-ones.------See the New Book that contends for the existence of God using moral absolutes by Mike Robinson:There Are Moral Absolutes: How to Be Absolutely Sure That Christianity Alone Supplies------or additionally see the dynamic new book on apologetics:[[\\"God Does Exist!: Defending the Faith using presuppositional Apologetics, Evidence, and the Impossibility of the Contrary\\"]]type in ASIN#:1420827626"},{"Title":"The Life of Jesus / More Than a Carpenter","review":"I was pleased with the merchandise.

Thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Manga Mania Bishoujo","review":"This book is adorable. The art is stunning (That's because Christopher Hart only drew about 22 illustrations out of the whole book.)Christopher was never a good artist in the style of manga. I'm was never a fan of his art and still isn't.But this book is great to have for refrence, most of the book is not for beginners, But it might be useful for them to buy it anyway. It does has some simple steps for them in drawing the heads.It starts you off drawing beautiful eyes. Then the many lips and mouths and their expressions.Then drawing the head in different poses.And then it goes to teaching you how to draw the Cheat between the Pretty Girl (only two pages though.)It shows you 9 pages on hair, when wind is blowing, between short, long, medium, and wild hair. The many curves of hair and style. Also \\"When you change a hair style, you change a character\\" page. It gives you 12 pages on body expressions and poses and Body Language.3 pages on the poses of hands and (2 pages)on feet (note all feet pictures except one, is wearing some kind of shoe.) It also tells you between a Stylish Figure and a Seductive Figure,a Cool Figure, and Warrior Figure(4 pages.)It also have Advance Action Poses (11 pages.)It also has Bishoujo Clothing from Primitive to Techno Soldier to School to Professional Uniforms to Magical and non-Human costumes (11 pages.)

But afterwards it's Creating Chemistry (7 pages).And last but not least \\"Magical Girl Special Effects\\" (on the last 7 pages.) &lt;--That might be very useful if you creating a Magical Bishoujo Manga.I'll give it 5 stars cause it was a very good book and most of the illustraions were amazing.

Chris Hart's books are rather hit or miss for me, but this book was very comprehensive. It covers the female figure in great detail in Japanese style. The contributing artists were wonderful and did a good job of showing the female figure and face from various angles.The sad thing about Chris Hart's books is that his own artistic style is so very poor. Frankly I could've done without his own illustrations, which is really too bad since he is the author.I think the couples illustration at the end, and the drawings of the face from various angles were worth this book's price alone.5 stars.

Flying to Japan or Korea is out of the question as well, so what do you do?One option is to purchase nifty \\"How to\\" books from sites like Amazon.com. Unfortunately, you won't have any idea of how good the book is until you open that package from the shipper. The quality of any genre of art book varies widely. Some assume much more skill than the average Otaku can manifest on a good day. Even a good book art book is of limited value if it's not the right book for the individual aspiring artist.Fear not. Having purchased a number of books on the topic I feel qualified to recommend MANGA MANIA: Bishoujo by Christopher Hart. From the very first page you will be lead through the process of creating beautiful, alluring female figures with little more than basic art tools and modest talent. Christopher Hart avoids the temptation to show off his own artistic talent while talking down to the reader/student. Instead, he walks you through the process of character design. With clear, step-by-step illustrations you see the character come alive. You deal with not only eye placement but expression. The famous eyeshine and shadowing details also come into play as you decide which technique appeals to you most. Along the way, the author imparts history and cultural influences that have shaped the manga culture we know today.You might go on to buy other Manga art books afterwards to refine and define your style.

Gives a complete well-documented account of the true Israel along with explaining the truth of what most Christians think is modern Biblical Israel. I wish every preacher would read this and wake-up the Body of Christ. Judaism is nothing close to Christianity and the Rabbi quotes are all amazing in this book. Rev 3:9 I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews but are not and are liars, I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. To me this verse can only apply to the deceit of the Edomite/Khazars who pose as God's chosen people and who spread this lie to the present day. Now we see Christians accepting this as truth and thinking of themselves as the Goy/gentiles when they are actually the Biblical Israel and the chosen race. Please, please read this book and then read the Mystery of the Gentiles by the same author. I have read many books on this topic and this is the best. Also if you can find it, read \\"Who is Esua-Edom?\\" by Charles Weisman. These are the best 3 books and will wake-up Christians and help you understand the covenants in the Old Testament as well as gain major perspective of who Paul was actually teaching in the early churches. I bought multiple copies and passed them out. Also read Raymond Capt \\"Stone Kingdom\\" and his \\"Missing links Assyrian Tablets\\". It is time for the Church to wake-up. God bless America and you."},{"Title":"God's covenant people: Yesterday, today, and forever","review":"I started this book with a little scepticism, but Weiland has done such a fine job of making his points clearly and fully referenced, so I ended up convinced by him. I checked ever reference to make sure there was no twisting of the sources, and found no problem. The evangelist has done a superb job of explaining exactly what the problem with our modern world is, how we have come to this pass and how we can get out of it. It is written in an essentially American context, but readers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as other English speaking nations, can be sure that the same problems and remedies apply to them. As he says, to win a war you have to know who you are, and who your enemy is. I cannot fault this book. It should be in the hands of every thinking Christian, and we should realise, as the Puritan fathers who built America did, just who we are. This message should be preached from every pulpit, in every English speaking nation. Perhaps then we may be able to stop the rot and recover the Godly society we once had.

I read though it three times before I became a Christian in the winter of 1986.But then I purchased an interlinear--George Berry's Interlinear New Testament to be exact. The Greek text in it is the Textus Receptus (TR). The King James Version (KJV) is in the margin. Using this interlinear did two things for me.First, it introduced me to the question of textual variants. At the bottom of almost every page are textual variant footnotes. They compare the TR to seven other published Greek texts. Now at first sight this looked like a lot. At least one variant on every page of the Bible! It can't be that reliable!However, as I looked at these variants I found that for the most part they were not that significant. There were some that seemed to matter. But overall, the differences were more \\"nit-picking\\" to me than anything else. So my previous studies about the textual integrity of the New Testament were confirmed, not hurt by this information.Second, I began comparing my NIV to Berry's word-for-word English translation below each Greek word. It did not take very long for me to realize that the NIV simply did not match up with this word-for-word translation.The preacher of the church I was attending at the time used the New American Standard Bible (NASB). So I purchased the NASB version of Ryrie's Study Bible. Comparing the NASB with Berry's translation I found that it did match up much more closely than the NIV.The above is taken from Chapter One of my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\" In that chapter I go on to discuss how the use of this and other interlinears convinced me that dynamic equivalence versions like the NIV are not reliable. So I switched to using the NASB.But as I studied the textual footnotes in this interlinear and the subject of the Greek text-types in general, I became convinced that the Textus Receptus was more accurate than the Critical Text. So I switched to using the NKJV as my primary Bible.So this interlinear had an important effect on my Bible studies. As such, so I highly recommend it. I detail all of my experiences and conclusions in myDifferences Between Bible Versionsbook."},{"Title":"Interlinear Greek-English New Testament","review":"The print is so light most of it is unreadable for me.

This goal has been achieved in other study material for students of NT Greek but not in this particular reprint.This book is cheap (& looks it) and commendably small but I couldn't recommend it to anyone since there are much better Greek interlined New Testaments out there. I own this and I DO use it but that doesn't mean I'm happy with it."},{"Title":"Interlinear Greek-English New Testament","review":"Many preachers and Bible students use the George Ricker Berry Greek to English Interlinear to double-check the KJV translation.The reason it is wrong to use the Interlinear KJV Parallel Greek-English New Testament by George Ricker Berry to try to assure yourself the KJV is properly translated is because the REAL AUTHOR OF THIS INTERLINEAR --Plymouth Brethren leader, Thomas Newberry--regarded the Received Text as \\"faulty\\" and represented the KJV as having many inaccuracies, errors, and obscurities in renderings:The Revised Version.-- This is the result of repeated expressions of dissatisfaction with the Authorised Version, repeated attempts to amend it, and repeated calls for its revision, on account of the faulty state of the original text it proceeded upon, the comparatively defective knowledge of the original languages on the part of the translators, and the proved presence of many inaccuracies, errors, and obscurities in the renderings.(Quoted from The Newberry Reference Bible, Portable Edition, pg. 944)The author of the George Ricker Berry Greek to English Interlinear boldly exalted the Revised Version over the KJV:This Revised Version gives evidence of being the work of men well qualified as scholars for their task, and animated with an equally tender regard for both the original Scripture and the Authorised Version. It is certainly much more accurate in text and translation than the older version, but less pure and musical in its English. [Bold emphasis added](Quoted from The Newberry Reference Bible, Portable Edition, pg. 945)Why would Thomas Newberry, a Plymouth Brethren leader, who like John Darby, regarded the Textus Receptus to be inferior to the minority Greek Text, translate the Received Text into English? The answer is obvious: to attempt to discredit the King James 1611!It is no longer a mystery why the George Ricker Berry Interlinear reads like a MODERN VERSION in many places."},{"Title":"Interlinear Greek-English New Testament","review":"To those who either study Greek, or simply are curious about the meanings of the Scriptures, this is an excellently informative tool of insight.

Even more so(78)is my dear friend to whom I shall send this copy. At times we find the modern crime novels, though in many cases well written, just too stuffed with violence, murder, and every conceivable kind of misery. Than we take our refuge with Ken Holt and his friends, the Allen clan. Vile crooks are trying hard to bump them off in every book, but we can enjoy the reading without fear, knowing that they'll fail. The crooks, that is. The Vanishing Magician was, as a child and later, made a scapegoat for the crimes of others and this very well written novel deals with consequences of this. All Ken Holt books are good, but the psychological touch in this one makes it even more interesting for us grown-ups in quest of quality entertainment."},{"Title":"Studying the Torah: A guide to in-depth interpretation","review":"Bonchek helps readers through the Torah (by which I mean the Five Books of Moses) by supplying several \\"keys\\" to Torah interpretation, and providing examples of each. To give two examples:One key is language in the opening sentences of a sequence or paragraph. For example, in the first sentence of a paragraph discussing the law of liberation of slaves (Exodus 21:2), the Torah uses the phrase \\"go out\\" twice. And in the succeeding verses, the Torah uses the word \\"go out\\" several more times - thus indicating its view that slavery (at least for Hebrews) should be a temporary status, because slaves will eventually \\"go out\\".Another key is the contiguity principle - the idea that Biblical language should be interpreted by reference to nearby language. For example, Gen. 3:1 describes a snake (the one who offers fruit to Eve) as \\"subtle.\\" Well, why is he subtle? Bonchek goes on to say \\"God had said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden\\" -- but in fact, God said not to eat of only one tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This exaggeration enables the serpent to manipulate Eve into eating of the tree."},{"Title":"Studying the Torah: A guide to in-depth interpretation","review":"The author has a unique way of showing us how to study the Torah.

Trust me!Shalom"},{"Title":"Studying the Torah: A guide to in-depth interpretation","review":"I have been to a number of talks, and read a number of authors' opinions about how to study scripture. Generally, a lot of the advice that I have read has been along the lines of looking at the \\"Who, what, when, where and why?\\" or following a specific word or theme and see how it is woven throughout scripture. \\"Studying the Torah\\" uses a different approach.The author starts with using the \\"P'shat\\" method of interpretation -- looking for the plain sense meaning of a section of scripture and finding questions that seem unanswered and looking at interesting words and phrases to understand the deeper levels of meaning and thematic elements. From there, he goes on to give 8 more \\"keys\\" to unraveling the \\"hidden\\" meanings and themes within the Torah, simply by looking at the text itself. For example, another key is the importance of the opening sentence that begins a \\"parsha\\" (section of scripture). He gives the example of Numbers 32 -- In the first sentence here, we see the word \\"cattle\\" twice. Not only that, but the sentence reads, \\"And much cattle was had to the children of Reuben...\\" which is an awkward grammatical rendering. In other places, we see the easier way to write such a sentence, such as Genesis 13:2, \\"And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold...\\" When looking closer at the section as a whole, it becomes apparent that \\"putting the cattle before the people\\" was probably a very deliberate method that was used to show the priorities of these people. Boncheck goes on to interpret the chapter further, showing an interesting teaching moment that was happening under the surface of what seems to be an ordinary negotiation.That is one of the most excellent parts of the book. Bonchek not only tells you what \\"keys\\" he has found useful in drawing out more meaning from the scriptures, but then he goes on to give several in-depth examples for each key, to show how he studies through a section of scripture using these methods. I have the feeling that it probably takes a lot of practice to become adept at using these methods... but it does open up interesting avenues to finding more in the scriptures than just what lies on the surface."},{"Title":"Studying the Torah: A guide to in-depth interpretation","review":"Is an unvaluable resource to help you in the study of the Torah, and to get the sustance of each word of the Scriptures"},{"Title":"Studying the Torah: A guide to in-depth interpretation","review":"This book is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who truly wants to know how to study the Scriptures.

Just keep in mind that's like reading In Search of Excellence and saying you've gone a long way toward learning to become a manager. If you're looking for a book that will make you a star, I doubt you'll find one.This book explains how the stars of the restaurant business achieved their success. It explains tons of restaurant industry history, and lots of the relationships on which successes have been built. It appeals to our inner sense that hard work and high standards lead to opportunity and success. Becoming a Chef deserves recognition as an inspirational book about how to succeed in America.If you know how to read between the lines, Dornenburg and Page also warn that in this business most people will labor in obscurity. Be warned by the inventor of the Red camera (a video camera of such exquisite power it can take IMAX movies) that the fastest way to develop something awesome and have a billion dollars is to start with TWO billion dollars you made in some other business. Even those who come to the restaurant business well capitalized should know there is no guarantee of success.But if restaurants are your passion, this book will show you how other people found their way in a business where you are judged anew with every plate you put together. If your standards are high enough to succeed with customers, you still won't succeed all the time. You'll want to ask how do you stay motivated to stay at the peak of your game. No book has the right answer for you, but Dornenburg and Page explain the answers to this question described by many of the stars in the industry.Readers not driven to answer this question will find this book a little jumpy, so I only gave it four stars.Salted among the pages of text described so far, the book includes almost a hundred recipes. I tried hard to ignore these, but some just compel attention. Even without the text, Becoming a Chef almost rates as four star cookbook for the amateur cook.

When Galileo first broadcast his findings about the solar system in 1610, he sparked a flood of speculation about lunar flight. Johann Kepler, himself a pathbreaking astronomer, posthumously published a novel, &quot;Somnium&quot; (Dream) (1634), that recounted a dream of a supernatural voyage to the Moon in which the visitors encountered serpentine creatures. He also included much scientific information in the book, speculating on the difficulties of overcoming the Earth's gravitational field, the nature of the elliptical paths of planets, the problems of maintaining life in the vacuum of space, and the geographical features of the Moon. It is an interesting and useful and perhaps the first entry in the genre of science fiction."},{"Title":"Kepler's Somnium: The Dream, or Posthumous Work on Lunar Astronomy","review":"\\"Somnium\\" (which means \\"Dream\\") by 17th century astronomer Johann Kepler is quite possibly the first modern story of space travel. It was not published until after Kepler's death and was rarely published or translated until the late 1800s. Today it is very difficult to find English translations of this book, most copies selling used for more than $100. I had to acquire a copy through inter-library loan, but even that was not the real book from the publisher. My library copy was a facsimile produced by a university in the 1980s of the mid 1900s translation in this Amazon listing. I am not aware of any public domain e-book versions of Somnium -- if anyone knows a website where I can download one please let me know in the comments.Kepler wrote Somnium as a fantasy literary platform to launch his scientific defense of the then-unpopular astronomical theories of Copernicus, namely that the earth and other planets travel around the sun. For fear of being persecuted like Galileo, Kepler kept his Copernican ideas out of the public eye, only discussed them with close confidants, wrote Somnium as a fantasy taking place within a dream, and delayed publishing the book for decades. He intended the short story as a thought experiment to consider what the earth might look like from the moon. In doing so he devised some physics hypotheses of space travel that remain fairly accurate to this day, and he even realized centuries before Darwin and natural selection that lifeforms in wildly differing environments would appear and behave very differently from each other.Somnium is an extremely short story, taking up only about 20 pages. These are followed by about 80 pages of Kepler's detailed scientific notes (originally footnotes but fortunately moved until after the main text in this edition). These notes are the reason for Kepler's decades-long delay of publishing the book because he wanted his argument to be unassailable by the political, religious, and scientific figures who might oppose him. In a way these notes are the real body of the book, but I only skimmed through them because my purpose in reading the book was for science fiction and early ideas of space travel rather than detailed astronomy. These notes are followed by approximately 150 pages of appendices written by the translator which cover everything from biography to history to science, some appropriate for the general reader and some appearing very technical. Unfortunately I did not have time to get very far into these appendices before I had to return the book to the library.Somnim as a short story (all 18 or 20 pages of it): Kepler has a dream about an Icelandic boy whose mother is a witch. Due to poverty the mother sells her son to a ship's captain, and the boy eventually ends up in Denmark apprenticing to an astronomer whom Kepler himself had learned from when he was a boy. The boy develops a fascination with the moon and eventually is allowed to return home. His mother is extremely happy to see him, and they discover that they both have an interest in the moon (hers occultic and his scientific). The mother tells her son that she knows a demon who has taken her to the moon before, and they decide to go see the demon together. The demon takes them to the moon using a method that is magical in nature but demonstrates sound scientific principles (the discussion of the safety precautions needed to travel in space is by far the most interesting passage in the book). They hide from the sun in caves, examine various lifeforms, and then unexpectedly and abruptly Kepler awakens from his dream.There is not much story here, and the little bit of story there is I found difficult to understand. I attempted to read it three times before I made it through all 20 pages simply because I wasn't sure what exactly was going on. I was greatly assisted by a certain online article about Somnium by Gale E. Christianson, and I strongly recommend that anyone who is remotely interested in this book Google and read that particular essay which explains everything so clearly and beautifully. In the story I really enjoyed the Icelandic boy as a character and was intrigued by his relationship with his mother. I found the description of the trip to the moon to be thought-provoking, entertaining, and even funny. After they got to the moon everything seemed like a big disappointment because nothing really happened and there was no more plot, just description.Who would I recommend this book to? I strongly recommend Somnium to fans of early science fiction and anyone who wants to read early ideas about space travel. (That category includes myself.) However, if this is you then I strongly recommend you find a cheaper way to read this book then to spend an enormous amounts to buy a copy. The person who would truly benefit from this book would be a professional astronomer or a scholar."},{"Title":"Kepler's Somnium: The Dream, or Posthumous Work on Lunar Astronomy","review":"The Somnium is basically a straightforward account of the moon-equivalents of our days, years, seasons, eclipses, tides, climate zones, view of the planets, means of timekeeping, etc. The playful and pleasant tone of the work may be illustrated by a note where Kepler argues that, owing to the earth's size, the moon receives a significant amount of reflected heat from the earth, making the nights mild in the regions of the moon facing the earth:\\"The warmth of moonlight ... we may investigate with our sense of touch, aided of course by art. For if you receive the rays of the full moon on a concave parabolic, or even spherical, mirror, at the focal point, where the rays come together, you will feel a certain warm breath, as it were. This happened to me at Linz, when I was busy with other mirror experiments and not thinking about the warmth of light. For I began looking around to see whether anybody was blowing on my hand.\\" (pp. 122-123)I was disappointed that Kepler treats the biological implications of his meticulous astronomical account so briefly. Apparently, the moon is full of serpents and pine cones (p. 28), but there is little elaboration on this point. Also sadly, Kepler tells us that he has suppressed a discussion of how living conditions on the moon affect its political climate (p. 130, seemingly omitted for fear of its misinterpretation as allegoric of earthly affairs).It is of course ridiculous to call this \\"one of the most important books in the history of science\\" (back cover). It is also quite silly to call it a work of fiction or even science fiction: the fictional component of the work amounts to little more than a fanciful poetical preface which has nothing to do with the treatise itself."},{"Title":"INTO THE FIRE HOW YOU CAN ENTER RENEWAL AND CATCH GOD'S HOLY FIRE","review":"I picked up this book and couldn't put it down until I finished it. It captivates you with such honest sharing and deep thoughts of the ways that God moved in Che's life. The stories are inspiring and motivating to seek more of God and to have more of God in our lives."},{"Title":"Unity of good","review":"This book written by the discoverer of a religion over a century ago, tells uw who we are in truth and in God. Very informative aond concise about the true meaning of life and how to live it."},{"Title":"Booknotes","review":"Brian Lamb would be a national treasure if he had only shepherded C-SPAN into existence. But he also brings us Booknotes -- a wonderful and distinctly understated tour through the inner workings of the most fascinating authors of our time -- and this book admirably captures the tenor and content of the cable program on which it is based.Each author is covered (only once as a rule) in two to three pages which may touch upon influences, motives, work style and the writing experience. Each chapter begins with an introductory paragraph by Mr. Lamb, but otherwise the show's creator and moderator is not injected into the material, which is presented as straight text rather than in an interview format.The short chapters make it a wonderful read in all circumstances, the material is engrossing, and one finds many suggestions for further reading here. Well done."},{"Title":"Booknotes","review":"This is one of the books that is long overdue for a book review by me. I stumbled across this book about 6 years ago and it should have been one of the first books I reviewed for amazon.Since April 1989, C-SPAN's Booknotes has been offering one-hour televised conversations with non-fiction authors every Sunday night. Booknotes has interviewed over 710 historians, biographers, policy experts, and journalists. Authors are only interviewed once, regardless of how many books they publish. Eack Booknotes book (there are currently 5 out now) is a collection of essays developed from the edited interview transcripts of each of the sixty-minute interviews with each author. I know you will discover at least 10 books you will want to read after reading this collection of interviews. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Booknotes","review":"I am not a cable subscriber, so I have never seen the show &quot;Booknotes&quot; on C-SPAN. But that did not stop me from purchasing this book. I am a frustrated writer and thought the book would provide, as promised, a glimpse of how and where writers gain inspiration. I have recommended this to friends and have loaned it to a colleague who also writes. If the show is half as good as the written representation, I should run right out and become a subscriber. I highly recommend &quot;Booknotes.&quot;"},{"Title":"Booknotes","review":"OK, upfront I'll own up to my prejudice. I love the way Brian Lamb does his program, Booknotes, on C-Span. He is at the top of my &quot;people I want to have lunch with&quot; list. If you, too, enjoy Booknotes and Lamb's interviewing style, then I'm quite sure you will enjoy this book. If you are not familiar with Booknotes, then you need to get with the program. You're missing out.Th book is a compilation of summaries of Lamb's interviews with some 130 prominent and not so prominent authors. Each summary is tightly edited, and written like a statement from the author rather than a Q and A seesion. The result is excellent. The summaries are short enough to maintain reader interest, and the titles of the authors' books is great fodder for reading lists.If Brian Lamb asked me in his understated manner, &quot; So,what's your recommendation&quot; My answer would be &quot; Unqualified 5 stars &quot;"},{"Title":"Booknotes","review":"Full of fascinating stories, quotes and people, this collection held me enthralled from beginning to end. Not only useful as a glimpse into the writers themselves, most of the interviews also give you a taste of the subject they've written about -- more often than not, I wanted to read the transcript of the full Booknotes interview (available online)as well as seek out the books they'd written! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The conspiracy; a novel","review":"I read this book a couple of times when it first came out. I thoroughly enjoyed the yarn, in some measure because of Hersey's device of telling the entire story through the exchange of notes/memos between two despicable men. Loaned my copy to a friend (or former friend) with predictable results. Therefore, I ordered another copy today.In reading the reviews here I was amused and bemused to note their comparisons of the story to the end of the Nixon administration. The parallels between the two periods were engrossing (a bit predictable, perhaps) and absolutely and wholly wrong.While I was as disgusted as the next guy by Nixon and his cronies, it would seem only fair to point out that Hersey intended no comment on Watergate whatsoever. It would be impossible. He must have written \\"The Conspiracy\\" ca. 1969 or 70, because the book was published in 1972. I suppose you might look for parallels to the Johnson administration, but the events of Watergate began in 1972 and came to their climax with Nixon's resignation in 1974!Think again (or perhaps, at all) people !"},{"Title":"The conspiracy; a novel","review":"It's inevitable for people to compare John Hersey's The Conspiracy to Thornton Wilder's Ides of March or Robert Graves' I, Claudius and Claudius the God. The comparisons are apt: all three authors used their extensive knowledge of Roman history to write glosses on their own times. But Hersey differs from the other two in presenting a far darker tale of the cynical and corrupt use of power and the paranoid behavior engendered in those who exercise it. Taking as his setting the creation and suppression of the Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in 64-65 BC, Hersey provides a devastating commentary of the Nixon presidency and its response to the Watergate crisis.Hersey's epislatory novel is told primarily through the exchange of memoranda between Tigellinus, co-Prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and various others, mainly Paenus, tribune of the secret police. These memoranda often include intercepted letters, especially those between the Stoic philosopher Seneca and his nephew, the poet Lucan. This technique allows Hersey to extend the number of voices in the first person and to provide insight into both sides of the conspiracy.Hersey is a first-rate historian as well as novelist. Many of the novel's letters are based on the writings of his characters and the events recorded are generally accurate. His primary sources are Tacitus' Annals and Suetonius' Life of Nero. Seneca's words often are quoted from his Moral Epistles, as are parts of Lucan's Pharsalia.Through the exchanges between Seneca and Lucan Hersey explores the demands of artistic expression and individual courage under tyranny, while those between Tigellinus and Paenus probe the nature of the corrupting influence of unbridled power. Reading this novel makes one wonder what dialogues between Robert Haldeman and Chuck Colson might have been like, as well as those between Sam Ervin and Ben Bradlee."},{"Title":"The conspiracy; a novel","review":"in fictional form. This book is a thinly-disguised description of the Nixon presidency **preceding, and anticipating!** Watergate's paranoia."},{"Title":"Living Large - Now!: Enjoying a Juicy Life Every Day!","review":"If you're looking for another self-help book, Living Large Now is not your thing. But if you live a life filled with errands, obligations, and tedium and sense that you are missing something BIGGER, more FUN, more EXCITING, more FULFILLING in life... this book is for you!I was amazed that such a simple, little book could reach to the depths of my soul and into my deepest thoughts. Although I have many acquaintances, I had to ask - do I really have friends I can count on? Where is the &quot;village&quot;, the support group of wonderful women who will pick up my kid, bring me dinner when I am ill or after my baby is born, and who knows when to take command to care for ME? I seem to do a lot for others, but I couldn't say they felt they could \\"count\\" on me anymore than I could \\"count\\" on them. We were simply too distant for that. We hadn't spoken words that sealed our relationship as good friends. Although I knew many women, we still danced the I-barely-know-you two-step of superficial greetings and smiles.As women in the 20th and 21st century, we have lost that community in so many ways. This book is about recreating the community that provides essential &quot;vitamins&quot; to women, the way our testosterone-driven society (think: war, sports, government, male leadership at the highest levels, glass ceilings, higher pay for men, more importance given to men's words, etc., etc., etc.) feeds men. Before the rise of suburbia and the isolation (even in apartment buildings) among neighbors, women came together to enjoy each other's company, care for each other, celebrate their lives, beauty, etc. This book gives us concrete ways to re-establish a way to find great women to hang out with and fun things to do on Saturday night when you were just going to sit home in front of the tube or do the laundry.More importantly, this book reminds us WHY we need to seek each other out, hang out, have a blast, and return fulfilled and joyful into our work the next day. The book even offers great ways to break of our self-inflicted molds in business, such as volunteering so we can find strengths we never knew we had - and translate them into a better job or career later on!I loved this book. It was funny. It was filled with little stories about STARR'S life. And, while I was laughing and speeding through the book, I learned more about finding &quot;Angels&quot; in my daily life, growing beyond who I have let myself become, and living a LARGER LIFE than the one I thought was mine. In short, it made my life much better in a matter of minutes! I recommend Living Large Now as a wonderful gift to all women who deserve to live a JUICIER LIFE! Give to all your friends and form an &quot;Angel Brigade&quot; of your own! (You gotta read the book to find out what I mean!)"},{"Title":"Living Large - Now!: Enjoying a Juicy Life Every Day!","review":"Liked this book, it really points out the issues that women face.

I always rate recipes from 1-5, and anything below a 4 never gets cooked again. I have now worked my way through about 17 recipes from the Diva Cookbook, and remarkably they are all 5's--when most cookbooks fall into the 3 star rating of recipes.

Most of the recipes use more than 3 or 4 ingredients, so you do get some complex flavors to improve your cooking skills.

It takes you from the heartland of Wisconsin to places (literally) out of this world.

She's guided by an old Indian medicine man who also has amazing magical powers. Synandra's a truly magical person in a magical world, and is now one of my favorite literary characters.

As I got into the book, I was fascinated with all the little details Hampel put in to let the reader know that this was an alternate timeline story; the cereal industry is centered in Chicago rather than Battle Creek, Michigan; L'Oreal as snack food giants instead of Hostess and Kelloggs. The \\"sound-pacs\\" are obviously supposed to be Walkman radios (Capt Jimmy used the time machine to go steal the idea from the future, and then make millions manufacturing them in the mid-1960s). Capt Jimmy also founds the Church of the Electronic Trinity, which turned up morphing into an earlier version of the Church of Scientology (with Capt Jimmy being a kind of alternative L. Ron Hubbard).But the most thought-provoking section of the book is when Synandra and Basil are using the machine and it pops them into the mirror scene of Citizen Kane, and the Orson Wells character \\"sees\\" than, although they have fully matrialized yet, and reaches in and adjusts one of the knobs on the machine and they pop into his reality. And they're in a real place, not a scene of a movie.I think one of Hampel's best ideas in the book is hinted at here. That there is more to the concept of reality than we currently think.And the humor is just fantastic! I just can't say enough."},{"Title":"The Portable petswelcome.com: The Complete Guide to Traveling with Your Pet","review":"I bought this book and \\"Pets on the Go\\" both at Amazon.com. First I visited petswelcome.com's web site and thoroughly checked it out, looking for completeness by checking their site for motels/hotels that I know accept pets. Some places that I knew of were missing in popular tourist sites where people bring pets. I found their website very large (almost too large) for efficient surfing and for fast note taking/printing out. So I bought the book instead. Well, the book writing is \\"cutsy\\" to the point of being corny. That aside, comparing it with \\"PETS ON THE GO\\" (which I also bought), \\"PETS ON THE GO\\" wins hands down. The latter has more organization, more entries, more detail in the entries, and more current information. For example, checking \\"Lone Pine, CA\\" (a popular tourist town for Mt. Whitney climbers), one finds only one scant entry in \\"Petswelcome.com\\", whereas in \\"PETS ON THE GO\\" there are four entries, plus \\"PETS ON THE GO\\" gives you the motels' URL's! \\"PETSWELCOME.COM\\" does not give the URL's. (Go figure----they're a dotcom company!). Libby Montana has no listings in \\"PETS WELCOME.COM\\" whereas \\"PETS ON THE GO\\" has four. This happens over and over. \\"PETS ON THE GO\\" is twice as fat as the other book and it is organized alphabetically by State, City (in boldface). \\"PETSWELCOME.COM\\" was frustrating for me for fast, efficient use because the first boldface entry is not the city (rather the motel---which is not alphabetized!) and you have to squint to find the city in the listings. A pain! Of the two books I would get \\"PETS ON THE GO\\" (I rated it 5 stars for fast and thorough, complete information). I would be tempted to throw the other out the car window! One just gets the feeling of dotcom generic phoniness when reading \\"PETSWELCOME.COM\\". I feel like this book is like a maze-designed building with every other brick missing.

I finished A Tree on Turtle Island almost three weeks ago, yet the characters remain with me. Seclearr's writing style is so unforced and smooth and not contrived that she can easily weave her very disparate story threads together into a beautiful fabric. The fabric renders the threads and characters inherently linked, and I think this in turn allows the reader to engage with the characters and develop an immediate empathy with them. I have thought about Maggie and Swataney and Quinn and Reed almost every day and wonder what will happen next. The turtle totem is powerful and palpable, and ties the characters together and to the reader. Excellent story."},{"Title":"A Tree on Turtle Island","review":"I loved this book. What I really found most intriguing was the historical story. I am a historical fiction reader and I have never read anything about Pennsylvania in historical fiction. Maggie's story was facinating and the historical perspective of the Native American struggle in Pennsylvania was enlightening. But the author was able to bridge the present with the past. In doing so she tells a current story which is all about walking your own path and discovering both weaknesses and strengths within yourself. The author shows a real insight and depth of understanding about the human condition and the human spirit. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"A Tree on Turtle Island","review":"As I entered the Story of Quinn and Reed and Maggie, the main characters in Seclearr's novel, I was immediately thrown back to another story which served to shape and guide my journey in life--as spiritual seeker and psychotherapist--From Bernard Nietschmann quoted in Askwasakne Notes probably 20 years ago, telling a Miskito Indian Story.It goes like this: After delivering a lecture on the solar system, philosopher--psychologist William James was approached by an elderly lady who claimed she had a theory superior to the one described by him.\\"We don't live on a ball rotating around the sun,\\" she said. \\"We live on a crust of earth on the back of a giant turtle.\\"Not wishing to demolish this absurd argument with the massive scientific evidence at his command, James decided to dissuage his opponent gently. \\"If your theory is correct, madam, what does this turtle stand on?\\"\\"You're a very clever man, Mr. James, and that's a good question, but I can answer that. The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger turtle.\\"\\"But that does this second turtle stand on?\\" James asked patiently.The old lady crowed triumphantly, \\"It's no use, Mr. James--it's turtles all the way down.\\"Ms. Seclearr has given us the gift of this story told through timeless eyes across history and culture. A Tree on Turtle Island powerfully, yet gently, takes the reader into web of life where we discover we are all connected here on Turtle Island. One is introduced to a new way of experiencing connection and history through the adventures of Reed and Quinn, two women in search of themselves who ultimately find that and more--that the yearning to be one's self is timeless and universal. They may differ in time and circumstance to Maggie and her family, but their struggle rings true to Maggie's journey to find herself and be true to that self, and to make peace with herself. Seclearr has created engaging and complex characters who surprise and delight with their fullness and humanity. She has undertaken the challenge to weave together several disparate cultures and themes--early Native American--Colonist, Morovian history, modern day America, issues of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community, without seeming forced or contrived. This is an engaging and moving read as much for the story as for the characters for whom for this reviewer became a co-companion on the journey. Whether traveling with Maggie in the mid-1700's or traveling with Quinn and Reed today, A Tree On Turtle Island, traveled into my heart and psyche and took root. 2002by Moonhawk River Stone"},{"Title":"A Tree on Turtle Island","review":"&quot;A Tree on Turtle Island&quot; is an artful telling of a monumental vision. Many of today's great thinkers have been calling for new stories to be written to help our culture understand the way of peace. Yet, the path of peace is far more than understanding geopolitics or history. It also involves simultaneous journeys inward, into our own personalities, and outward into the diversity of our complex world. Seclearr weaves a beautifully detailed tapestry in &quot;A Tree on Turtle Island.&quot; She examines an amazing epoch of American history and links the inner journeys of both ordinary people and gifted peacemakers, telling the stories of real people in both historic and contemporary America.This book is a challenging and wholly worthwhile jouney, a guided meditation on peace."},{"Title":"A Tree on Turtle Island","review":"Seclearr weaves the healing journeys of several individuals into a tapestry that reveals a path to peace. Whereas Coehlo's classic &quot;The Alchemist&quot; works magic on the personal journey of discovery, &quot;A Tree on Turtle Island&quot; provides insights that also apply to neighborhoods and nations.A deep understanding of history could help humans avoid repeating the cycles of violence, victimization, hatred and revenge which plague our world. We need stories such as &quot;A Tree on Turtle Island&quot; to guide us as we attempt, on the personal, political and cultural level, to create more relationships of partnership rather than domination. This book is a remarkable achievement towards that goal."},{"Title":"All color book of cats","review":"This book, THE ALL COLOR BOOK OF CATS, by Elizabeth Towe and Christine Metcalf, has 101 colour pictures of cats, in every pose imaginable. Theh accompanying text describes the various breeds, and lengends of cats. Chapter-Essays accompanying the pictures and captions are\\": \\"The Nature of Cats\\", \\"Pedigrees\\", \\"Living With A Cat\\", \\"Orientals\\", \\"Big Cats\\", \\"Showing\\", and \\"Cats Alone\\". An \\"Acknowledgements\\" page follows at the end of the book, giving the origins of the wonderful cat-pictures inside.And wonderful they are! Like the best pictures of human beings, these pictures of cats are not only beautifully taken, but also, somehow, show the inner-mind of each cat -- at least at the moment when the picture was taken!Some groups of humans -- Amish people and Orthodox Jews are those that come immediately to mind -- do NOT like to have their photograph taken.They feel that a photo can, in some way, capture a person's soul. When necessary to have a photo taken, (say for a group-family picture), they will politely turn their head, so that only a profile or three-quarter view is seen. When a full-face photo is unavoidable, (say for a passport, ID or Driver's Licence), they will make a sour face, or in some other way try to hide their identity. One might think this a quaint custom -- but looking at these cat photos, one cannot be too sure. The MOOD and TEMPERAMENT of each cat herein is effectively shown in just about every picture -- from the cat on the front cover, who seems intent on trying to understand what the unseen photographer is thinking abd/or to get the photographer, (and any other human around), to agree with the cat being photographed, to a tired-looking cat, (with a kitten), on page 25, to a \\"student cat\\", or at least one that seems intent on learning something new, on page 38, to an open-mouthed, almost snarling \\"this is my territory and don't you dare come into it\\", leopard, on page 49, to a cat who looks almost as if he/she had just been chastized, on page page 57, to a picture of a Rex Cat who almost looks like it is a piece of taxidermists' work, to a worried and scared little kitten on page 68, to a truly queenly-looking Siamese cat on the back cover, the cats in this book ALL have definte personalities -- which all show quite nicely! Are their souls captured in these photos? I don't know -- but their moods of the moment sure are!This book is printed on very good paper, and the print size, though smallish, is dark and clear. It is a perfect present for any cat-fancier you know -- and anyone you wish to make into a cat-fancier, too!"},{"Title":"All color book of cats","review":"The \\"All Color Book of Cats\\" by Elizabeth Towe and Christine Metcalf is a collection of 100 illustrations in color. The poses are the type one would pose for the old tin type pictures. They sit there calmly looking out into space with that regal superior look. Most of the background is flowers and trees. Some of the little cuties turn out to be leopards.The collection is well worth the price and makes a good coffee table book."},{"Title":"A Father for All Seasons","review":"Bob Welch has done an excellent job of describing in story form the journeys of men, boys, and fatherhood. One paragraph has you laughing, the next can have you in tears. As you remember your childhood growing up, Bob also reminds you what is like to be a father and to watch your children break away and gain their freedom. This is a must-read book for anyone who is serious about being a Dad. Also nicely done is his easy-going witness of his Christian faith. You will not be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"A Father for All Seasons","review":"I read this book in one sitting -- I couldn't put it down! Using the analogy of the changing seasons, Welch takes us through a journey of parenting that is insightful and meaningful for both men AND women. Through his remarkable ability to place the reader smack dab in the middle of the story, he weaves a tapestry of heartfelt and humorous events and memories drawn from his experiences and \\"seasoned\\" with the recollections of others. From the all too familiar ritual of hanging Christmas lights to the depths of loss and forgiveness, the reader embarks on a journey full of tears and laughter. At the end, we can't help but contemplate our own stories of family and life while anxiously scanning the Internet for more books by this talented and inspiring writer!"},{"Title":"A Father for All Seasons","review":"There are few resources written in &quot;laymen's&quot; terms about that relationship that exists between a father and son. But Bob Welch has changed all that with his book, &quot;A Father for All Seasons.&quot; The book addresses that &quot;in between time&quot; from birth to death. Welch illustrates the stages of the father/son bond using the seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter and a Second Spring. The Second Spring is &quot;... a side of fatherhood you don't find on greeting cards.&quot; (&quot;A Father...&quot; page 218) Welch's book draws back the vail of sacredness in the father/son relationship by using his own life experiences in the role of father and son. His ability to tie into the range of emotion from sorrow to joy in using tragic experiences as well as his gift of humor is masterful. Welch is the &quot;Erma Bombeck&quot; of fathers. The reader will be drawn into the mind of a father and son thus exposing thoughts, feelings, actions and reactions that are part of that bond. Using his skills to create detailed &quot;mind images&quot; Welch helps the reader reach a deeper understanding of that special bond. In the chapter &quot;Firsts,&quot; Welch writes of the first major league game he took his son to. Welch writes, &quot;... sports can bind together a father and son like the lacing of a well-made mitt.&quot; (&quot;A Father...&quot; page 49) This book dares to toss out the stereotypical view of the father/son relationship as being a &quot;guy thing&quot; and ventures into the sustenance of that relationship. If you want to know what that special and sacred attachment is, you will have to read the book. &quot;A Father for All Seasons&quot; is NOT a book for men only! It can be a gift for first time parents, Christmas, birthdays, Fathers' Day, Mothers' Day... by all means Mothers' Day! What better way to show you care then by giving a gift that expands a mother's understanding of the family unit. There is no &quot;right&quot; season to give this book to someone. With Mothers Day and Fathers Day right around the corner... search no further for the &quot;just right&quot; gift. &quot;A Father for All Seasons&quot; is sure to hit the mark."},{"Title":"A Father for All Seasons","review":"Bob Welch's love of family, his warmth and gentle humor and his ability to help us feel relationships and find the meaning of them in our own lives makes him a rare and wonderful writer. I blinked back tears at a father's estrangment from his son one moment and then laughed out loud at the timing of a ten year old's insights the next. As a writer myself of both fiction and non-fiction, I find Bob to be a master weaver: of story and realtionship, of feeling and faith. I bought five copies. They're precious gifts given to the fathers and sons I care about in my life. I hope they'll discover the value of those relationships in this book that encourages and teaches.

Though he focuses on dads and their boys, the lessons are universal. Those lessons (and this book) are for anyone who cares about human relationships. At times it's sad, at times delightfully funny, but always engaging. I will be at the front of the book store line when Welch's next book is published."},{"Title":"A Father for All Seasons","review":"This book is one of those rare pieces that can make you laugh out loud and then the next minute bring you to tears. Welch includes stories from his own somewhat-wacky life told with a seasoned writer's easy, engaging style.

Andrews book: poor girl with some kind of talent is whisk of to a rich family because of something or another. But it is a little more interesting then the Ruby or Melody series. Here's the plot, Dawn goes to a private school with her brother Jimmy because her father works there. She meets Philip Cutler who becomes her boyfriend for a little while and his sister Clara Sue who is jealous of Dawn and wants to make her life miserable. Later in the story Dawn's mom dies, and she finds out that she is related to Philip and Clara Sue! She's is sent back to live with them at the hotel and is treated badly by Grandmother Cutler. The problem with the Dawn characters and all of the latest V.C. Andrews characters is that she is too weak! Why didn't Dawn just beat up Clara Sue? I was waiting and waiting for her to do it but she didn't. The jealous sister thing and the evil grandmother thing is being over done now anyway. I can't beileve what a creep Philip turned out to be, he was so nice in the beginning. I highly recommend reading Dawn it is a very good book although the main character is very weak, even after all of the things she has to go through."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I love this story. When she found out she was really a member of the Cutler family and was kidnapped I was shocked. For a family that supposedly missed her they treated her like a slave girl and her father totally lacked a back bone. And it was so gross how her brother wanted her even though it was incest. It was sad that the people who kidnapped her were better to her than her own family. The story was so unbelievable."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This was the first book of the V.C.

Like Andrews' other books they usually dark sides them, but I think that's what drew me to them even more along with the mysteries, suspense, hoping that the main character survives whom ever is trying to destroy her, etc. Continuing on about &quot;Dawn&quot;, I read the entire series and a year and a half later I am craving to read it again so after &quot;Orphans&quot; comes out I am going to finish that series and read &quot;Dawn&quot; again. I would also like to add for V.C Andrews if she reads this is that I am hoping for her series to be made into audio tapes and/or miniseries eventhough movies rarely do the book justice, it would still be neat to watch my most loved books on screen."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This was a great book!! The characters were developed and believable. Dawn was pushed into such a bizarre situation, and she survived. The book was captivating, and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Intriguing, intriguing and part of it are heartbreaking. The poverty of the Longchamp family is poignantly and well described and it's touching that Dawn and Jimmy have a close bond between them as siblings. Jimmy is rather sweet, despite his quick temper and difficulty dealing with the rich, spoiled kids in their new private school that they are attending only due to their dad getting a maintenence job with the school.Everything changes for the worse when Ormand is arrested and it's revealed that Dawn actually is biologically part of another family...the rich, snobby Cutlers with priggish, spiteful, jealous Clara Sue and phony Philip who tried to charm his way with Dawn and mocked poor Jimmy behind his back while smiling to his face. The couple who all themselves Dawn's \\"parents\\" are really not parents at all in the way Sally Jean and Ormand Longchamp were...Laura Sue is another phony who spends her time upstairs pretending to be sick whenever anyone brings up anything she doesn't want to hear (I laughed and mentally imagined the \\"medicines\\" she was claiming to be on were actually jelly beans or milk duds) and irresponsible dependent Randolph Cutler who repeatedly makes excuses for the others' shabby treatment of Dawn. Randolph especially makes excuses for his lousy mother, Lillian Cutler, the biggest snob of all. Lillian, who calls herself Dawn's grandmother, treats Dawn with open contempt and gives Dawn one of the worst jobs in \\"her\\" hotel as chambermaid while she gives Clara Sue and Philip cleaner jobs.Jimmy, who has his load of problems in the foster home he's sent to, runs away and finds where Dawn is and offers his shoulder to lean on, despite the fact that he was abused in the foster home and is dealing with his own trauma from that as well as still grieving for his lost mother, whom he loved very much.I really liked Jimmy because even though he tried to hide his vulnerability under a mask of fiery bravado and his fiesty temper, he really was soft and sensitive inside and it's clearly seen when he weeps over Sally Jean's tragic death, then cries over being seperated from Dawn. I was sooo glad when I read that later on, Jimmy gets in a better foster home.Dawn later finds out why the grandmother is such a heel and why she seems to resent Dawn from an unexpected source. Dawn confronts her grandmother with it; that part was great since then her grandmother was confronted with her wrongdoings and had no choice but to send Dawn to the school of her dreams...learning about music, Dawn's lifelong passion.Dawn finds out more about Laura Sue and Randolph in this spellbinding story and also finds out what the entire story is behind the terrible accusations against Ormand and Sally Jean Longchamp. It's a story of heartbreak, cheers, and many revelations and surprises."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This was the first V.C. Andrews book that I read when I was a teenager. At the time, I liked the book a lot, but after reading the other series features to V.C. Andrews, I realized that it follows the same story ideas as the others. Beautiful, thin, blond teenager is taken away from their rich family before their born or as an infant and find themselves living their early years in poverty. As a teenager something happens and suddenly their life is changes forever. Even more the same, there's almost always some for of incest occurring in the book whether by choice or not."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I keep wondering why in the world V.C. Andrews books are so popular, and I keep wondering why I buy them, and then I finish one and realize they are such campy trash and I love them.\\"Dawn\\" is no exception. Even though this was one of the books ghostwritten after Andrews' death, it follows the same basic elements of any classic Andrews novel: Innocent fair-haired protagonist, rags to riches story, incredibly talented and attractive youths, evil old woman, and a whole lotta incest. Like, a LOT of incest. Incest that doesn't start out as incest, and love that then turns into incest after the plot twist...INCEST.The story starts with the titular fair-haired innocent, Dawn, on the move with her poor family (Momma, Daddy, brother Jimmy, and new baby sister Fern) to a new apartment. After Daddy gets a maintenance job at the prestigious Emerson Peabody school in Virginia, Dawn and Jimmy get to go to school for free, and they are thrust into a posh private school world that they've never experienced before. I love how recklessly evil the principal, Ms. Turnbell, and the students are to the Longchamp kids. Andrews makes such ridiculous situations- like why is everyone just needlessly evil? It's funny but it tends to make me facepalm a little. Dawn meets the handsome and charming Phillip Cutler, whose rich family own the Cutler Cove resort in town, and his bitchy sister Clara Sue, who wants to make Dawn's life miserable. Dawn and Phillip embark in innocent teenage romance, or in Andrews terms, attempted assault of a young woman masquerading as flirty teasing. Good stuff, keeping it classy. Phillip is a total jerk and lies about his experience with other girls, but Dawn is smitten.So then the twist comes forth- Dawn's mother dies from sickness and her father is arrested at the hospital for kidnapping Dawn from her rightful family, the Cutlers, when she was an infant. So Phillip and evil Clara Sue are really Dawn's siblings, and she is taken from Jimmy and Fern and forced to live with the Cutlers in their fancy hotel. She is treated like a shameful secret by Grandmother Cutler, a treacherous old biddie who runs a pretty tight ship. Dawn's new family sucks- along with the evil grandma, her father is a flake and her mother is a simpering fool who barely gets out of bed. But that's not all- Dawn discovers what really happened and why she was really \\"kidnapped\\", and she has to work to outsmart this powerful new family and get back her old family.There are so many flaws in this book it is ridiculous. I think Andrews took some liberties with the foster care system. I don't think they just throw the kid into a new home like hey, here's your new family. I really need to stop fact-checking these books; its really just beating a dead horse. Also, why would Dawn's parents take her back to Virginia and have her go to school with the Cutler kids if they freaking kidnapped her from that family? Daddy even knew Dawn was going on a date with Phillip! Like, come on! Best kept secrets, people! You're not doing this right!This wasn't a terrible book- it certainly wasn't boring. A lot happened in one 400-page paperback and I read it pretty fast. But it is a middle-school level read with a lot of Andrews' weird personal fetishes sprinkled around, and the characters are two-dimensional at best and cartoonish at worst. I don't know why I keep going back to V.C. Andrews- probably some Freudian thing. My brain cells might be dying as I read her books but I'm always entertained."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"... and I read it after reading the Flowers in the Attic and the Heaven series. I loved both of those series (though they could drag at times). So, of course I should love Dawn and the whole Cutler series, right? Well, I was more than halfway into the book when she was in the attic for some reason and her brother molested her and I had to pause. I had read FITA many times and the molestation/rape scene read so familiarly in Dawn. So I picked up my copy of FITA, flipped thru to the part where the same thing happened with Chris and Cathy and lo and behold IT SOUNDED THE SAME BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME FLIPPIN PARAGRAPH. Word for word.I don't remember if I bothered finishing Dawn, but I do remember finding out that V.C. Andrews wasn't the one who'd written Dawn, that she'd died after the Heaven series.

I couldn't fall in love with my brother like that ever. This book would be ok if you've never read the Heaven series or the Flowers in the Attic series.Sadly this series gets worse. I picked up the whole lot of them on Ebay, and by the fourth book, I just put it down halfway through. The fourth book of the Dawn series is literally a copy cat of the fourth one in the Casteel series.I agree with others, Dawn is conceited, whiny and just plain stupid. The only part I liked in this one was when she was sent to the Meadows. That to me was halfway original. And it just sounded interesting to live without power or running water. As everything was said in this book, I kept finding myself saying \\"What's so bad about that?? Get over it and grow up!!\\"Now, the book Heaven. That's a good read.

At times I could guess what was going to happen next but there were still a lot of surprises.What I did not like about this book were the likenesses it had to other books by V.C. Andrews. In this series there is a wicked, stern, tight-lipped grandmother, incestual relationships implied as well as made into reality. Must we repeat \\"Flowers\\"? Surely V.C. Andrews had other ideas for plots for her books. Let's branch out! I ended up just skimming past those parts in the book.Aside from the sexual encounters, I thought this book to be a pretty good read. It kept me going with it's hints of deceit because I wanted to find out the truth as well."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I loved this book. I love Dawn's character (more that Heaven from the Casteel series), and the way she strives for what she deserves and needs.In this book Dawn dreams of having everything she needs to reach her dream of being a great singer and for her and her family to finally settle down in one place. Then finally her father lands a job as a janitor in a private school, and things start to look up with her singing career, plus a new love interest (Philip). But after her mom has the baby (Fern) she becomes sick, and ends up passing away. Then they reveal that Dawn will actually be taken to a different household and shouldn't have even been with this family in the first place. (read the book to find out why) But when Dawn comes to her new home she realizes that she wasn't really even wanted back. Soon everything is once again against.

Come to find out she was sold by the rich Cutler family that owns a beautiful hotel. Jimmy, whom she thought was her brother, ends up falling deeply in love with Dawn even though they had grown up as brother and sister. This book was one of my favorites because of all the twist. I have read over 30 other VC Andrews books and I see a lot of simularities. There's always a beautiful girl that has a talent that goes from rags to richs, to some preppy rich school and there is always an evil person. Usually a rape or incest is also involved. A lot of times the main character dies and continues on with the main characters daughter. Despite these simularities, I think that each story is very good. Right now I'm on the series \\"Rain\\" which is a little different from the rest. It's actually about a black girl that was raised in the projects and her sister gets murdered by gang members. I think the ghost writter is doing a great job."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have been a fan of V.C. Andrews novels since I was eleven, I am now 19, and Dawn was the fifth book of hers that I read. I enjoyed the characters immensely and the story-line was fantastic. While I wished that Dawn were a little stronger of character, in the end it really doesn't matter because justice is served. Every good book has to have the perfect blend of sexuality, mystery, and excitement to hook a reader and this book definitely has them all. I would recommend this book to most anyone, but especially to someone who feels that there is more to life than meets the eye."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"The reason I think it could be better is simple--if you were in the same situation as Dawn, when her brother raped her, you would more than likely feel very insecure and embarassed about that. Dawn, on the other hand, seemed to forget about that situation until Phillip showed up in her bedroom. Otherwise, the book was great, and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Having not read V.C. Andrew's books for over four years, I decided to pick up Dawn at a used books store--for the heck of it. I wanted to see why I liked it so much during middle school. I now know why I stopped reading her books. It's soo mind warping! Although the stories are interesting, they're disgusting and fake. Dawn makes incestuous thoughts, sex at 15, and perverted touching okay...that's just messed up. I think I liked it more during middle school because of my curiosity with the opposite sex and my naiveness of great novels. Since I'm more matured, the books now appall me. I was going to give Dawn 1 star, however the plot was interesting and I've read worse. Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend the book, unless you have nothing else to read, and if you do read it be prepared to have your morals and values questioned."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I admit I liked this book a lot when I was in my early teens, because of its suspenseful plot and its many sexual scenes. Fortunately, real life has never been like this for anyone. This book is about rape, incest, cruelty, betrayal, stupidity, and a host of other topics I would rather not even think about, much less read about. The main character is so stupid, it's hard to sympathize with her very much, and none of the other characters are worth two cents either. All of them are flat stereotypes. Be careful; this stuff will burn up your mind if you let it. But at least now I know how to identify truly horrid literature! This book has served a purpose after all."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I am not trying to offend anyone here, but by far Dawn is only appealing to people that have never really read a good book in their lives. On whole it was extremly stupid. People just do not fall in love with their 'supoposed' sibblings. As well as the fact that Dawn herself was extremly weak, petti and annoying. I.E. ''I filled out my sweater better!!!'' &quot;Was it a crime to like my blonde hair and blue eyes?'' Their was a point in the novel were Dawn not only thought herself half bad looking or immaculate beyond human belief, she unfortunatley also believed that no one was a smidge on her. Comments such as: &quot;She had dull brown eyes&quot; Managed to achieve nothing but offend. As far as I and another of my friends are concerned Dawn was a weak, vain, dull looking little priss who's life was meaningless.. And on whole the characters were unrealistic, hollow and simply, I am afraid to say the whole book was an utter shock after reading stories that ent! ertained readers beyond belief. This includes the Dollanganger and Casteel previous to this book. Now that was what you call writing...Dawn, a no hopers tale."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn was a weak and woefull tale of a vain and prissy little bimbo. I.E. ''I filled my sweater better!!'' ''Was it a crime to like my blonde hair and blue eyes?'' This vainess posessed by Dawn was beyond like. It was to the point were she was willing to cut off her stupid hair and frame it for every one in the world to see.The plot was stupid because it concentrated too much around one particular thing. One highly unrealistic and pethetic thing I might add. Other characters in the novel were far to obsessed with the leading lady (The inspirational Dawn) this included people that really shouldn't have been, as well as people that were highly unrealistic in every way.This book is very, very annoying..Short and sweet. Dawn the story of a worthless try hard and her try hard friends and family.You really stuffed up V.C. Andrews."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"All right, if I'd had my way, there would be no star above. This was a waste of my time, energy and the dollar fifty I paid for it. In fact, if I had gotten it for free, it still would have been a waste. Dawn is nothing more than a pretentious journey through some hicks pretentious life, her incestuous brother and her general stupidity (ie: blonde hair). Really, if you like wasting your time, your money, your energy . . . and your life, read this. Otherwise, burn it."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I was instantly hooked on this book from the very start. I also like the way that VC Andrews portrays her characters. I think Dawn would have been better off staying with the Longchamps at first. I will like to see what happens to Dawn in future novels in the Cutler series. I hated the way that the Grandma treated Dawn using her as a slave basically. I also didn't like what Phillip did to her and also the way Clara Sue treated her. So now comes Secrets of the Morning to read and see what that is like."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I had only read a page of the story Dawn and it caught my ayyention in a snap, we had a 3 day weekend from schooling and i asked her if i can borrow the book for the time we were gone.finally she said yes and right at that i started to read it.i couldnt stop reading, it was like a curse i actually stayed up till 2:00am reading the book.the only way i could stop was my mom or hiding it from myself. i know i might sound a little crazy but i really like this book.thats how i found this website because i was looking for the rest of the books. i cant wait to see what happens with dawn,jimmy,philip,clara,grandmother cutler,mom,dad and all the rest.even though she may be a little unlucky i must say she is kinda lucky for atleast one a love to care for her.im glad i got to speak on this book it really gave me some hinta about life.now if you excuse me i need to see where i can buy the other books. ^_^ ~julie~"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This is almost as good as Flowers in the attic! I love this book, I HAVE to get the other novels! I Recomend this book to any person who likes to read thrillers!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"this is the ghost writer's first series by himself. An interesting tale, but not as good as the Dollanganger series, or his latest work. But still really good"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This story was a good beginning about how some people can take their hurt on innocent people. For instance, Lillian \\"Grandmother\\" Cutler framed Ormand and Sally Jean Longchamp for kidnapping Dawn. I presume Lillian thought people should suffer because she thought there was nobody she could turn to when she was a child. Laura Sue was truly a coward for not standing up for Dawn when Lillian degraded her (D). Clara Sue was horrible by making trouble for Dawn and Jimmy at Emerson Peabody. What was more is Clara Sue framed her for taking a necklace. To top it all off she had Jimmy turned to the police after she promised to give him a safe haven. I was glad when Sissy, Dawn's co-worker, came around to befriend her. Sissy even pointed out where to find Mrs. Lila Dalton who was Dawn's nurse. Mrs. Dalton helped Dawn a lot to tell what she knew."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I enjoy V.C. Andrews stories. This is a good book, had me flipping through pages. The story kind of reminded me of Heaven with the suspense of who was sleeping with who, and &quot;oh my god...no it can't be,&quot; type feelings."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"in my honest opinion, dawn is the best book i have ever read. and i still can't find a book to top it. i don't think i ever will. this was the first book i had ever read of v.c. andrews and that was a year ago. jimmy is just amazing and unbelievable. this book is sad at times, but i highly reccomend that you read this whole series. i just love v.c. andrews!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"this is such a good book!

The secret about Dawn is kinda obvious but there were some surprises throughout the story. In my opinion the story went rather quickly. I am looking forward to reading the sequel A.S.A.P"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I like Dawn, it was one of the best book of the Culter serie and also one of the best serie of the Ghost Writer who took the place to write VC Andrews books after her death. Dawn can get on your nerves sometime, I find her a bit too weak but after she become more strong. It was a good reading and a page turner. It's maybe du d&eacute;jas-vu but it's not bad. Yeah the characters are kind of black or white no in between, if one character is good he stay good and if one is bad he stay bad. I like the atmosphere in this book, the characters were good even if they were black and white. It's a good novel I think!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I used to read VC Andrews back when I was in my teens. I have never forgotten the magic of Flowers in the Attic. The Cutler series has been on my book shelf for years needless to say, and finally I've decided to pick it up. And so far I'm pleased that I did!Dawn is the first in the 5 book series and a decent start. The story is a little slow at first, but picks up quickly towards the middle and end with many shocking secrets revealed. As we meet Dawn she's a 14 year old from a poor family who due to a new job her dad received now has the opportunity to go to a private school. This foreshadows what her life is about to turn into down the road and is kind of a transitional phase between her poor life full of struggles to her new life full of opportunity and the unknown. You won't be able to guess where her life takes her...I would of course recommend this book more to teens than to adults, even though I am an adult who did enjoy this guilty pleasure and easy read. VC Andrews is famous for writing detailed stories that pull you into her web and this series appears it's no different, I'm already half way through the next book Secrets of the Morning."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"To say that VC Andrews has become formulaic would be a major understatement. A ridiculously gorgeous 12-14 year old girl with \\"flaxen blond hair\\" and \\"cerulean blue eyes\\" has her life radically altered when she discovers she's a member of a wealthy socialite Virginian family. However the family is more psychotic than-well no other family in the history of literature is even on the same level of insanity that exists in VC Andrews. The psycho family delights in tormenting the heroine whom ends up sleeping with her older teenage brother.\`Dawn' is no exception. Here the formula is applied to Dawn Longchamp. The Longchamps are dirt poor Virginians. Poor, but pleasant and as happy as poor family can be. A series of unfortunate events tare the family apart and Dawn is sent to live with her \\"real\\" family she never knew existed, the Cutlers whom make Dawn's life a living hell. Though nothing as extreme as being tortured in an attic, Dawn mostly endures humiliations.A very obvious rehash of \`Flowers in the Attic'. In fact there's even a psycho grandmother and an attic. Dawn is also locked in one room of their giant mansion. Grandmother Cutler also wishes to erase the mere existence and memory of Dawn's previous family.As for the only reason you read VC Andrews, the incest, there's plenty of it. Yes you won't be bored with \`Dawn'. Her brothers aren't. The twist here is, who is Dawn's true soul mate? Jimmy, the brother she grew up with? Or her biological brother Philip?I was able to forgive the fact that \`Dawn' is VERY obviously a rehash of \`Flowers in the Attic.' It doesn't even pretend to be anything else. With a heavy amount of incest it gives the audience what it wants. I can't blame VC Andrew's ghostwriter for using what works.My only and big objection to \`Dawn' is that it is VERY predictable. By page 150 I had accurately predicted the rest of the book. I was bored with waiting for the characters to catch up.If we're not going to attempt a suspenseful plot then why slow down the book with one? A lot of time and space is wasted. Just cut to the chase. Or in this case the incest."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"$11.99 for a digital copy of a book first published around 1990 is ridiculous! Are they only handing out so many copies of this book for the Kindle? This is just another example of publishers being greedy, and preying on people's sense of nostalgia! To anyone out there thinking about buying this book for your Kindle, I say don't! Buy it used,then the publisher doesn't get a single penny."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I have read all of the Dollanganger (Flowers in the Attic) books, and those are, hands down, the best series/books that are actually written by VC Andrews herself. I read reviews about Dawn, and was hesitant to read it because I know it is by the ghostwriter. When I first started reading the book, I was turned off by characters/setting sounding too similar to previous, original VC Andrews books. The character, Dawn, was too much like Cathy and Heaven from previous series.This book grew on me, but I was still very turned off when I would read a line of description that was almost word for word from previous books. For example, of course, Dawn's incestuous brother has \\"flaxen blond hair and cerulean blue eyes\\"... and the grandma has \\"icy\\" or \\"gray steel eyes\\" and hair that is pulled so tightly... these are all exact rip-offs from Flowers in the attic. How could a writer, even if he is writing under someone else's name, not have been more creative than that?? Then, the characters in general are mostly the same as other characters in previous books. There is a harsh, mean grandmother, an air-headed, self absorbed young mother, incestuous brothers (all Flowers in the Attic), a rotten conniving \\"replacement\\" sister (My Sweet Audrina) and Dawn's poor family (Heaven).Even a lot of the plot takes from other Andrews books. The kids being at a rich private school is from Petals on the Wind where Carrie goes to one similar and similar things happen to her. Also, the \\"brother\\" Jimmy and her sister Fern being separated from her and sent away to other homes is just like what happens in Heaven, with those children. Also, in Dawn, she ends up going to New York to pursue her dreams of becoming a singer, exactly how Cathy goes to NY to become a dancer...some of the similarities are a shame. I could go on and on.I will admit that I thought the story was overall interesting and I read the book easily in two days. I might continue with the rest of this family series, but I wish this ghostwriter had more fresh ideas and didn't rip-off other successful, magical VC Andrews originals."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"As all of V.C. Andrews books reveal...there are many twists and turns along the way of life. Dawn, a girl who finds herself torn between what she once thought as truth, and what she now knows as truth, is shown that life isn't always what you believe it to be. There is a slow start to this book, which makes one sort of believe that nothing too bad will happen. However, when it comes to it, we learn there are many secrets in the Cutler family, and Dawn is just one of them. To write much more would spoil everything entirely. I would personally recommend this book to a teenage girl trying to discover who she really is. Also, I would recommend this book, and the entire series to anyone willing to get a taste of what lies and deceit are in a family."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This book could have been better. There are some mistakes, of which I will name one. When the Longchamp family is seperated, its about a year after the book started. Dawn was fourteen in April, having a May birth, when Momma told gave birht to Fern. A month later, she is fifteen. Then the following April, Momma dies, and in June the family is seperated. That would make Dawn sixteen, which is appropiate considering she is sixteen at the beginning of Secrets of the Morning. Fern, though is a year old, and yet she can say things like \\"Dawn, up\\" All 12 month old kids I heard of cannot say that. It requires a superior verbosity than a one year old has. I think Fern should have been two. If you look at the preview in Web of Dreams, it states that Dawn is twelve and Jimmy is fourteen. Why did they change their ages?"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Let me first say that I'm not one of those people who hate the ghostwriter who wrote this book, as so many other Andrews fans are. As a matter of fact, although I prefer the books Andrews wrote herself, I've enjoyed a lot of the books Niederman wrote under her name.I've read them all and been entertained by them all, even this one. When I first read it I was in 9th grade. I read it right after it came out and I remember being capitvated by it on the bus ride home. Then, of course I reread it (that's what teenagers do with Andrews' books).However, this was one of the most insipid that he wrote, which is not to say that you shouldn't read it, just that its stupidity will anger you. Actually, it was the first of the new series that he created-supposedly \\"inspired\\" as the disclaimer says, by \\"incomplete stories\\" V.C. had somewhere before her death. I don't know about you, but I've always found the vageness of that claim a little convienient. Where are these stories? How many were there? Be specific!Anyway, this story is about a weird Cathy (Flowers in the Attic)/Heaven mix. Bacially, trying to not disappoint fans, Niederman thought a composite of all the heroines Andrews had created would satisfy. (Except Audrina-I don't think Audrina comes up. I love Audrina BTW). But it doesn't work because Dawn doesn't have a developed story/character of her own that's believable, it's like someone just cut and paste from \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", \\"Heaven\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\" to make her story.In some cases, sentences are taken word for word from Flowers in the Attic-for instance, creepily enough, when Dawn is raped by her brother, Niederman uses the exact same sentence to describe it as Andrews had Cathy use to describe HER rape by HER brother! (Something disgusting about \\"my resistant flesh tearing and bleeding\\" ). Niederman thinks that if the same experiences happen to Dawn that did to the other characters, we'll somehow be convinced. But the magic of Andrews was that she invented new demented abuses/relatives for each heroine! Be creative!Like Cathy, Dawn is blonde, has an evil grandmother, has a brother obsessed with her-wait, two brothers obsessed with her-her \\"foster brother\\" and her biological brother. She's in love with the former and attracted to the latter for a time period. Until she knows it's her brother! Unlike Andrews', Niederman does not want to take that crazy step where people KNOW it's their relative-and don't care!!! (Cathy and Chris and Heaven and Troy kept at it despite knowing they were blood related).Like Cathy, she also has religious fanatic relatives.Like Heaven, Dawn is raised by poor white rural people who turn out not to be her biological parents. And I don't remember exactly, but I think Dawn's foster parents took money to raise her from her biological parents, which is reminiscent of when Heaven's father sold the kids, except in reverse, because money was given to poor people to raise a rich child, for stupid reasons that will later be revealed.Dawn's biological mother is a duplicate of \\"Dark Angel's\\" Jillian, Heaven's maternal grandmother, whose shallow obsession with her own beauty makes her a ridiculous character. Like both Dawn and Heaven, Dawn finds out she is actually part of some insanely wealthy family that lives in an enormous estate that has a name. (This is also like Audrina, actually. Do you know anyone whose house has a name? Me neither, and I've met a lot of rich people. But that was always something fun V.C. did that Niederman continues. Very Gone With the Wind).Anyway, as you can tell from all this convoluted nonsense this is a ridiculous book with an undeveloped character. But that's just my opinion!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"The beginning of the Cutler series was great all the way up to Midnight Whispers, however, they start getting repetitive. Like everybody's behavior is the same (drunks, incest, people talking to themselves, someone has a baby with a relative who isn't really a relative).The rest of the Cutler series become predictable. Incidentally, though, V.C. Andrews created masterpieces. Even though I could tell what might happen next, or was perturbed by the behavior of a character, I enjoyed reading the stories.I'm an avid V.C. Andrews reader. I'm glad her relatives have kept up with the style of writing that V.C. Andrews started."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"That was the first novel I read of the V.C. Andrews collection. I remember I had told my friend once how do you read so many books and such long ones in such a short period of time cause I have a problem with reading long books cause they can get boring, but when she told me about the book she had been reading called &quot;Dawn&quot; that she was so into the book that she couldn't put it down it was good. So I decided to check it out for myself so I did and I couldn't put it down neither it was so sad at the begining that it made me cry cause they were very poor and always moving and losing friends, and then it made me feel happy for Dawn and Jimmy that they had maybe found a better life maybe and that Dawn had fallen in love with Phillip and him with her, but then it became sad again when she found out the truth about everything her family, her boyfriend her whole life was just turned all around as if she was never meant to be happy in her life I felt so bad for her even though it was just a book it made me feel something inside it made me feel thankful that I have a good life even though I have problems I am thankful for what I've got.Then I read the rest of the &quot;Dawn&quot; series they were really good books also I really enjoyed reading about Dawn and I think it would make a great movie cause it is very emotional sad, but yet exciting I thought the book was great."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Before there was trash TV, when Jerry Springer was just the mayor of Cincinnati, there were the VC Andrews books. I seem to remember these books being introduced sometime during junior high school, but this was the first one I picked up and read cover to cover.Following the same format as the previous series and the ones to follow, this is the story of a backwoods country gal (in this case named Dawn) struggling with her hillbilly family to be introduced by scholarship fate to a highbrow school and slice of society. Feeling outcast and ashamed of her sharecropper roots, Dawn discovers by a bizarre twist of fate that she is in fact not related to the people she thought were her immediate family and is in fact the long lost daughter of a wealthy, old money family.But wait, there's more!In yet another sickening twist, the most popular girl in school who had asserted herself as her arch nemesis is her sister. And the most popular boy in school, Philip, who she had already had a sticky, awkward encounter in the backseat of his sports car with is actually her brother. *Shudder*But wait, there's STILL more!Dawn is shuttled from her clapboard shack to her new family's spacious estate to meet her real mother (some kind of skittish, over medicated bird in a golden cage) and adjust to her new surroundings. The whole time, the suave popular boy / brother Philip has not been able to put aside his lust for this tasty morsel he just happens to be related to and continues to try to get into her pants. And Dawn herself, now free of the ties that bind, has her love for Jimmy, the boy she thought was her brother until recently, grow into full blown passion.Oy Vay ... It's hard to put down a juicy, trashy story like this for even five minutes. Something like this speaks to a sordid part of us. Like all these books, it has just enough deconstruction of social classes, high school clique mentality, and primative instincts to appeal to everyone. The topic of incest is something so hideous and horrifying, yet we can't stop reading about them because they are just so hideous and horrifying. Perhaps Andrews was trying to tell us something about our society in this. Traditionally we've always thought incest was something that happened among uneducated, backwoods people (like where Dawn came from); but, in recent years, we have learned that these things happen among everyone from the middle class on up and it happens much more often than we think it does (like where Dawn went to). Some are true victims (such as when Philip gives into his wants and finally rapes Dawn), and some are just simply something else (Dawn and Jimmy). It's creepy and twisted, but it happens.Enjoy this book (and all other titles by the same author) for some trashy entertainment. It's not a great literary work as it's aimed for the teen set, but gives us something to think about afterwards."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"yes, it was predictable. but thats why i loved it. i don't like surprises to much in s book unless, of coUrse it was a love surprise... i liked the end and encourage that if you read this book then yo need to read her others."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn was the best of all the v.c andrews books I have read so far.

Although a person can usually predict the outcome of Ms. Andrews novels there is still just enough there to surprise you ever once in awhile.Dawn and her family have always been poor, but because her father has taken a new job at a prep school she finally gets to go to a school that may gives her hope for a future. Dawn soon finds herself infatuated with boy who also attends school with her. His name is Phillip Cutler, and his sister Clara Sue has vowed to make Dawn's life a living hell. Before Clara Sue gets the chance Dawn discovers her true identity shortly after her mother's death, and is thrown into a new family. The head of her new family is a heartless grandmother, her sister is Clara Sue, and her boyfriend Phillip is now her brother. All of these changes have made her life very difficult to bear and left her wishing that Jimmy would come to her rescue.This is an interesting read to say the least, but as I mentioned earlier it is very predictable."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I liked this book, don't get me wrong, but there were a few cliches that continue to irk me. Ghostwriter, what the heck are you thinking; it's like you use some of the same expressions over and over and over again! (i.e. &quot;putaway heart&quot; and &quot;her prune mouth drew up like a drawstring purse&quot;) I lost track of how much he used the latter. Seriously, this guy needs to get some originality...and fast. While Dawn was okay of a character, I felt she was somewhat whiny as well. I personally liked Heaven, Cathy, and Audrina better. At least they had backbones. And some of the characters were pointless. This guy needs a thesaurus and some new ideas."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn was a very interesting book. I thought the plot moved along quickly enough to keep me from getting bored. A girl discovers she was kidnapped, and is taken from her family and put into a new one that is full of deceiption and sin. I have read a lot of V.C. Andrews books, though, and they are all very similar, so there was nothing surprising in this one. The characters are interesting though, sometimes even a little comical because of all the emotional stress they put on themselves. It's a book i would recomend to someone who was bored."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"As one of the first VA novels I read it was interesting to see the simularities to other books, however, it has its own discrete story behind these. The twist is believible and keeps you asking what happens next. But why are families so willing to take back children given away? Perhaps they feel guilty but the stories would hardly happen in the real world. Maybe it needs a touch of reality."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"After learning that this novel is not based on any notes left by the late Virgina C. Andrews but solely is the ghostwriter's novel alone, it makes what came after this series and the Landry series as well, a let down, having seen how badly he has done by recopying what was in the Cutler series into the new Hudson series. But this is a pretty good novel. Will hold your attention from page one until the final end although, like with Darkest Hour, everything seems rushed to a fast conculsion. But otherwise, it's a decent novel."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This is the only VC Andrews book Ive ever read, so I dont know the difference between the ghost writer or the real one. I just know I couldn't put this book down. Sure, it was over the top, sure, there was a disturbing obsession with incest, sure the rape was taken with a grain of salt, but I didnt really care! It was so much fun. There was a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter, thus not allowing you to rest the book at all, and I just enjoyed it immensely. Lotsa, lotsa fun."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"THIS WAS THE FIRST V.C. ANDREWS BOOK I READ. AND NOW I'M HOOKED. I READ EVERY ONE I CAN GET MY HANDS ON. IT HOOKED ME FROM THE VERY BEGINING. I AM STILL TRYING TO FIND A BETTER BOOK."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I could not put this book down..I stayed up until 6 AM one morning reading it!! that's how good it was! I am now reading the sequel,&quot;Secrets Of The Morning&quot; and i think it may even be a little better! this book is a must have!!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"Dawn was one of the best books by vc andrews; it was totally worth reading. Now you don't find too many like this one, I read Dawn when I was 15 and that was five years ago. I have been reading Andrews ever since, the latest one I am reading is Into the Garden. It's good so far but not like her earlier ones as this one!"},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"I was a teenager when \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" was first released and I loved the book so much that I would have read anything that VC Andrews wrote. However, as I've gotten older, my appeal for the VCA books has greatly lessened. Maybe it's because of the \\"ghostwriter\\", maybe it's my own maturity and preference for a different style of writing. The only book from this series that I had previously read was \\"Darkest Hour\\", and I really did like that book - however not enough to pursue the rest of the series. I ran across \\"Dawn\\" at a rummage sale and bought it for 25 cents. Although I did read the entire book, I still wouldn't buy the rest of the series. I guess I just can't get past how someone could lust after their own brother - whether biologically related, or just raised together. It's very wierd. If I found out today that my brother wasn't blood related to me, there's still no way I could think of him as anything but a brother."},{"Title":"Dawn","review":"This book was very good.
