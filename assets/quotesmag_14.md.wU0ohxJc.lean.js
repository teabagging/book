This book is an excellent example of it in use. the book consists of a series of short stories, mostly about American pilots in the Pacific Theater in World War II. The stories are all related to one another but any one of them is also a stand-alone story on its own (in fact, the author notes in the back note that 5 of the stories were previously published independent of one another in magazines). The dust jacket liner notes call it a novel-in-stories.Many are complaining that the stories are disjointed. Yes, that's the intention. It is similar to the difference between a movie about an event and a few snapshots of that same event. The movie is smooth, a series of photographs is disjointed - but each picture can stand on its own.Anyway, Spencer's book consists of 15 vignettes about the lives of two pilots. The first one is about their childhood. It is by far the weakest of the stories. It has the least to do with the war, but it is a decent little story about the Great Depression. The rest of them give us a little taste of the action in the air over the Pacific but also a sense of life back on base and on leave.The book is a breeze to read and quite enjoyable. As a memoir in fiction, one can assume that some of it really happened to Spencer, some of it is based on things he heard about and some of it he just made up. Either way, I enjoyed it.I give this one a grade of A-"},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"I read this book this year. I picked it up because my Grandpa was a B-24 pilot in the war and said it was a good fictionalised account of 'his war'. I started reading and was sucked in.The way he describes dogfights and bomb runs is in great detail. The book is based on two characters, Lieutenants Stevie Larkin and Blake Hurlingame. Both are childhood friends who both join the Army Air Forces during WWII. One is a fighter pilot and the other a bomber pilot. The book bounces between different characters but the stories are intertwined. If you want a well written, tragic WWII novel, \\"The Pilots\\" is a great choice."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"I thought I would enjoy &quot;The Pilots&quot; because I am a fighter pilot myself (albeit of the modern era) and I enjoy first-hand accounts of WWII. The glowing accolades on the back cover from some aviation/military authors seemed to indicate a good read. I was rather disappointed. Although I read the whole thing, and it was mildly entertaining, it was far from what I expected. It was a very amateurish piece of work. The author himself tells us in the forward that he wrote down these &quot;stories&quot; to record the world of WWII pilots, their experiences and feelings, for his own sons. He then collected the stories into a book.It could have been much better if he had put a little more effort into consolidating the stories, but he didn't even bother to clean up the individual stories and mesh them neatly together - sometimes they left you hanging and sometimes they seemed to go nowhere. Some were obviously left out entirely. And he bounces back and forth between a B-24 pilot (which he portrays OK since he was one) and a P-38 fighter pilot (which is most of the amateurish stuff) that he tries (unsuccessfully) to tie together at the beginning with a too-long account of their childhood as neighbors. And probably because the author later became a Psychotherapist (as reported in the &quot;about the author&quot; on the cover flap) the whole book is laced with a lot of people with childhood issues, who &quot;need to talk to someone&quot;. Reading this you would think that half the pilots (and flight docs) in the Pacific theater were loony. And the author seems to have the characters, rather than dwelling on bonds of friendship and camaraderie, mostly be antagonistic towards each other.The author's credibility dropped even more when he mentioned that WWI fighter pilots didn't fly with parachutes because they hadn't been invented yet (which is blatantly false). A last minor, irritating point is that the cover of the hardback that I read shows a P-51 which never (to my knowledge) served in the Pacific theater (where the book is based) and which, more to the point, is never a part of the stories.Overall, if you've got nothing to do for a weekend, and the book is sitting there on the table, you might want to read it. But I wouldn't buy it."},{"Title":"The Pilots","review":"From the book jacket, I know that James Spencer is a writer and has been for a long, long time. I also know that for a brief period in his life he was a B-24 pilot in the southwest Pacific during World War Two. By his own admission he flew 44 missions, some of them very long range, over trackless ocean that would have provided little if any chance for rescue had he and his crew gone down. Such combat flying is unarguably valorous, particularly in retrospect, but at the time was just the flyers' &quot;job.&quot; I know a naval aviator who flew similar solo strikes in a PB4Y-1 (the Navy version of the B-24)during the same time period of 1943 and '44 and am familiar with what such missions entailed.That said, this book falls short in a number of areas, beginning with the opening section about the protagonists' early years, which is full of both unbelievable incidents and characters. From there it goes from combat flying in both bombers and fighters, life at the bases, R&amp;R in Australia and various other ruminations about &quot;what it all means.&quot; Combat flying memoirs are beginning to appear again after a long dry spell as veterans want to commit their experiences to print while they still can. Some are good but those tend to be the non-fiction ones. This book is called a &quot;memoir as a novel,&quot; which I assume means that there is at least some basis of actual related experience in a fictional context. In this case, I suppose the experience is that of serving in the 13th Air Force in the Pacific and then projecting a young aviator's now mature viewpoints into a few fictional characters? Hey, I'm reaching here, but the author admits that he thinks he should have been a fighter pilot, fantasized about P-38's and one of the characters in this book is a fighter pilot. Of course, there's bomber flying too by another character. So is this Walter Mitty stuff or real stuff that happened to others but not to the author? So this is a novel. It's really not a memoir at all any more than James Jones' FROM HERE TO ETERNITY was a memoir of his life in the pre-war Army at Schofield Barracks.The truth is less elegant than the alleged new art form. This is a novel and not a very good one. A truly good memoir of South Pacific combat flying is Edwards Park's NANETTE. A truly good novel of South Pacific combat flying is Gordon Forbes' GOODBYE TO SOME. Both of these books, written by men who did the deeds, are well worth the time it might take to find them.With full appreciation for Mr. Spencer's wartime service and his demonstrated writing skills, presumably non-fiction, evidenced by his having been published for years, I feel that this particular effort was substandard for war fiction... or memoir.And a minor note to the publisher: the book jacket shows P-51's. While P-51's are mentioned in the author's foreward, the US aircraft in the book are B-24's and P-38's. Pictures exist for both these aircraft -- even shots of them in the Pacific theater, even shots of them together -- so look around if this book goes to paperback."},{"Title":"Leibniz: New Essays on Human Understanding (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)","review":"The contribution of Gottfried Leibniz to the development of man is immeasurable. However, knowing his contribution is difficult to assemble because Leibniz published only one book during his life. Yet, he was a prolific writer of papers and letters to many people on many subject. Beside discovering the infinitesimal calculus, which is taught is all high schools today, he was known as a 'walking encyclopedia.'The material in this book was made by Leibniz in response to England's John Locke's 'Essay Concerning Human Understanding' (1690). The material was prepared by Leibniz to use it in a debate with Locke. Locke proposed physical atoms for the universe. This is consistent with Newton's physical universe. But, Leibniz proposed monads, which are becoming part of modern creation theories. However, Locke died and the debate never occurred. Instead, Leibniz established correspondence in 1715-16 with Samuel Clark, a disciple of Isaac Newton. This correspondence is an excellent summary of Leibniz's thoughts before he died in 1716. It shows the basic differences between Newton and Leibniz in both science and mathematics.This book should become part of the home library of any intellectual family."},{"Title":"Search sweet country","review":"I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO FIND A WRITER WHO IS AFRICAN AND HAD THE BRAVERY TO WRITE A WORK OF FICTION THAT HAD CADENCES OF SCIENCE FICTION,MIXING IT WITH THE WELL USED FOLKLORE OF AFRICA.NOT SINCE THE PALM WINE DRINKARD HAVE I BEEN SO MESMERISED AND MOVED BY THE SHERE INVENTIVENESS OF A BOOK.REMINISCENT OF RUSHDIES GRIMUS,THE STORY WAS A JOY TO READ AND INSPIRED ME TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PRODIGIOUS AUTHOR WHOM I FELT WAS POSSESSED WITH THE RARE GIFT OF INVENTIVE BRAVERY.SADLY,TRY AS I MAY I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN ANOTHER OF HIS WORKS,BUT I HAVE BEEN BREATHTAKEN BY CRITICAL REVIEWS OF WEST AFRICAN MAGICAL REALISM WHICH INCLUDE HIS TWO OTHER WORKS.SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP THIS ENGINE CHURN AGAIN,HE REALLY MOVED ME TO ALMOST STEALING THE ONLY COPY I HAVE EVER SEEN OF HIS BOOK(AT THE LIBRARY).I AM A YOUNG AFRICAN POET,WHO WOULD ONE DAY LOVE TO SEE SUCH WORKS AS KOJO LAINGS RE-READ,RE PRINTED,AND HE,REPAYED FOR HIS GREAT SERVISE."},{"Title":"My Pictionary","review":"This book offers engaging pictures of common everyday objects along with the words for each object.

Es un personaje secundario, sin embargo tiene relevancia al ser hermanastra de Jack. El escritor introduce dos temas importantes que relaciona con ella y que luego no \\"cierra\\". El primero se refiere al incendio de la Catedral (inicio de la obra), ella sabe algo que nadie m&aacute;s sabe, y nunca esa informaci&oacute;n vuelve en la obra. El segundo es el relevante hecho de la relaci&oacute;n de Johnatan y Martha, que el autor nunca trata (final de la obra). Teniendo en cuenta que Follett es muy detallista y utiliza todos los datos que subrepticiamente o explicitamente va introduciendo en su obra, es inentendible que no de relevancia a esos dos. Podr&iacute;a entender que no quiera dar relevancia a Martha en la obra, pero entonces que no deje cabos sueltos.- Para los editores: en la edici&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol hay por lo menos 5 faltas de ortograf&iacute;a o de tipeo!!

La verdad es que el libro si engancha, pero que enganche no quiere decir que sea buena literatura. Los personajes son o muy, muy malos o tan buenos que rayan en la estupidez, del tipo de personajes de una telenovela mexicana. La trama es bastante predecible y esta muy claro que esta es otra novela historica escrita a base de formula (las hay algunas, he tenido la desdicha de leer mas de una) y es que es evidente que a la gente le encanta este tipo de novela ya que se venden como pan caliente, por eso las continuan escribiendo. Se que los amantes de este tipo de literatura me van a arrojar a los leones por esta critica, pero hay que tomar en cuenta que comparado con tanto genio como Borges, Cortazar, Saramago o Garcia Marquez, por nombrar algunos grandes escritores, nuestro querido Follet, se queda muy chiquito. Aun no entiendo como desperdicie mi tiempo leyendo esta novela (1400 paginas!!), debi haberla usado para aguantar la puerta.A los amantes de la buena literatura les aconsejo que se mantengan alejados de este libro. Si tienen tiempo para perder, inviertanlo en La Rayuela de Cortazar, leyendola al derecho y al reves, o si en verdad quieren leer una novela historica en Memorial de Convento de Saramago encontraran una obra maestra.

The author weaves a rich and colorful tapestry of people, places, and events surrounding the building of a magnificent cathedral in the medieval town of Kingsbridge.Early twelfth century England was a country in a state of flux. King Henry I had died without a male heir. His daughter Maude was to be queen. The English barons, for the most part, however, refused to swear fealty to her. Maude's first cousin, Stephen of Blois, then usurped her rights and proclaimed himself king. This was to plunge England into a civil war that was to last for many, many years, turning England into a virtually lawless and tumultuous land, until Maude's son became King Henry II of England.For most people, however, life would go on with every day concerns being paramount. The book tells the story of a number of these lives. One story is that of Tom, a master builder, whose life long dream was to build a cathedral. The lives of Tom and his family would intersect that of a humble and intelligent monk named Phillip who would become the prior at Kingsbridge Priory. The fates would intervene and provide Tom with an opportunity to pursue his dream.Their lives would intersect with a number of other individuals, some good, some evil, who would have a great impact on their lives and their goals. Tom would lose his first wife, Agnes, by whom he already had two children, brutish Alfred and sweet Martha, due to complications sustained during the birth of another son. This son was to provide a connection between Tom and Phillip of which Phillip would long be unaware.Tom would ultimately marry Ellen, a strong willed independent woman of the forest, perceived by many to be a witch. Her son Jack, a sensitive, highly intelligent lad, whose father was deceased, would grow to manhood. His dream would begin where Tom's had left off. In Jack's background, however, was a mystery surrounding his deceased father, a French jongleur. That mystery in some way involved Sir Percy Hamleigh, Waleran Bigod, and Prior James, the old prior of Kingsbridge before Phillip.When Earl Bartholomew of Shiring makes the treasonous mistake of siding with Maude in the conflict with Stephen, he ends up on the losing side. Sir Percy Hamleigh and his son William, siding with Stephen, attack the Earl's castle, and take Earl Bartholomew captive. Imprisoned for treason, he loses his earldom to the Hamleighs. His young son and heir, Richard, and his daughter, the beautiful Lady Aliena, are left to fend for themselves, but not until William Hamleigh has slaked his thirst for revenge upon them. You see, William had been engaged at one time to marry the Lady Aliena, only to be spurned by her to his vast public humiliation. This was the moment for which he had been waiting. Aliena and Richard would ultimately migrate to Kingsbridge to begin a new life.Meanwhile, the church itself was having its own political intrigues. Phillip was tricked by Waleran Bigod, an ambitious arch-deacon, into supporting him for the post of bishop. Phillip would later best Waleran and incur his enmity for a lifetime. Remigius, a spy for Waleran Bigod, was a monk at Kingsbridge Priory who saw his dream of becoming prior at Kingsbridge dissipate with the advent of Phillip. He would spend a lifetime undermining Phillip and plotting against him. Moreover, the fate of Kingsbridge and the building of its cathedral would always seem to hinge upon the political vagaries of the time. Its fortunes would ebb and flow with the political winds.Ever present throughout the destinies of all these characters is the age old battle between good and evil. Complicating it further were those who sought to do good but did evil, believing that the end justified the means. Spanning over fifty turbulent years, this is a spellbinding story of love, hate, faith, betrayal, revenge, and triumph. Against a backdrop of civil war, the sharply drawn characters grasp the imagination of the reader. Twelfth century England is laid out in painstaking detail, providing an unforgettable backdrop for the lives lived within the pages of this memorable work of historical fiction.

In this way one will become unto Hume's philosophies -- rather than merely contemplating, as the vulgar mind usually chooses to do."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"David Hume is not an easy man to read. But The Oxford Philosophical Texts edition with the help of Tom Beauchamp makes him more approachable and easier to understand.One must also keep in mind that this book was written after A Treatise of Human Understanding. Therefore, Hume had the time to rethink his original writing style. What we have here then, is kind of revised and much much more approachable Hume as compared to his previous text.What makes Hume, Hume is all here, his discussions on causality, skepticism, miracles, etc. One must keep in mind that Hume was one of the greatest thinkers of Modern Philosophy regardless if one agrees with his thoughts and conclusions. We still must read him.This edition has plenty of explanatory notes put forward by Beauchamp in the beginning of the text that act as a tutorial for those working through the text. Hume is notoriously difficult but with the help of Beauchamp he is accessible and always rewarding.The text may cost a little more, but the rewards of being able to read Hume and have Beauchamp help you along is well worth the extra dollars. Also, the quailty of the book will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"This book will make you question many things; indeed Hume makes our quest for knowledge look like the struggle of Sisyphus rolling his rock up a hill, only to have it fall down again and again as he fruitlessly makes his repeated efforts. Hume argues to the logical conclusion of the empiricist tradition that began with John Locke.According to the empiricist thesis, sensory experience is the foundation for all knowledge about the world. This knowledge is what Hume calls Matters of Fact. Matters of Fact include such statements as &quot;The sun will rise tomorrow&quot; or &quot;The cat is on the mat.&quot; Deductive knowledge, such as mathematics and logic, is termed &quot;Relations of Ideas&quot; by Hume. These are necessary truths, or true in all possible worlds, thus they are not truths about the actual world, according to Hume. However, Hume thinks that Relations of ideas are useless to us because they contain an empty sort of knowledge that tells us nothing about the world. Hume says Relations of Ideas are CREATED meanings, unlike Plato and Aristotle who would say that mathematical and logical truths are facts about the world as well, not merely our creation. The relation of ideas/matters of fact dichotomy is the same as the analytic/sythetic distinction of contemporary philosophy. Hume does not doubt the truth of relations of ideas, he just thinks they are useless. For a skeptical attack on even the analytic/synthetic distinction, and hence analytical truth, see &quot;Two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; by W.V. Quine.To gain useful knowledge, i.e., knowledge of matters of fact, we can rely off inductive reasoning (reasoning from singular instances to a universal generalization) and sense observation. Now Hume never uses the term &quot;induction,&quot; for his attack is explicitly on our knowledge of causation in nature, but his argument would apply to all forms of induction, not just causation, thus it is often called &quot;Hume's attack on induction.&quot; To this day, no one has solved the problem of induction. This alone makes Hume a worthwhile read.The argument basically goes like this: Induction involves a generalization to the unobserved on the basis of observed phenomena. To have a good reason for making such a generalization, we have to presuppose that the whole of nature exibits uniformity in its behavior (If nature were not uniform, then it would be unwise to try and infer future experience on the basis of past experience). However, to make a statement about the uniformity of the whole of nature is to make a statement about unobserved phenomena (since we can never observe the whole of nature). Since this is about the unobseved, sense observation is out of the question to cite as evidence for a uniformity maxim about nature. Thus, the only available evidence for such a maxim would have to come from induction, but we need the maxim to justify induction in the first place! Thus, inductive reasoning is essentially circular. However, please note that this is only true if all reasoning must be based on the framework of deductive logic.Hume also attacks religion and belief in the external world. To believe in the external world is to use inductive reasoning because we generalize from the observed (the sense impressions in our mind) to the unobserved (a mind independent reality). We can have no knowledge of a mind-independent reality because all the reality that we can ever experience must be contained somehow in our minds. If it wasn't in our minds, we could never experience it. There is a large similarity between this view and the view of Protagoras the sophist, 2400 years ago. He said &quot;As things appear to a man, so they are for him.&quot; In other words, the only reality for each individual is that which is contained (appears) in his mind. Plato set out to defeat this view in his dialogue, the Theaetetus. If Plato is successful, then Hume is defeated as well.In numerous places, Hume anticipates Postmodern theses. And he suffers from the same problem that any skeptical or relativist position suffers: The Humean skeptic says &quot;Knowledge is impossible,&quot; but if that was true, how could he know that? The relativist says either: a) reality is relative to each individual's construal of his appearances (Protagoras, existentialism). b) reality is relative to each socio-cultural or linguistic community's construal of its appearances (Postmodernism). c) reality is relative to the a priori categories and intuitions of space and time, which are innate in all rational beings to allow them to construe their appearances (Kant's answer to skepticism). However, if any of these 3 relativist theses are true, then some knowledge of reality must be non-relative. How could you state &quot;Reality is relative to x&quot; unless you were able to see the way reality worked from a standpoint that is outside the constraints of x? If you are making that statement from inside the constraints of some perspective, then anyone with a different perspective need not listen to you because your statement about relativism is not part of their reality since it is not within their framework/perspective. Basically, if Hume, or any skeptic/relativist were right, then we should be equally skeptical about whatever they are trying to convince us.Still, Hume is very much worth the read, and he will make you think outside the box if you are going to understand and get past his arguments. Though the skeptical position seems contradictory for reasons stated above, this refutation of skepticism is only possible by first admitting that the skeptic is right! Thus, we still have a lot of work to do to find an alternative to skepticism/relativism, and Hume's book cuts out our work for us. He raises the problems that we need to solve if we are ever going to escape the hopelessness of relativism and skepticism. And even if the skeptic is unanswerable in the end, we are better off at least knowing that, and thus we will be freed from dogmatic and unfounded beliefs. Hume does us a great service by freeing us from dogmatic faith in both religion AND science -- a critical, skeptical eye in this age of empty ready-made certainties is both healthy and necessary if we are ever to get on the path to real knowledge."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"While I tend to be a fan of mostly Plato's philosophy, Hume holds a special place in my mind. I was required to purchase this book for a Philosophy class, and read it immediately after reading Descartes' Meditations. That alone may be enough to influence my feelings towards the book, but upon reading it a second time I have decided that it was everything that I had cracked it up to be the first time.The best part of Hume's philosophy, while it is hard to swallow, is that it is easy to read and understand.

One of the early points it makes is that most endeavors to write about the nature of thought are hopeless and nearly impossible to understand. With that disclaimer, Hume sets out to contradict himself by writing lucidly about, while candidly acknowledging the severe limits of, this topic. He uses logic to show that most human understanding falls into two categories: a very small group of innate truths deducible by logic, like every triangle has three sides, and a much larger group -- nearly everything we \\"know\\" -- which is based on reality-based observation. This latter group always has, at a fundamental level, an element of probabilistic assumption: Things customarily happened this way before, so they probably will again. Thus almost everything we (think we) know about the world is based on empirical experience, not pure logic. So . . .how did he figure this all out?"},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"Before the Epiricist philosophers came along, it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true. Basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning. Thus, complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic, working off what was assumed to be true. Then Hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics. Hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories: Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact. Relations of Ideas are things that a true by defintion. 2+2 will always equal 4, because that is how it is defined. Try as we might, we can never successfully imagine 2+2 equalling 5. So relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world. They are definitions we use to describe what is happening. Matters of fact, on the other hand, are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world, such as \\"The Sun will rise tomorrow morning.\\" Unlike with Relations of Ideas, Matters of Fact are not true my their defintition. We can imagine successfully \\"The Sun will not rise tomorrow.\\" How, then, if we can imagine the supposed impossible, do we know anything to be truly impossible? Hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry. He effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true. It wasn't until Kant's Critique of Pure Reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of Hume's metaphysics. This is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"If one accepts the methodology of Descartes in applying scepticism to reason and the senses, in effect denying the existence of all things but a \\"thinking thing,\\" two entailments are logically consequent: Either Berkeley's idealism or Hume's scepticism. I don't accept Descartes' starting point, so I find the entailments confused and incoherent. But if one does accept Descartes' starting point, then the two extremes must be heeded. If for no other reason than observing the absurdity of either man's conclusions, it is valuable to read both entailments. But in their confused process, both men bring certain salient features to light.Hume accepts Descartes starting point, making it his own. But to Descartes method, he adds Pyrrhonist scepticism: That all reason leads to infinite regress, and that all sensations (or impressions) can not be trusted.Hume begins with the conclusion that all sense perception is either an impression or idea. Even memory and imagination, two other faculties of the mind, are conflated into these two species of perceptions, as impressions. Their difference is one of degree (vivacity), not of kind. Hence, Hume is the author of what is known as the \\"Copy Principle.\\" Instead of unmediated, direct perception through the ordinary senses, all perception is mediated by the imagination into impressions and ideas. From this follows certain resemblances, contiguity, and causal associations between impressions or ideas, and from this association we develop a sense of self. But even the notion of causality here is one of implied inference, not of actual inductive reason. Hume denies there is any real causality that can be known, although we operate \\"as if\\" we infer cause from effect. Even probability is reduced to a mere association of ideas and/or impressions; because neither reason (which always leads to infinite regress) or senses (which can always be deceived) can actually be true. The Enquiry also treats of miracles and the testimony of others derisively; but don't we rely on the testimony of others who claim the earth is round rather than flat, just as we rely on others who testify to miracles in a byegone era? After all, few of us have direct experience with a spherical earth (Popper makes this observation).Hume's method incorporates five kinds of scepticism: (i) methodological, (ii) conceptual, (ii) nomological, (iv) explanatory, and (v) reductive empiricism. His commitment to scepticism is not without some capitulation. While he denies absolute causality and inductive inference and probability in an actual senses, he relies on them for practical purposes. One can't remain a pyrrhonist for long; some elements of reason and some degree of confidence in impressions is necessary for ordinary life. But if one starts with Descartes' starting point, extreme scepticism is a necessary entailment. Which, after seeing Hume deny so much intuition, is it really worth starting with Descartes' scepticism? Answering that question is what makes Hume interesting."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"This is one of the most impressive free kindle editions of a book that I have read.

The endnotes also have hyperlinks, which makes it easy to read the notes and jump back to the text. The index also has hyperlinks.

Note that Hume is Scottish and the book was originally written in English.I have always had an interest in philosophy and history and finally got around to reading this foundational work. The title describes exactly what this book is about. Hume starts by giving a brief introduction to philosophy and then jumps into the main questions. The biggie is where do ideas come from? How do we understand things? What is instinct, inspiration? It is interesting that his answers to these questions still hold up well to modern thought.Hume wrote this book at a time and place where Calvinism still held great sway and God was thought to be behind every thought and action. His ideas were radical and I was interested to see how he tried to delicately handle ideas that would potentially offend many of his readers.I highly recommend this seminal work to any one interested in philosophy and enjoys stretching their minds a bit. This is something I will refer to often. I continue to enjoy the access my Kindle gives me to great classics like this."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"Hume, I and many others think, was the greatest philosopher to have written in English, and this is the book to pick up if you want to introduce yourself to Saint David's distinctive brand of classical empiricism. This is a must-read for anyone with even a passing interest in philosophy, and it's hard for me to see how anyone interested in the history of modern thought can avoid reading this book or the corresponding sections of Hume's Treatise.As is well-known, the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding was intended as an encapsulation and popularization of the views Hume defended in Book I of his magnum opus, A Treatise of Human Nature. Hume assumed that book's commercial failure could be accounted for by its length, difficulty, and lack of accessibility, and so, being a man who desired literary fame, he hoped to acquire commercial success by presenting the same ideas in a more appealing and accessible manner. Unfortunately, it seems Hume misunderstood what the literati of his day were looking for in a philosophical treatise. For the Enquiry, like the Treatise before it, didn't bring him the fame he sought. Still, Hume did understand what goes into writing excellent philosophical prose, and consequently this book is a much easier read than Book I of the Treatise. Indeed, this book constitutes an excellent introduction to Hume's thought, and, except for maybe Berkeley's Three Dialogues, I can't think of another primary source that would serve as a better introduction to classical British empiricism.Now, let's get to the ideas here. Hume, like the other classical empiricists, was primarily concerned with the psychological question of the origin of our concepts. About the answer to this question, the empiricists were all agreed--our concepts are furnished by experience, which includes both sensory experience and introspection (i.e., the experience of our own mental states). And the empiricists also agreed about the way we can justify our beliefs. Some beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of the ideas they contained, and we can know their truth (or falsity) simply by thinking about them; other beliefs are true (or false) in virtue of how the external world is, and we can know their truth (or falsity) only by drawing on our experiences of the world. According to Hume, all substantial conclusions about the world fall into this second category. That is, the truth (or falsity) of all substantial claims about the existence and nature of things in the external world can be discovered only by checking those claims against the evidence of our senses.The traditional way of placing Hume within the story of empiricism goes something like this. Hume takes up the empiricism of Locke and Berkeley and pushes it to its logical conclusion. Whereas Locke and Berkeley hadn't been wholly consistent empiricists, Hume, the true believer, demonstrates that classical empiricism leads to a pretty thoroughgoing skepticism. Since he's wholly convinced of the truth of his empiricist premises, Hume is willing to accept the skepticism that goes along with them. However, those who aren't convinced of that his empiricism is obviously correct think that Hume has actually demonstrated the implausibility of his empiricism. If this is where empiricism leads, they think, then it's clear that we need to reject empiricism. Indeed, some, like Thomas Reid, view Hume's arguments as constituting a reductio ad absurdum of his sort of empiricism. On this interpretation, Hume's philosophy essentially presents a dilemma for all future thinkers: abandon empiricism, or accept empiricism along with Humean skepticism.But a different view of Hume, one of Hume as proposing a wholly naturalistic account of the human mind, has recently emerged as a competitor to the general conception of Hume's place within philosophy sketched in the previous paragraph. This interpretation downplays Hume's skepticism and emphasizes his professed intentions to provide a positive account of the operation of the human mind that appealed to nothing beyond the evidence of our senses. According to proponents of this interpretation, Hume is most interested in a description of the operation of the human mind. He's describing what human nature allows us to know and what it doesn't allow us to know. Furthermore, he argues that our nature is such that, where it fails to provide us with the resources to acquire the knowledge we might want, it provides us with a natural habit of forming the right conclusions anyway. Even though our nature limits our knowledge of the world, it ensures that we possess the habits of mind needed to make our way in the world. Hume dubs all these habits of mind &quot;custom.&quot;If this view is correct, then Hume has abjured many of the normative aims of traditional epistemological inquiry. He isn't attempting to show how we can answer a skeptic or why we have good reason to believe what we think we know. Instead, he wants us to stand back from our everyday beliefs and think about the natural processes that result in them. How, exactly, do our minds operate? How do we come to think what we do about the world? Hume thinks that this sort of inquiry will lead us see that, at some point, the explanation of why we think what we think reaches certain brute facts about the operation of the human mind. When we reach these points, there is nothing more to be said. We simply can't help thinking in these ways, and we lack the resources to demonstrate that these ways of thinking constitute an accurate way to represent the operation of the external world. And, Hume claims, it turns out that many of the fundamental elements of our conception of the world--the belief that things stand in causal relations to one another, the belief that we can know that there is a world outside our minds, the belief the future will resemble the past--end up not being open to ratification by experience. With respect to beliefs of these sorts, we ultimately have to appeal to custom in order to explain their existence and popularity. Hume, then, can be seen as demolishing the pretensions of reason in order to make room for a wholly naturalistic account of human thinking."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"This is a superb edition of one of the basic works in Western philosophy. Designed to be used by both casual and serious students of philosophy, this edition contains the text of Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (EHU) and a series of other sections that provide background and further directions for studying Hume. Included are an excellent precis of the EHU, a first rate annotated bibliography concerning works by and about Hume, considerable background material on Hume, and excellent notes to the text of the EHU.The EHU is a concise and charmingly written presentation of Hume's views of the nature and particularly the limitations of human knowledge. The EHU presents Humes basic concepts of human thought, human pattern recognition, and then proceeds to Hume's revolutionary analysis of the problem of induction. Hume exposes our limitations in establishing certain cause and effect relations. Hume's analysis of this problem and its corollaries leads to ultimate skepticism about our ability to know the external world with certainty and undermines much of the basis for religion. Hume presents his ideas in an attractive style that owes much to famous 18th century essayists like Addison.A fundamental work and very readable work."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"David Hume was perhaps the leading light in the Empiricist movement in philosophy. Empiricism is seen in distinction from Rationalism, in that it doubts the viability of universal principles (rational or otherwise), and uses sense data as the basis of all knowledge - experience is the source of knowledge. Hume was a skeptic as well as empiricist, and had radical (for the time) atheist ideas that often got in the way of his professional advancement, but given his reliance on experience (and the kinds of experiences he had), his problem with much that was considered conventional was understandable.Hume's major work, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', was not well received intially - according to Hume, 'it fell dead-born from the press'. Hume reworked the first part of this work in a more popular way for this text, which has become a standard, and perhaps the best introduction to Empiricism.In a nutshell, the idea of empiricism is that experience teaches, and rules and understanding are derived from this. However, for Hume this wasn't sufficient. Just because billiard balls when striking always behave in a certain manner, or just because the sun always rose in the morning, there was no direct causal connection that could be automatically affirmed - we assume a necessary connection, but how can this be proved?Hume's ideas impact not only metaphysics, but also epistemology and psychology. Hume develops empiricism to a point that empiricism is practically unsupportable (and it is in this regard that Kant sees this text as a very important piece, and works toward his synthesis of Empiricism and Rationalism). For Hume, empirical thought requires skepticism, but leaves it unresolved as far as what one then needs to accept with regard to reason and understanding. According to scholar Eric Steinberg, 'A view that pervades nearly all of Hume's philosophical writings is that both ancient and modern philosophers have been guilty of optimistic and exaggerated claims for the power of human reason.'Some have seen Hume as presenting a fundamental mistrust of daily belief while recognising that we cannot escape from some sort of framework; others have seen Hume as working toward a more naturalist paradigm of human understanding. In fact, Hume is open to a number of different interpretations, and these different interpretations have been taken up by subsequent philosophers to develop areas of synthetic philosophical ideas, as well as further developments more directly out of Empiricism (such as Phenomenology).This is in fact a rather short book, a mere 100 pages or so in many editions. As a primer for understanding Hume, the British Empiricists (who include Hobbes, Locke, and Berkeley), as well as the major philosphical concerns of the eighteenth century, this is a great text with which to start."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"This book was written in 1748 and I must say it certainly humbled me to realize that modern philosophical concerns are neither new nor unique.

Hume's first 100 pages discuss the experiential foundation of knowledge. His arguments are compelling, but too enduring. The final 45 pages are superb.

According to Kant, Hume awoke him from the dogmatic dream......With Hume, english illustration comes to a definitive expression. Through his opus, empiricism is systematized and acquires a new dimension that expands its influence on all fields of philosophy. Previous conceptions about the theory of knowledge, ethics, politics, esthetics, and the philosophy of religion, all are transformed or renovated by Hume. In spite of his critics, Hume's system dwelled with different topics of modern interest: positivism, psychology, nominalism, critical skepticism, determinism, agnosticism, moral philosophy, political economy, etc.No serious philosopher after Hume, has been able to avoid a careful look at his system. So if you are a student or scholar of the subject matter, I highly recommend this edition of Hume's seminal work."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"David Hume was an anomaly of the Age of Reason. His contemporaries stoutly defended the ability of human beings to use a reason that they held to be divinely inspired to solve the assorted Mysteries of the Universe. For them, the evidence of the senses could only lead mankind away from these Revealed Truths. But Hume, in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, countered with equal stoutness, denying the validity of any conclusion not reached by sensory experience. If one could not form impressions by sight, taste, touch, sound, or smell, then the significance of that impression, in Hume's opinion, had to be discounted. Related to the link between impressions gathered by sense and those by reason, Hume posited that the conformity between an image of an object received from the external world and the reality of that object as it truly existed in that external world was impossible to establish since the only evidence of that object, or indeed of the external world itself, was no more than an amalgam of internal images.Complicating matters for the supporters of reason over sense was the tricky matter of accepting that human frailty might lead to sensory imperfections (blindness, deafness etc) which could lead one to imperfectly use reason based on faulty sensory input. Hume suggested that a healthy skepticism that he termed \\"mitigated skepticism\\" would be a viable midpoint between too much skepticism, which would lead to rejection of all knowledge as insufficiently grounded in reality, and a dearth, which would lead to an acceptance of all knowledge as valid. An Essay Concerning Human Understanding represents his own use of reason to oddly enough undermine traditional concepts of reason itself to show a clear and convincing link between the validity of the senses to accept external stimuli such that man could rightfully draw logical and founded conclusions from their intersection.Hume first published his ideas concerning sensory impressions in A Treatise of Human Nature (1739). Written when Hume was not yet twenty-five, this book was a powerful indictment of the overarching reliance on reason to fathom all of Nature's secrets. Unfortunately, the buying public did not agree and sales flat lined, causing him to re-write it. This revised version, which Hume called An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, was artistically superior and sold well. He divided his book into twelve sections, summarized thus:(I) Of the Different Species of Philosophy: Hume's opening section introduces philosophy as having two broad parts: moral philosophy or the science of human nature and natural philosophy.(II) Of the Origin of Ideas: In the ongoing debate over which is the more potent, immediate sensory impressions of objects or abstractions of thought recalled in memory, Hume declares that the former overrule the latter. He also suggests that the reliability of cause and effect is questionable since past performance is no guarantee of future performance.(III) Of the Association of Ideas: Ideas tend to combine in predictable sequences: those that resemble each other; those that are contiguous to each other; and those that retain a cause and effect on each other.(IV) Skeptical Doubts Concerning the Operations of the Understanding: Hume emphasizes the need to retain a healthy sense of skepticism, not too much and not too little. Sensory impressions, as always, take precedence over reasoned thought: \\"The most lively thought is still inferior to the dullest sensation.\\"(V) Skeptical Solution of these Doubts: Human beings tend to assume that habit or custom is a sufficiently valid reason to continue an action. Not so, warns Hume.(VI) Of Probability: Hume defines \\"probability\\" and \\"chance\\" as terms that incorrectly influence human beings as to the most likely outcome of an event. Probability and chance are no more effective at prediction than habit or custom.(VII) Of the Idea of Necessary Connection: If custom, habit, probability, and chance do not effectively predict events, then what does? Hume suggests that \\"the observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances\\" will prove so.(VIII) Of Liberty and Necessity: Hume notes that if one follows cause and effect to its ultimate cause (God), then one as an ultimate rationalist might refuse to accept God as the Primum Mobile of all things.(IX) Of the Reason of Animals: Animals learn in ways not unlike how people do. Constant experience with related stimuli seems to teach better than reason--which animals lack.(X) Of Miracles: Hume notes that miracles are witnessed only by country bumpkin types and are thus unreliable. The church took extreme exception with this section.(XI) Of a Particular Providence: Though we might like to think that God exists, we have no experience to infer either His divine existence or an afterlife.(XII) Of the Academic or Skeptical Philosophy: In the first part to this section, Hume lists competing variations of skeptical argument. In the second, emphasizes the need to eliminate the sole reliance on cold reason and logic to solve the assorted ills of mankind.David Hume tried mightily to undermine reason as the sole factor in human discourse. Ironically, he was so successful in doing so that his books helped to usher in the next generation of Romantics who assumed much the same."},{"Title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","review":"Hume is underappreciated, as even the casual reader of the Enquiry will see. Kant credited Hume with &quot;awakening me from my dogmatic slumbers,&quot; but Kant's thought owes more to the structuralism (if one may call it that) of Rousseau than the ernest and tentative scepticism of Hume. Unlike Kant, Hume does not try to rescue Platonic dualism by positing an 'idealistic' connection between the consciousness of man and what lies beyond our sensory awareness. Unlike Wittgenstein, Hume does not say we should remain silent about that for which words may fail us. In contrast to some of his famous successors, Hume does not attempt to rationalize religion to justify the power of the state; nor does he sacralize philosophy with a neo-mystical faith in analysis. Hume exemplifies honesty in critical thinking in a way that one seldom sees in any sort of writing.

I remember reading the famous billiard ball account of causality in which our common sense view of ' before' and ' after' is questioned and taken apart. I believe Hume says after this account, something to the effect and ' still when we leave the room we leave by the door and not by the window'. A friend of mine in this class when the class ended opened the window ( on the ground floor ) and went out that way.This is difficult and great philosophy.

The Jesus Myth is a continuation of this evolution in his thinking, when combined with his other texts, no sober thinking individual can possibly claim that the Jesus, who is worshiped by hundreds of millions is anything other than an imaginary friend, as so little can be know of him. This book is outstanding, no lesser verdict can do it justice!"},{"Title":"The Jesus Myth","review":"When it comes to books about the evidence for Jesus, authors will never be able to provide an adequate argument to convince the religious that their belief is not based on reality. You cannot overcome conditioning with just written words. G.A. Wells is more intelligent than any conditioned person whether they are lay people or employed by the church as is the &quot;Rev.&quot; &quot;Dr.&quot; Gregory S. Neal, Pastor of the Beverly Drive United Methodist Church whose members, combined, have the I.Q. of zero.You would think that it would be up to the claimants that Jesus was real to provide the evidence for him. But, alas, it is always up to people such as Mr Wells to do their homework. This books is as good as it gets as are Mr Wells' other efforts. Denying the truth is the church's position since if they were to come clean the church would dissolve and the pope and all of his minions would have to find other lines of work, aside from molesting children.whatever you do for yourself, do not be misled into thinking that religion is based on truth, it is far from it. Besides, what are humans achieving by believing in something that was created by man to fool and control humans?When you read reviews about Mr Wells' books you are either going to accept what he writes because you are intelligent and can tell truth from fiction or you are going to dismiss truth in favor of fiction. When you dismiss the truth, you are no better than those who sell religion to the gullible. Are you gullible? I'm not. Thank you Mr Wells."},{"Title":"The Jesus Myth","review":"For readers interested in the story behind one of the most influential religious figures this book is a must. Wells neatly presents all factual \\"evidence\\" of a historical Jesus and discusses it throroughly adhering to strict scholarly rules. Although I was aware the historicity of the Jesus figure had been subject of some controversy before starting this book, I was completely surprised to learn how little -if any- factual evidence actually supports the historical Jesus hypothesis. It all boils down to two meager mentions in a text by a Jewish historian (Josephus) and even those are subject to considerable debate amongst respected scholars of the field. Needless to say that the apparent deafening silence regarding Jesus in historical sources outside of the christians texts came as quite a surprise to me (This for me is very hard to grasp given the dramatic events surrounding the life of such a significant figure). I would recommend this book to anybody (religious or not) interested in the subject of Jesus because it provides the necessary balance in order to come to a well informed opinion regarding christianity."},{"Title":"The Jesus Myth","review":"For me, books of this kind have become more and more something of a mixed blessing. I look at the net result: First, in his books before this one, (I read them all) Mr. Wells had maintained that Jesus was an utter myth, on a same footing with Wilhelm Tell, the supposed to be founding father of an entire nation. Latter day tourists can visit now all the sites and even have a look at the church register - but sorry folks: the whole thing is just a hoax. Well, on second thoughts, Wilhelm Tell's story is most definitely fiction - but what about the people who swore an oath of independence on the \\"Rutli\\"? After all Switzerland is real, it gained its independence through war, and most of the time remained independent ever since. Would an acknowledgment that the founding story is just a tall tale, change this fact?Now, Mr. Wells has changed his position on Jesus (not on Tell, poor bloke,) and he gives us a guy slouching along on bast sandals somewhere, sometime, in the historical limbo and quite separated from his story that took on a life of its own the gospels. Does this really make any noticeable difference, say, to Mr. Doherty's position? (see my review on \\"The Jesus Puzzle.\\") You tell me. As was to be expected from him, Mr. Wells has put into it an immense amount of hours in the library. I used to like Wells. His books are well written and make good compendia to quickly find a reference, but they can't substitute for going to the sources yourself, if you wish to form an educated opinion of your own. This would require time, inclination, and training, and last, but certainly not least, the leisure and means to follow your interests. It also requires a modicum of intellectual integrity and honesty - can I live with myself on received authority alone, or will I take pains to do my own share of work and research? Is the methodology of my enquiries up to scientific standards? Do I have the time to care?Mr. Wells follows the common practice of theological debates and presents his case in a barrage of quotes and cross-references in the footnotes. I wonder what this can do to us common blokes and lasses who are busy with building bridges or raising children as a single parent. I can't see us very likely to go through the tedium of finding out what makes a \\"son of men\\" different from a 'messiah,' or a 'Christ;' and if you come home from your second job at the check-out counter in Publix, the subtleties of addressing God either as Jahwe, Elohim, or Adonai will be completely lost on you, because back home you are so darn tired that you could cry in your sleep.At the bottom-line everything depends on criteria which have absolutely nothing to do at all with biblical scholarship. In the cause for Christianity, it comes down to just one thing: \\"Ye shall know them by their fruits.\\" The facts as presented by two millennia of Christian history, should speak for themselves. Had the assailant who had knifed a mother at the entrance to an abortion clinic, suffered from a lack of scholarship? I don't think so. He followed Lk 19:27 to the letter: \\"... those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.\\" Over the last two millennia this is probably the least quoted and most practised line of the entire New Testament. (And no I did not quote out of context: especially in this instant the context does absolutely nothing to salvage the tenor of this message and anyway it corresponds well with Mt 10:34-37, Lk 12:49-53, and parallels.)In fact it corresponds well with entire sections, especially the fundamentalist's favorite read: \\"Revelations.\\" Repeatedly we read the invocation that the Lord should come real soon and make an end to this world right now. Pagan critics of the second and third century had a reason to accuse Christians of hating the world and all mankind. I think they got it right. Anybody, capable to read the New Testament with his brains on full alert, will find in it the usual hate message of hysterically religious but very common fanatics - with \\"love\\" and \\"charity\\" as the candy wrapper. I don't see Mr. Wells addressing this issue properly when he, no doubt in the best traditions of polite enlightenment, tries to debunk the message, by establishing its roots in \\"mere\\" myth. What do we care about myth, as long as it is scripture? The real issue here is whether we can afford to let faith rule over our own better judgement. But perhaps there is no better judgement in the first place, and faith fills a moral vacuum? That would be scary! The fact that the physical and mental health of us infidels is safe only because of Christian laxness and ignorance of the finer points in the professed faith, is truly unsettling. In a world where glass-teat and church are the only available alternative to illegal substance abuse, there is a very good chance that this may change real soon, and I don't see that Mr. Well's book should come across as an effective deterrent.So who will read this book? Well those who have always read Mr. Wells' previous books, and they don't need to be convinced. If you are one of them, you won't get a ripping good read, but good honest research and a reliable index to secondary opinions on primary sources, collected and presented in Mr. Wells' characteristically lucid style."},{"Title":"The Jesus Myth","review":"This is a good book. It should be noted that the review here by &quot;revtompaine&quot; is actually by Rev. Dr. Gregory S. Neal, from Neal's article entitled, &quot;Who is G. A. Wells&quot;, and therefore probably should not be in an amazon.com review."},{"Title":"The Jesus Myth","review":"It was a good read, well-written. However, it really didn't introduce anything new to the subject area than what has been rehashed over the past 20 or 30 years."},{"Title":"The Jesus Myth","review":"As has been true with all of Wells' works in the field of the &quot;un-Historical Jesus,&quot; the problem with this book is not so much the author's lack of standing as a Scholar in the field of New Testament Biblical Criticism as it is his utter failure to apply the standard tools and controls of the Historical-Critical field. It is this failure which has doomed Wells to abject obscurity among the REAL scholars of modern liberal Historical-Criticism. Sadly, most of his arguments are built upon a tangled web of &quot;silence,&quot; and it is such arguments that fail the test of parsimony and leave Wells out in the cold.For example, one of the principle claims of this book is that Paul didn't know anything about a real-life, Historical Jesus. Indeed, according to Wells, Paul cooked up Jesus out of the Jewish figure &quot;Wisdom.&quot; Never mind the fact that, in Hebrew literature, wisdom is usually personified as a female -- known, in the Proverbs, as &quot;Lady Wisdom&quot; -- Wells speculates that a personified &quot;Wisdom&quot; is at the heart of Paul's theological proclamation. Now, as absurd as this theory sounds, the grounding for his argument that Paul didn't know anything about a real-life Jesus is equally absurd ... it is based upon Paul's near-total silence regarding the Historical Jesus. Wells asserts that, because Paul doesn't tell us anything about the life and teachings of Jesus, Paul must have been ignorant of such information. His conclusion is the grounding for much of his entire theory regarding the nonexistence of Jesus ... and, as such, is crucial in his argument. What Wells cannot obfuscate, with his elaborate theory regarding Jesus really being Lady Wisdom, is that his theory is fallacious from its foundation in Paul's supposed ignorance of the historical Jesus. Arguments that are built entirely out of silence usually are. For instance, Paul's silence can be FAR more easily and parsimoniously explained by realizing that Paul's letters are occasional literature, written in response to questions and problems that had come up in Paul's churches. As such, it was not Paul's intention to lay out the detailed content of the kerygma in the context of his letters ... that material was better presented in preaching ... and so his silence on such topics should not be construed as indicating an ignorance on such matters. Other reasons for Paul's silence have been presented, and all of them are far more reasonable than Wells' conclusion that Paul's silence = Paul's ignorance. Wells' argument from silence, in the end, comes up empty.This should go a long way toward illustrating the problem which exists with most of Wells' theories; he takes valid observations and correct information -- in this case, the near-silence of Paul on the Historical Jesus -- and draws conclusions that are neither the only valid conclusion, nor are they even most likely ones. He does this regarding Paul's silence, as well as regarding the silence of most secular authors from the period. Indeed, even where we have historically relevant data from non-Christian sources like Josephus, Tacitus, and Pliny the Younger, Wells always leans toward the least likely, anti-Christian, conclusions.The vast majority of &quot;high-powered critical scholars,&quot; whom Wells quotes and twists in his attempts to prove his points, NEVER cite Wells nor recognize his argument as being valid. Indeed, for the most part, scholars have considered Wells' work to be the result of unbridled hyperskepticism ... hardly a balanced approach to the question of the existence of the Historical Jesus. Fundamentally, the problem with Wells is that he assumed his conclusion before he began his &quot;search&quot; ... and then he only searches under certain rocks, and in such a way, so as to ensure that he won't find an Historical Jesus. Wells begins with the assumption that Jesus didn't exist, and then proceeds to prove his assumption utilizing the content of critical scholarship, true, but without the controls that make critical scholarship so very sound. He has set out to prove that Jesus didn't exist, and then only accepts as valid the evidence which he can interpret to prove his point. In other words, his bias has predetermined his conclusion. Don't buy this book; it is not an example of New Testament Critical Scholarship. Rather, if you want to see TRUE scholars at work, click over to the writings of Sanders, Johnson, Kee, Crossan, Hayes, Funk, or Mack, and purchase one of their books. Wells' theories are out beyond Pluto."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"Someone gave me this book at a very dark and dispair-filled time in my life. I was reluctant at first, more into wallowing in self-pity. But I came to know myself through the pages of this book and will always be grateful to the angel that gave it to me. She was almost a stranger and never got to know how much it helped me. This book can't &quot;change your life&quot; but if YOU want to change your life, it will remind you of how you cannot fail with God, and that God helps those that help themselves. Do yourself or a loved one a favor, READ THIS BOOK! I refer back to it - even though I got it many years ago!"},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"I know this is just a book, but somewhere there is a real-life Cassey, Reggie, and a Michelle. This book was very emotional to me because there is some truth behind this. Cassey needed her a$$ kicked. Reggie needed to be shot down. Michelle needed a mother to tell her that she is somebody and she is worth something. I have never been molested by my mother's boyfriend(s) because she never had one to bring around. Her life was all about me, and she didn't want to bring me around different men. Being a mother myself of a boy and a girl, and another on the way, I couldn't understand why Cassey could just brush this under the rug like that. I know from being around other females and talking to them and knowing other social workers who work with families like that, these things are common -- the molesting and the mothers taking the boyfriend side because they don't want to face it and/or the child is scared to tell anything. Statistics state that 1 in 3 females are or have been molested in some time in there lives. It amounts to 33% according to my calculations, but it's way too many and I think it goes higher than that. Child molestation is too taboo, and this goes across races, socioeconomic statuses, religions, etc. We need to talk more to our children, and listen to what they are saying no matter how bizzar it is because it may some hidden truth behind it. As a mother, a single one at that, rather be lonely and have my children love me and feel protected rather than having some sicko as a man molesting my babies. I will date, but if my kids don't like him -- HE'S GONE! In the book, Cassey was just as responsible as Reggie was in the lost innocence of Michelle. If I ever knew a real-life Cassey, a mother like the one in the book, there would be no hestitation in me kicking her behind! In the book, Cassey's bestfriend Twana, was gooooooooooooooooooooooooood!T. D. Jakes sent little hidden messeges in the book. Well, they weren't hidden inconspicuously, but they were there. For example, when he is in the cell with Michelle when she killed Reggie and when Michelle was recalling scenes from the revivals, his words hit home, which was another reason why I got so emotional with this book. When he stated something like, \\"where you have been doesn't define where you are going,\\" he hit it right on the nail. I said, \\"amen\\" to that. I am not a \\"Holier-than-thou\\" person, but I do believe that everyone you meet and everything you have went through serves a purpose and it makes you who you are today. I refuse to let everything I have ever went through go in vain. You are not promised anything and you may not have a choice in certain matters, but I do know this; you do have two choices in life. Whatever you are going through, you can either just sit there and do nothing or die trying to change it. At least you would be doing something.This was a well-written book for everyone to read, and the messeges that J. D. Jakes send can be understood by anyone. I would recommend this book to anyone -- whether or not you are Christian and you really don't have to be. However, his words will make you think, and it may bring up some painful memories. Or, you may be able to confirm what he has said. EXCELLENT WORK!"},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed!

The brilliance of the book is not its readibility, not the back-and-forth movement of the plot, not the stark realism, but the realization that salvation is a messy affair.We tend to think too clearly on the matter of our redemption. Too neatly categorical. Too rank and file...who will be saved, and who will not. Jakes' genius here is to show how things come down to unpredictability, to release in tragedy, and the tragedy that underlies that release; to missed opportunity, and how a found opportunity misses the larger picture. Salvation-in-process is very messy, and I praise God that it is not on my desk.In the end, reconciliation can lead to redemption. Re-kindled relationships can lead to shared grace.

(Large Print Edition)","review":"I see that there are no \\"negative\\" reviews regarding this garbage, so let me be the first.T.D Jakes is still stuck in the bedroom in regards to women. We are \\"recievers\\" because we are like sockets apparently. UH? What is that??? And WHERE in the Bible does he get that?Basically there is a lot of extra Biblical crap here that has no place in the Christian community.Secondly, this man is NOT an orthodox Christian, in the sense that he does not believe in the Trinity. So..why is this book being sold at Christian bookstores?The only positive thing that I can take away from this book is that at least someone is TALKING about female sexual abuse. I most definitely DO NOT agree with his paternalistic attitude regarding women, but its a START I guess. But frankly, this kind of paternalism he epouses, in my opinion, only makes the problem worse BECAUSE when you still say that MALES RULE, well, they get to do whatever they want with their women.so, I would most definitively LEAVE this one alone."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"TDJakes is a fan favorite, but let me introduce you to this best selling novel that was highly recommended to our book club and ultimately became our bi-annual book of the year. It's called &quot;WAITING TO EXIT HELL.&quot; This novel is a real-to-life book. We were blessed to be able to get this powerful sistah to speak at our luncheon and she is really real. She showed me how serious it is to seek the kingdom of God first and then he will truly add the rest. This book really affected me personally and I know that it will reach you too in one way or another. It took a tremendous amount of courage from this exciting novelist.

Jakes has gone directly to the soul of women in WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED!In what can only be described as a spiritual love sonnet to women, Jakesspeaks to all of the hurt and pain that has been experienced by women sincethe beginning of time. Using taut Biblical examples like Sara, Eve, andEsther, Jakes ministers to women in a way that convinces you that divineintervention was in play when he penned these words.WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED! delves into women's roles as ordained by God and howoften these roles have become confused due to old hurts, pain, and abuse. AsJakes covers a plethora of issues including incest, premarital sex, rape, andpromiscuity, he speaks directly to the reader. You often feel you are sittingin the room with him as he discusses these topics and the biblical insightinto his views. He prays with you as you read and he encourages every womanto reach for her individual greatness in God.I have read this book twice and both times I was in very different places inmy life. Each reading brought me a very different and personal message.Jakes describes the stages of life within the text and I found myself easilyin his metaphor. I was so moved by his words that I dismissed my reading ofthe book for a second time as coincidence and acknowledged it as the \\"God-incidence\\" that it certainly was.WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED! is a book that should be on every woman's nightstandbecause no matter what you are experiencing, Jakes has a message for you timeand time again.Reviewed by Diane Marburyof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed!

THIS BOOK SPEAKS TO THE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ABUSED MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY OR SEXUALLY. IT FORCES WOMEN WHO USE MONEY, MEN AND THEIR BODIES AS A WAY TO GAIN SELF-ESTEEM, RESPECT, OR LOVE. THE BOOK POINTED OUT THAT SOME OF US WHO HAVE BEEN USED SEXUALLY AND DISCARDED,UNKNOWINGLY SEND OUT VIBES THAT SAY TO UNSAVED MEN &quot;I'M DESPERATE, ABUSED AND LONELY.

Jakes is annointed and has been prophetically impressed upon by God to reach &quot;women&quot; in a manner in which no other man has done thus far. I would be remiss if I did not give hommage to Bishop Jakes for having the divine wisdom and indepth conscienceness to caringly touch those secret places of a womans' psyche that only God himself knows about. This book transcends all barriers such as ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. When it comes down to facts, women are women, and many of us are faced with similar challenges throughout life. I would recommend this book to every woman! It is healing, and powerful. Though &quot;Woman Thou Art Loosed&quot; will often bring tears to your eyes, those tears will inevitably be the water which surfaces the pain and washes it away. After reading this magnificant work by Bishop T. D. Jakes, I believe any woman would be on her way to recovery from whatever hinders her spiritually, physically or emotionally. I, personally, thank God Bishop Jakes!"},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"I have read this book three times. The first time I read it, I had just come home from the a mental hospital following a suicide attempt. My husband left me for another woman following 17 years of marriage. I was at a complete loss. A friend of mine recommended Woman Thou Art Loosed and I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down. It was like this book had been written for me because Bishop Jakes knew me personally and could feel my pain. Once my mind was clear, I realized that Jesus knew me personally, knew my pain and wanted me to come back home. HE wanted to be the man in my life. I needed no other. To make a long story short, I read the book, renewed my faith, embraced My Lord and life, picked myself up, dusted myself and here I am three years later, loving My Lord, loving life and proud that I AM the Daughter of A King.

Because it can give men a better understanding on women's attitudes, perspectives, moods, and over all, spiritual warfare. It is a well written book and is anointed by the Holy Spirit of God. I recommend this book for women which are still bound by the past and cannot see beyond today. This book will encourage you to be the woman God wants you to be. It is great for counselors, widows, single women, and women which have been sexually raped and molested.

The wounds are exposed, &quot;oil&quot; is applied by the minsitry of God's love, and healing ultimately takes place. God is a good God and through this book, I truly realized how special women are to Him.

He is fantastic and I can't wait to read the novel associated with this book.I recommend this to all women as we all need to be reminded that our past, however torrid or saintly, is our past and He has forgiven us when repenting of those sins.

In college I've learn how to &quot;channel&quot; my energy and how not to deal with certain issues. One particular situation comes to mind and I thought I was doing something wrong. Why was I allowing the devil to make me feel and think I was less than what God called me to be. I was dealing with this situation that God ALMOST got me out of but I went back. After having heard the cassettes, I understood that I wasn't the only person feeling this way.

The women's group at our church used this book along with the workbook. It was a time of healing for the group. Bishop Jakes understands the emotions of a woman more than any man that I have encountered does. If you are determined to hold the hurts of the past, the book might become painful. This book pushes you towards healing."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed!

God spoke to me through this book, allowing me to let go. My bonds, the chains that were once holding me back from what GoD has for me have been broken. it showed me how to resist the devil, not accepting what it is that i should reject. It did not matter to me whether the author of this book was a male or female, i believe that despite the gender the book would have been exactly what God wanted it to be. i would definately recommend this to anyone, not just those who have been abused or have low self esteem, but to anyone who just needs a touch from God, becuse if you begin reading this book with expectations, those expectations will certainly be met. We serve a faithful God."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"That a man would be giving the wisdom to heal my wounds of the past is astonding. No one relates to a woman and her feeligns, needs and pain the way that T.D. Jakes does with this worderfuly simple book.

This is a MUST READ for every female!"},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"The book is nothing like I expected. His devotional book with the same title is great. I read it first, and expected the book to be more like that. It was not enjoyable to read and often had to feel embarrassed as I read it on my Kindle at the fitness club...and see the person next to me reading the sexual scenes as well. Little Christian, a lot of secular. Sorry I paid for this book."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"This book was very upsetting to me...first because it addressed several serious issues and in my opinion, left them open-ended at the end of the book. So if as a child or teenager you went through any one of those situations..it didn't do anything but dredge up old tramautic memories without any way to let go of that pain AGAIN. Secondly, I'm not a very spiritual person and I'm not sure if thats the reason I didn't get the message from it that I was hoping to...but I think it would have been a lot easier to do so if he wouldn't have touched on those painful and touchy subjects and then brushed them off so lightly. I think T.D. Jakes needs to stick to ministering in the church and leave that subject material to the professionals."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"While I can see why so many people have recommended I read this book since I had a past with abuse, I found it a little chauvanistic and written from a man's point of view, but since the author is a man, that shouldn't be surprising. I give it a mixed review...helpful, but puts people into stereotypes sometimes. My neice has attended his church and was very blessed so maybe its just his expression through writing that put me off a bit."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"Woman thou art loosed assaults your emotions. You are gripped with the reality of both the difficulty and necessity to forgive no matter what has been done to you in life. The story is constructed by a series of flashbacks in the life of the main character Michelle Jordan. The story shifts rapidly back and forth between the past and the present. I was amazed at how i was able to keep up with the story even with the jostling back and forth. It is a well constructed story and i even caught myself hanging on the character Bishop Jakes' words. The characters are so real that i found myself being tempted to hate some of them. I couldn't understand why Michelle Jordan's mother was so blind. But i was sharply reminded at the end that we are all sinners in need of a saviour. We must forgive as we have been forgiven. This was not just a story but a hard and important lesson. Thanks to Bishop TD Jakes for this masterpiece of essential and extremely unique story telling."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed!

It made me aware of not giving another man a fair chance. I now have a loving, promising, relationship with a man I wouldn't take a million dollars for!"},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"Woman thou art loosed I believe has great pointers. It's a book with one focus and not to necessarily teach you the \\"how's tos\\" as an instructor or Pastors do today (which is wonderful to do). This book is catered directly to deliverance or \\"letting go\\", it speaks to your Spirit to the Holy Spirit within to unloose a believer from things I must learn to communicate to God my healer to, and allow the Spirit till heal these covered wounds that never healed. It preaches to the forgotten hurt but hurt we unknowingly carry around that causes us to fall short in relationships and Love for others in various ways of loving people. That's why I would recommend it to those who have already started their personal walk with the Lord and are hungry to learn and have accepted Christ. I wouldn't recommend it to those who are still critical, and unforgiving regarding Son of God and God (Adonai), but those who want to believe in the delivering power of God as far as first \\"letting Go\\" Second getting the healing, seeking his face in your spirit of who he is to Desire him like no other desire you had before!! God is so vast you have to search him out in so many forms. That's why we're always satisfied with the WORD the BOOK the BIBLE in constant learning in many gifts and TD Jakes teaches, he preaches, he sings, he raps, he demonstrates, he provides movies, The Potters House for your home church growth, and to find your own home church for personal one-on-one development. If you want a more teaching style that help bring you to more of an understanding you can still get it from Bishop Jakes another book I highly recommend for deliverance and teaching is \\"The Battlefield of the Mind\\" by Joyce Meyers, WOW too!! In this mind state the person is open to not just one aspect of searching God since he's so vast and his spirit resides in different gifts and ways of communication. Basically this is a deliverance book that must keep it general as Bishop states for every situation requires specific advice, seek counseling from your trusted Pastor and find a church home."},{"Title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed! (Large Print Edition)","review":"This book is not for someone who is in the process of overcoming a situation. If you have resolved yourself to the idea that you will not overcome an issue, then TD Jakes may be able to motivate you. This book appears to be a man's opinion of what a woman should do to overcome problems that only women face. The advice would have been better received and written if it had come from a woman who had actually experienced the life situations that were discussed. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sleepwalker in a Fog: Stories","review":"Russian literature has always been about ethics. I really can't find any other universal feature that makes Russian prose, both classical and modern, so singular a phenomenon. Command of language? Incredible as it is in the works of Russian classics, it's not unique among the world literatures, and anyway is mostly lost in translations. Universal comprehensibility? Not at all; unlike Shakespearean plays that are set in some vague pan-European context, Russian novels are always tightly bound to Russia's very own religion, mentality, and history that are scarcely known in the West. What remains, and what really sets Russian literature apart, is its moral imperative---the impossibility for a Russian writer to show any disdain or ridicule towards those dispossessed, fragile, or helpless. Deep thrilling compassion and frantic pursuit of justice are characteristic of both the Russian classic novels of XIX century and the modern short stories by Tatyana Tolstaya.&quot;Breathing&quot; is perhaps the best one-word description of Tolstaya's prose. It's not the suffocated gasping of Dostoyevsky, not the gentle crystalline air of Chekhov, not even the powerful storm of consciousness of Leo Tolstoy (whose great-grandniece is Tolstaya). Winds, airs, puffs are transfusing the fabric of these delicate pieces of prose; words and images are streaming, curling, twisting in long yet weightless sentences. Tolstaya's winds smell like sea, like childhood, like love; she makes us remember that the word &quot;spirit&quot; is derived from the Latin stem meaning &quot;air.&quot; Reading this book is like breathing freely outdoors after endless hours in a stuffy room..."},{"Title":"Sleepwalker in a Fog: Stories","review":"I first came across one of Tolstaya's stories in the New Yorker,and was amazed by her style. There is no western writer Iknow of who writes in such fluid, fantastic and yet earthy prose.The closest I could come is Bohumil Hrabal, but that is only a verydistant resemblance. While the writig is breathtaking, I foundthe longer stories in the book somewhat difficult to get through -they are composed of a series of tightly knit anecdotes and taleswhich flow from one into another. I believe that Russian literatureis notoriously difficult to translate, and that may have something todo with it. Nevertheless, stories like \\"Serafim\\" and \\"Most Beloved\\"are fantastic. I am looking forward to her new book, \\"The Slynx\\"."},{"Title":"The Body Is the Hero","review":"I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn more about how the body fights diseases, infections and other foreign matters that find thier way into our systems. Glasser paints an incredibly vivid mental image of lymphocytes, antigens, macrophages, white cells, etc. using layman's terms and with excellent practical examples. Medicines don't cure our bodies - our bodies cure themselves. The Body is the Hero is a brilliant explanation of how the body does it. I am going to recommend this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Body Is the Hero","review":"This book is a superb and detailed examination of the miraculous working of our bodies, particularly the immune system as it has evolved over millions of years, and of the medical profession as it has fought hard against new insights that would have brought us much farther in medicine years earlier. Anyone reading this book will always have a greater appreciation for the body he inhabits."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"I finished this book in two afternoons and just loved it!

Other reviewers and the book's website mention the \\"classic\\" TV show Dark Shadows (which we watched faithfully and even had a board game) as well as comparisons to \\"Rebecca\\" by Daphne Du Maurier.Andrew at 20 years of age accepts a post as a tutor to further his dreams as an artist. His natural talent as a teacher becomes apparent. Duncan was perfect as dark and mysterious lord-of-manor type. But the romance between Andrew and Duncan wasn't easy, as other dashing and experienced men try to court Andrew's affections as well as the unresolved mysteries surrounding the cast of characters.I was surprised by the plot twists and turns, and was not expecting the conclusion. I loved the cover art, and the image of Andrew fit exactly! This was a very enjoyable read, curled up on the couch, on a rainy afternoon!!!"},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"Sweat-soaked bodies? Rippling pecs? Is this the same book? This was a 'cookie-cutter' gothic romance(?)(I use the term loosely), with every cliche I have ever read rolled into it. eg.the dour valet,the coach pulled by 2 black stallions,the mansion on the hill shrouded in fog,the murder mystery of who killed who.Very little imaginative content in this story and the 'so-called' romance between the young tutor and the lord of the manor was not fully developed . I didn't feel many characters introduced were fully developed and that the author was throwing new characters at me without taking the time to position them properly in the story. I didn't feel connected to anyone except Elena and Leo. It felt to me like there were some chapters missing.The author seemed to rush the story by using a couple of sentences to sum up what should have been a couple of chapters. eg.They went to dinner in Manhattan, ate the meal and the next thing is they are packing to leave.I think this is more a book for teens."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"May be a bit spoilerish so you are warned....I was excited to read The Master of Seacliff and I did read it in a day but I found Duncan not attractive at all. I mean, Andrew described him as a hairy pirate. Ewww, no Thank you! All that hair was a complete turn off for me. I wanted to go through the book & cross out all the hair refrences. And at times, I don't think Andrew found him even likable. I was expecting from the cover, that the picture was of Duncan, I mean he is the master of Seacliff afterall but it turns out, it's apparently Andrew. Now on the other hand, the character Steven Charles, yum! Too bad he wasn't the leading man.The story itself was interesting. I did enjoy the plot. If you're looking for lots of sex, this isn't the book for you. There was sex but not until basically the end and even that lasted less than two pages."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"Gothic mysteries have been around for years, but gay gothic mysteries are a rare breed. In the pantheon of queer literature these novels are few and far between. In fact, off the top of my head, I can think of only one other I've read, Vincent Virga's spellbinding GAYWYCK, originally published in 1980.In THE MASTER OF SEACLIFF, Max Pierce delivers a classic piece of gothic fiction. All the prerequisites are in place. The large foreboding mansion overlooking the sea, the brooding darkly handsome lord of the manor who may or may not be a murderer, the newly hired fresh faced innocent, and the sinister servant determined to drive the newcomer from the premises.The year is 1899 and twenty year old Andrew Wyndham travels 200 miles up the Atlantic coast, from his Manhattan home, to take up residence at Seacliff, the large estate of Duncan Stewart. Andrew has agreed to a position as tutor to Duncan's eight year old son, Tim, for the summer. The money he earns will be used to finance his dream of going to Paris to study art.Duncan Stewart is a wealthy and powerful businessman with an infamous reputation. His father, Gordon, and his father's friend, Albert, were found shot to death at Seacliff eight years prior and prevailing gossip holds Duncan responsible. It's said that Duncan wanted control of the family business and murdered to have it. Officially the deaths are considered a murder-suicide between the two men, but most don't believe it.This, however, is not the only mystery clouding the situation. Duncan's prot&eacute;g&eacute; and secret lover, pianist Steven Charles, disappeared a year before Andrew's arrival and his absence has, once again, brought suspicion upon Duncan.As Andrew learns more of the rumors about Duncan, he is both fascinated and frightened. Duncan is a man who can be both charming and obnoxiously brash. Will the obvious attraction between the two men blossom into love, or will the mysteries surrounding Duncan doom their relationship to failure?THE MASTER OF SEACLIFF is both a beautifully constructed mystery and a well told tale of forbidden love at the turn of the last century. The pace builds nicely and the conclusions are not easily guessed. This novel is gothic storytelling at its finest, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"Max Pierce seems to be a writer to watch. He understands the fine art of mystery storytelling, finding that magic of the past great writers who doted on dark old mansions that held their secrets of murder and mayhem much like an old spinster creaking in her attic rocking chair. But Pierce introduces a taboo subject of the time in which he sets this intriguing tale (1899 in America) and in doing so refreshes his story for a new audience of Romance aficionados. He populates his engrossing yarn with handsome men (yes, and women) most of whom appear connected by their closeted sexuality!Seacliff, the name of the elegant but darkly invested mansion somewhere along the coast above New York City, hides secrets of two significant murders that happened some eight years before the story begins. The narrator is a young artist Andrew who timidly accepts the role as tutor for the son of the wealthy Duncan Stewart, the virile and powerful scion of the estate whose wife has died without an heir for Duncan (a situation remedied by a quick trip to a gypsy in Paris), replacing a young pianist who left the estate under mysterious circumstances. Gossip and secrets suggest that the murders of Duncan's father and one Albert may have been at the hand of Duncan himself, but other mysteries cloud the mansion: the daughter of the housekeepers apparently committed suicide in a leap off the cliffs when she learned of her beloved's suspicious death; her mute son remains in the household tied to cemetery visits; the butler is inordinately dour and suspicious; the neighboring estate is owned by a brother and sister - the brother being gay and the sister a bit too compassionate. Pierce slowly unveils the fact that gay relationships existed between the murdered men, the neighbor and the pianist with Duncan, and that similar forces are at work to bring the new tutor Andrew into the murky trysts. And simultaneously the true stories of the many deaths that hang in the past gradually are uncovered. It is a lot of story to condense but Pierce writes with such uncanny attention to detail and to keeping the language and atmosphere of 1899 in place that he creates a page-turning thriller that keeps the reader guessing up to the final page.Gothic horror, interrelated murders and suicides, past and present gay relationships, and exploration of a time when a staff of servants underlined the intrigue of the old mansions all make THE MASTER OF SEACLIFF and absorbing new novel. Pierce's elegant prose puts it all into perspective, keeping the sensual aspects alive but related in the tenor of the times. By the end of the novel, closing the covers, the reader satisfyingly reflects on the forbidden love affairs the walls of Seacliff had seen and how those gay trysts opened such strange events that made the discoveries of perpetrators so fascinating. Grady Harp, December 06"},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"This is truly a fun read. I started it on Saturday morning and didn't put it down until I finished it that same evening. The story had all the elements one expects from this genre with one unique switch - gay characters. I did figure out some of what was going on about half way through the book but the twist at the very end was unexpected; keeping me at the edge of my seat and very satisfying. This took me back to my days in Jr. High when I would rush home from school and watch Dark Shadows with my mother and sisters while we all kept pillows on our laps so we could hide our faces during the scary parts. To this day - anything that takes place in a mosoleum creeps me right out. Well done, Max Pierce! I will now be on the hunt for other published works you have written."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"I was so pleased come across this gay gothic---I enjoy the genre so much, and most particularly those titles that feature a gay twist.Now, some readers of this novel have complained that it borrows excessively from Victoria Holt's (straight) gothic novelMistress of Mellyn, as well as Vincent Virga'sGaywyck. This is true enough. I've read both books, and this is particularly similar to Holt's book in several ways. I'll also add that it adds a dash of Daphne du Maurier'sRebeccato the mix. And so perhaps I do wish that the plot of \\"Master of Seacliff\\" displayed a bit more originality.But you know what? In the end, I didn't mind all that much that it was derivative. I've come across so few gay gothic titles, that I'm quite happy to add another to my very short list of such books. And let's face it, the gothic novel has been around for over 200 years; take, for example, 1794'sThe Mysteries of Udolpho (Penguin Classics). Part of the fun of the genre is the way these books trade on hoary old clich&eacute;s: the young innocent arriving at a palatial mansion shrouded in mystery and gloom, complete with screams in the night, figures half-glimpsed in the mist, unsolved murders from the past casting a pall upon the present... What fun!Now, the book isn't perfect. Apart from the derivative story-line, there are a few plot points that didn't exactly make sense to me. And I really do wish that the characters of the two protagonists had been a developed a bit further, a bit more delineated. I'm not asking for the obsessive detail of \\"Gaywyck,\\" but I wouldn't have minded seeing the growing relationship explored in a bit more depth. But man---that Duncan Stewart---now there's an attractive bear of a fellow!Still, despite a few flaws, I enjoyed the book very much and will happily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"When I first got The Master of Seacliff, I was excited. Finally, a chance to read a gay gothic romance other than Gaywyck. 15 pages into the book the story started to feel familiar. I am a HUGE fan of gothic romance, so in one regard they all feel familiar. A few more pages into it, and I had it. Pierce took a good deal of his plot from Victoria Holt's Mistress of Mellyn. The little boy Ash is a male version of Holt's Gillyflower. Elena Van Horne is Holt's Celestine Nansallock. Leo Van Horne is Holt's Peter Nansallock. Even the ending, where the villain is revealed to have killed before, is taken from Mistress of Mellyn. The parts of this book not taken from Mistress of Mellyn are taken from Vincent Virga's Gaywyck. The crazy butler is just Julian Denvers retransplanted from Virga's Gaywyck and given a different name but the same motive.I am surprised that Holt's estate didn't catch such blatant plagerism. Perhaps because this book is in the gay gothic genre, they missed it completely. Aside from the plagerism, the book is weak. The protagonist wants to become an artist, works in a notions store before being hired to teach at Seacliff, but has never worked with watercolors, oils, pastels or charcoal and we are supposed to believe that he would instantly know how to paint without the slightest instruction, even on the sly. Also, he takes the job at Seacliff to pay for his trip to France to become an artist. However, what was he supposed to live on once he got there, air?I reread this book twice before writing this review, in addition to rereading Holt's Mistress of Mellyn. I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight before writing this review. I am sad to see something touted as such a great book when many elements of the main story have been clearly taken from another story."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"Pierce's novel suffers at times from repeating information, as if the intended reader were afflicted with a memory disorder. The characters are well-developed, however, and the main storyline is interesting enough.

Andrew is a young, timid artist who accepts a position as a tutor at Seacliff, an eerie fog-enshrouded mansion that is perhaps even haunted by the ghost of its murdered owner. Duncan, the son and current master is the number one suspect and also a potential mate for Andrew.Pierce meticulously creates all the details of the gothic genre. The romantic aspect is beautifully restrained and slowly drawn out, a refreshing change from most current gay romantic fiction that jumps into the sex scenes in the first chapter. As a murder mystery it is well plotted and will keep you guessing all the way up to the final twists at the end.The cover art is beautiful with its spooky, gothic design, but the bare-chested, Fabio-type model doesn't match the author's description of the somewhat frail, slender Andrew.Pierce has done the gothic romance genre proud."},{"Title":"The Master of Seacliff","review":"This book was a surprise to me. Being a reader of the classics and gothic books, I read everything I can get my hands on. It reminded me of many of the great gothic/romantic fictions- Rebecca, Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights... but with a gay twist. What a hoot! While some of the plot devices and characters may not be wholly new to readers, I loved the way they were mixed and blended into this intoxicating gay fiction. In some ways it reminded me of Charles Busch novels which do a similar thing, mixing hollywood cliches and making a new story that lives on its own but also is an homage to those old classics. If you are a reader, gay and wanting to take a fun ride, get this book. Lots of fun.

After reading each entry I must say that the professional quality and artistic accomplishment of each author is quite evident.

Kierkegaard's central thesis is that the modern age (that is It is important to understand, however, that K. does not mean passion as defined by the mob mentality, hate or lust. This is what Marcel, a later Existentialist, meant by &quot;passion.&quot; Rather, he is refering to a powerful sense of inward spirituality.Kierkegaard was a Christian (despite what philosophy professors might tell you) and the second essay in this volume is, essentially, a theological treatise on apostolic and divine authority. K. argues that Christianity is at its core an authoritatian religion. Authoritarian, that is, in the sense that the word and teachings of God have ultimate authority over man and human institutions.This book isn't a bad place to start if one wants to read a bit of Kierkegaard. The two essays are really pretty easy to read and will surprise you with how appropriate they are to the modern and even post-modern era."},{"Title":"The Present Age","review":"Written over 150 years ago, it remarkably seems to describe our age, for example &quot;A revolutionary age is an age of action; ours is the age of advertisement and publicity. Nothing ever happens but there is immediate publicity everywhere&quot;. And those in government may appreciate &quot;In the end a whole age becomes a committee&quot;. Perhaps the Internet is both a great leveler that Kierkegaard warned of, but also a perpetrator of the anonymous. I think Kierkegaard might laugh at some of the pseudonyms floating around the net, far less creative than his many including Johannes Climacus. Perhaps this anonymous net means no risk, but we need to &quot;Come on, leap cheerfully, even if it means a light-hearted leap, so long as it is decisive&quot;.This book provides a good, short intro to Kierkegaard, and the humor keeps this moving without masking the personal challenges."},{"Title":"The Present Age","review":".Soren Kierkegaard was a contemporary and unique thinker. In &quot;The Present Age&quot; one finds many thoughts that are both subsequently echoed in parallel thoughts and/or have directly influenced other great thinkers. For instance Kierkegaard speaks of the danger of loosing individuality to the abstract form of public opinion. Many of his thoughts can be found in later writings of Alex de Tocqueville, Nietzsche and Heidegger. In Kierkegaard's case, true individualism is based on the Christian religion (apart from Christendom). Written over almost two hundred years ago and yet so contemporary are Kierkegaard's words to our present age of nihilism and rule of public opinion.On Nihilism and relativism, Kierkegaard writes:&quot;A passionate tumultuous age will overthrow everything, pull everything down; but a revolutionary age, that is at the same time reflective and passionless, transforms that expression of strength into a feat of dialectics; it leaves everything standing but cunningly empties it of significance. Instead of culminating in a rebellion it reduces the inward reality of all relationships to a reflective tension which leaves everything standing but makes the whole of life ambiguous; so that everything continues to exist factually whilst by a dialectical deceit, privatissime, it supplies a secret interpretation - that it does not exist: p. 42On individualism and public opinion, Kierkegaard writes:&quot;The abstract principle of leveling . . has no personal relation to any individual but has only an abstract relationship which is the same for every one. There, no hero suffers for others, or helps them; the taskmaster of all alike is the leveling and himself becomes greatest does not become an outstanding man or a hero - that would only impede the leveling process, which is rigidly consistent to the end - he himself prevents that from happening because he has understood the meaning of leveling; he becomes a man and nothing else, in the complete equalitarian sense. That is the idea of religion. But, under those conditions, the equalitarian order is sever and the profit is seemingly very small; seemingly, for unless the individual learns in the reality of religion and before God to be content with himself, and learns, instead of dominating others, to dominate himself, content as priest to be his own audience, and as author his own reader, if he will not learn to be satisfied with that as the highest, because it is the expression of the equality of all men before God and of our likeness to others, then he will not escape from reflection. &quot; p.57&quot;The public is a concept which could not have occurred in antiquity because the people en masse, in corpore, took part in any situation which arose, and were responsible for the actions of the individual, and, moreover, the individual was personally present and had to submit at once to applause or disapproval for his decision. Only when the sense of association in society is no longer strong enough to give life to concrete realties is the Press able to create that abstraction 'the public', consisting of unreal individuals who never are and never can be united in an actual situation or organization - and yet are held together as a whole.&quot; p. 60&quot;The man who has no opinion of an event at the actual moment accepts the opinion of the majority, or, if he is quarrelsome, of the minority. But it must be remembered that the majority and minority are real people, and that is why the individual is assisted by adhering to them. A public, on the contrary, is an abstraction. To adopt the opinion of this or that man means that one knows that they will be subjected to the same dangers as oneself, that they will be led astray with one if the opinion leads astray. But to adopt the same opinion as the public is a deceptive consolation because the public is only there in abstracto. p.61"},{"Title":"The Present Age","review":"In this review I would like to consider the second essay collected in this edition -'On the Difference between the Genius and the Apostle'- which is too often overlooked by readers. Kierkegaard begins this meditation by denouncing the tendency of nineteenth century Christians to assume (even hope that) the Apostles were 'geniuses'. But according to Kierkegaard \\"St. Paul cannot be compared with either Plato or Shakespeare, as a coiner of beautiful similes he comes pretty low down on the scale, as a stylist his name is quite obscure...\\" So, why read the Apostle Paul? \\"Genius is what it is of itself, i.e. through that which it is in itself; an Apostle is what he is by his divine authority...\\" The Apostle represents an Eternal Paradox, the Word made flesh, while the genius may initially be paradoxical \\"but ultimately the race will assimilate what was once a paradox in such a way that it is no longer paradoxical.\\" Thus the mere 'genius' St. Paul becomes, like the 'mere' genius of Plato, another name one surveys in a 'History of Western Thought' college course.But an \\"Apostle is not born; an Apostle is a man called and appointed by God, receiving a mission from him.\\" And what of the Apostle's message? \\"The new which he may have to bring forth is the essential paradox. However long it may be proclaimed in the world it remains essentially and equally new, equally paradoxical, and no immanence can assimilate it.\\" Kierkegaard is here maintaining that while the Hegelian dialectic may assimilate every other; it cannot assimilate the Eternal Other of God's Word - \\"for the essential paradox is the protest against immanence.\\" And genius, or so Kierkegaard maintains, is merely the finest flower of imminence. \\"Divine authority is, qualitatively, the decisive factor.\\" Thus ultimately the Apostle appeals to Authority while the genius can only has resort to his all-to-human reason and rhetoric.Kierkegaard rightly sees this attempt to assimilate the category 'genius' to the category 'Apostle' as a consequence of modern skepticism about God and authority. But as a consequence of this assimilation the Apostle is \\"an examinee who appears on the market with a new teaching.\\" And once this teaching is assimilated \\"there would cease to be any difference between the teacher and the learner.\\" Of course, this is the ideal of Enlightenment; knowledge spread through the world equalizes everyone. To these \\"impertinent people who will not obey, but want to reason\\" Kierkegaard says that, \\"Authority is, on the contrary, something which remains unchanged, which one cannot acquire even by understanding the doctrine perfectly.\\" Divine Authority can never be subsumed in any dialectic because \\"if authority is not 'the other', if it is in any sense merely a higher potency within the identity, then there is no such thing as authority.\\" In fact, \\"between man and man qua man, then, no established or continuous authority was conceivable...\\" Kierkegaard is indicating that either we submit to Divine Authority or we submit to nihilism. There is no third choice.Many Christians agree with this last but still want to see the Apostle as a genius. But to do so is to make the same what is forever Other and to compare the Incomparable. \\"To ask whether Christ is profound is blasphemy, and is an attempt (whether conscious or not) to destroy Him surreptitiously; for the question conceals a doubt concerning His authority, and this attempt to weigh Him up is impertinent in its directness, behaving as though He were being examined, instead of which it is to Him that all power is given in heaven and upon earth.\\" Kierkegaard reminds us that no apodictic statement can be profound. \\"The decisive thing is not the statement, but the fact that it was Christ who said it...\\" One is tempted to here sneer that people too unintelligent or immature to judge statements on their own will always need some authority. Of course, it is now commonly thought that the Enlightenment is the 'adulthood of the human race', as Kant once remarked. But this is the exact possibility that Kierkegaard is denying; humanity, in its relation to God, will never achieve adulthood. Humanity will always be under the Authority of the Divine Other.Even the great genius of the genuine philosopher does not escape this stricture. \\"What Plato says on immortality really is profound, reached after deep study; but then poor Plato has no authority whatsoever.\\" In fact, philosophy, which is thought to be the ultimate 'authority' for our modern 'enlightenment', can be considered the ultimate target of this essay. \\"The whole of modern philosophy is therefore affected, because it has done away with obedience on the one hand, and authority on the other, and then, in spite of everything, claims to be orthodox.\\" By 'modern philosophy' Kierkegaard is of course here alluding to Hegel. The most important distinction that Kierkegaard makes between the philosopher (i.e., the greatest genius) and the Apostle is that it is only the Apostle that has a purpose, properly speaking. How can we recognize the Apostle? \\"...[T]hat a man is called by a revelation to go out in the world, to proclaim the Word, to act and to suffer, to a life of uninterrupted activity as the Lord's messenger.\\" But it is otherwise with genius. \\"Genius has only an imminent teleology; the Apostle is absolutely, paradoxically, teleologically placed.\\"The genius is \\"an unnecessary superfluity and a precious ornament.\\" This superfluity is underlined by Kierkegaard's closing remarks on genius: \\"he has nothing to do with others, he does not write in order that: in order to enlighten men or in order to help them along the right road, in order to bring about something; in short, he does not write in order that. The same is true of every genius. No genius has an in order that; the Apostle has absolutely and paradoxically, an in order that.\\" A genuine 'in order that' (i.e. purpose) must come from God or it is only, at bottom, a private fancy. All philosophers, from Plato to Hegel and beyond, ultimately only have their word on the Truth of whatever it is they teach. Only the Apostle ultimately has a purpose, because it is only he that is not spreading some private fancy.If there is a God then there is something that endures. If there is no God then we can only have a succession of genius de jour - forever. The History of Philosophy is in fact this History of 'genius de jour'. As High Modernity continues its long disintegration into our low postmodernity we see the consequences of trusting in genius without Authority. It has now been seen by our postmodern nihilists that, regarding their grand theories, Plato and Hegel (and Marx and Nietzsche) only have their word on it. Thus 'reasons' and, far more ominously, thus does everyone (or an ever increasing fraction of everyone) on the planet. Modernity had staked everything on philosophical creativity -the ongoing creation of 'world-views'- but the ongoing war between various philosophical artifacts makes on wonder about the intelligence of this bet. It is the various irreconcilable philosophical artifacts, and their world-views, that are tearing our world apart.One certainly doesn't need to believe in Divine Authority in order to believe in the utility of authority. But, and this is the answer of philosophy to Kierkegaard's attack, if Divine Authority remains powerless (or unwilling) to enforce its Will then philosophy must continue to 'create'; that is, philosophy will continue to bring a temporary but unifying purpose into the world. All that philosophy has is this ersatz purpose to pit against nihilism - a world bereft of meaning and purpose. And this is all philosophy ever will have..."},{"Title":"The Classic Touch","review":"In reading the 1987 version of this title (there is a 1999 revision published) I am inspired to go back and read the classics that I read (or was supposed to have read) in high school.

What I found disappointing was the lack of any coherent view of leadership or practical methods for implementing any of the lessons learned from literature.

Cancer wraps tentacles around the victim as well as bystanders. It takes courage to survive; it takes God to give it meaning.Katherine Murphy lost many dreams with the nightmare of cancer but awoke with the vision of God in her circumstance, and the reality has never dimmed. As she vividly described the loss of physical strength and appearance, Murphy discovered a true identity and inner beauty.

I didn't think about going to the library to see if I could get help from a book. So, now in reading her book I learned about some things to look at before deciding what treatments to take and what to look for in selecting a doctor. I know that having the right doctor for you is very important too.I want to recomend this book not only to those who are experiencing this dreadful disease themselves, because I believe that it would also be a good book for others who are helping or living with the patient.

Ryder has learned as a young boy that women are good for one thing, and one thing only, his heart turned to stone by his own mother. Cheri has learned that men are not to be trusted and doubts that she'll ever be able to allow a man to touch her again. Mistaking Cheri for one of the tavern whores, Ryder learns the hard way not to make snap judgements! This little woman is used to the crude remarks of men, drunken and otherwise, and is not the least bit afraid of setting a giant of a man on his ear! Not afraid, that is, until her heart starts to soften toward him...Lawfully Yours hooks the reader from the first few sentences and engages the emotions as you find yourself caught up in the battle raging between Ryder and Cheri. A man and a woman who feel the undeniable pull of sexual attraction, yet each fighting their own demons from upbringings and past-tragedies that were far from ideal, it's apparent they want and need each other, yet they keep pushing each other away. Just when you think 'happily ever after' is in the cards for this pair, Rasey knocks you for a loop and you find yourself dusting off your dashed hopes and hurrying to get back in the saddle so you don't miss what's around the next corner! This is a fast-paced and exciting read with snappy dialog and fabulous characters so intense and real, you'll wonder if you don't know them from your own life. Delicious sexual tension as we watch the age-old 'battle of the sexes.' Total frustration to see if love can, in fact, conquer the law . . . and does it need to? With a murder mystery to add to the excitement, this historical romance is difficult to put down and hard to forget once you've reached the end. Rasey grabs your heart as well as your mind with this finely crafted novel, destined for the bestsellers' lists."},{"Title":"Lawfully Yours","review":"Set mostly in the year of 1870, Bounty Hunter Ryder Storm was hired by Adelaine Montgomery to hunt down Cheryl Donovan. Adelaine accused Cheryl of murdering her husband, Charles Montogomery, three months ago.It took Ryder four months to locate her. Cheryl had changed her name. She went by the name of Cheri Henderson and had a two year old son, Joey. Ironically, she lived with his own good friends, the McGregor Family. After only six months in Tucson, Arizona, all the McGregor's considered Cheri and Joey to be part of the family. They all knew the truth about Cheri being raped years ago and Joey being the result. They were the only ones who knew and did not care. Cheri loved her son, Joey, and so did all the members of the McGregor household.Cheri worked as a waitress in Charlie's Saloon, but that was ALL she did.

They did not know who Ryder was after, but they were glad to see him whenever he was in the area. Ryder and Cheri clashed on first sight. But since they both loved the large family, they were as civil to each other as possible. It was an attraction to each other that caused the clashing. It was that attraction that kept Ryder from just taking Cheri back to face the widow. The more he learned, the more Ryder doubted that Cheri killed Charles Montogomery.***** I seldom read a historical romance this good. (The only thing wrong with this story is the cover of the novel.

Not just any woman either, but a murderer. Ryder is hired by Adelaine Montgomery to find one, Cheryl Donovan, who she believes murdered her husband. Ryder is cynical about women and doesn't trust them, and his basically simple investigation soon becomes complicated and possibly more than even he can handle. The investigation takes Ryder to Tucson, Arizona where he meets Cheri Henderson; a young, unwed mother who Ryder believes isn't as innocent as she claims to be. Ryder believes Cheri to be the murderer he is after, but his heart keeps getting in the way of the job.Cheri Henderson would do anything for her son, Joey, even work in a saloon to put food on their table. Running from a tragic past, Cheri tries to put it all behind her, but it becomes difficult when Rider Storm comes to town seeking a woman suspected of murder. Cheri does her best to ignore the rude, arrogant and bossy bounty hunter, but finds it difficult ignore her body's response to him when he is near. Cheri knows Ryder is a \`ladies man' and fights her body and soon her heart, when it comes to Ryder.Tensions and sparks fly in Tucson and Ryder and Cheri soon find their lives changed forever. Is Cheri the woman Ryder seeks? Will this honourable lawman get his woman to have and to hold?Patricia Rasey pens a wonderful historical romance in LAWFULLY YOURS. This tale is fast-paced, consistent, intriguing and sensual. Ryder Storm is a delicious hero who is tough, sexy and a bounty hunter that I would surrender to in a heartbeat! I could rave all day about Ryder Storm and Cheri Henderson, but I do have to say that they are sassy, tough, fun and it's an adventure riding with them in the Old West. Ms. Rasey brings 1869 to life and shows how tough the West was, how society looked upon unwed mothers and the prejudices that went along with it. In LAWFULLY YOURS, Ms. Rasey shows some tough and independent ladies who work along side their men and who could make it on their own without them. I adored Cheri for her heart, her love for her son and the fierce independence she lives by. Ryder was everything a reader could want in a hero, and then some. LAWFULLY YOURS is an amazing must read with awesome characters, an exciting and never boring story, that needs to be read to believe it and to savour it.Patricia Rasey writes historical romance with class and style. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!Reviewed by Tracey West (The Road to Romance)"},{"Title":"Lawfully Yours","review":"Romance novels are supposed to have improbable plots and be written rather heavy-handedly. This book, like Rasey's others, raises (or is it lowers?) the bar for utter badness, in plotting, characterization, and writing, even in cover art. Her narrative stumbles along like it was dragging an anchor, and her dialogue reads like it was written by someone who's never listened to two real human beings converse. Perhaps if Rasey would quit publishing her own books and work with an editor . . . . One star is a generous rating."},{"Title":"Troy: Homer's Iliad Retold","review":"First off. let me say that I am definately NOT a master of literature. I need things in prose not verse. I undertook the reading of Homer's Iliad and Odessey no so much from a literary sense as a historical one.The version of Homer's Iliad that I am reading is the Barnes and Noble version, which itself is written in prose. Even so, I needed something to help dummy down the Iliad. This book did the trick. It contained a character summary in the beginning which enabled me to not have to flip to the beginning of B&N;'s Iliad edition. This book also provided historical info, as well as more info on the Gods and Characters in the Iliad. The drawings were also interesting.It contains 24 'books' just like the Iliad and these books correspond exactly. In order to 'challenge' myself I would read a chapter in the 'real' Iliad, and then read the corresponding one in this book.For you Lit majors out there, you would probably laugh at this book, but for \\"Lit Challenged\\" people such as myself, this book was a great aid. Yeah, it's like reading Cliff Notes, so reading this book by itself probably doesn't qualify as reading the Iliad, but if you are approaching the Iliad from a historical perspective, it's not bad."},{"Title":"The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (Pocket Books)","review":"Very well plotted mystery entangled with discord among heirs, missing property, suspicious death of the millionaire, two murders and the caretaker's cat. Mason often uses unconventional tricks to make a cat's-paw of authorities, and the trick he uses in this book is extremely superb.Della and Drake try to stop Mason from skating on thin ice. Mason retorts &quot;What a hell can a man lose? He only has a lease on life. All that really counts is a man's ability to live, to get the most out of it as he goes through it, and he gets the most kick out of it by playing a no-limit game.&quot; Anyway, Perry Mason gets a lot out of life; he lives a full life and he really enjoys it. How I envy him!"},{"Title":"The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (Pocket Books)","review":"Once again, the lawyer-detective solves the mystery.

The writing is dated, but overall the book is a solid 4. Its easy reading plus clever, and sophisticated at the end."},{"Title":"The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (Pocket Books)","review":"The Case of the Caretaker's CatThe caretaker of an estate comes to consult Perry Mason about his cat. Perry explains why something trivial could develop into something big - like rejecting a client whose suit would have destroyed a prosecuting witness' alibi (p.6). Perry cautions Mr. Charles Ashton about his situation, and the Peter Laxter will (made two days before he died in a fire). Perry writes a letter for Mr. Ashton, who then leaves. But Della Street looks down to the street, and sees Mr. Ashton is being followed. Perry likes trial law because it isn't routine, and involves human nature (Chapter II).The investigation takes them to the private nurse who was on duty the night of the fire. This conversation is instructive. Edith DeVoe witnessed a strange event a few hours before the fire, but can't be sure of the identity of the man in the garage. Why was a hose from the exhaust pipe of that car running into the heating system air vent? Would death by fire mask carbon monoxide poisoning (Chapter V)? Dr. Jason explains how he could make a determination based on the condition of the body. After they exhume the body, Dr. Jason says to go ahead with the investigation of murder. When District Attorney Hamilton Burger goes to the house to question Sam Laxter they find Charles Ashton murdered! Perry goes to see Winifred Laxter, and finds Ashton's cat. Her boyfriend Douglas Keene brought it to her for safekeeping.Mason and Drake go to visit Douglas Keene. To avoid notice, they park over a block away and walk there. The apartment is empty, as if the occupant hastily left. There are red spatters in the bathroom washbowl. Mason and Drake then find out when Edith DeVoe married Frank Oakley (the other heir of Peter Laxter). When they search for Douglas Keene at Winifred Laxter's shop they learn he has fled. They get information on Ashton's crutch, and a new suspect to consider. In Chapter XII Sergeant Holcomb summarizes the case against Douglas Keene, and tells Mason that they found the cat. (Is the cat a red herring to distract the reader?) Chapter XIII has a scene in Mason's office that is as funny as it is educational. Chapter XIV tells how Mason is able to bring in Douglas Keene to the police.In Chapter XVI Perry uses an assumed name (Ashton's partner) and goes with Della to a hotel, posing as a just married couple. The purpose of this disguise is to track the new car bought by Watson Clammert. By reporting it stolen, the police will stop and question the real Watson Clammert (Chapter XVII)! It works.The Preliminary Hearing begins, and the witnesses are questioned. Mason explains the importance of holding and safeguarding the caretaker's cat, and what would have happened if another cat was brought to Ashton's room. Mason continues, and provides a shocking surprise ending (Chapter XVIII). Now all of his previous actions result in a solution to the mystery (Chapter XIX).This is an interesting story, but I found the ending too contrived. It might work in a film where the viewer can't pause and refer to previous events. Another fault is the disregard for various laws in those seemingly simpler times."},{"Title":"Out of the Ghetto: The Social Background of Jewish Emancipation, 1770-1870","review":"This book is about the changes in Jewish sociaty in Germany mainly between 1770 and 1840. Though the author claims to be equally analysing all of Western European Jewry, in fact he only focuses on German Jewry. The reason for this may be that he wasn't so happy with the outcome in Ausria and Hungary. Most of what happened after 1840 is mostly in the political realm, i.e. when exactly Jews had legal rights to serve in Parliment and not have swear the standard Anglican oath etc. The main problem the book has is the author is one-sided in that he favors the Jewish reformers to the extent of not even mentioning Rabbi S.R. Hirsh. Rabbi Hirsh was able to construct a system that showed that there is no contridiction between the Jewish religion and the Modern era. A side effect of the problem is that the author gives very little statistical records to back up his ideas. If one wants to try and figure out what the total picture of German Jewry was in this period, one will be either misled or just confused. However all in all the book is clearly written and carefully footnoted."},{"Title":"Elysen","review":"Elysen is a powerful tale of a young woman born as a warrior into a culture where her presence is forbidden. In a haunting, futuristic and yet barbaric world, Elysen's only protectors are killed and she is accused of their murder by a grasping, power hungry cousin who first brutalizes her then hunts her.With aid from a strong, believable cast of supporting characters, Elysen escapes--pregnant, confused,questioning everything she was taught and her role in the world. Traveling beyond the borders of exhaustion and belief, Elysen encounters both evil and good, and takes power from both.Although Elysen has a satisfying conclusion, the story is obviously poised to continue, leaving the reader eager for the next volume."},{"Title":"Elysen","review":"Elysen grabbed me on page one , held me tightly until the final page and then sent me forth to find more of the story in volume two - perhaps even volume three. I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Elysen","review":"Elysen, the first novel from Joe Cooke, is an extremely promising entrance to the world of fantasy, and an excellent read. I highly recommend this book to any lover of adult fantasy; this is definitely an author to keep an eye on. However, I must admit that Elysen is very much a first novel, and as such has its share of issues.The book chronicles the story of Elysen (or more accurately, as mentioned in a previous review, what could easily be the first part of her tale). Elysen lives in a world whose past is obscured in myst, and whose future is clouded in predictions of darkness, of the coming of the Shad'ya who will destroy all. Born the daughter of a Lord of Vyr, who is never meant to live, Elysen faces a unique destiny, and one shrouded in darkness.This is not a light book. Violence, death, and an overarching dark destiny all are integral pieces of this narrative. However, within this tapesty of darkness, Cooke manages to forge many human connections between his characters. While painted with a dark brush, hope shines through in this book in many forms.The characters in this story are truly what make it worth reading. Although dialogue at times is slightly stilted, the characters all have a depth to them that is not an easy thing to accomplish. It is obvious even with characters who drop into the narrative (and sometimes drop just as quickly out) that Cooke knows who they are, has felt their history, and is willing to load them with all of the baggage of their unseen past.However, this is not to say that this book does not have some problems, since it is definitely obvious in places that this is a first work that has not completely lost its roughness around the edges. Mostly, it just needs a little more love at the editing desk; there are a few typos which are very apparent, and several places where the dialogue could have stood a bit of critical revision to make it flow better.Overall, this book is a pretty amazing read. I found the first part to be the most rough over all, but it was good enough to keep going, and I eventually finished it in one (fairly long) sitting. I haven't found a book in a long time that kept me stuck to my chair like this one, and it is a testament to the overall strength of the writing that it kept me so riveted. By the end, I was loving this book and wishing for more. Thankfully the ending balances concluding the events of this book even while leaving space for a sequel; I was slightly worried by a previous review which made it sound like a \\"to be continued\\" style ending, and was very happy to be proven wrong.Despite some rough spots that call out for a closer edit, this book as a whole is an amazingly strong entry to the world of fantasy by an author who has a lot of promise. I strongly recommend picking up a copy and falling in love with Elysen and her world for yourself."},{"Title":"Elysen","review":"I just finished reading ELYSEN by Joe Cooke.

I can't tell if she is trying to write reincarnation commedy or just a guide for idiots.She starts off the book by telling us how she went to a bar to ask drunk people who they thought Howard Stern could have been in a past life. (Because, she claimed, drunk people would have fun with it rather than wonder if they believed in reincarnation or not.) She takes herself lightly enough to use this style occasionally. At other times she takes herself really seriously (&quot;proving&quot; who Bill and Hilary and Monica were in Sixteenth Century England.)As for my second theory that this is the reincarnation guide for idiots, she tells us that if we are obsessed with the Civil War and spend vacations acting out battle scenes, we were probably involved. Well, what can you say to that?? DUH--to use the most basic syllable I can think of.If you enjoy reading about reincarnation (which I do), read all of Brian Weiss' books, starting with Many Lives, Many Masters.

Yes, truth is stranger than fiction. . .A great read!"},{"Title":"16 Clues to Your Past Lives: A Guide to Discovering Who You Were","review":"This particular author is a little hard to figure out... First, she DOES seem to have done extensive research, but then she destroys her credibility by making claims that Bill Clinton may have been Henry VIII, Howard Stern was a harem girl, etc. Her method of determining past lives is by having the reader analyze their interests in THIS lifetime... while I don't doubt for one second that the interests and themes of past lives DO carry on into the next, most of the phenomena she points to could be the product of forgotten childhood experiences.This book IS entertaining, though.

However, unlike the same reviewer who gave the book only 1 star, I give the book 4 stars for at least rehashing the basics of raising a Christian daughter.Among the important points covered in the book include:1. While parents should be involved in spiritual training, the daughter must eventually be responsible for her own life.2. When parents are loving and affectionate to their daughters, they will not need to seek love elsewhere.3. Suggestions for instilling good habits in your daughter.4. Encouraging your daughter to seek wisdon through the Scriptures.5. Teaching your daughter to avoid bad companions.6. Helping your daughter to realize she has certain abilities given to her by God.7. Using your daughter's problems to draw her closer to God.8. Encouraging your daughter to think of herself less through serving others.Again, while the book seems to be overly simplistic, it doesn't hurt to be periodically reminded of the basics and common sense parents may often overlook in raising a daughter who will evenutally grow into a woman who will glorify God through her life.Being the proud daddy of 3 wonderful daughters, I don't mind the periodic reminders at all - there's too much at stake (their souls) and the world is a much different place than when I was a teenager.Read and enjoy!

She is also undoubtedly a strong Christian and an exemplary role model for the many girls that she mentors. Unfortunately, these things do not translate into being a good author.While the theory behind the book is quite strong the execution is definitely lacking. At 245 pages the book tries to be extensive in it's coverage of raising a (pre)teenage girl, but it ends up being repetitive and downright boring. The chapters aren't arranged in any real logical order, and something mentioned in one chapter becomes the focus of the next without any substantial transition.While this can be annoying at times, it is largely overshadowed by the fact that there is rarely ever any new original thought and that information is constantly being repeated. Quotes are taken from various sources (some of which are actually not cited correctly), and haphazardly used throughout the text to try and prove points that have already been thoroughly discussed and explained. Scripture often takes up entire paragraphs, the meaning of ANY paragraph can be gotten by merely reading the first sentence of it, and entire chapters could be omitted without any loss of information.I would definitely NOT recommend reading this book, as there are plenty of other resources available.

The title of this book sounded very promising, but if I had looked through this book in a bookstore, I would not have gotten it.Some of the recipes are nice, but could just as, actually more, easily be made using regular baking dishes than clay pots. I was looking for a cookbook where using a clay pot made a difference in the final product--and this book is not it.As two examples out of many I could use:1. Braised Red Cabbage with Cranberries - All the clay pot does is provide a covered dish for the final cooking. Prep cooking is done in a frying pan. One could just as easily make this dish completely in the frying pan, covering it until done, or use any covered container one already has and finish it in the oven.2. Banana Bread Pudding - Calls for use of a cazuela, a Spanish, clay pot that looks like a high sided pie pan. The cazuela is not necessary for this dish to be made. Any similar shaped, metal or glass, baking dish could be used.Whether one likes lamb or not, the recipe for Gigot of Lamb with Garlic is one of the few recipes in this little book that is probably much nicer made in a Romertopf (or other covered clay pot) than in a normal covered roasting pan.The most frequently called for Romertopf size is 3-quart."},{"Title":"The Best of Clay Pot Cooking","review":"This book is excellent! Do I really mean it, given the insightful critiques on this page with low ratings for the book?Yes, I do; and I give it 5 stars to balance out the reviews.

This book on the other hand had a well developed character, with deep thoughts and emotions and was quite mature as circumstances compelled the character to be. I would read this book with my middle school and older students and believe they would get a lot out of it. Thank god for Ann Rinaldi! If only other children's writers were able to write and develop characters like she could.As for the 12 year old that found the book confusing, it was probably not a book to read on your own just yet.

This book will appeal most to those who like historical fiction and books that expess African American slaves' journey through life."},{"Title":"Numbering All the Bones","review":"I have always loved the work of Ann Rinaldi. Her ability to bring her characters alive while taking the reader on the journey back in time. I was first introduced to her work when my daughter had to read several historical fiction books for her History class. She didn't seem to like what I had on my shelves so I went to her History teacher. She recommended I get her some books by Ann Rinaldi. She said she had never met anyone who didn't like to read work by this author. She was correct. This was the turning point in my daughter's reading life. I, the reading teacher had not been able to get her to crack a book for pleasure and yet this teacher had hit on the one author who would do that.In Numbering All the Bones we meet Eulinda, a house slave. She was much more than that. Her master was also her father. We start off reading about the accusation of a theft by the master's first wife to get back at Eulinda for being her husband's daughter. This resulted in the mistress selling off Eulinda's youngest brother, who had found the ring. To pay her back, her older brother actually steals the ring for future use. When the mistress dies, the master remarries. His new wife seems to treat Eulinda like an actual member of the family, that is when it is convenient for her in the presence of her husband. As the Civil War Winds down changes take place in the master's house. With a prison down the road from their plantation, the mistress has found a way to make money off of the situation. At the end of the war a confederate soldier has come to make things right in the abandoned prison. It is learned that 13,000 soldiers, both black and white died there, including Eulinda's brother. When she finds him she finds the ring and goes about trying to set things right. This is done with the help of Clara Barton.I felt so sorry for Eulinda being in a situation where she felt she didn't fit into either world. Although she was a fictional character, most of the other characters were not. I am sure there were many people like Eulinda during this time who took a stand for what was right. This is probably one of the best Civil War book I have read in a long time and one I will proudly recommend to my students. I gave this a rating of 5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Numbering All the Bones","review":"genre: historical fictionaudience: Advanced 5th grade readers and aboveEulinda, plantation house servant during the Civil War, grapples and discovers her identity and purpose as she transcends her plight and takes charge of her destiny.I wonder if Ann Rinaldi is the first writer for children to uncover the secret of the sexual exploitation of black women by their white owners during America's period of infamy? Mildred Taylor's THE LAND and Richard Peck's A RIVER BETWEEN US have followed. I applaud her.Southern society, the horrors of the Andersonville prison, and redemption by the remarkable Clara Barton color this engrossing story.

I know I love my freedom.\\"If I can go to America with Analee then I will be free.\\" Eulinda and Analee were on the verge of finding a way to get Analee's husband to America. Eulinda donned a new coat to give to Analee's husband. They were like a pair of depressed clowns trying to be happy again.\\"Mr. Hampton can we go to the jail to find Neddy.\\" Eulinda and Mistis plus everyone else went to the jail to find Neddy, Eulinda's older brother. Mr. Hampton goes to the jail the next day and gives the jail food so the people in it don't starve to death.\\"What ya'll doin' up here in this part of the hill. You don't have a pass you are not allowed to be up here. If you don't leave in ten seconds you are going to lose this dog you got with ya.\\" Eulinda had a dog, named Otis, which was taken away from her. Then, she asked if they could go to the jail. She didn't tell them Otis was there. Otis is a small fluffy dog that looks very dirty. Otis was a very white dog when they got her. Now he is a brownish color. He is probably a light-brown color now. Eulinda has loved that dog for so long and she wants to get it back from the jail. They might get it back but it also could get eaten and stewed. The people in the jail would like to have that for dinner.If you want to find out more about Mr. Hampton and Eulinda I invite and encourage you to read Numbering All The Bones by Ann Rinaldi."},{"Title":"Numbering All the Bones","review":"The best book I have ever read.

The story introduces readers to 13 year-old Eulinda and relates the story of her life as both a slave and a free person. The book is set in Georgia, with scenes taking place before, during, and after the Civil War. As the plot unfolds, the impact of slavery, the Civil War, and its aftermath becomes apparent.The story begins with Eulinda reflecting on how she ends up where she is and why she is journaling about her experiences at Andersonville Prison. In order to tell her story she must she must go back to a time prior to the war and share what life as like as a slave. As the daughter of a slave and the plantation owner, and also living on a plantation with relatively liberal owners, Eulinda was allowed the opportunity to learn to read and write. As a house slave, she was able avoid some of the more tedius field work, but in spite of the apparent special treatment she received, she was still a slave and also had to endure mistreatment.Later, when she reflects on the war, Andersonville Prison (a real prison in which a reported 13,000 Union Soldiers died in just over a year) is mentioned. Not only does she highlight what it was like living in the community surrounding the prison, but also the emotional and economic impact of the war itself. The final phase of the plot deals with the aftermath of the war and also introduces another real-life historical figure, Clara Barton. It is during this phase that Eulinda becomes more intimately involved with the prison as she attempts to come to terms with her past, come to grips with the meaning of her new found freedom, and plot out her future. The author includes notes at the end of the book that will assist readers in separating the factual information from the creative elements of the story.NUMBERING ALL THE BONES is a notable work of historical fiction. Ann Rinaldi has a unique voice that makes history come alive. She integrates historical information and abstract concepts such as the meaning of family, self-identity, and freedom, and puts them into meaningful context. The well-developed characters and ever-evolving plot keep readers engaged and invested in the outcome of the story.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Numbering All the Bones","review":"Numbering the BonesNumbering the Bones is about a girl named Eulanda and who is a slave and she is the daughter of her master, but her mother died she had two brothers Zeke, and Neddy.

Not much happens that could be easily summarized on a book cover, but so much happens in the way of character development and psychological insight that the results are nearly mind-boggling. How Huxley could develop such a large cast of characters so thoroughly is one of the greatest testaments I can make to his ability as an artist, and for those who love to sink their teeth into complex characterizations and psychological motivations, this book will have you frothing at the mouth.One should read \\"Point Counter Point\\" not for the destination, but for the journey. The ending is eerily and disquietingly ambiguous; Huxley is not as interested in passing judgements on his characters as he is in illustrating how complicated the act of living is and how there is likely no one approach to life that will adequately prepare one for its tragedies and twists of fate. A somewhat cynical point of view perhaps, and certainly not comforting to those in search of the big answers to life's big questions, but very realistic. There's hardly a page of this novel that didn't strike a chord with me and put perfectly into words either an idea I have myself or a character trait that I can instantly recognize in someone else.Though published nearly 80 years ago, this novel feels like it could have been written yesterday (some period differences aside, of course) so relevant do these characters' conflicts, escapades, fears and desires seem. Huxley's book is a reminder that 80 years isn't all that long in the course of human events, nor really is 200, 300 or 400 years. Despite superficial advancements in technology and science, the fundamental questions of being have been mankind's greatest preoccupation for centuries and will likely go on being so.This is a marvelous novel and perfect for a book club or literature class, as the food for debate it offers are virtually endless."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Aldous Huxley's reputation as a writer of fiction rests on three works: _Antic Hay_, _Brave New World_, and _Point Counter Point_. In this book, the most ambitious and successful of the three, he examines in detail the ideas and personalities of the British intelligentsia of the late twenties. Their politics, their sexuality, their world view, their love of life, and their fear of death are ruthlessly dissected for our delectation.Huxley accomplishes this by developing various themes with one group of characters and then reintroducing them with another group, whose members view similar developments from a different perspective. Situations, ideas, and figures of speech recur in altered form throughout the novel. Oftentimes, he accomplishes this effect with a great deal of gentleness and subtlety.Two brothers-in-law, Walter Bidlake and Philip Quarles, are clearly projections of Huxley at different ages. They interact with each other and the other members of the large cast of characters. A third, diabolical character, Maurice Spandrell, is more or less Huxley's Jungian shadow. D.H. Lawrence is projected into the story as Mark Rampion, and John Middleton Murry appears as Denis Burlap. We are allowed inside the minds of these five men, letting us see the events of the story from many points of view. For that matter, we are allowed inside the minds of all the characters. In particular, we are allowed inside the mind of the frighteningly seductive femme fatale, Lucy Tantamount, who is a projection of Nancy Cunard.Communists and Fascists, apolitical seekers of wholeness, God-seekers, and bored aesthetes offer their views on the events and ideas of the time and on each other. Sometimes these oppositions escalate into violence. The crippling effects of poverty on the poor are contrasted with the pathetic efforts of their economic betters to come to terms with their personal demons.The young rich characters have for the most part dispensed with God and busy themselves searching for a good time. But the doddering rich, the elderly quietists, the weepy inepts, the smarmy bullies, the shameless exploiters, and the sinister diabolists continue the quest. The elderly quietists come off best.The lusts of the flesh fail as miserably as religion. Philip Quarles and his wife cannot communicate. Spandrell humiliates his conquests, but is ultimately bored with them. Lucy Tantamount is also chronically unfulfilled. Rampion's vision of wholeness and marital fulfillment serves more to highlight the deficiencies of the other characters than to inspire emulation. The elderly members of the cast no longer possess the life force necessary to seduce, and such efforts as they make end in disaster. Burlap, the truly successful seducer of the novel, is so disgusting that he will make your skin crawl.The novel is like a machine with a thousand moving parts. It delights, it captivates, it amuses and horrifies. It sparkles with Huxley's intelligence and wit. It is sufficiently vicious in spots to gratify one's intellectual bloodlust. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I thought Point Counter Point was probably one of the best books that I have ever read. What drew me in the most was the ability Huxley has to portray many characters, all of whom are very different. The subtle way in which Huxley questions the idle spirit of modern man are at once both funny and disturbing. It is amazing how little has changed since the publication of the book...All in all, I was left feeling awed that someone could write a book that was so good.... and I was sad to have to finish it... it was the type of book you wish could last indefinately."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Aldous Huxley's 1928 novel opens with a grand London party given by Lady Edward Tantamount. Music plays. Dozens of characters cross the stage, meet briefly, argue, and part. Some go on to a restaurant that stays open past midnight; there, they meet still more characters and argue some more; several of them continue to yet another party in the early hours of the morning. We are now 100 pages into the book, a quarter of the way through. The numerous characters will continue to bump into each other over the next days and months, but the essential texture of the opening will not change.If you Google the title, the question comes back \\"Did you mean Point Counterpoint?\\" Well, no. Counterpoint is a musical term implying line and movement: two or more voices, intertwining with one another, echoing, developing, but never standing still. Huxley certainly understands that music implies movement -- his descriptions of actual music are superb -- but his method as a novelist is essentially static: to set characters off against one another, each of whom represents a different point of view. The book is thus a series of debates, some funny, some serious, all clever. But the characters ricochet off one another like balls on a pool table; this is truly a matter of point clashing with point; there is no line, little movement, and almost no plot.Oddly enough, Huxley has one of his characters, a writer, criticize his own method: \\"Novel of ideas. The character of each personage must be implied, as far as possible, in the ideas of which he is the mouthpiece. In so far as theories are rationalizations of sentiments, instincts, dispositions of soul, this is feasible. The chief defect of the novel of ideas is that you must write about people who have ideas to express -- which excludes all but about .01 per cent of the human race.\\" And again: \\"The great defect of the novel of ideas is that it's a made-up affair. Necessarily; for people who can reel off neatly formulated notions aren't quite real; they're slightly monstrous. Living with monsters becomes rather tiresome in the long run.\\" He has it right; this book IS a made-up affair, it IS tiresome, and its .01 percent of the human race consists of a handful of English aristocrats and intellectuals -- Huxley as a kind of egghead Evelyn Waugh.Several times, I almost tossed the book away, yet kept on reading -- why? The first time was when Huxley introduces Mark Rampion, a painter and would-be novelist closely based on his friend D. H. Lawrence. Here is a character who does not come from the upper classes, whose thoughts are three-dimensional and fully worked out, and whose unconventional yet bracing morality serves as a touchstone for the other characters in the book. The chapter describing his courtship is one of the few passages where the novel of ideas becomes one of feeling, and it was riveting. Although nothing quite like that chapter comes again, I kept on because I was often amused, sometimes challenged (Huxley is an erudite author who almost demands footnotes), and increasingly aware that I was reading something that was as close to source material on the period as I was likely to find. For Huxley does not confine himself to the social and amorous goings-on typical of an early Waugh book such asA HANDFUL OF DUST. He also addresses politics (both fascism and communism are represented), religion and its substitutes, philosophy, the arts, and science. Even sex gets analyzed with an almost scientific detachment: there is a long disquisition by one of the more despicable characters on the techniques of seduction, perversion, and spiritual degradation; another embarks on what must be the first examination in literature of the phrase \\"sleeping around\\". As a reference work, this is fascinating; I just wish it were a better novel. Interesting though the numerous points are, I could have done with some genuine counterpoint."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I, like many, with Brave New World as my only prior exposure to Huxley, was not quite sure what to expect with Point Counter Point. Rated the #44 fiction novel of the 20th Century by The Modern Library, I felt obliged to give it a read. Firstly, it is entirely unfair, and furthermore foolishly inane, to even begin to compare it to the dystopian genre of Brave New World. It's apples and oranges.The true mark of a genius is the irrefutable fact that his work cannot, and should not, be fastidiously placed in a box, or in essence shortsightedly confined to a category. That is readily apparent with Huxley, and more importantly Point Counter Point. A prodigious and incendiary denunciation of 1920s English aristocracy and their partners in crime, the supercilious intelligentsia. Huxley exposes them for nothing short of morally bankrupt, intellectually vacuous, and hopelessly incorrigible.Point Counter Point strikes me as a book for the more intelligent among us, i.e., those who strive to read challenging and illuminating literature that is not only profound, but highly enjoyable as well. You will treat yourself to intensely stimulating debates between Huxley's eclectic cast of characters as they argue the merits of science, religion, communism, fascism, capitalism, fidelity, etc, etc, etc. Although Brave New World receives all of the ink (and rightly so), Point Counter Point makes an incontrovertible case that it is a definitive classic in its own right."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Point Counter Point provokes all kinds of philosophical thoughts in my young, impressionable mind. But isn't that what I need? I love the way Aldous Huxley makes his readers think about their godless, fornicating lives and the impact it has on them and their world. Few authors cause me to feel the love for reading I have like Aldous Huxley does. Regardless of my age, I am a senior in high school, Huxley stampeded his way into my heart with Brave New World in ninth grade; then with Doors of Perception in eleventh; now he does it with Point Counter Point. I can live without a major plot as long as he continues to build his characters. No flat characters exist in any of Huxley's novels. Read them. Fall in love with him like I have."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"In Huxley's books, its not just the plot that captivates. Huxley's insights on society and people are so on target and so truthful, it's amazing. His ability to translate truth into words is incredible. Point Counterpoint is no exception:\\"Work's no more respectable than alcohol, and it serves exactly the same purpose: it just distracts the mind, makes a man forget himself. Work's simply a drug, that's all. It's humiliating that men shouldn't be able to live without drugs, soberly; it's humiliating that they shouldn't have the courage to see the world and themselves as they really are.\\"\\"But there is in debauchery something so intrinsically dull, something so absolutely and hopelessly dismal, that it is only the rarest beings, gifted with much less than the usual amount of intelligence and much more than the usual intensity of appetite, who can go on actively enjoying a regular course of vice or continue actively to believe in its wickedness.\\"\\"But the very possession of a body is a cynical comment on the soul and all its ways. It is a piece of cynicism, however, which the soul must accept, whether it likes it or no.\\"If these statements strike you as surprisingly truthful, then Huxley is for you.The theme of Point Counterpoint concerns the mind/body dichotomy, which I think is really interesting. It makes you think about yourself a little differently than you may be used to."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Lots of people have overanalyzed and overhyped the books on this site, but let me tell you this: Point Counter Point is Huxley's finest work. Sure &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; are popular titles, (popularized by quasi-intelligent hippies who THINK they understand things) but Point Counter Point really shows just how perceptive and thorough Huxley's literary style is. If you can disassociate Huxley's &quot;cult&quot; fans from his actual work, this is the one title I would reccomend. Stunning...."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Many years ago I saw the Masterpiece dramatization of Aldous Huxley's \\"Point Counter Point.\\" I have finally found time to sit down and read the original text. This is a wonderful novel. Huxley's command of English is striking. He is an artist- except that he uses words and not paint brushes to fill in the canvas. Some have compared \\"Point Counter Point\\" to Thackery's earlier work \\"Vanity Fair.\\" They were not wrong. It is interesting to note that Huxley writes of the deep cynicism and hypocrisy that infected post-WWI Europe. He captures a jaded society that has lost all moral bearings. He characters are cruel and brutal with their emotions and intellectual swords. Thackery also wrote after a long conflict- the Napoleonic Wars- and similarly captures a society bent on seeking pleasure and material satisfaction. Perhaps a major difference is that Thackery's characters are funny and amuse. Many of Thackery's creations would actually be fun to meet in person. Who would not want to spend an exhausting evening with Becky Sharp or the foppish Josh? The characters in Huxley's novel are far from agreeable. In fact, I could not wish to meet any of them in real life. However, Huxley captures an age. In fact, reading \\"Point Counter Point\\" I now understand better the collapse of the West in the face of Nazi aggression. Appeasement and the rapid collapse of France's Third Republic have always been a mystery to me. Huxley provides a clue- Western Europe after WWI had lost its moral compass and inner strength. The characters of Lucy Tantamoun and Burlap were bereft of true emotional empathy with their fellow human beings. Where Thackery paints a picture driven by material gain; Huxley tells of a society that suffers extreme ennui and moral abandonment, driven only by the pleasures of petty cruelty and puerile interests. This is a must read for anyone wanting to better understand the late 1920s and the onset of the 1930s. Otherwise, read it for the sheer pleasure of experiencing Huxley !"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"This striking portrait of early 20th century high society is the first book I read by Aldous Huxley. While exposing the lavish lifestyle of the literary and social elite as one of hypocracy and shared animosity, it also carries a strong philisophical undercurrent. He uses the satirical charaterizations to expound on his personal docterine, and does so in a way that is both accessable and entertaining.At times the book tended to be a tad meandering, without any real plot-driving focus of conflict, but somehow the lack of a linear plot deveopment is not that big of an issue once you get caught up in the flow of his writing style. I do caution readers to avoid the foreward, as it reveals one of the few major plot developments.This is one of my all time favorite novels, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys biting satire, brilliant dialogue, and discourses on a variety of subjects that are still applicable nearly a century later. And how can one resist a book that fits in the phrase &quot;the stertorous borborygmy of dispepsia&quot;?"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"pienso que es un libro muy bueno, que realmente vale la pena leer.

But the characters, who were simply viewed as intellectuals in their day, behave like people with Asperger's syndrome by today's educationally deficient standards. Even Rampion, the most mentally healthy character in the book, can quote French, alienates his family, and makes references to philosophers. Neurotypically normal people will nonetheless understand most of the characters' antics, but \\"Aspies\\" will identify more with the Quarles family and Marjorie than the other characters.Brave New World is the dystopia that Huxley is famous for, but this book depicts a dystopia as well-one that happened to exist in Huxley's time. His world was ruled by not a bread-and-circus government, but people who were so intelligent they didn't understand the meanings of love and friendship. Huxley himself is one of these people- he seems unable to conceive of any other kind of world than the one he lived in. Anatole France's THAIS, a book I'd never heard of until I read this, is referred to as a children's book. The proletariat are, with few exceptions, only mentioned as examples of the \\"unwashed masses\\"-apparently he didn't feel comfortable around them (one person with a colloquial English accent frightens Walter just by grumbling at him). No one seems to understand or utilize love except for the obviously abnormal (Rampion, Burlap). In these times, the characters' antisocial tendencies and formidable intellects seem especially striking; the world of PCP appears to be ruled by autism.I am recommending this to my psychatrist mother as a book that her autistic patients should read. I have a feeling it will find favor among them."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"The novel looks at more priveleged members of English society. Often, Huxley deals with their relationships and ponderings of the impact of scientific developments on society. Much of this is done well. However, the book is not one that engrosses the reader. The book was a chore to finish.Despite having some interesting personality traits and views, I found the characters mostly boring. The characters seemed to lack vitality.

The tragedies at the end left me scratching my head."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"This was probably the most disappointing book on the Modern Library list. I loved Brave New World, but it seems that I misunderstood one of it's main points. Huxley apparently opposed science and meant the book to be as much a warning about a science dominated future, as a warning about authoritarian government in general. From this perspective, Brave New World is nearly a crypto-Luddite tract.Huxley was generally something of a sensualist and an anti-rationalist. Like most men before him, he was troubled by the body/mind dichotomy that uniquely confronts humankind. But unlike the great thinkers who have been responsible for nearly all human progress, he (along with his friend DH Lawrence) came down on the side of the body and sensory experience, rejecting reason, science, religion, etc.. It seems to me that to choose the body over the mind is to reject the divine spark in man in favor of the animal instinct.Point Counter Point, a voluminous, wildly overpopulated, completely outdated roman a clef is meant to vindicate his viewpoint, but is so sarcastic as to undermine even his own arguments. Despite some funny set pieces and some interesting ideas, I'd not recommend this book and may have to revisit Brave New World.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"A very good piece of literature, but not a very good book."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"This is simply an amazing book. Compulsively readable even while it dazzles with long bravura political/intellectual conversations. You finish the book with a real feel for a particular moment in time, politically, artistically, personally and intellectually. What astonished me more is that Huxley creates a fictional character who eerily foreshadows the real life figure of Oswald Mosley, the British fascist leader of the 1930s. When I first read the book, I thought it was an actual, lightly fictionalized portrait of Mosley and his movement, only to learn that in fact Mosley did not come to prominence concurrent with the book. Do not miss this."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Point Counter Point was a scandal in its day, and is still an startlingly funny account of the literary and cultural elite of the 1920's. There are recognizable depictions of the famous personalities of the day. Various plots intertwine to culminate in an dramatic ending. The book describes a bygone era, England after the first war, with Victorian morals falling. Huxley has a gift for caricaturing individuals, lampooning mores, and playing with the varied intellectual and artistic fashions and fads of the 'twenties. Even read today, the book provides a liberating sense of iconoclasm and free thought, and is humorous to boot. Best to read and reread."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Huxley had to be one of the most astute minds of his age. Although Point Counter Point and a Brave New World are very different, Huxley's far sighted genius is evident on every page.The coversations of Spandrell, Pampion, Burlap and Phillip Quarles are deep and challenging touching subjects such as art, literature, religion, science, and sociology.Huxley also mixes infedelity and mudrer into his rather thin plot. The true value of Point Counter Point is its deep thought provoking conversations, not its plot."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Huxley's character portrayals are, as has been mentioned, sophisticated, fascinating and diverse, if not a little exaggerated. His ideas are, as always, well developed and insightful. The plot structure, as is typical in a character-driven novel, is virtually nonexistant - but we can forgive this. In fact, the only real problem I have with this book is a disagreement with Huxley's callow &quot;whole person&quot; thesis, which smacks of a kind of vague transcendentalism. Of course, this is a personal gripe, and I would encourage this book to anyone interested in a rather meandering examination of extreme personality types in early 1900's England."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Point Counter Point, considered one of Aldous Huxley's best novels, is an omniscient intertwining of myriad characters in all their glory, sin, sophistication and harsh cynicism. While little actually happens in the plot of the story, there is so much detail given to each character that we can essentially see their life through their eyes for the duration of the text.If it weren't for Aldous' ability to awaken his characters within the reader and donate a most wise introspective commentary to compliment each one, this book would have been a total loss for all involved. It is his insight and sheer breadth of intelligence that make all of Huxley's works a must-read for anyone in any generation.That said, I will add that I personally found this book to be almost a complete bore, and even fought myself to not put it down almost every time I picked it up. I realize that this is contradictory to everything I've just said, so allow me to explain.Keep in mind that this is pure opinion.Of Aldous' works that I have read, I find a sharp distinction between his early and latter writing. Antic Hay, Chrome Yellow, The Genius and The Goddess and Eyeless in Gaza and Point Counter Point are novels that address problems of an era that was, frankly, deceased long before I was born, and I found little interest in them because of this. I'm not saying that they weren't brilliant or provocative in their own right; merely that they spoke of things that were beyond me. Contrastingly, Brave New World, Brave New World Revisited, The Encyclopaedia of Pacifism, The Doors of Perception, Heaven and Hell, Ape and Essence, After Many a Summer and Island have each blown me away almost completely, and each in their own way. I couldn't say enough about any one of these novels, and in fact skipped writing a review of Island because I simply couldn't say anything intelligent enough about it that would come close to the level of brilliance within the text. I believe these novels to touch upon a much more personal philosophy that the others did not; each explores a personal avenue, often relating social implications to the fray, whereas the former group deals most explicitly with social implications and how they affect his characters. Broad statement I know, but this is a general summary of my thought patterns.Back to Point Counter Point, as this is supposed to be a review of the text, I won't be saying anything else about it. I feel that I can't do it justice since I didn't enjoy it, and insulting it for being outside the scope of my personal preference would be idiotic and more worthy of a Newspaper than this site.

Huxley does the same here, presenting a large cast of characters and allowing them to present their ideas separately, contrasting one viewpoint with another. He says, \\"In the human fugue there are eighteen hundred million parts....It is only by considering one or two parts at a time that the artist can understand anything.\\"This is a novel about life-philosophies and where they lead the separate characters. Huxley portrays one of his characters (a novelist, modeled upon himself) as writing, \\"The character of each personage must be implied, as far as possible, in the ideas of which he is the mouthpiece.\\" And that is exactly what Huxley does here. He also allows various characters to give long speeches wherein they explain their ideas.What Huxley is primarily concerned with is the balance that he feels must be achieved of the three aspects of man--the intellectual, the physical, and the spiritual or emotional.All of this sounds very boring, as I relate it, but it is not. It is often very funny. (A murdered corpse just going into rigor kicks his murderer. That was priceless.) The plot is actually quite interesting, including bits of high drama. The types of people portrayed are realistic, if a little exaggerated. The ideas are interesting; the writing is impeccable.It is slow-going reading, and the people seem more like stereotypes than real, so emotional investment in the novel is minimal.This is certainly an interesting read and very well done, but it is written with an almost entirely intellectual focus, revealing perhaps that Huxley had not achieved a balance in his own life."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I had no problems with this order.

I am sure we know a lot of the characters of this novel in the poeple we mingle with."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"This was the second Huxley read for me. First of course being BNW. While this and BNW are to differing books, it was PCP (I like the initials!) that really compelled me to read all of Huxley's other novels and explore others like Henry Miller, Gabriel Garcia Marqez, and William Faulkner. The influence this book has played on my desire to explore serious literary fiction has is probably why I am unafraid to state that this is my favorite book I have ever read. Considering how many novels I have perused through, that is not a small understatement.The reason for this is not because I find the characters easily likable. Spandrell and Phillip are the only two characters are particuarly find to likable people. As in that I would like to explore their minds over a cup of coffee with them. The beauty of this piece is Huxley's ability to delve into the sick desires and insecurities of his characters so it is astounding how easy it is to identify with your own thoughts and feelings about a particular situation. If you have had your heart broken by a woman, just look at the gut wrenching sickness of Bidlake and L. Tantamount's relationship for a feeling close to a cynics mind. For me Phillip's quiet \\"I prefer to be left alone with my own thoughts and desires attitude\\" is a beautiful commentary on someone who seems to have rejected what society has to offer us. Whether you hate or love a particular character almost all of them exhibit a characteristic that I have felt or identify with about modern society (it doesn't even matter this was published in 1928).Despite the converging, merging, and diversifying path of all the important characters, it locks into a nicely concluded puzzle with a ironic and bitter tragedy. Which is why it stands a notch above Those Barren Leaves. The story comes together. It is a beautiful piece of literature which my words cannot do justice."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"This book is fascinating, and Huxley's genius is evident on every page. However, his effort to create a giant contrapuntal mosaic of different voices fails in that it has almost no driving motion to propel it forward. In music, that motion is created by the beat. In writing, it is created by the story.While this book can be appreciated for its deep insight into human nature and exquisitely drawn characters, it remains more of a static work such as that of a photo or painting, and requires the reader to move through it, rather than moving the reader along. In a shorter book, this might work. In a work of this size, it leaves the vast majority of readers unsatisfied or abandoning the book. There is a reason why this book has so few reviews. It is not the fault of some readers that that Point Counter Point is not as popular or accessible as some of his other novels. It's because he has only appealed to the intellect capable of looking within a painting for an hour, and not the intellect who can listen attentively to an entire Mahler Symphony. To the musical intellect, this book teases with its occasional brief advances in action, then jerkingly stops the microscope repeatedly to focus on the characters. Huxley is unable in this book, like a true master, to keep the microscope moving."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I'll explain the title quote later; first let me say that I found the novel very well written. Every time I read a book I look for memorable quotes to pick out, and Point Counter Point scored well above average. But at the high level the book still failed for me. Huxley was trying to write a 'novel of ideas,' but I found this was executed at the expense of a plot. Most of the characters are mere caricatures--people like Willy Weaver and Charles Quarles--who are themselves entertaining parodies, but who don't give the novel any meat. And then the official characters don't much pick up the slack. Take Walter Bidlake, who opens the book stuck in his declining affair with Marjorie Carling. He was interesting at the start, and I found his courtship of Lucy Tantamount engaging, but after that their affair simply leaves off and they do nothing but exchange a few letters in the last 200 pages. Walter's story has no ending, but his is actually the most developed of them all. Other than that, the only really engaging piece of storytelling was that of Mark Rampion's courtship of his wife, but that was a standalone episode.So, without much plot, what do the characters spend their time doing? Mostly ranting. About how industrialized society is destroying our souls; how wealth and leisure make us frivolous and lazy; how the supercilious intellectual life is merely a crutch for people who can't deal with their fellow man, etc. While Huxley makes some good points, he doesn't counterbalance his criticisms with recommendations; and his characters are mostly examples of what not to do, so his theories end up pointing to nothing.And a lot of the book's arguments seemed manufactured and phony to me. This phoniness reached surreal heights in the last scene where Rampion listens to Beethoven's A Convalescent's Holy Song of Thanksgiving. I've heard it many times, and it's a great piece of music; but Rampion uses it as a launching point to say, \\"Why did [Beethoven] make castration and bodilessness his ideal? What's his music? Just a hymn in praise of eunuchism. Very beautiful, I admit. But couldn't he have chosen something more human than castration to sing about.\\" (p. 429) Rampion says to Beethoven, \\"What is your music?\\" and I say to Rampion, \\"What is your *deal*?\\" He isn't just over-analyzing the music: he's inventing completely artificial things to put on top of that music to over-analyze. Even the things he appears to enjoy he can only use as fodder for some blanket condemnation.The novel wore even thinner for me when I discovered that it was a roman &agrave; clef filled with people Huxley knew personally. I thought Lucy Tantamount was a great character, but the dignity of her as a literary construction lost some of its gilt when I realized that Huxley was merely demonizing a woman he had had his own bad affair with. Though I was surprised to find that Mark Rampion was supposed to be a depiction of D.H. Lawrence.Speaking of whom, in the end Point Counter Point reminded me of a quote from Lawrence's own Lady Chatterley's Lover. In it, Constance Chatterley is talking about her husband, Clifford, who is a young 'intellectual' writer, but:\\"Where the intellect came in, Connie did not quite see. Clifford was really clever at that slightly humorous analysis of people and motives which leaves everything in bits at the end. But it was rather like puppies tearing the sofa cushions to bits; except that it was not young and playful, but curiously old, and rather obstinately conceited. It was weird and it was nothing ... a wonderful display of nothingness. At the same time a display. A display! a display! a display!\\"(p. 53)That is exactly how I feel about Point Counter Point: slightly humorous, but leaves everything in bits at the end, and comes off as a conceited display of nothingness.Though, on reflection, I realized that Lady Chatterley's Lover was making a lot of the same core points as this book. In Chatterley, Constance begins having affairs because her husband was made crippled and impotent in the war; and Clifford tries to make up for his physical incapacity by devoting himself entirely to the intellectual life of a writer. But, as Clifford becomes more abstract and artificial, Constance and Oliver Mellors (the eponymous lover) move closer to nature and sensuality. And, while the lovers achieve happiness, the writer--for all of his success--only becomes frustrated and infantile. This seems like the same condemnation that Huxley was going for.Perhaps Lawrence was criticizing those who symbolically cripple themselves to work purely in the intellectual domain, because they only produce inferior works because of it. That was why he approached Lady Chatterley with the objective of simply telling a good story with well developed characters--the plain, non-intellectual book--, and yet he was still able to convey the points he wanted. But with Point Counter Point Huxley was trying the opposite: to throw out the plot and story entirely so that he could just focus on writing his 'novel of ideas.' But by discarding the mobility and moment of a story, it seems that Huxley--like Clifford Chatterley--was crippling himself. And, as such, between the two books I enjoyed Lady Chatterley's Lover much more."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I'm roughly two hundred pages into this work and can't put it down.

Great debate within over the struggle between passion and reason, hedonism and cold pursuit of &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;The better good&quot;. The book may seem slow, but there is no other way the story, or points could have been effectively made."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"The book has its quirks that make it more difficult to read now than it might have been in 1928. The proportion of dialogue to plot movement makes the book's structure look like an extended parlor discussion with only a few events that \\"happen to them\\" in between. The book is also stuffed to the limit with exposition on the nearly dozen main characters, each of whose primary flaw is both explained in narrative and demonstrated not in action, but in dialogue. Third, the details of 1920s British politics and the scholarly dialogue make some parts difficult to follow, to the point of obscurity.However, these flaws do not outweigh the sparkling portions of the book. If Huxley's dissection of the modern soul weren't so witheringly accurate and complete, this book might not have made mention outside its immediate time and place. Although this is from late in the book (Chapter 36), this passage (a journal entry in Philip Quarles' notebook) gives the summary statement of the problem:\\"It's incomparably easier to know a lot, say, about the history of art and to have profound ideas about metaphysics and sociology than to know personally and intuitively a lot about one's fellows, one's wife and children. Living's much more difficult than Sanskrit or chemistry or economics. The intellectual life is child's play; which is why intellectuals tend to become children -- and then imbeciles and finally, as the political and industrial history of the last few centuries clearly demonstrates, homicidal lunatics and wild beasts. The repressed functions don't die; they deteriorate, they fester, they revert to primitiveness. But meanwhile it's much easier to be an intellectual child or lunatic or beast than a harmonious adult man.\\"Huxley demonstrates this general principle in his characters, all of whom are intellectuals of the moment and are engaged in fields of painting, writing, biology, politics, religion, and seduction, and all of whom share neither the solution to the unhappiness of their predicament, or the moral strength to overcome their weaknesses. This is a morality play, but not of the traditional kind. Here, the tempter is not a horned figure with a pitchfork. Rather, it is a consequence of the modern world: the balkanization of the fields of knowledge and the allure of \\"whoring after abstractions\\" at the expense of arresting the development of real human qualities. To this extent, I don't believe this problem has been solved even with the transition forward from the modern world into a post-modern one, and the character studies still largely ring true today.That's not to say that today's moralists would agree to Huxley's solution to this problem. Rampion, the least flawed character in the book, says this as a rebuke to the religious ascetics and to the sexual and intellectual fetishists alike: \\"[I]t's a damned sight better to behave like a beast -- a real, genuine, undomesticated animal, I mean -- than to invent a devil and then behave like one's invention.\\" Judging by how Huxley spent his life thereafter, it appears that this was his own view as well."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I didn't like this book. Aldous Huxley has succeeded in creating a book in which every character is distasteful. There is simply not one character in the book who is likable or who has any redeeming qualities.Many other reviewers seem to suggest that the whole point of the book is to demonstrate the moral decay of English society around the time of the First World War. However, how can one seek to demonstrate moral decay without some point of moral reference? In order to do this, Huxley would need to create at least one character who establishes a moral point of reference by which the other characters in the book can be judged. There is simply no character in the book which fulfills this reference role. As a result, the book is no more than a fairly pointless and gratuitous description of decaying individuals.I had also expected Huxley to provide some well argued and intellectual insights into his own atheism and his general skepticism about organised religion. Unfortunately, in this regard, Huxley only succeeded in demonstrating his arrogance, stupidity and condescension - for example:\\"You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion. . . . Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat's meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.\\"A further reason for the title of my review, is that virtually nothing of substance happens in the entire book and the only significant events which do occur in the book, appear to occur for no apparent reason and are not explained. I found myself going back a few pages after one of these pointless events to check whether I had missed the explanation of why the event happened - unfortunately, there was no explanation.Give this book a miss!"},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I read this book several years ago and I am now adding it to my personal library. As one of your editorial reviewers notes, Aldous Huxley's explanation of the motives for actions filled gaps in my understanding of peoples' thinking. It is as valuable as a psychological textbook, and it is a lot more interesting. Seconding the reviewers' comments, this book is as appropo today as in the recent past. Modern man can reflect on the personalities of the characters and see how they betray themselves and others with subtle repressions of their real feelings. For the lovelorn on Valentine's day, Huxley's portrayal of a venal vixen provides soothing understanding for those who have endured similar rejections. Also, commentating on what one of the critics said, that Huxley showed his disapproval of science; this is another reason why it is a great novel. Science ignores the human spirit."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"After 100 pages I hated Point Counter Point. It was pretty nicely written, witty and urbane and filled with mildly amusing ponderings of people who like to show off how smart they imagine themselves to be. After the first 100 pages my vague recollection of reading Brave New World sometime years and years ago made my already underwhelming opinion nosedive. I hated the characters: hated their smug, self-righteous, utterly condescending self-importance and I was annoyed with Huxley for creating them.But I kept going, for an as yet uncertain reason compelled to at least finish it. And nothing changes . . .The turnaround comes in the slow, very subtle humanizing of these pompous jerks followed by a rapid and all-consuming anatomization of the nuance and flow of their personalities. Regardless of their lofty identities and superior postures, these people are flaked away, pulled apart, itemized and discarded with an ambitious and often roaring insight.I suspect many of Huxley's other novels resemble this slow-to-appreciate mumble of ramblings, often in dispute, of various social issues as seen by people who hardly care. Having ventured this one I might wish to avoid many of the others. Regardless of this eventual respect I still find myself irritated. Call it three-and-a-half, rounded up because it ends rather cruelly."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"Every time I write a review of a book which is considered \\"literature\\" I am afraid that some Pulitzer Prize winner dude with 2 PhDs is going to track me down and hit me over the head with his cane, but, since I move once a year, I will take my chances. I wish the rest of the book tasted like the first 20 pages. It starts with a series of insights of the minds of the characters which is just exquisite, but then it dilutes onto other things, which are much, much more mundane and I just do not see the same quality of thought put into the writing until some chapters ahead.My 2 cents."},{"Title":"Point Counter Point (Modern Library, 180.1)","review":"I love science fiction especially books like 1984, a brave new world, and Fahrenheit 451.

It also discusses NCAA requirements and athletic scholarships. In addition, it offers great tips on networking, budgeting, studying for exams effectively and maintaining self-discipline.

Regardless, the result is a fascinating account of growing up in the oil patch of West Texas. Billy and his family moved twenty two times with his dad chasing those wild cat wilds of the past. Most of their travels were in a big Hudson Terraplane and whenever anyone asked where they were headed the standard reply was &quot;Diddy Waw Diddy&quot;. Which a substitute word for whatever one wanted it to be...similar to Seinfeld's now famous yada, yada, yada.This book is filled with belly laughs that will keep you turning the pages for more but the best for me was the story about the woman who left her husband until he built her a dream home. After a few months it's finished and she returns to the find beautiful three story home awaiting her. It wasn't until she walked into the front door did she realize that it was only 12 feet wide and the back was a drive-in movie screen.This book is out of print but if you can run across a copy you'll find a very amusing look at the authentic life of families involved with helping to lubricate this country's industry toward the end of the Great Depression."},{"Title":"The Ghosts of Glencoe","review":"This book had alot of suspense, though I thought it was sort of boring at the start, it picked up and in the end I really liked it!

I witnessed many of the events described.Although I (the character Kevin) am a product of the mean streets and the dysfunctional family Edward so aptly describes, he rose above it all with an independent streak.This fine coming of age semi-memoir made me laugh out loud, hurt inside, and realize I am proud of the author.The depiction of the chief protagonist (Roberta) is so concise as to be eerie.Written in a stream of consciousness/flash back style, the book moves compellingly thru the trials and tribulations of a boy and then a man seeking answers to often unanswerable questions."},{"Title":"Glory Be to the Father, the Son","review":"From the very beginning of Richard Stickann's first novel, &quot;Glory Be to the Father, the Son&quot; I felt like I could identify with Edward. He came from a very dysfunctional family, and he had the courage and determination to rise above it. The father and mother in this book seemed very cold and rigid, which was very commonplace in that era. When reading about Roberta, the coniving, dominant, yet helpless sister, I felt the urge to scream. Kevin wasn't exactly the perfect role model for any younger sibling. Yet, Edward seemed a better person for not being the same way as his parents or siblings.I was very proud of Edward for breaking free from his parents when he became of age. I'm suprised the father even noticed, since he never seemed to care about anything else that Edward did.The descriptions of the Catholic Church were hilarious. Another good choice made by Edward was to leave the seminary, considering the state of the Church in this day and age.The book was sometimes hard to follow since it was written in a chain of consiousness style, but overall, it was an excellent story, and will be highly recommended to others."},{"Title":"Glory Be to the Father, the Son","review":"Many books have been written on the subject of coming of age, of discovering one's self in the midst of adult antagonism. Richard Stickann's \\"Glory Be To The Father, The Son . . .\\" is an admirable inclusion to this list, containing well-rounded characters and a tremendous ability to both laugh at itself and sob out loud.In the book, Edward, a shy, pious youth growing up on the South Side of Chicago, is in constant emotional struggle with his self-serving mother, his impossible sister, his trouble-making older brother, and especially his emotionally unavailable father, who is fairly nonexistant in Edward's life except for his lifeless, beer drinking, television watching, farting clay form parked in the tv room whenever Edward passes through. As the book moves through Edward's life I found myself struggling along with him as he was faced with decision after decision on whether or not he should fight for his parents' attention and affection, or whether he should abandon them altogether. The book is written mainly in flashback as Edward reflects on his childhood during the death of his parents, and while this allows us to know the outcome of his familial relations fairly early on, the way the past got him there continually surprised and delighted/horrified me.This is definitely a first novel. Evidence is seen in its sometimes choppy passages and its knack for overemphasizing certain characters and ideas. However, it is also seen in its pureness, its boldness, and its ability to portray the pain and struggle of this character's childhood with such candor and humility. Raw emotions are splashed across every page and much of them portrayed exceedingly well through the thought process of an adolescent.\\"Glory Be To The Father, The Son . ..\\" is a must-read for anyone who grew up amongst the trials and frustration of familial dysfunction. Every person should see bits of him/herself in Edward, as he is a wonderful, likeable conglomerate of every adolescent's struggle for acceptance, respect and affection."},{"Title":"Rutherford B Hayes Statesman of Reunion","review":"Alas, so much of this book is taken up with white supremacist rants of the vilest sort that one wonders if Eckenrode was capable of any objectivity whatsoever.

He uses his friend to illustrate the value to be gained from interacting regularly with achievers who have left their legacy to us in print form.

He uses his mother as another illustration, writing \\"her books were marked and marked again, and any sentence that was good was underscored.\\"Like all of Dr. Peale's other books, this one is full of practical wisdom. He doesn't just cite the principles, he teaches you how to apply them. This book truly does live up to its title."},{"Title":"Programming for Linguists: Perl for Language Researchers","review":"This book is overly simplistic even for linguists with no programming experience. The problem I had with it is that it had too few examples of applications that could be written to deal with linguistic research. It would have been good to offer a real world example of say a syntactic parser or the like. Functions which are particularly pertinent to linguistics should have been highlighted a lot more to be a better more effective manual for the non-programming linguist.Also, by leaving out technical details of perl it is harder for the non-programmer to go on to other perl sources. Overall I found this book to be an okay basic starter for a non-programmer, but not particularly useful for linguists who are interested in automating linguistic processes."},{"Title":"Programming for Linguists: Perl for Language Researchers","review":"I hate to write negative reviews, but this book deserves it. Both the title, \\"Programming for Linguists,\\" and the subtitle, \\"Perl for Language Researchers,\\" are misleading. This book is really just another \\"Perl for Dummies\\" book, and not a very good one. There is no code here that is relevant to either linguistics or language research. Linguists who want to learn Perl would be better off with an introductory text from O'Reilly."},{"Title":"Programming for Linguists: Perl for Language Researchers","review":"I was interested in this book as a possible text for students learning Perl in introductory computational linguistics. I had learned some perl from the O'Reilly &quot;Learning Perl&quot; book, but never really used the language.I was really happy to find full sample programs illustrating almost exactly what I wanted to do. Because the examples and exercises were all things I was familiar with I found itvery easy to immediately begin modifying the programs. The last sections with a sample web-spider was particulary fun, and made it possible to start searching for web examples almost immediately.There are two drawbacks with the book. It's a good introduction to Perl, but quite early on you'll need to supplement it with other texts, like the Perl Cookbook. The second drawback has to do with the orientation. Most of the example programs are geared to language students but few of the examples illustrate work with corpora. The book would be more useful as an introductory text if there were more examples about text normalization, searching corpora, simple tagging, etc."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"As a native Chicagoan, I was living there when the allegations of sexual abuse against Cardinal Bernardin came out back in 1993. Being quite young still, as well as not being Roman Catholic, and not having a whole lot of contact to the Roman Catholic Church, I didn't know who he was before then. However, from that point onward, Cardinal Bernardin became more of a presence in Chicago, in good part because of his loving attitude toward his accuser, whose charges were false, and because of all the work he did trying to work for the good of all people, Roman Catholic or not. Therefore, when he died in 1996, I, as well as most of the city of Chicago, mourned the passing of a truly great man.This book is an autobiographical \\"letter\\" from Cardinal Bernardin chronicling the last three years of his life. It's written as somewhat of a long letter to the reader, and at once one gets drawn in to the utter love and the kindness that radiate through the words written in the pages of this book.I had been looking for something to learn more about the kind of person Cardinal Bernardin was and the sort of things that he taught. I was fairly dubious that I would \\"get\\" much from this book, as a lot of it is written about his battle with cancer, and with him facing an imminent death. However, I ended up enjoying it immensely. It's just a bit eerie as well, because by the time he finishes it up, he knows his time on earth is extremely short, and the reader is kind of put in a place of seeing glimpses of the world as he must have seen it in that fall in Chicago. Here I was, in that same city, seventeen years old, and \\"starting\\" life as a college freshman. And yet, despite this disparity, there is something very comforting, and something that rings very, very true in the writing, something that made me devour the words, ending up reading the book in the matter of a few hours.Cardinal Bernardin finished this book on 1 November 1996, and died two weeks afterward. The Gift of Peace. Yes. May his spirit be eternal."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"Recently I lost my father to a 10 year bout with cancer. This book provided me with joy, tears and abudance within a month of my own fathers death. Cardinal Bernardin was a remarkable man who had the courage to face his accusers, his illness and ulitmately his death. He has reconfirmed that faith, hope, love, forgivenss and kindness is the very essentials of what life needs to be about. It is clear from the Cardinal as it was from my experience with my own father that even when you think you are at your darkest human hour you need to reach out and make a difference every single day until your final moment in this part of your journey here on earth.This book is a must read for anyone who has doubted that there is peace in death. He reconfirms that the lessons most important in life are to continue to give of yourself every day despite the adversities you face. In his illness, through his false accusation and his wonderful rediscovery of a deeper faith in Christ it makes accepting God's plan for you important.Anyone who has an ill parent or someone close to them should read this book it will give you a much clearer spiritual understanding of illness, death and living every moment under God's plan."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"A year ago, on November 14, 1996, our beloved Cardinal Bernardin died, as we the people of his flock, spent time in prayer and reflection over his years as our shepherd. It is amazing to realize how we were enveloped into his loving care, even as he lay dying. Some months later, his book, &quot;The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections&quot; was published, as his gift to us. More than its worldwide sales, is its personal value to those who read it, perhaps once, maybe several times. How many people near death will ever have the energy to focus on the Lord's Presence, amidst physical pain? For Cardinal Bernardin, the pain he wrote about may have focused on physical and emotional difficulties that surfaced in the final three years of his life, but clearly, there are words in his book that can yet feed the flock, &quot;how if we let Him, God can write straight with crooked lines,&quot; if only we let go of the control and allow HIM to direct our life's journey. This does not mean we should make no plans, but rather, set aside time daily to draw close to the Lord, and let go of the concerns that may grip us --- to make room for HIM in our lives. Is there room for HIM in the inn of our deepest selves? There is no other option. No matter what difficulties or hurts arise, we are all still family, always needing to work on healing; the other choice leaves us without family and friends. Cardinal Bernardin speaks of redemptive suffering -- the kind Jesus felt, the kind we may experience. The message clearly leads the reader to know that we, like Jesus, can move beyond the suffering, toward something better, allowing the Lord to work in our lives, bringing us into communion with Him and others who are feeling pain and suffering. In the midst of his pain, Bernardin's faith was strong, but he was preoccupied with the pain. His message is this: develop a strong prayer life in your best moments so you can be sustained in your weaker moments. Lean on family and friends, and church community, as they minister. As you read this book, you may feel the connection with Cardinal Bernardin because either you or a family member or friend is experiencing the pain and suffering of illness. Cardinal Bernardin's presence remains with us, in these words, &quot;Pray while you're well, because if you wait until you're sick, you might not be able to do it.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"Joseph Cardinal Bernadin of Chicago was one of the leading lights of the Roman Catholic church through the past few decades; in the last three years of his life (he died in 1996) he endured the beginnings of the scandals of the church (including accusations, later proved false, against himself) as well as a recurring battle with cancer. Through all of this, Bernadin was able to find peace, and it was the peace of God, a peace that is a gift and grace from God.While the issue of the false accusation is the first piece of the text, it does not dominate it. After a few pages, it is over and done with. One wonders at such power of forgiveness. Perhaps it was in response to the next, final battle that became much more dominant. Prominent throughout the book is the battle with cancer. Bernadin speaks of his own struggles and fears, but puts these in perspective as he became acquainted with the others who were getting treatment with him. He became, in his words, an unofficial chaplain to the other cancer patients. Bernadin struggled to maintain his sense of faith that all who similarly suffer must endure - as Bernadin said, it was finally time to practice what he preached! He renewed his sense of the importance of prayer, and his sense of ministry. While his post-operative treatments would only require ten minutes, he often found his visits would last for hours, as he visited with others. When the hospital staff offered to make private entrance and exit arrangements so that he would not be \`disturbed', he countered with the observation, \`I'm a priest first, a patient second.'Bernadin shares letters he received from other cancer patients, their families and friends, all added to his prayer list. It grew from the handful of people he met to well over 700 names in a very short time. The letters are touching, some asking for prayers, some also offering prayers. The farmer who knew the seasons, who wished the Cardinal faith as his harvest time drew near; the fathers and mothers of children who asked for special prayers for children or gave thanksgiving for recoveries; all these letters are important.There is a difficulty with dying publicly, as Bernadin had to endure. There was also a responsibility, to make valid a lifetime spent in the ministry. Relating the story of his recent visit with Fr. Henri Nouwen, Bernadin found peace in the idea that life is a preparation for death, and those who have lived life in the faith should see death as a friend. Bernadin also found faith in the example of Jesus - when the doctors gave Bernadin his final pronouncements of \`inoperable' and \`incurable', he finally knew what Jesus felt in the Garden of Gesthemane.One touching aspect of this book is that it was completed in draft form less than two weeks prior to Bernadin's death. Being a man who took pride in his penmanship, he decided he wanted to write (actually write, not type or draft for typeset) the opening section (done on All Saints Day, 1996), the cover, and section dividers. The publishers kept this promise, so one feels a real sense of connection with the text.It is not an easy thing to die. It is even harder to watch someone else. Walking with Bernadin during his final days as this book permits the reader to do in many ways will help all of us for a journey we are destined to make, and to relate more fully to others who are on the same journey, on the road to eternity."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"America was drawn to the story of Joseph Cardinal Bernardin when he publicly shared with the community of the Archdiocese of Chicago the news that his liver cancer was inoperable on August 30, 1996. The Cardinal wrote The Gift of Peace to share his thoughts on the last three years of his life. His writing reflects the principal role of a Roman Catholic bishop - - the teaching office, to nourish within the community the principles of faith illustrated by the realities that present themselves in the course of everyday life.Like most Americans outside of Chicago, I first learned about the Cardinal in the news coverage that accompanied his last year on the front pages of the newspapers. He wanted to walk with the community as he confronted his death. Sharing with the community both the pain of his illness and the discoveries of the intellect that bridged for him, first acceptance of his terminal illness, and then the process of personal reconciliation of his life journey.There are so many books upon the shelves of Amazon.com on the topic of Death and Dying. None of them adequate to the task of being \\"how to's\\", but offering reasonable guidance for that most personal of tasks, confronting personal death and death in the family. Yet, I keep coming back to The Gift of Peace. Perhaps, because of the Cardinal's one-to-one conversation by which he engages the reader.For those of us that can prepare for death, a struggle may develop as we form a personal inner conversation to embrace with grace and maturity and purpose our changed fortune. The Cardinal models in the journey of his illness the direction our own path may take.Upon hearing the first fateful news of his illness, the Cardinal experienced a feeling of helplessness. The same helplessness I nervously experienced when the heart specialist began taking my history. The Cardinal acknowledged then, as I did also, the state of great anxiety as patients wait to hear from doctors what their fate will be. \\"God was teaching me yet again just how little control we really have and how important it is to trust in him.\\"The Cardinal describes how terrible illness changes lives - - not only the life of the person carrying it, but also the lives of friends and family members who love and care for that person. We follow in the book's narrative the Cardinal's trajectory along illness as described by Therese A. Rando: keeping alive, understanding and acknowledging the illness, experiencing the pain, framing realistic expectations and completing unfinished business.And in the midst of the Cardinal's struggle, he continued his own ministry to others with cancer. \\"Somehow when you make eye contact,\\" he says, \\"when you convince people that you really care - - that at that particular moment they are the only ones that count - - then you establish a new relationship.\\" It is all about entering into an intimacy with those we minister to, however brief, forever permanent.Jesus learned this lesson from the Canaanite woman to whom he first avoided, saying he was sent to minister only to the house of Israel.\\" She continued to confront him, to engage him. She established a relationship that from that moment forward propelling Jesus' ministry beyond Israel to embrace all the nations. For ministry, the Cardinal concludes, is about imparting a sense that \\"somehow you truly care and have somehow mediated the love, mercy and compassion of the Lord.\\"Ministry to the dying is all about strengthening the relationship between each person and God. I understand that each of our ministerial encounters is unique. Our need for healing is no different in dying than in living - - however the more apparent and actively sought out for. I strive to go to the bedside with practical skills fashioned around a dynamic toolbox of appropriate pastoral applications.A dynamic shaped by what the Cardinal would call prayer and prayer's search for peace. Peace that accompanies recognition, acceptance, reconciliation. And as a pastor, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin offers us a simple prayer that we may find the gift of peace. It is in the journey toward death's great mystery that we call out to the Lord for peace. The peace that finds voice in prayer. Prayer that nourishes. Prayer that heals. Prayer that reconciles. Prayer that brings us to salvation."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"Former Cincinnati archbishop and Chicago Cardinal-Archbishop Joseph Bernardin knew he was dying when he undertook this final goodbye to the peoples of his Church. It is impossible to open this slender volume and not have that foremost in mind. Even the opening pages here are hand-written in the Cardinal's beautiful penmanship. This man, once seriously considered American's one great hope for the Papacy, lived a life in so many ways worthy of imitation. The late Cardinal was imperfect, needless to say, and his personal epistemological beliefs were not shared by all Americans, but in the good things that may be known of him, he was inspiring in a highly positive way. He personified modesty, dignity, grace, and exercised almost super-human powers of personal forgiveness as demonstrated in his laying aside all enmity toward the troubled young man who falsely accused him of molestation. Bernardin was a man who committed the first hour of every day of his life to prayerful meditation, and in a reversal of the past dogmatic intolerance of Catholicism, advocated the ecumenical consanguinity of all humans regardless of race, religion or creed. When visiting a Chicago-area synagogue during his time as Cardinal, Bernardin greeted the Jewish worshipers there by telling them, \\"I am Joseph, your brother.\\"This book tells in his own words Bernardin's battle with the cancer that ultimately killed him. He was a man who did not shun death, he embraced it as part of life, and--in his view-the doorway to a better existence. It also tells of how his faith sustained him in his darkest hour (far more dire, he confesses, than the terminal cancer) which came in the months that followed the unfounded accusations of pederasty made against him by a one-time seminarian.Bernardin, through this last book, founds a legacy of moral goodness that should stand as a challenge not just to Roman Catholics but to humanity everywhere, to lay aside anger, pessimism and violence, and strive toward a life in which hope, peace, selflessness, form the foundation. In this post-911 world, we probably need more than ever to remember that there are, were, and will be good people in human society who set examples for all of us. In The Gift of Peace it is our privilege to know one.Bernardin, who completed this work on November 1, 1996, passed away on November 14th of that same year. I remember waking up to the news on local television as I was preparing for classes in my final year at a Catholic school in his one-time archdiocese. I was struck then that he was truly gone and that such a figure of profound importance, about whom I'd grown up hearing so much, wouldn't be there any longer. However, through this book, in a way, his life and works can, via inspiration, still prove influential.This man will one day be a canonized Saint of his church, and this is his last earthly \\"talk\\" to those of remaining in this life."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"Cardinal Bernardin honored us all with this book. He reveals his personal struggles with a humiliating false accusation, a devastating diagnosis of cancer, and, almost miraculously, it comes as close to a man's account of his own death as we can get. He closes the book just days before he died and writes of knowing that he will die. And yet there is nothing creepy about reading it. The reader can only hope and pray that he or she will meet adversity, even death, with the courage and compassion of Cardinal Bernardin.

As Archbishop of Chicago and later a Cardinal, Cardinal Bernardin was a well-known leader in Catholic circles. The accusation of sexual misconduct leveled at him by a young man catapulted the cardinal into the national spotlight in a humiliating way. Later, the young man recanted his tale and met personally with Cardinal Bernardin to apologize. Through this whole ordeal, the Cardinal acted with great faith, but was naturally bewildered about a charge from a person he did not know about something he knew he did not do. He found the words of John 8:32 (The truth will set you free) to be his guiding light and found their promise fulfilled.The story of the allegations and their later withdrawal is a small part of the recollections he shares with us in his very personal and intimate style. The major thrust of the book concerns his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and how he struggled with his fate and rediscovered a newer and stronger faith in God. In a very heartfelt way he discusses his understanding of suffering---not merely its inevitability but also its purpose and redemptive value. He recalls quite vividly the words Jesus used at the Last Supper, knowing that in a matter of hours he would be crucified. \\"Love one another. Such as my love has been for you, so must your love be for each other. This is how all will know you as my disciples: your love for one another.\\" Cardinal Bernardin lived these words, most completely in the last three years of his life, the period covered by this remembrance.As noted by others, this book comes as close as any to a person describing their final days on earth and preparing to enter the kingdom of God. Cardinal Bernardin finished the book on November 1, 1996 and died thirteen days later on November 14, 1996.

No matter what difficulties or hurts arise, we are all still family, always needing to work on healing; the other choice leaves us without family and friends. Cardinal Bernardin speaks of redemptive suffering -- the kind Jesus felt, the kind we may experience. The message clearly leads the reader to know that we, like Jesus, can move beyond the suffering, toward something better, allowing the Lord to work in our lives, bringing us into communion with Him and others who are feeling pain and suffering.In the midst of his pain, Bernardin's faith was strong, but he was preoccupied with the pain. His message is this: develop a strong prayer life in your best moments so you can be sustained in your weaker moments. Lean on family and friends, and church community, as they minister. As you read this book, you may feel the connection with Cardinal Bernardin because either you or a family member or friend is experiencing the pain and suffering of illness. Cardinal Bernardin's presence remains with us, in these words, \\"Pray while you're well, because if you wait until you're sick, you might not be able to do it.\\""},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"Cardinal Bernadin, in clear easy reading form, teaches us how to live in the face of profound suffering.

His decision to stop treatment when he did reflects a wish to have his life end on his own terms. This book is wonderful: one can see why the Cardinal was so popular with his parishioners, and why he was such a great influence in the American Catholic Church. He will be missed."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"I was happy to recieve the book fast but I was disappointed that there were so many notes written in margins of the book! Oh well. Overall I loved the book! Good read(:"},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"We used this book as one of our monthly Book Club selections. We had a wonderful discussion.For me the whole book is a commentary on what he says on the first page. He learned to \\"let go.\\" the rest is all a way of living a CHristian life from this point of view; not be attached to anything but keep your eyes on God alone.Based on the Gospel of Jesus, this ability of \\"letting go\\" is the secret of Christian life; to allow God to work in us and through us require that we learn how to discern His will. Once we do this, we can live our lives without letting the storms determine the direction of our journey.Cardinal Bernardin learned this the hard way.I read the book in a couple of hours but had to go back again over and over to let the truth of his experience sink in my own heart.I particularly enjoyed the chapter titles: they used his own handwriting. It was his wish. I liked that he reclaimed beauty (handwriting) in a world that was being destroyed by the ugliness of his illness.easy read, thought provoking, life changing book."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"\\"Subito Santo!\\"(Make him a saint now!) was my first thought as I finished reading \\"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin\\". This was a book I noted when it first was published, but I waited to read it until now. Perhaps I thought it would be sad or even depressing. How wrong I was! This is an uplifting book, recounting in his own words the major events of the last three years of Cardinal Bernardin's life. It is a book filled with moving stories of reconciliation, kindness,care of others even in the face of his own debilitating illness, and love of the highest order. It is the truest expression of the saying \\"Let go and let God\\" I have ever encountered.This is not a long book and I suggest reading its short chapters over several days or weeks. This will allow the \\"Gift of Peace\\" the book offers--which is Cardinal Bernardin's real legacy--to take root and grow in the reader. If this happens, the book has served its purpose and Cardinal Bernardin, now in the company of the saints in light (even if not an official saint yet) can, himself, rest in peace.\\"Santo subito!\\" Make him a saint now!"},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"The Gift of Peace was recommended to me by the rabbi who presided over my father's funeral, which tells you something about its universal appeal.

This is the union that Cardinal Joseph Bernardin spoke of in \\"The Gift of Peace\\". The frivilous matters of this world mean little when they are placed in the proper perspective. Bernardin's tumultuous final three years of life led him through false accusations of misconduct and cancer. He invites to follow his journey in the book as he puts his life in the proper perspective and prepares for his eternal reward.Just as Jesus suffered and died to be reborn to greater things, we do the same. Death is a passage to a greater life. As one becomes ready to die, they begin the process of \\"putting their life in order.\\" There is also the matter of putting the soul in order which is acknowledged less frequently. Bernardin advises readers to pray now as it is often difficult to find the strength or focus during sickness. Additionally, by praying now we are more prepared to release the worries of this world and trust our fate to God. Worrying about what is out of our control is among the most frivilous wastes of energy during illness. In the book, Bernardin readily admits that even he was unsure if he was praying well at times. The truth is that your prayer life will tell you when it is adequate.One need not being dying to appreciate Bernardin's wisdom. We all have our daily sufferings or cross to bear. Bernardin's wisdom provides strength for the journey as we embrace death as a friend and passage to eternal peace. Even our sufferings our only a passage to greater things. Bernardin has written a masterfully written, spiritually uplifting book that only hints of the peace in the next life."},{"Title":"The Gift of Peace: Personal Reflections (Walker Large Print Books)","review":"Cardinal Bernardin talks candidly about dealing with a false accusation of sexual misconduct, his panceatic cancer, and his later terminal illness and preparation for death.

It is like having a wonderful text read to us at bedtime as we listen on levels spiritual and psychological unreached by silent reading. Please notice the audiobook of this present precious text of peace is read by a Monsignor, a close coworker of this blessed Cardinal.The false accusations of abuse made against this great American Cardinal were quickly cleared up, and this slim volume insightfully and clearly records that process and the holy process of reconciliation with his false accuser, in a lesson for us of peace and reconciliation and of forgiveness of those who most completely destroy us. The Cardinal truly lives and demonstrates for us the promise we make each time we pray the Our Father. Forgive us in the same way that we forgive those who have trespassed against us. Forgive us with the same forgiveness we show others. Just as we must do unto others what we want others to do for us, JEsus also calls us actively to forgive others in the same way we want the Father to forgive us. This saintly and courageous Cardinal Forgave the disturbed young man who falsley accused him of abuse, and this book well displays the process, that we might also learn to forgive, in the Love of God, in our interpersonal relationships and national policies.How many times must we forgive, o Lord. Not seven but seventy times seven.We need in our national Catholic Church this voice now more than ever. Read this book and weep and become renewed in our Gospel mission to love and to forgive and to spread the good news to the poor and liberation to the captives. Sight to the Blind. In this time of unjust war and overwhelming violence, we need to hear this book.Yet some Catholics for political reasons continue to condemn this saintly man (while silent on Cardinal Law), eagerly assuming the accusations true, or some association with others similarly accused, in order not to hear the exhortation by this great Cardinal that the right to life does not end at birth, but at a natural and God given death. The right to life must be supported at every point in our life and in every aspect of life. This great CArdinal elaborated for our edification the seamless garment explanation of the right to life.Womb to tomb.Please read this book.I must rush to Mass now, and I bring this book with me to help my confused prayer. I thank God this great and holy and courageous Cardinal left us this Gift of Peace in the weeks before his untimely death. As head of the USCCB at the time of the crafting of the prophetic letter The Challenge of Peace, his courageous voice is needed now more than ever.

Cardinal Bernardin leads the reader through his last days of life as he deals in a very graceful and touching way with terminal cancer, life's issues and personal spirituality. It's not long until the reader feels he or she is walking the journey with a close friend. Through his experinece, Cardinal Bernardin helps the reader deal with his or her own mortality in a peaceful way. He is still ministering to us.

Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, the late Archbishop of Chicago, completed this work just 13 days before he died of pancreatic cancer. It may be, therefore, particularly good for cancer patients or people facing death. He tells us simply and honestly of the trials of his last years and days - a false accusation from a former seminarian, his illness, his ministry to fellow cancer patients, his final acceptance of death. It is rare than anyone has graced so many of us as much as he has by the manner of his dying. I was privileged to see Cardinal Bernadin a few months before his death. I was impressed even from a distance with his simplicity, humility, acceptance and peace. He was clearly a man who was (the Irish would say) \\"thinning.\\" He seemed transparent and shining with the inner light of someone who had been tried in the fires and had had burned away anything that was dross, a person who had stood naked before the whole world and had stood the test of it.

In this short well-written book Cardinal Bernardin candidly talks about the horror of being falsely accused of sexually abusing a seminarian while serving as Archbishop of Cincinnati. When the accusation came out as nation-wide news, Bernardin was then the Archbishop of the Chicago diocese. In this book he describes how he handled this erroneous attack on his reputation and that of the Catholic Church. It is an uplifting beginning of the book and a welcome one considering the many true sexual scandals that the Church now faces.Bernardin courage was tested again when he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer. Once again he rose to the challenge and put his faith and future in the hands of God.The Gift of Peace is a must read for anyone, religious or otherwise, who faces a problem that he or she thinks is beyond their capability to handle.

However, he did not adequately address certain issues which were pressing to me. These included God giving Noah permission to eat meat, God providing a garment of skin for Adam and Eve, the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, Jesus eating meat and Paul's arguments against vegetarianism. Richard Young does and excellent job addressing all of these and other issues. He approaches each issue and question with straight forward honesty. Frequently, I felt as if he brought up an issue with which there was not good vegetarian response. However, he would address how it is normally read, frequently in complete agreement with the traditional reading of the passage, but then very gently present a fresh perspective.Some Christian vegetarian groups use dubious historical documents to \\"prove\\" that Jesus and/or his disciples were vegetarian. Young does nothing of the kind, in fact, he debunks those attempts. He is very honest and straightforward in presenting his case.I would strongly recommend this book for the Christian who is struggling with animal rights and vegetarianism from a Biblical perspective. If a Christian is not struggling with these issues, perhaps they should and this book would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"One of the most important things about this book is that it does NOT, I repeat NOT, try to reinvent Jesus as a vegetarian. There have been some attempts to try to &quot;prove&quot; Jesus was vegetarian, but the author finds the evidence for such reinventions to not be compelling. The author basically concludes that some consumption of meat is biblically acceptable, so long as the animal has been treated with care and compassion during its life. On the other hand, the author also concludes that vegetarian is preferred, and factory farming would have to be contemptable in God's eyes. By the way, I'm personally an agnostic, and one of the reasons why I have turned away from Christianity is that the Christian church, in general, does not see the obvious truth to the immorality of factory farming. This book is must reading."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"I am saddened by a previous review by &quot;a reader&quot; on July 26, 2000. I wonder if this person even read the book. Or did they read it with a closed mind and heart? What makes this book so wonderful is the author's ability to remain unbiased while using scriptual evidence to answer very complicated questions. Unlike some of the more complex books on the study of Christianity and Animal Rights (e.g. Andrew Linzey's Animal Theology), Richard Alan Young writes in a clear, consise, and easy-to-understand manner yet manages to answer all the important questions that arise when considering this complex subject. This should be required reading for anyone who calls themself a Christian. Truthfully, it would be easier to not read this book and not think about how your life adds to the suffering and violence inflicted upon animals (ignorance is bliss), but I urge you to read this book, ask God to open your heart and mind, and let Him through His Word change the way you view animals."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"I must say that I was initially put off by the title of this book. I assumed from the title that this must be another one of \\"those\\" Christian arguments for vegetarianism--you know, the ones that use out of context prooftexts to argue that Jesus really was a vegetarian. However, one of my colleagues did his Ph.D. work with Richard Alan Young, and he told me that Young was not only an excellent scholar, but a person who lived his convictions. So I decided to give the book a try, in spite of the title.I am so glad I did. Young deals with the major issues and texts which arise when the question of vegetarianism is posed. Each chapter heading is a question which leads the author into a discussion of the relevant texts and historical background. He addresses questions like \\"Was Jesus a Vegetarian?\\" \\"Didn't God Permit Us to Eat Meat?\\" and \\"Didn't Paul Condemn Vegetarianism as Heresy?\\" with honesty and theological integrity. He does not try to force intepretations out of the texts, but lets them speak for themselves, offering a balanced and evenhanded treatment.Most importantly, Young offers one of the best arguments for Christian vegetarianism I've read to date. He does not resort to prooftexting or spurious arguments based on scant biblical evidence. Instead he builds the case for vegetarianism upon a much broader biblical perspective--the peaceable kingdom. In sum, Genesis 1 and 2 offer the ideal view of human existence: humans and animals are vegetarians, humans are the caregivers of God's creation, the world and all creation are at peace. Unfortunately, all that is shattered in Genesis 3. However, the biblical material looks forward to a reinstatement of that original harmony. Examining the prophets vision of the peaceable kingdom, Young concludes that the role of Christians is to do God's will on earth as it is in heaven. In other words, Jesus' vision of the kingdom of heaven is a here and now concept, not a concept that will occur only in heaven. \\"The peaceable kingdom encompasses the full range of human moral aspirations, depicts peaceful coexistence between humans and nonhumans, and represents the goal toward which God is guiding history\\" (150).Our job as Christians is to envision the peaceable kingdom and work to bring it about. Christ's act on the cross was an act of restoration, not just between humans and God, but between humans and other humans, and humans and all creation. Thus, Christians are to be actively involved in that restorative vision. If the peaceable kingdom is to be established, one fundamental step toward that outcome is refraining from eating meat. There can be no peace between animals and humans if we continue consuming animals.Additional touches set this book apart as well: each chapter concludes with a wholesome vegetarian recipe; the last chapter offers a basic discussion of how to \\"go vegetarian;\\" and Young provides a bibliography for further reading.Don't be put off by the title of the book--I found out that the publisher insisted upon it to make the book more \\"provocative.\\" This book is a must read for any Christian who desires to investigate Christianity's relationship to animal rights and vegetarianism. It is well written, thoroughly researched, and easily accessible to anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"A very thoughtful friend (who is a vegetarian) recommended this book to me. Though a meat-eater for nearly 30 years, I decided to give this book a try. I was pleasantly surprised.First, Young writes in a cool, level-headed fashion that doesn't come across as angry or accusatory. Unlike other books on the subject, this feels more scholarly and balanced.Second, Young takes you through the Bible with remarkable insight. It is a deeply Christian work throughout. His arguments mainly depend on understanding the whole story, and what he calls &quot;directional markers.&quot; This is a very powerful idea that I think really illuminates many modern ethical issues. To his credit, he does not try to argue that Jesus and the apostles were vegetarians, and that this message was somehow corrupted later on. He brilliantly argues that the situations of modern slaughterhouses did not exist in biblical times, and that the fundamental values of Christianity are in opposition to them. He does point out that human history in the bible is bracketed by vegetarian behavior (cf Genesis 1-2 and the Isaiah description of the &quot;peaceable kingdom&quot;). Why then should we not move toward this goal?My one cavil with the book is that it is not written for the evangelical Christian (which I am). His view of Scripture would certainly make many evangelicals uncomfortable (for example his understanding of several authors writing the Pentateuch, his sometimes fuzzy statements on the nature of Jesus ministry, etc.). Occassionally I thought he cited verses out of context such that their true meaning was obscured by his intentions. Despite these flaws, I think overall his biblical exegesis is sound (Professor Young is a professor of New Testament, so this is no surprise).I do appreciate his numerous statements along the lines of &quot;I'm not saying everyone must stopping eating all meat in all circumstances.&quot; Instead, he thoughtfully and gently tries to challenge the reader to reconsider their own practices. I know that my own meat consumption has gone way down and am contemplating becoming a vegetarian. He encourages the reader to make slow changes, such as finding one meatless main dish per week to add into your diet. Who cannot do that? I also think much more deeply about the conditions that animals are kept in today and how they should live. Would you eat that piece of chicken or beef if you could see the animal's death? What is gluttony if not eating on more than you need? These and more questions are powerful thoughts that will challenge you throughout the book."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"I have argued animal rights and vegetarianism with many Christians and run into the same walls time after time.

I became a vegetarian about a year ago because of my love for animals and recieved some not so good comments from some of my Christian friends. I am a Christian and I wanted to find reassurance from Christians that being a vegetarian was not the wrong thing to do and I found that reassurance by reading this book."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"The title of this book scared me. I thought it would be one of those fanatic books about how Jesus could possibly be a vegetarian, etc. However once I started reading this book I found myself laughing at the chapter titles: \\"Was God the First Tanner\\", \\"will there be slaughterhouses in heaven.\\"Young thoroughly answers questions that vegetarians and nonvegetarians alike grapple with in using the Bible as guide for life. While at times I felt he took passages out of context, the overall meaning behind his words seemed to speak the biblical truth. Young concludes that vegetarianism cannot be a universal moral truth, yet it is closer to God's vision. I highly reccomend this book for those questioning how Christians are to respond to todays treatment of animals."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"I agree with the author's overarching view of biblical hermeneutics -- searching for \\"directional markers\\" that build an internally consistent perspective, rather than (non-contextual) \\"proof texting,\\" a generally paroxysmal and frivolous approach to scriptural study and application. But it seems unfortunate that, given this broadly impacting issue of meat production and consumption, Young has 'hung his hat' so specifically on the concept of 'cruelty' against animals, and of their 'rights', as these issues are, at best, an aside to the far larger moral/ethical, logical, economic, ecological, health related, theological, and human stewardship considerations attached to flesh-foundering. The real ethical questions cannot be reduced sloppily to 'was Jesus a vegetarian?' or 'did Noah eat meat?' (Young sees this much). The deeper ethical issues of today relate to the 21st century world we live in, and should not be reduced to 'muskrat love', they are larger than that, and ask to be considered with 'the wisdom of serpents' (Matt 10:16).Many in wealthy western culture, uneducated in the science and ethics of meat, think most easily of vegetarians as being equally soft hearted and soft headed; that vegetarians are teary-eyed cow huggers. But the 'animal rights' approach to the meat market culture is the least relevant and persuasive tack toward dealing with the truer, larger picture. In terms of Christian ethics urging the world toward a proactive \\"peaceable kingdom\\" (I have no argument against this), the 'animal rights' focus is rather like 'the tail wagging the dog.' More significant moral/ethical issues, relative to vegetarianism, are:1.) Environmental degradation concomitant to the modern animal-based diet may be the most significant (and popularly overlooked) global assault on nature; an assault featuring deforestation for the production of commercial livestock, loss of biodiversity (plant and animal, terrestrial and aquatic), unnecessary burning of fossil fuels, air and water pollution, loss of topsoil and arable land, desertification, the list goes on. A single east coast factory hog farm constantly produces more raw sewage than the city of Los Angeles, sewage containing harmful bacteria and disease that is simply introduced to ground water (the related ecological and public health problems were briefly presented on the television news magazine 60 Minutes). Neither laws demanding nicer treatment of little piggies nor regulations on the treatment of pig pee are going to alleviate the problem. The only solution is for Americans to rethink their diet of bacon double cheeseburgers and pork sausage. The ecological issues of modern meat are far too large to discuss adequately here, they stretch from the factory farm to the open ocean to the upper atmosphere.2.) The moral/ethical problems of meat eating are not only environmental, they are economic. Pandering to the palette of the wealthy beefeater demands [anti-human] misdirection of economic assets. Generally speaking, it takes 16 pounds of vegetable protein to produce 1 pound of animal protein. With that comes much more than 16 times the water and fuel! At the height of the 1984-85 Ethiopian famine, while more than a million people were dying of hunger, European meat producers were buying feed grains from -- Ethiopia! Will humanity's natural, agricultural, and economic assets serve humanity, or will they serve the gluttony of the wealthy? Along these same lines, the respected Christian author Richard J Foster touched very briefly on important aspects of the meat focused diet in his book Freedom of Simplicity (1981): \\"A million hogs in Indiana have superior housing to a billion humans on this planet.\\" And those \\"million hogs\\" are degrading ground water, proliferating disease and ultimately creating cancers and premature human deaths (see below). Lest you think there'd be a net deficit of jobs if we eliminated meat packers and cowboys' livelihoods in favor of a plant based diet, assuredly that is not the case. No industry provides fewer jobs per unit of land used than does cattle ranching; a nation with a vegetable based diet would have the potential to create more net jobs while actually reducing costs for the consumer. That may sound contradictory, but federal meat industry subsidies prop up this meat-mad system. Here's one maddening example of these subsidies: If I go for a hike in nearby Cleveland National Forest, I won't see any of the once native pronghorn antelope, instead I'll probably see cows, ranching long ago extirpated the antelope. And guess who pays for these cattle grazing on public lands. As an American taxpayer, I do! The US government builds access roads, digs wells, pipes water, and provides other products and services for the cattle industry that uses public lands. Ranchers theoretically \\"lease\\" these land accesses, but the \\"leases\\" are laughable, do not cover the public expenditure that underwrites them, and amount to government giveaways. I may not eat beef, but as a US taxpayer, I pay for wealthy beefeaters to eat beef!3.) The animal based diet is finally a disease and death centered diet. Billions of Chinese have a long tradition of a vegetable based diet, and they have virtually no incidence of obesity, heart disease, GI tract cancers, osteoporosis, or scores of other meat-related maladies -- UNLESS they move to the west and take up the animal based diet. Several excellent medical studies make the point clearly, meat kills (not just cute little lambs, meat kills people!). The health-related issues of the animal based diet are obviously bound to the economic issues as well (for example, health care asset allocation). Will we feed starving people or spend our economic assets first supplementing, and then trying to wrestle with, the self-inflicted meat-based sicknesses of the blissfully foolish? The human health issue looms as large as the ecological and economic issues, and is too great to be treated adequately here. These are all highly moral and ethical Christian stewardship questions. How can Christians turn a blind eye?There are still other ethical issues tied to the animal based diet, and \\"animal rights\\" MAY be one of them. But this is not so clear. Is it rational or meaningful to suggest that because animals sense pain that they have any sense of \\"cruelty\\"? That they have any sense of their \\"rights\\" being violated or of some \\"injustice\\" being imposed on them? These are surly sentient concepts well beyond the ken of the animal mind, whatever it may be. The \\"animal rights\\" approach to the question of meat appeals to 'warm fuzzy' ideas but what is needed is a serious, hardheaded treatment (by the way, if we begin to do the right things, for the right reasons, the \\"animal rights\\" question will begin to go away!). Most Christians--there are and have been exceptions--have been sadly silent on the matter of meat-mongering (some have even embarrassed themselves with goofy \\"proof texting\\" attempts to define vegetarianism as a biblical heresy!).Young's thesis aspires to a robust view of biblical hermeneutics, which is a good thing. It aspires to treat an important topic. But the \\"animal rights\\" focus is misplaced. An outstanding book on the moral/ethical and health issues surrounding the animal based diet is Howard F. Lyman's 'Mad Cowboy'. Christians should have been publishing books like Lyman's decades ago; being shining beacons of conscience in the material darkness, not hiding in that darkness in blissful ignorance and self-indulgence. It's not too late to start doing the right thing.Mad Cowboy: Plain Truth from the Cattle Rancher Who Won't Eat Meat"},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"Young's purpose in \\"Is God a Vegetarian?\\" is simple: to explore the biblical foundations for Christian vegetarianism. Young chooses to listen to \\"the entire story\\" of Scripture to make a case for Christian vegetarianism rather than relying on certain \\"proof-texts\\".The core of Young's argument is that the story of Scripture reveals that God is moving humans and animals towards a \\"peaceable kingdom\\" where they live together in harmony. Considering this, Christians should structure their lives and daily practices (including their diet) in such a way that it reflects this ultimate destiny.As a Christian who is exploring the theological and ethical issues of vegetarianism, I found this book to be extremely helpful and informative. Young manages to be balanced, and not biased; simple, and yet not simplistic.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for more information on the biblical basis for Christian vegetarianism."},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"This an intelligent, well-argued book. It will help Christianvegetarians to explain themselves and witness vegetarianism toChristian non-vegetarians.... this is a very worthwhile book forthose who realize that God is about peace and not violence of anykind.

I picked it up last week and --WOW!!-- why did I not read this very profound book ASAP?There is a lot of stuff about vegetarianism and Christianity out there. Some of is pure crap (like the Essene Gospel of Peace junk most notoriously.) First rule for me: if the author isn't able to deal with the biblical texts with integrity and scholarship...oh, well...I'm not wasting my time on that one. Young not only shows competent Biblical scholarship, but STELLAR competence. I've studied the Bible for pushing 40 years, graduate degrees and all, and I learned things I didn't know on nearly every page.How many books on vegetarianism and the Bible can one say that about?My journey into faith-based vegetarianism began 9 years ago with Matthew Scully's Dominion. It was a life-changing book for me, and it too was from an author who approached the biblical texts with competence. However, Scully hammered home the &#34;Dominion&#34; theme from Genesis--which is all well and good. But Young's book helped to fill in all the missing gaps for me: it was more comprehensive. &#34;Is God A Vegetarian?&#34; is also most capable of being &#34;life-changing&#34; book for people, and one can't say that about many books.I will be referring to this book for YEARS.BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Is God a Vegetarian?: Christianity, Vegetarianism, and Animal Rights","review":"Richard A. Young teaches New Testament at Temple Baptist Seminary, and is also the author ofHealing the Earth: A Theocentric Perspective on Environmental Problems and Their SolutionsandIntermediate New Testament Greek: A Linguistic and Exegetical Approach.He wrote in the Preface to this 1999 book, \\"My wife and I have been vegetarians for about ten years... Our trek was guided mostly by health reasons and only partly by ethical reasons. The religious aspect was not a consideration at all. However... We have come to realize that a vegetarian diet is part of a whole way of being, a way of being that is physically, ethically, environmentally, and spiritually healthy for ourselves, others, and the entire planet. We have also discovered that the religious and spiritual aspects of vegetarianism are of fundamental importance... the title [of the book] is a questioning metaphor that probes into the very being of God. What is God like? Is not the God of the Bible a God... who would never kill to satisfy selfish desires... If this is how we understand and experience God, then what metaphor best expresses that in today's context?\\" (Pg. xi-xii)He admits in the first chapter that \\"The only passage in Scripture that clearly states that Jesus ate meat is the post-resurrection appearance recorded in Luke 24:40-43... Scholars claim that this passage is most likely a later addition to the oral tradition... Even if this were the case, the passage would still point to Jesus' actual dietary habits, for we would not expect later traditions to radically depart from the KINDS of things Jesus actually said and did. If Jesus was a staunch vegetarian, this episode would never have passed into the tradition as it now stands... The passage therefore supports the idea that Jesus probably ate fish.\\" (Pg. 2)He observes, \\"The Bible teaches that (1) animals possess 'nephesh'... (2) animals possess 'psuche,' the Greek counterpart to 'nephesh' in the New Testament... (4) animals will be present in the eternal state... The Hebrew mind certainly associated animals and humans more closely than we moderns do. We don't know exactly what this immaterial aspect of humans is that we keep on calling 'soul,' but... it is not the exclusive property of humans. Thus the lack of a soul can no longer be pressed into service as a justification for exploiting or abusing animals.\\" (Pg. 25)He addresses the difficult question of God's actions in the Garden of Eden: \\"'God's provision involved killing animals and making clothing out of their skins... It doesn't look as if even God is much interested in reaching the peaceable kingdom'... The rugged clothing most likely expresses God's continuing concern and care for humans despite their departure from God's ways... God's faithful provisions... employs the customs of a semi-nomadic culture, which involved using animals for clothing, tents, tools, and food.\\" (Pg. 31) He also suggests that \\"Paul makes it clear in 1 Corinthians 8 and Romans 14 that some ... abstained from meat altogether... Their vegetarianism, however, would have been conditional, being contingent on their particular social location.\\" (Pg. 95)He concludes, \\"The Bible neither commands nor condemns vegetarianism. It is left as a choice. However, as we locate our story in God's story, it is difficult to avoid the implication that vegetarianism is the best dietary choice for Christians.\\" (Pg. 163)This is an excellent, biblically-based analysis that does not shrink from tackling the \\"hard\\" questions. It will be an important text for any Christian studying this issue, whether you agree with Young's conclusions, or not."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"I reread this trilogy (this is the first -- followed by Chernevog and Yvgenie) every few years.

That is until they discover Uulamets, a wizard with a secret. Uulamets wants Sasha's help to bring back his daughter Eveshka-a rusalka, a ghost who remains alive by sucking the life out of living things around it.

A friend of mine told me that there are plays and operas based on Rusalka. Depending from different parts of Russia, Rusalka is a ghost with past different mythologies & varieties of powers. Well, Ms. Cherryh create a great fantasy based on the concept of a Rusalka.The intorduction of the book is fast paced where one the the characters, Pyetr falsely accused of something and the village wants him dead. Along the way, he gets unexpected help from a wet behind ears teenage boy and escape the village of Vojvoda.Pyetr learns a little bit more about his new companion, tries to portray the real harshness of life & squash fairy tales of magic.

I was fortunate enough to have found this book at a book fair. It appears to me as if there aren't many copies avaiable based on the pricing here. Rusalka is based on ancient Russian folktales come to life. The two hero's struggle to deal with angry townspeople, wizards, wraiths, and Things throughout the book. But along the way they learn a lot about themselves and how important wishes are. You see you have to be careful what you wish for, it might come true. But not in the ways that you think."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"Rusalka is a fantasy set in pre-Christian Russia. Cherryh creates plenty of atmosphere as her characters Pyetr and Sasha flee trouble in Vojvoda during the darkness of winter and find themselves at the mercy of a powerful wizard in a dead forest. Pyetr, who was mortally wounded as he fled, has ironically been healed and returned to life by a magic he denies exists ... a skeptic. Sasha believes in magic and lives at its mercy until he discovers that he is a wizard and must learn how to direct the powerful forces that flow through him.Despite their differences, Pyetr and Sasha are devoted to each other. Street-wise Pyetr is determined to protect the younger and naive Sasha from those who would take advantage of his innocence, and Sasha refuses to leave Pyetr alone and unprotected from the powerful magic that he vehemently denies. Pyetr relies on his wits to shield him from misfortune. Sasha is determined to avoid trouble by learning to carefully control his powerful thoughts. Together they learn that neither wits nor careful manipulation will protect them from the uncertainties of life and that there is nothing more powerful than a good and loyal friend.Pyetr and Sasha will need to rely on each other if they are to survive the ordeal that awaits them. They encounter various magical spirits that inhabit this dark forest while constrained by the will of Uulamets, the wizard. These spirits are quite fickle and most times very dangerous. Along with these not-so-benevolent spirits, the forest is haunted by the ghost of a young murdered woman. She is a rusalka and she is the daughter of Uulamets. The rusalka doesn't want to be dead and so must drain the life from anything or anyone in order to maintain existence until her father can bring her back to life.Cherryh uses Slavic folklore, with its heavy emphasis on magical power, to tell the story of a different kind of power ... the power of friendship. This is the strength of Rusalka. Cherryh's ability to create an atmospheric novel is one of her strong points as a writer. She can also generate an intensity that leaves you gasping and dreaming strange dreams at night. That said, I was disappointed with this novel. The struggle of wills revealed through the dialogue between characters was meant to build and create that intensity I just mentioned, but instead I found the conversations repetitive and tedious. I couldn't wait for the characters to stop their constant bickering and for Cherryh to just get on with some action instead. I generally like Cherryh's books a lot, so I'm a bit baffled by my ambivalence toward this novel. Perhaps I wasn't in the right mood for this one, so I'm glad that this was not my first experience with Cherryh."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"I bought this in 1990 and promptly lost it, couldn't find another copy for years. Purchased it on Amazon who sent it to the last address. Got it again on e- bay who didn't screw it up.Fairly good story, angst and anger ridden though. Very good treatise on the mechanics of magic in a quasi magical universe. As you can imagine a story about a murdered girl can be rather dark. The ending was interesting and borrowed from Tolkein a bit. I liked the book as a whole."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"A good book but not outstanding. Sometimes the story seemed to drag a bit and I had a hard time relating to the characters. But I did really like that it was based off Russian folklore because I haven't read many other fantasy books that have done so."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"Very different direction but excellent. These are not sci-fi for all you sci-fi Cherryh fans out there."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"I had read Yvgenie years ago and enjoyed it. When this book became available I was excited to read more in the same vein. However, as previously stated, the characters have no growth, no empathy and create tension simply by fighting amongst each other constantly.Reading the book has become a chore.Also, the author's lack of confidence in our ability to learn vocabulary is a bit off putting. Can we not call every supernatural being a \\"thing\\"? That's what nouns are for. You can introduce them like that if you like, but there are paragraph that read \\"and the yard-thing did this and the forest-thing did that and the water-thing the other...\\" Please! Use nouns, I beg of you.So, in short, prepare yourself for 200+ pages of unlikeable characters fighting with each other, muddled action and endless trudging through swamps and forests.I cannot say I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"I'm usually a big Cherryh fan, I have enjoyed everything else I have read by her. But Rusalka just left me cold. It seems to go on forever with the main characters bickering, to be brightened by momentary flashes of action after which ... the characters resume bickering."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"I agree that Rusalka is ultimately unfilling. I enjoyed the first half but ultimately, I felt that it just kind of petered out. Also, Cherryh's sentence structure was odd throughout the book, making it sometimes difficult to figure out what she meant."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"In the layout of the story this book is different than the Cherryh I'm familiar with. Not because it's fantasy primarily--the Gate of Morgaine books were as well stylistically, for all that they also tied into Alliance-Union. That series was recognizably a similar approach to her larger canon, the focus on politics and intrigue, the outsider as central figure. Here it's recognizably the same hand with characterization and prose, but the plot layout looks fairly conventional. It takes a pre-Christian Russian fairy tale, but at core it's a dramatization of a stock mythological concept with a focus on building of relationships rather than sustained reflection on the larger community. As a book it works pretty well, slow and a little disorienting to get into but after that point quite gripping, with some strong writing and good moments of horror and wonder. Also, after awhile of finding myself displeased by the characterization of Bren, here the layout of more flawed and believable people is good. They're characters without a firm grasp on the answers for their universe, without a blueprint for their future. That works in many of the most intense scenes, where they have to grapple with their own ignorance and the strange metaphysics of a world that is actively coming around to kill them. The novel toys with a lot of the forms of magical horror, but ultimately turns from it because the victory lies in obtaining knowledge and clarifying ambiguity. Some initially menacing forces turn out to be co-opted into alliance, and there's usually a lot more room to work with than killing or being killed.I'd view this work as more minor than a lot of Cherryh's work, though, and the focus is in many ways narrower and less ambitious. At a certain level I think her approach to writing doesn't capture the fun potential of exploring stories and mythology in the way a Neil Gaiman can do.Better than: The Shining by Stephen KingWorse than: King Rat by China MievilleRoughly equivalent to: The Steel Remains by Richard Morgan"},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"I like folklore, and I like novels based on folklore, and I was prepared to like _Rusalka_, especially after reading the rave reviews posted by others. It did hold my attention long enough that I was able to finish it, but in the end I had to admit I didn't like it.First gripe: the endless and tedious scenes of Pyetr, Sasha, and Uulamets wandering around in the woods acting like jerks to one another. Pages upon pages of one of the characters musing about what morons the other two are. The use of the word \\"woodcraft\\" on what seems like every page, as Sasha or Pyetr admires Uulamets' skill in navigating the forest. It begins to feel like we are reading the same chapter over and over after a while.But that's the little gripe. The big one is what seems like a big continuity mistake. Do not read on if you absolutely can't stand spoilers! This spoiler refers to an incident in the middle of the book, not the ending, if that changes your feelings at all.About a third of the way into the book, a false Eveshka is brought to lfe by Uulamets' magic. He was trying to resurrect his dead daughter, but instead resurrected a version of her who was as he wanted her to be rather than as she was. Now, Pyetr never had sexual or romantic feelings about Eveshka until this false Eveshka showed up; it was then that he started noticing her beauty. BUT...later, Pyetr claims that he knew all along that the Eveshka look-alike was a fake, and all of a sudden he is in love with the real one. Why? He wasn't in love with her before. He was annoyed by her until he met the fake one. I don't think I understand."},{"Title":"RUSALKA.","review":"I consider myself to be an educated, literate person. And like most educated, literate people I tend to frown down upon the science fiction and fantasy genre as a whole. But don't get me wrong: there is some damn good fiction that, for better or worse, tends to get categorized as science fiction or fantasy.At the forefront of this small group are Walter Miller's Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, and CJ Cherryh's Rusalka trilogy. Saint Leibowitz... for being the best work of science fiction ever published, the Wheel of Time for being the best and most ambitious meditation on escapism ever attempted and Rusalka, for simply being Rusalka.Spare and unpretentious, Rusalka is a fairy tale, and nothing more. Though the characters sometimes do tend to seem stereotypical, as Julia Alvarez' In The Time of the Butterflies shows us, this needn't detract from the value of the work as a whole.Rusalka may be a fairy tale, but it is a decidedly dark one at that. The whole of the first book's action takes place in a wet, Cummingly mudluscious spring. The woods are dead and dying, the forest of the Rusalka shapeless gray trunks protruding grossly from brittle brown grass and marshes.To quote the old cliche: you can't judge a book by its cover. But, simply put, I can think of no one more qualified than Keith Parkinson to evoke the entire world of Rusalka in one single image. And he succeeds beautifully. Parkinson's Rusalka covers are easily some of the best paintings to ever grace any book in any genre.This is as good as fantasy literature gets and I would advise you, regardless of your past experiences with the genre to seriously consider driving out to your used book store and picking up a copy of Rusalka. Hell, pick up the entire series. And if you don't like your books used, order it off of this site. Buy it now, read it later, whatever. Just read it."},{"Title":"Toil of the Brave","review":"Set on the coast of North Carolina during the revolution, this book mixes real history with interesting characters to make the story come alive. Two men working for opposite sides, one for the British and one for the colonists, have a relationship with the same woman. Their relationship comes to a climax during the battle at King's mountain. Mrs. Fletcher knew the area and the history intimately and writes with skill that is not dated. Planters living near swamps using boats for transportation with descriptions of the plants and animals, open door hospitality, and later divisions within the characters as they are forced to decide whether to support the British or join the colonist when war reaches their homes.

Some say that they starve to death because the portions are so small, and others claim that the entire eating experience is out of this world. Although I've not been to Canyon Ranch, I must say that this cookbook inspires me to think seriously about it.First of all the layout is truly a graphic masterpiece. The photographs and information are laid out in a very logical, colorful and exciting way. The visuals make you want to rush out to the store and start cooking as soon as you open the book.This book truly offers healthy food with real taste. The top choice for menus that we've tried in our house were: the duck breasts with blueberry sauce, spaeztle (German noodles) and braised cabbage. Dessert was blackberry cobbler.Preparation is clearly spelled out, and fairly easy in comparison to other gourmet type recipes in the cookbook market presently. I managed to successfully prepare this menu for 8-10 people, and without any rehearsals!The duck breasts were amazingly delicious (and very expensive to make - but with a little creativity, you could avoid the additional costs meat-wise), the spaetzle was weird in texture and taste but quite good and a hit -- beats the usual rice tenfold! -- and the cabbage was a great surprise and the tastiest favorite of all the various foods offered (guests were looking for seconds and thirds). The blackberry cobbler (which could be done with any kind of berry) was light, not too rich, and a huge hit. It has replaced my usual calorie and fat laiden recipes for fast desserts and it impressive to look at as the grande finale!This menu worked well with the ten and twelve year old taste testers. One hated the blueberry sauce over the duck and the other loved it. However, they heartily ate everything else (especially the cabbage and cobbler!).Making multiple courses (for 8-10 people)was not a problem for this menu, as the multiplications of the ingredie! nts added up without any problems. If you have a hefty appetite, be certain to make more than you planned to. The final servings are on the small side for such a lengthy prep time. (I believe in leftovers after working in the kitchen for so long!)The recipes take some time to plan for (many call for elaborate marinades which add the flavor sans fat), and most definitely are not &quot;comfort&quot; foods, although it is a great book to browse while sitting in front of the fireplace as the recipes are perfect for the hot summer ahead!Note: This cookbook is a 10 except for the convenience of preparation and overall cost of ingredients which caused me to lower my review to a 9."},{"Title":"Canyon Ranch Cooking : Bringing the Spa Home","review":"I like to cook for friends, and I don't mind accommodating their dietary needs. In fact, I consider it a challenge. In that light, the words &quot;low fat&quot; struck fear into my heart.I bought this book with the expectation that the food would at least look good. I didn;t expect that it would rock my gastronomical world.From our first nibble of Canyon Ranch Guacamole to our last morsel of Pears in Phyllo (filo to me) the tastes were amazing.I made:Canyon Ranch GuacamoleFive Onion BisqueHearts of Palm and Endive Salad with Papaya VinagaretteMashed Potato and Shallot CasseroleMustard Topped Rack of Lamb with Spinach SaladPears in PhylloGranted that this might be a bit more, quantity-wise, than would be expected at the Spa, but it was low fat and it left the diners, myself included, in thrall.It also helped that I started with a show-stopper, the guacamole. It had a rich somewhat salty flavor - a good trick with little salt and negligible fat. Here is the spoiler: It is made from asparagus! Nobody could figure it out.The book is no-nonsense and, while stating the benefits of a low fat diet, it doesn't preach. It also assumes a pretty good level of technique and access to decent ingredients.One low fat cooking caveat: Ignore instructions that tell you to spray no-fat cooking spray on baking sheets. Use non-stick sheets or parchment paper. If you really need the spray, spray it on the parchment paper. It took an exhauystin half hour to get this stuff off of my baking sheets."},{"Title":"Canyon Ranch Cooking : Bringing the Spa Home","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed every recipe I have tried from this beautiful book, and I have tried several.The baked fish and chips impressed some of my non-healthy eating guests so much they wanted the recipe and plan to never deep fry again. The price may seem high, but was worth it for some of the unusual techniques alone. I never thought of smoking food with tea inside of a steamer basket.There are two reasons I did not give the book 5 stars. One, because I do not like the hardback format - this is a cookbook to be used, not some pretty picture book to lay on the coffee table. Secondly, the book has margarine listed as an ingredient listed in several recipes. The latter is a very small complaint that is actually addressed by the author in the introduction, apparently Canyon Ranch switched away from margarine while the book went to press, and the introduction lists proper substitutions.

I love it like my grandparents.--Jam Suey."},{"Title":"Summer at The End of The World","review":"I devoured this book because it's a brilliant weaving of memory, perception (Kingdon's depictions of natural beauty and food are a particular delight), spirit, and emotion into a fabric of self-discovery and -reconciliation. Kingdon carries the reader along with her on this journey, gently insinuating her consciousness into ours until we feel as if we're living the life described in the book. We glory in its triumphs and grow stronger as we survive its tragedies. After I finished this book, I knew I'd encountered a real life, not some phony or artsy construction.Just as compelling is Kingdon's incisive treatment of sexual orientation. By integrating the theme of homosexuality into the narrator's life--neither its central factor nor a peripheral element but just a fact of existence--and by showing implicit parallels to her own (straight) sexuality, she counters the anti-GLBT people who insist upon inflating sexual orientation into angelic or demonic monstrosities. Kingdon tells it like is about sex: Love confers meaning and integrity upon sexual practices, not mechanics or gender.Even if you don't care about the inner journey of the narrator or homosexuality, you can still enjoy this novel as a travel book. But if you do care about them, you'll enjoy the trip even more."},{"Title":"Summer at The End of The World","review":"In telling the story of Summer at the End of the World, Kirsten Kingdon skillfully engages the reader in her tale, but almost by stealth, sends a message. The story is about a newly widowed woman finding her way--a drama which plays out in many interesting and engaging ways. The message is about gay rights. It is so skillfully interwoven into the story that one is scarcely aware that it has been delivered. This is because the story's characters find their way through life in ways familar straights and gays alike. By revealing this common thread of the human experience, Kingdon both entertains and enlightens us."},{"Title":"Summer at The End of The World","review":"This book is an excellent semi-autobiography - most of it is based on the author's own experiences, and therein lies the strength of the book.

She is exceedingly honest with the reader, including about her own faults, and is therefore infinitely human and endearing."},{"Title":"Summer at The End of The World","review":"Summer at the End of the World, by Kirsten Kingdon is an absorbing, deeply moving novel.

Her main thesis is that it was during the latter part of the 1910s and the whole of the 1920s, and particularly in New York, that American composers developed a modernity that was wholly theirs, not something borrowed from Europe. Of course, there were predecessors--giants like Charles Ives--but they were still largely being ignored. It wasn't until a nucleus of composers, patrons, and fledgling arts organizations began coalescing in New York that the American voice finally emerged and was being heard. Beginning with visionaries like Leo Ornstein in the 1910s, this group soon included such rugged individualists as Dane Rudhyar, Edgard Var&egrave;se, Carl Ruggles, Henry Cowell, George Antheil, Roger Sessions, Aaron Copland. And individual voices they were, but they recognized, or at least some of them did, that they needed to band together in a sort of artistic and political brotherhood to get their works performed and published. Such efforts as 'Musical Quarterly,' the League of Composers, 'Musical Review,' 'Modern Music,' the Copland-Sessions Concerts and many more came into being. Music journalists (and promoters) like Carl van Vechten and Paul Rosenfield called wider attention to this new music.This was a heady time. Of course, not all of the excitement was in New York. But many musicians from outside New York were attracted there. For instance, Ruth Crawford, later Ruth Crawford Seeger and one of the most original voices of all, came from Chicago late in the 1920s. Artistic ferment, not only in music but in all the arts, made New York THE place to be.The book mentions and discusses the works of many composers that are not very well remembered today--but whose music may be due some sort of revival of interest--like Marion Bauer, Louis Gruenberg, William Grant Still, Emerson Whithorne, Frederick Jacobi. And of course composers now very well-known are discussed: Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, Roy Harris, Carlos Ch&aacute;vez, Walter Piston.There is a chapter on the widening influence of jazz on American concert music and a description of the famous Aeolian Hall concert in 1924 that introduced Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue,' (and Zez Confrey's 'Kitten on the Keys,' as well!).A good deal of engaging prose is written about the wealthy and fiercely devoted women who were important, even crucial, patrons of modern music: Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Blanche Walton, Alma Morgenthau Wertheim.There are many illustrations--concert programs, pictures of musicians and the like. Particularly interesting are reproductions of literally dozens of pages from musical scores, as from Var&egrave;se's 'Octandre,' Antheil's 'Ballet m&eacute;canique,' Ruggles's 'Vox clamans in deserto,' Cowell's 'The Voice of Lir,' Copland's 'Piano Variations,' Crawford's 'String Quartet' and many others.A valuable and fascinating 40-page appendix lists all the pieces played on most of the new music series in New York during the period under discussion.Oja has obviously done her research meticulously and the book is written in a lively, engaging style. It is not aimed at the scholarly audience, although surely musicologists can find plenty to marvel at here, but would be, I suspect, fascinating for the curious general reader.Recommended.Review by Scott Morrison."},{"Title":"Making Music Modern: New York in the 1920s","review":"What an exciting and most interesting book! Carol Oja takes us back to a transitional period in the cultural history of New York City (and America); the 1920s. It isn't that book doesn't talk about anything outside of those years, but that the stuff before leads into that decade and the stuff after discusses how it flowed from those times. Probably the best place to start reading this book is the fascinating Appendix that lists the programs of Modern Music Societies in New York from 1920-31. It gives you a flavor for the decade and the material the book is going to cover.There was a time when Europe treated all of the United States about like New York and Los Angeles treat even big mid-western cities now. A place to come and make piles of money from the rubes (I am from Ann Arbor, MI - we get lots of great visits from orchestras and artists, but it is almost always the artists coming here to give us something rather than coming here to seek something). In our age of instant communications and global simultaneous experience of cultural events, it is hard to remember or understand that it used to take months and years for cultural events in one part of the world to work there way to other cultural centers.Awhile back I spoke with an elderly friend who was one of the founders of the Interlochen arts camp in northern Michigan and had been involved in the School of Music in the days of Earl V. Moore. He told me that in the 1920s here in Ann Arbor, the new music was Dvorak and Tchaikowsky. They did not get the stuff of Debussy, Ravel, and Stravinsky until later. Now things had changed by the 1960s. Another friend got a hold of the score and parts for Stravinsky's \\"Requiem Canticles\\" and gave the second performance of the work here in Ann Arbor immediately after the premier.This book does a great job of showing us how the sense of growth and wonder of the burgeoning city whetted people's appetite for new ideas and wonders in drama, art, and music. Edgard Var&egrave;se brought his unique genius to the city and founded an orchestra to play new music. He caused a sensation and created a demand for more of the new. This openness allowed local talent to flourish and the likes of Ornstein, Ruggles, Anthiel, and others prepared the way for the next generation of Copeland, Sessions, and others. The author supplies us with great descriptions, generous portions of music samples, and well chosen picturesFor me, the most powerful idea that stays with me is how alive and searching everything was. People did not wait to be subsidized, or for institutions to come to them and give them grants asking them for their art. They just went and made it and created their own means for performance and presentation. Of course, most of it was not art built to last. But so what? This weird demand we make that only art that is eternal is worth making or that only absolutely unique art deserves praise is utter nonsense. I wish we encouraged more of this kind of energy in our young people today and encouraged them to make real and honest art that is true to themselves rather than the extremes of commercial sellout or political pose that we seem to require of them today.Sadly, by the end of the decade, the winners began to stand apart from the mass of other artists and they became fashionable with the attending public support and accolades. The commercialization and institutionalization of \\"serious art\\" was well under way; especially with the transformation of jazz elements into material for art music. One group of people could pretend to jazz while maintaining respectability while others seriously explored what jazz could mean to art music, respectable or not.What a time it was and what a book that documents it for us so well."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Mysticism and Its Relevance Today","review":"I have always been interested in ancient Egypt, but I hadn't read anything new for many years - until a few months ago, when I started reading on the subject again.So far I've found that many of the books on this topic are quite dry - with a few glaring exceptions, this being one of them.This author looks at the evidence in spiritual and mystical terms - and I must say, his interpretations seem to make quite a lot of sense! For instance, he shows evidence that the ancient Egyptians were not polytheistic - in fact, they were quite adamant that there was only one \\"true source\\".I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic, & who is ready to look at the evidence from a fresh perspective. This book is ideal for those interested in spirituality."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Mysticism and Its Relevance Today","review":"This is great if your into Edgar Cayce. If your not into him, dont get this book. It is mostly filled with Cayce's prophecies, not with a more scholarly approach. I was looking for more Egyptological content. But hey that's me.."},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Mysticism and Its Relevance Today","review":"This is a great book if you're a follower of Edgar Cayce as I am.I...This book is for the open minded who feel our current undertanding of history is severely flawed. If you're convinced that the great pyramid was built by a bunch of guys pulling 50 ton blocks of granite around in the desert with ropes you probably won't like this book.You can read this book in one night as I did. Quite a few pages are taken up by beautiful pictures of art work from Egypt with explanations of the hidden meaning of the symbols and figures. If there was ever a race of people who were heavily into symbolism it was the Egyptians.This book makes some statements which have implications that apply to the entire human race. One is that the current form of the human body is going to change somehow sometime in the near future. This has only happened a few times since the beginning of the human race.I didn't realize that the high priest Ra Ta who built the great pyramid was a reincarnation of Edgar Cayce. I think it's obvious that Cayce is a very unusual soul. If I understand correctly it says Cayce was going to be reincarnated again in 1998 which means he may already be alive again.Another suprise for me is there are many similarities between the ancient Egyptian religious beliefs and other religions such as Christianity and the Jewish faith. It's possible that Mary the mother of Christ and the godess Isis are the same person. For Catholics Mary is like a godess anyway and this may be an accurate symbol since she is supposedly also Eve who was created by dividing the soul of Adam (Christ). So she is the twin soul of God.I have no problems believing all of the references to Atlantis. To me what Cayce says makes perfect sense.For more wonderful ideas about the construction of the great pyramid I recommend this book:The Giza Power Plant by Christoper DunnDunn proves that the great pyramid was actually a machine like a form of nuclear reactor that shot a cosmic energy beam into outer space. Dunn's theories agree with this book that the great pyramid was built using anti gravity technology.I believe what Cayce said that we are entering a new age.The Egyptians indicated this also and said that some type of trial by fire is going to occur. Yes, I believe this. I believe Satan is going to collect all of the selfishness he has given out.A lot of this information is consistent with theories I read in a book that was supposedly communicated to someone by people from another planet called Iarga. They said that human beings could originally communicate using a non verbal form of radiation that even the plants and animals can understand (ie. 'everyone spoke the same language'). The Tower Of Babel story in the bible indicates the point that humans lost the ability to understand the radiation. People such as Tanya Fitzpatrick (the Pet Psychic) can still understand the radiation.Jeff MarzanoMeditation Music of Ancient EgyptUfo...Contact from Planet IargaEdgar Cayce's Egypt: Psychic Revelations on the Most Fascinating Civilization Ever KnownThe Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient EgyptInitiationInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)"},{"Title":"Ancient Egyptian Mysticism and Its Relevance Today","review":"John Van Auken puts forth more ideas regarding ancient myths surrounding the 'old' world.

Not only does the author quote theories as if they were obviously true that have long been shattered by academic Egpytology but has the guts to offer an &quot;interpretation&quot; of wall paintings which 1)are based on faulty understanding of A.E. history and religious symbol, but he admits himself that he is not interested in these things anyway, and 2) rest their point on part of a scene which has been damaged and is impossible for either he or the reader to see. When I read that the &quot;shem&quot; symbol (the symbol for eternity that is represented by the rising/setting sun) that the ba bird is carrying is really an &quot;anhk&quot; (the symbol of life) without a stem, signaling that &quot;life had left the body&quot; I started giggling so hard I couldn't go on reading.

I found it easy reading, accurate reading and wonderful photos and illustrations (showing the pre restored state and restored state of some buildings, its amazing how well they did). There are chapters with actual mayan mythologies as well, and these are some of the most interesting and revealing parts of the book. The tattoo i got is illustrated in the book, its a panel depicting the god of the toltecs (quetzalcoatl) KulKulKan, a snake like bird figure with a human head coming out of his mouth.

He has been playing the piano for only a year and has learned most songs from watching tutorials on Youtube.com. I got him this book expecting it to have a lot of songs, but it only has a few: Star-Spangled Banner, Fur Elise, Come Back to Sorrento, and I have met you for Vocal and Piano. My husband only likes playing classical music, so he was only interested in learning Fur Elise. I was expecting the kind of tabs that you find online for piano and guitar, but Balmin created his own type of tablature. It is ingenious and very easy to learn; however, we can't find this type of tablature anywhere else other than this book. So my husband is only going to learn one song and then he will need to look for something else or continue to use Youtube (which has been the best resource so far). We tried visiting Balmin's website to see if we could find tabs, but it's no longer viewable/online. I did some research to see if I could find more of his tablature elsewhere and I had no luck. So if you want to learn a new technique of tablature to convert sheet music yourself or you are only interested in learning a few songs on the piano that this guy offers, then this book is for you.

As narrator, the cynical, uncharitable Gryllus does start to wear on your nerves -- this was a read-aloud book in our home and after a while I started skipping some of the extraneous negative adjectives, with no discernible impact on the story: author Paul Shipton does lay it on a bit thick. Still, this is pretty clever and engaging, readers with a modest background in Greek mythology will get all the jokes, and only purists will be offended by the uncharitable caricatures of figures such as Zeus, Homer and Epicurus.

The editors of the book are considered the nation's leading experts and two of the most prolific writers on the subject. Excellent for Social Work or Psychology. The book was an excellent tool for me while study in Graduate School."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The concept of this book fascinated me from the beginning. However, the telling fell short of my expectations to be amazed. It's worth the read for the history involved in the handing down of an unknown masterpiece-just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"While I found this novel to be well written, I didn't become emotionally moved by it as a whole. I have a problem when novels don't give me a truly in-depth look at the characters. Because this book pretty much consisted of several short stories based around the theme of a painting, it was a hard for me to become emotionally attached to many of the characters. While I appreciate art, I wouldn't consider myself an art lover. Maybe that's why I had a hard time being attached to an inanimate object as the main character of this novel. I did like a few of the stories. The last story which focused on the creation of the painting was my favorite."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I don't like short stories (I read so quickly that by the time I'm really into one, the story is already over), and in fact, I read this book in about half an hour, but I had a strong feeling of wishing it were longer. Each story is carefully crafted and there are a variety of themes that run through all of them and connect them. The author has a really effective way of describing art without it sounding &quot;artsy&quot;, so that even non art buffs can imagine why this painting was so meaningful in the lives of the people who owned it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I loved how the story was about the painting and how it has touched so many lives through time. So often in life we do not think about how our actions will affect other people, and this told the story of a painting that did."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I loved this book. It was fascinating how she tracked the painting back to its origins. I wish she could have expanded on each of the stories - they all seemed so real to me."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The reason I am rating this three stars is that I felt that there was an inconsistency in the quality of the writing and at times the stories were weak. Each chapter is a different short story about the owner of the painting at various times in the last few hundred years. Some stories are great, interesting and page-turners while others are not. Some stories are boring and I felt no real connection to the characters as people. I put down the book about half way through and had a hard time picking it up again. What saved this from a lower rating was that the end contained several great short stories that I feel were the best stories in the book, so it ends with high quality page-turning stories.I found it fun to find out the origins of the painting, we do find out who the girl in the painting is, however, I honestly cannot say it was suspenseful throughout. I found myself captivated by some stories and not wanting to put the book down, but then bored and wanting to skip the chapter of the next story.Lastly, I was frustrated at the idea that the first character in the book was contemplating burning the painting. Although it was stolen by his Nazi father from a Jewish family, despite his disgust at his father being a Nazi and guilt over how it was attained, he didn&#65533;t want to return the painting to the Jewish organization that takes back artwork stolen by Nazis. That he would consider burning such a lovely piece made absolutely no sense to me! The painting should have been returned to the Jewish organization."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is a wonderful book that is a quick, easy read but hard to put down. I read this right after reading some Hemmingway short stories and was reminded of &quot;Short Happy Life...&quot; by Vreeland's &quot;A Night Like No Other&quot;. I think the more reading you have done, the more you will see in this book. I've attended countless lectures by the author (at taxpayer expense) as an English Lit student of hers (way back) in High School. This book struck me as very personal in that I was reminded of Ms. Vreeland's intellegence, passion and playfulness at different points in the book. This book belongs on your reading list."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A choice for my Book Club this month (Sep 2011), I too found it - frankly - boring. The only part of the book that I liked was the opening chapter. Thereafter, it was a chore and I did not finish it. Although I tried skipping ahead, skipping back again - no amount of skipping made it any more interesting or appealing. I just skipped reading the rest and closed it (mercifully). Fortunately, I lost no money on this book but simply returned it to the library.Girl With A Pearl Earring was far more interesting and imaginative IMHO.If I am the odd (wo)man out at our Book Club meeting, might be time for a new Book Club. This makes too many hyped titles: \\"...sound and fury signifying nothing...\\"DD@Phila"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Walking through the bookstore, I came across a book called \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" with the look of its cover, and the passage on the back of the book, I thought that this would be a pretty good book to read. So I then decided to purchase this book to read for my class. It was eight short stores about Vermeer masterpiece. Her painting was very artful and with descriptive thoughts. The book is basically about the historical backgrounds about a painting, having it passed down to different people with different meanings. It shows that in each different chapter, it tells a different perspective from a different person point of view. She also takes you back in time in an adventure that gives its own beauty and how it had touched their lives. One of the most fascinating things about this lovely little book is the details of family life and the history. It is a little confusing in the beginning but once you get use to the writer's style, then you'll have a better understanding. If you like to read about a detective story trying and out the true meaning of a painting, then I recommend this book for you. If you're not into the whole detective stuff, then maybe this might not be the book for you. Overall, I had a chance to see a different style of writing."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is an excellent portrayal of a rabbi in ancient Israel who has a crisis of faith and searches for proof of god in secular studies. It is an easy read. Many of the hero's thoughts can be applied to agnostics today. What made this rabbi's crisis so difficult was that he was one of the most esteemed rabbi's in Israel. Many of the conflicts which occur in this book can be applied to the tensions between today's secular and reformed jews and the orthodox and fundamentalist jews. It sheds some light on the reason fundamentalist jews fear and forbid secular studies among their members. They are afraid that those who study secular subjects will desert the fundamentalist movement. This notion is particularly understandable today because studies in modern secular sciences etc. are likely to defeat even the most sacred traditions among the orthodox such as keeping kosher. Students who study modern science,medicine, and technology are likely to desert the orthodox and fundamentalist movements and so sadly such studies are discouraged in favor of torah study etc. The rabbi in this tale returns to his belief in god but he is shunned because of his exploration. His situation at the end of his quest is one of horrific conflict and anguish. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone of any religion,because it is an engaging and well written story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"If you've ever held and antique in your hand, and wondered about all the tales it could tell, this book is for you. I understand each chapter was written as a stand alone short story, but put together, Vreeland weaves an incredible tale about one of Vermeer's paintings. If you've ever loved the light of Vermeer's paintings, you'll be even more enchanted by this fictional &quot;story telling&quot; of the life of a painting."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I had never paid much attention to Dutch painters until I read Girl with a Pearl Earring, so when I picked this one up I was ready to enjoy another sojourn into that interesting country. I liked the different approach to the painter and loved the way the author takes you backward on the journey of discovery. Delightful."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"It is a bumper season for Vermeer books. The book sketches in the provenance of a fictitious Vermeer painting, chapter by chapter, which work like brief glances into a Vermeer moment in our lives. Tracy Chevalier in her &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; achieves a better result overall in terms of characterization and atmosphere - her Griet is flesh and blood, her Jan Vermeer convincingly elusive. However, notwithstanding her wooden prose, Susan Vreeland does manage to make a point: why are we drawn into Vermeer scenes? Why do we impart our own longing and solitude into his canvases, more than those of any other artist? Why do we care? The book is not only about a Dutch painter and his mystery, but about beautiful things we cherish, the moments that render an ordinary life memorable, the truth that all too often goes buried beneath the years."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Many of us complain that in our hectic lives, we have no time to read. I don't buy that flimsy excuse, however, if it does apply to you, take my advice and read Girl In Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland. This is truly time well spent in reading for pleasure. The author has researched the facts meticulously, and her style is spare and moving. Art and beauty play a major role in our lives;this is well proven by this book which traces the provenance of a purported Vermeer painting. Stories go backwards in time, characters are introduced, speaking the language of their era. Your mind is constantly engaged in reading this book. It goes on my list of 'Unforgetable Reads.'"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a brief but charming novel that illustrates the significance of a work of art for each of its successive owners. Within each chapter, someone considers the painting to be intrinsically valuable but is forced by circumstances to part with it. Although the mystery set up in the very first chapter motivates the reader to read on to determine if the painting really is a true Vermeer, it lacks the emotional impact that results from identification with one particular character. Instead, the reader is moved from one group of characters to another, and is left dangling when the painting changes hands. I did enjoy, however, the informative historical descriptions of Dutch life from several different perspectives, dating as far back as the mid-1600s. The characters that Vreeland has created are extremely realistic and reflective of the individual's struggle with personal issues and the times in which they live. Vreeland's characters are sensitively and at times, comically, portrayed and that is perhaps why I longed for each story to continue. Overall, I believe the book accomplished what it was probably intended to do: to illustrate the importance of a work of art upon the individuals with whom it comes in contact."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"After falling in love with Girl with a Pearl Earring some time ago, it was with great pleasure I discovered there were another Vermeer painting book out. This one is about a fictive painting though. There are 35 known paintings today, Girl In Hyacinth Blue is the 36th one, and fictive. In the book we follow it's history from today, and back through the ages and the paintings several owners till the time when the painting was painted.A wonderful, fascinating story, written in the crisp and also dark Vermeer colors. Several stories are told inside the story, everyone better than the other. What if a painting really could tell it's story. How fascinating that would be. And Susan Vreeland has done a masterpiece in this book. A painting will never be the same, from now on I will look at every new painting with the glasses of history - what can this painting tell me, what has this painting seen.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth blue is a classic example of Susan Vreeland's favorite type of story telling--where an object inspires and determines a course of story. One writing assignment we had in highschool was to write a story based on an object that we randomly chose out of a box. In the case of this novel, the Girl in Hyacinth blue is the object and in some regards, the protagonist. I love how the story unwinds itself back to its origins, to see just how it is that the painting arrived at its final owner. The theme of an objects life melds perfectly with the mission of Book Crossing.On a side note, I found it fascinating that Ms Vreeland is still teaching creative writing. When I took her class back in 1990-1, her carreer as a writer had only just started. She had gotten &quot;What Loves Sees&quot; published and was working to get a second book published. It wasn't until joining Book Crossing that I learned that she had done well for herself as a writer. I'm very pleased that she has because she was one of the best teachers I ever had."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I just finished The Girl in Hyacinth Blue- and I loved the time I had reading this interesting, heartfelt, and nicely written little novel. The type text was a very easy read size, so I just flew through the pages. The story pulls you through, even causing you to hesitate and figure out how this amazing painting, at the point of near destruction in the first chapter, slowly traces it's roots right back into the home of Vermeer as he paints this amazing girl (his daughter) which was immortalized and fantasized through the inheritance of this picture.I am no history or art buff, although I enjoy both, and so I can not support or destroy the history portrayed in this novel at all, but to me as I read, the validity didn't seem to matter. As the painting is passed on in the amazingly tragic and amazingly simple lives of the book you see longing and wonder, dreams and realities, and the affect these dreams have on us and those around us. The writing is beautiful and honest, yet simple and true.While I love giving 5 stars where deserved, I am picky on my personal likes in a book. I do not like too many loose ends to wonder about later, but more- a book that ties things to together yet sticks to you anyway- this book will stick, but there are few little situations that aren't answered. This very well may have been the intent of Vreeland, to keep your imagination churning, but for me it is not my favorite element of style, thus the lack of one star. Overall, though, this is a great read and a great recommend- I have told many of my friends who enjoy reading- &quot;Don't pass this one up-&quot;It is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is a pleasant simple read. What is wasn't (at least for me) is the literary blockbuster that I read about in the critical reviews. There just isn't that much meat to this work. I liked the format of vignettes going back in time. At the same time, that format left me hanging without resolution on some of the stories and thinking &quot;why bother&quot; about others. The writing has all the earmarks of modern, slightly pretentious literary fiction. Her writing it for creative writing classes comes through, unfortunately.Our book club struggled to find a half-hours worth of material to discuss in the book. We'd hoped for more."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a small book that lets us into the &quot;timeline of ownership&quot; of a painting. (real or imagined). Like most of Vermeer's paintings, it was painted in his home with the usual window and table. The painting is presumed to have been sold at auction in Amsterdam in 1696. We could see a similar painting in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, &quot;Woman in Blue Reading a Letter&quot;. In this painting the woman is pregnant, perhaps Catherina, Vermeer's wife. The Girl in Hyacinth Blue may be wearing the same smock. Susan Vreeland brings 17th century Delft to life for us. The book reminds me of &quot;The Red Violin&quot; following the theme of ownership."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A great read for those with little time to indulge in massive-length books. An alleged Vermeer painting is traced back through the centuries. Its impact on various lives is explored. I really have to thank the myriad reviews on it, because I noticed this book at the library, and began reading it without any prior publishing info. on it. (There's not even a real book jacket explanation). So the first two chapters were confusing. After I read a few reviews, I understood the author's concept. The later chapters, centering on Vermeer's family, were especially intriguing and delightful. This book was such a fresh, welcome difference from another Vermeer-inspired book, Girl with a Pearl Earring -- Watch out! That book seems to have an intense fan club that seems intent on pooh-poohing those who didn't like it, even though the latter were very helpful to me, explaining their positions clearly and making good points, influencing my own reactions. Susan Vreeland seems to have more insight into Vermeer, and I found her depictions of characters more absorbing than the rather dull main characters in Girl with a Pearl Earring. Here per this book, I also found it enjoyable to browse through, concurrently, a book on Vermeer's life and paintings, to lend &quot;atmosphere&quot; to the reading. I've never read anything by this author, but I'll be happy to check her future work."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"As much as I love the paintings of Vermeer I loved this book. A very interesting way to cite the provenance of the painting. Most of the stories were so touching and involving that they moved me tremendously. As a librarian and as a person who holds a Masters of Fine Arts degree, I found the synthesis of art and literature extremely moving. Vreeland writes with a passionate poetic touch and her sense of historical detail is extraordinary. I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I always love stories that go back in time,especially ones which revolve around a particular object or location.This is a story about a fictional painting which was looted by a nazi soldier during the clearance of the Jews from Holland in WW2.The soldier goes on to lead a decent life in the U.S. after the war,but can never quite absolve himself from his guilt at the theft and all the horrors that surrounded it.The story unfolds like the peeling of an onion--layer by layer until we come to the life of the artist who painted the picture of an innocent young girl.I found it to be a moving book,easy to read and with great descriptions of the details of everyday life."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"You *can* judge a book by its cover. Ms. Vreeland skillfully weaves together through time the stories of the various owners of a Vermeer painting. Interestingly, she chooses to start in the present day and work backward. I was inspired to do more reading about and viewing of Vermeer's work after reading this book. I finished it more than a month ago and still think of it often. I was sorry that the stories of the various characters and the story of the painting had to end. The last vignette-about the &quot;girl&quot; of the painting was one of the most poignant, especially when she has grown old. I concur with one of the other reviewers here that it would make a lovely gift for someone you know who loves art and books."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Not only is the writing style unique as Vreeland takes us backwards in time, but her word choices are well crafted. I had to read the book again within a 3 week period and planned to skim it. I just could not skim. Every word is perfectly chosen. To read the story was like creating a painting of people, landscapes, hopes, heartache, history, and love in my mind. As a lover of art and words, the combination of both I found very moving. If you enjoyed it the first time, read it again. Although we never know if the painting is destroyed, we have the opportunity to see how many peoples' lives it touched. That idea is so much more important than the outcome. The story teaches us that a work of art often outlasts its creator and can touch many souls well into the future. As a mediocre artist, this book gives me the desire to continue to create. Touching, uplifting, sweet, and executed with devotion."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"An officially unauthenticated, previously unknown Vermeer surfaces in an unlikely location: a chilly, locked room in the house of a secretive college professor. An art professor colleague of the painting's owner narrates the initial story in this linked series of stories tracing the &quot;life&quot; of the painting back to it's creation in Vermeer's studio. We meet each of its owners only briefly, but the painting itself (necessarily unseen, of course) grows more and more vibrant as the timeline grows shorter.It was a very quick read, surprisingly so. The writing is affecting and vivid, yet the stories are strangely forgettable - what remains is the description of the painting, and what it meant to the characters (security, money, plunder, etc.) during the time they lived with it. When I finished the book, I had that familiar feeling of fond loss that comes when you have to leave a character you've come to see as a friend - but, of course, it was the painting I felt that way about.It's really not fair that it doesn't exist."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Read this book right after you read &quot;The Girl With The Pearl Earring.&quot; Examined side by side enhances the reading experience. The juxtaposition of comparing and contrasting the way in which two women chose to approach writing about two different Vermeer paintings is interesting. Adding weight to both books, which can be quickly read. &quot;The Girl In Hyacinth Blue&quot; is like opening up a chinese box which unfolds another layer of interest with each turn. For further interest in the area, next read &quot;The Music Lesson&quot; (completely different,a good read, also addresses a Vermeer and written by a woman). The fourth one I have found and next on my list, is &quot;The Red Hat.&quot; I certainly have a richer appreciation for Vermeer. Catch the exhibit in NYC at the MET, through May."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I recently finished this book and have since passed it on to friends. I can't say that it was a masterpiece, but there was definitely something about it that captured me. The mysterious path that each individual story lead me down kept me wanting to turn to the next story to learn of its relationship to the previous one. Some of the vignettes were definitely better than others (and I especially enjoyed them as they went further back in history), but I enjoyed the &quot;quickness&quot; of each story and meeting each new character. Any monotony with a particular character might be quickly replaced by an entirely new character. The insights of &quot;the girl&quot; in the last story were especially compelling.My only difficulty with this book, and the reason that I bought it after borrowing it from the library, is that I need to read it over again and reexamine the stories' connections (in praise of the author, I have never considered reading another book twice). The book, as a whole, tells the story from present to past; however, each individual story takes place in it's own present time or is a short journey forward in time. At times I found this confusing and often found myself thumbing back through a previous story just to understand their relationship. I would have loved for the author to have spent more time telling about the actual transfer of the painting between each story's characters instead of the keeping the stories so distinctly separate.On the whole, I would definitely recommend reading this book. It is pleasant and enjoyable and a quick read. A short escape from the present."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I was in a reading rut before I picked this book up. You know how it is, sometimes nothing on your usual book menu really works for you. I had turned to biographies and historical novels to break me of the rut. I picked this up last week on a whim, having passed it by many times before. I read it in exactly two sittings, and just highly recommended it to two of my closest bibliophile friends. This was just a delight to read!Vreeland has designed the book as a series of short-stories which all trace back the history of a 36th Vermeer painting. (It is held that Vermeer painted only 35, and this 36th is of Vreeland's creation). What I found most interesting about the individual stories is how well Vreeland depicted the difference in value, both emotional and monetary, the painting had for its different owners over the years. For some, the painting was priceless and something to be coveted or hidden or cherished for familial or emotional reasons. For others, including the painter and his family, the painting was worth food and survival.In addition, I came to &quot;see&quot; the painting more clearly with each passing chapter, as I came to know how the painting was seen by its owners and how their feelings towards it affected me. I have much to think about now that I can digest the painting's chain of ownership in total.I was entranced by the atmosphere of the Dutch regions in which Vreeland set the stories. This book has a definite feel to it, and it is mesmerizing; you will have trouble putting the book down. Not a bad way to break out of my rut!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland's lilting prose traces the history of a painting-a Vermeer, perhaps? That's the assertion made by its current owner, a secretive high school math teacher who unexpectedly invites the art teacher over to view the painting and validate its authenticity.What gets in the way of such validation are the burning questions: How did you get it? Where are the papers? There is also the fact that Vermeer did not leave many paintings and he had many imitators. Without papers, without a credible explanation, who could assert that its creator was Vermeer?Yet validation is the only thing that will relieve Cornelius Engelbrecht of the burden of his inheritance. He knows but cannot tell how his father got the painting. He knows but cannot prove the painting is a Vermeer. He has devoted his life to researching Vermeer, the uniqueness of his style, the history of his works, in short, to proving the genuineness of Girl with Sewing Basket to himself. He has kept the painting hidden, showing it to no one before the art teacher. He has protected it like a lioness protects her cubs. He has denied himself all normal social interactions to keep people out of his life, out of his house, out of view of the painting, out of range of questions about its acquisition.In the second of Vreeland's eight linked stories, we learn of the painting's previous owners. With each successive story we travel further back in time, learning of the life of each earlier owner, the reasons for acquiring the painting, the reasons for parting with it. At last we reach the painter himself, and finally the girl in the painting.Each story can stand alone, but only when they are linked does the full story become evident. Only then do we understand the power of art, its ineluctable pull on the artist's soul, its ability to soothe and inspire the viewer's psyche. An engrossing, well-written book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is a well-written novel that travels backwards in time.

Have you looked at beautiful art and wondered about that? Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a novel which traces the fictional provenance of a painting by Vermeer backwards from it's current owner to the time the artist was inspired to paint it.The style reminds me of a group of storytellers sitting around a table, each picking up where the other leaves off, and each telling a very different, sometimes very dramatic rendering of an object's journey through time. Yet all are tied together by a fascination and a reverance for the skill of the artist and the subject of his work.A young girl sees,\\"The face of the girl in the painting almost glowed, her blue eyes, cheeks, the corners of her mouth all bright and glossy, the light coming right at her across the space between them.

Much, much earlier, the carefully wrapped painting is discovered in a boat along with a newborn child during a flood. \\"Sell the painting.

Vreeland's colorful portraits of Dutch life, from the wealthy to the poorest peasants, spanning several hundred years, are fascinating. I wouldn't have minded delving further into each of the tales, and the only other thing that could have improved the book was if the painting, which plays a silent, starring role in each of the stories, really existed.GiHB was enjoyable, but was a small disappointment after Vreeland's breathtaking Luncheon of the Boating Party."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"While this book was written beautifully; her research evident in all the stories, I didn't care for it.

Vreeland is an excellent writer, I don't have complaints in that department, nor in any departmnt; it just wasn't my cup of tea. What it did do, however, is make me more curious about Vermeer's work. I plan to look up his paintings and enjoy his beautiful talent."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book as the characters did not captivate my attention. Ms. Vreeland's descriptive style of writing did keep me reading on, as I hoped to read more of the Veemer painting than I did of the people that came in contact with it. Easy reading for a quiet evening."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"In the opening of this moving work of fiction, an undiscovered Dutch master's painting, circa 1665, is shown in secret to a professor of art. He is qualified to classify it as a genuine and theretofore undiscovered work of Jan Vermeer but is reluctant to do so because of the shady auspices of its acquisition: it had been seized during Nazi occupation. Since the acquisition is less than honorable, ownership of the painting is both a blessing and a curse. This theme is beautifully woven throughout the story.The impact of this simple portrait of a young girl is immense. Admirers are drawn to the blue of the smock she is wearing, the \\"pearl\\" of her eye, the luminescence of the light streaming through the window near her. And, although the subject is depicted engaged in the simple task of hand sewing, it is obvious that there is something very, very different about what was going on when this painting was being made.Through eight gorgeous and historically detailed chapters, author Susan Vreeland masterfully follows the ownership of the painting backward through time. As she plants and waters the seed of exploring the human ability to become attached to inanimate objects, we are given a view into the life and relationships of each successive owner.The challenge of the first set of characters is an awesome one: how to adequately enjoy something which is, technically, forbidden to own. Immediately, the reader's curiosity is piqued on many levels: Of course, What is the origin of this painting? But also, How does one come to terms with ownership of artistic property gained by questionable means? How can one enjoy it? And, of course, we ask ourselves again and again, if the work is authentic, if the work was actually done by Vermeer. And, if it was, what was the origin? Who is the subject? And, as we may ask ourselves in the case of the famous Mona Lisa, what was the subject thinking while she was posing and how did the composition come about?The challenges of each of the subsequent owners are as awesome as the professor's. And while each has a unique story, all of them are similarly enamored of the same stranger's work. And the delight and the pain of their human drama connects their stories while demanding our attention to a poignancy and delicacy that is unforgettable.As the author draws us in tighter and tighter to the humble creation of the painting, we can fully appreciate how one person's work can impact the lives of many strangers.With wonderfully human characters, a highly engaging and thought-provoking story line, and beautiful, painterly prose, *Girl in Hyacinth Blue* is a glorious and fresh work of fiction, and a book capable of entertaining while also having a deep, marvelous impact on the reader."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Is it possible that two different writers wrote two different novels about the same painter in the same year? I must admit that Vermeer is new to me, and introduced first through Girl With a Pearl Earring, and now through Girl in Hyacinth Blue. I found both novels exquisite, and well worth the time. Anytime a book makes me want to learn more about something...a place, a person, a time in history...i consider it time well invested. I have since read up on Jan Vermeer and his life, and find his paintings to be truly beautiful. And although I know that this particular painting is fictional, the story is completely believable and intriguing. I want to see a Vermeer for myself, and hope I'll have that chance someday."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I have never seen a Vermeer in my 21 years of existence, But now, I would love to see one and appreciate it. Appreciate art and beauty for what it really is - magnificent and large. That's what this book meant to me. In all its richness - stroking like a paint brush on the canvass of the readers' hearts - Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a winner all the way!The 8 Stories are woven around the imaginary painting of Vermeer and of love not being enough most of the time. From a father's misgivings to Vermeer's Daughter's Passions and so much more defines this 242 page, according to me masterpiece.It could have been any painter, any artist - because Ms. Vreeland's style is so unique and new that she could have given words to any painting. Any picture that speaks a thousand words, that touches the lives of so many, is sometimes so isolated and unappreciated. The girl in the picture, as the story progresses represents beautiful things for different people. It portrays poignancy heightened by the mysteries of giving and losing. Only in the end to seek the truth- beauty for what it really is!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is an excellent portrayal of a rabbi in ancient Israel who has a crisis of faith and searches for proof of god in secular studies. It is an easy read. Many of the hero's thoughts can be applied to agnostics today. What made this rabbi's crisis so difficult was that he was one of the most esteemed rabbi's in Israel. Many of the conflicts which occur in this book can be applied to the tensions between today's secular and reformed jews and the orthodox and fundamentalist jews. It sheds some light on the reason fundamentalist jews fear and forbid secular studies among their members. They are afraid that those who study secular subjects will desert the fundamentalist movement. This notion is particularly understandable today because studies in modern secular sciences etc. are likely to defeat even the most sacred traditions among the orthodox such as keeping kosher. Students who study modern science,medicine, and technology are likely to desert the orthodox and fundamentalist movements and so sadly such studies are discouraged in favor of torah study etc. The rabbi in this tale returns to his belief in god but he is shunned because of his exploration. His situation at the end of his quest is one of horrific conflict and anguish. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone of any religion,because it is an engaging and well written story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It didn't simply write the history of a painting by a well known artist; it looked at the history of a fictional work of art by Vermeer and, in so doing, drew you into the lives of each of its owners. A lovely way of thinking about art from a different perspective and a thoroughly enjoyable journey through the centuries!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The simplicity of this book should not be underestimated. What seems at first a simple history of a painting's provenance becomes, in the end, the acknowledgement of the precious moments and visions of everyday life.Moving backwards in time, from owner to owner, Vreeland offers a unique perspective of those who possess this small Vermeer painting. To some a source of pride of ownership, to others a distant claim on the past, many are touched by a longing to keep this painting near as it finds a spiritual nest in their hearts.Following this backward continuum, it is difficult to understand how men can dispose of this work of art for need of finances, though they must, while their wives try vainly to excuse keeping such a thing of pure beauty in their usually impoverished homes. The painting shines like a jewel where there is little to make daily living bearable.When we meet the painter himself in the very act of creation, we begin to understand the power of his need to paint. Vreeland gives us insight into Vermeer's struggle for validation in his work, the deep need to justify such an existence, which so relentlessly lays claim upon the soul.Fine-tuning once again, we are introduced to the girl in the painting, the model, who is Vermeer's daughter. This young woman has the gift of her father's eyes, the vision of the artist. She herself longs to use the brushes, to mix the vermillion, the ultramarine, the burnt umber, with her own hands, her own vision taking shape on canvas. How fragile and unrealistic her dream; nevertheless, she cannot relinquish this small corner of herself.In the careful recreation of the story behind Vermeer's painting, Vreeland honors the gift, the act, the opportunity to create art. Perhaps only time validates the true artist, but this author eloquently reminds us to honor the artist in each of us, the importance of the moment, the beauty in simple detail. The &quot;artist&quot; reading THE GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE smiles in recognition, gratefully accepting this affirmation."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"An enchanting, fascinating, wonderful book. The book itself is like a Vermeer painting. As Vermeer used the color and detail in a painting to reveal his true subject - light - so does the author use details, emotions and lives themselves to paint that which affects them - Vermeer. Marvelous."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"An artist paints, a writer writes, and the work passes out of his/her control and becomes part of history. Vreeland gives us an almost mythical journey of one painting through time, and along the way she illuminates the human condition. A magical work!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A man invites a friend into his aparment on a lonely night. There he shows his colleague an ancient painting. He insists it is a vermeer, an original and lasting one at that. We are then taken on a journey back through time to the previous owners of the painting and how it effected their emotions and lives, all the way back to the painters first ideas and beginnings of the work. Through these remarkable people, we have a revival of our own emotions, and how we can grow to love other things more than we can love ourselves.Not a collection of short stories but not quite a novel, Vreelands book a work of art, a book to be cherished and savored and threatens to burst with the luminous moments that bind it. Girl in Hyacinth Blue reminds us of how important the things we love matter to us and how we can spread those emotions and loves to everyone we know"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland takes the story of an undiscovered Vermeer painting and takes the reader back in time, from many of the times it changed hands. Each story woven together creates a masterpiece. Though I found it hard to keep track of how the painting had switched owners occasionally, it was for the most part understandable. I loved how each chapter was almost a stand-alone piece, yet tied in with all the other parts of the story. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The novel was a beautiful idea, tracing a fictitious painting back in time. Unfortunately, the execution was not as lovely. Though each chapter is a beautiful snapshot (the farm family in the flood and the youth losing his &quot;witch&quot; love were especially moving) the passage between chapters was choppy and not nearly as elegant as each chapter itself. It was difficult to keep pace as the novel moves so abruptly through time. Where did the slave-traders' wife get the painting? How did it come into the hands of the older farming couple? These and many questions come up but are not answered. The novel is a case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is a small book, and only about half of every page is used. I thought I could read this book in about an hour, but I had to keep stopping. Nearly every story is heartbreakingly sad. Our book group selected this book, and the leader said that the author wrote this while struggling with cancer and those emotions came out in the writing. This must be true. I like fiction that celebrates life. This book covers many of life's sorrows. I don't think I would read another book by this author, but I'm not sorry I finished this one. On to something happier, like a Jane Hamiltion. (ha)"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"With eight short stories or perhaps vignettes, Ms. Vreeman traces an unknown Vermeer from its inception, to a locked room of a Professor with a dark family past. Central to that past is the manner his Father acquired the painting and the same past that so haunts the son. This book cannot escape comparison with \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring\\", and while it does not compare poorly, it certainly finishes second.Some of the eight stories are good, and some are very good, but they remain just that, pieces of eight, not a unified tale. I would have liked to have read this as a single work, one that was not broken apart, shuffled, and left for the reader to thread a non-sequential storyline together.I enjoyed the book, and the read is certainly worthwhile. It does not make great demands upon the reader, but unfortunately it does linger either."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I loved this book. The style was unique, even though it was a little puzzling for the first 3 chapters. The book provides brief snipets in the lifes of several owners of the same portrait. Vermeer may be the artist, but the portrait is unsigned so it's authenticity is questionable. Chapter one takes place in modern times. Each successive chapter takes place further into the past. The last chapter is about a brief time in Vermeer's life. I felt somewhat disappointed at not being able to follow a direct line from the last owner back to Vermeer, but that disappointment added an facet of interest--it makes me long for more. I've only read 2 fiction books twice (Jane Eyre and Poisonwood Bible), but I started rereading this book the day after completing it. Here's hoping Vreeland continues to write."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A tapestry is a work of art, where pieces of lovely cloth are woven together into something even more beautiful. So it is with Girl in Hyacinth Blue. Vreeland writes stories which are so touching in themselves and then she weaves the stories together to create a wonderful novel. This book evoked such strong images and elegant language that they will stay with me long after the book had been returned to the shelf."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Beautiful novel, the story of a Vermeer painting hidden for decades. Going back in time through the lives and loves and stories of all the previous owners, this book is a small and beautiful masterpiece of art and connection."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I really liked this book. It was fun to travel back in time with the painting. I also read Girl with the Pearl earring and that was great too. This is almost like reading several short stories. Quick, fun."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"What an amazing book; I cried more than once, reading it. The swirl of life--love, sadness, passion, cruelty--over the course of centuries, underlined by the utter stillness and enduring beauty of the painting."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The story of a painting and the people who have own it. Such an interesting read as the history of a painting is revealed"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I love the great masters of art and enjoy studying their paintings. In this book, one painting has a life of its own and catches admirers being themselves. Each transition this painting made through the hands of different people, was unique and reflected how appealing a painting like this can be to different people. This painting brought out the entire array of human emotions."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I just couldn't get started on this one. The first chapters were intriguing, but as the narrative went backwards, I couldn't quite keep my interest. I've read \\"backwards\\" books before, so I'm not sure why this one didn't grab me. I still wonder about whether or not it was real (I think it was...) but didn't wonder enough to finish the book!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Despite the three-star review, I am not implying that this book is bad or poorly written. This is an author who writes well. The reason behind the three stars was the format of the story. It starts in the present tense and goes backward through history. It's a beautiful way to tell the story of the painting and its journey through time, but I found myself losing interest as the book continued farther into the past. Events that I might have enjoyed reading earlier in the story seemed to lose meaning as I turned more pages. While I understand the reason behind telling the story behind each owner of the picture, I kept wanting the make it full circle and return to the present day characters.The ending isn't as sad as some novels I've read, but the book left me with a depressing perspective. Not every book has to have a happy ending, and in a sense the ending of the book was really the beginning of the painting's story. Still, the ending left me feeling dissatisfied with both the characters and the time I'd invested in reading their stories."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Vreeland's short stories are amazing in the little collection.Read it for a women in lit class and happened to be the best one!Love history and things connecting to the past this is a great book to read.Real easy, interesting, and intriguing."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I found this story developed so slowly that I almost put the book down. I'm glad I finished reading it but would only recommend it to readers who have patience with a slowly developed story line."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"It is quite possible the first time you actually stop reading and put down the short-fiction book Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland may be as you complete this wonderful tale. For me this was a &quot;one sitting&quot; book.The story in the life of a lost masterpiece by Vermeer and the souls captured by its very existence is extremely compelling.Vreeland's narrative is as smooth and refined as a layer of varnish applied by the master artist himself. The words within each of the related stories are rendered in such a fashion that is is almost impossible to avoid feeling you are an active observer of history being made."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I don't normally submit reviews, but I found this book to be good enough to write one. It is actually a series of stories about a &quot;lost&quot; painting by Vermeer. The author's style is such that she varies the tone of each story to match its flavor, which was refreshing. The painting and the lives of those whose hands it passes through are skillfully depicted in her telling. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland's novel begins on a simple note: an art teacher is invited into the home of a colleague, and is shown a breathtaking painting of a young girl staring out a window, her sewing forever arrested in oil on her lap. The colleague claims the painting is an original Vermeer. The art teacher cannot quite accept this as truth, despite the erudite proof of the colleague, because the painting has no provenance, or line of succession, to prove its origins. Its existence is undocumented and therefore suspect. Thus the novel is launched. Vreeland takes her readers back in time to each of the painting's owners and their heartbreaking stories that lead to their surrendering it. The line leads back to Vermeer himself, with the girl who posed for the painting having the final word.I read this brief novel in one sitting and yet felt completely satisfied upon its finish. The comparison to Tracey Chevalier's GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is inevitable given the subject matter, though in my opinion, Vreeland's book has greater depth and is told more skillfully. Because she weaves a history of the Netherlands into her tale, one gets the feeling of the sweeping changes that accompanied the eternally wistful expression of the young girl with &quot;an eye like a blue pearl.&quot;I highly recommend this book for general readers, particular those interested in fine writing, art, and historical fiction."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A collection of short stories told in reverse chronological order and held together by the presence of one painting. The earlier vignettes, or the later chapters of the book, are captivating as the Dutch lowlands and windmills take center stage in Vreeland's narratives. Characters have short-lived moments in the book, but that is okay once it becomes clear that the central character is the painting. The book is not long and it is easy to complete in a short time. An enjoyable result from reading the book, is that I found myself constantly looking at objects that have been around for a while, old coins, old buildings, and reflecting about the connections and stories these objects could tell about earlier times and people that have long departed. I found the book worthy of recommending to my middle school age kid, so it is fine for young teenagers."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The concept behind Susan Vreeland's GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE is an interesting one -- a beautiful painting, claimed by its present owner to be a previously-unknown work by Vermeer, is followed back through time, through its various owners, to the time of its inception and inspiration. A challenging premise -- but in the hands of Vreeland, it works very well.The novel starts out in the present day -- a reclusive university professor invites a fellow faculty member (an art professor) into his home, after the funeral of a dean. There, in his study, he reveals to his fellow teacher his most prized possession, a beautiful, luminous painting of a young girl looking out of a window. The art professor admires the artist's skill, calling it 'remarkable', a 'beguiling imitation' of a Vermeer. When the painting's owner reveals his belief that it is, indeed, a Vermeer, the art professor presses him for information as to how his father (who bequeathed him the work) came by the painting, and we are off on our journey.Along the way, we encounter many people who have possessed the painting over the past 300+ years -- and, as a microcosm of humanity itself, we find that they are simple, pure, pretentious, generous, scheming, talented and manipulative, in turns. It's a fascinating way of looking at the world 'around' this work of art - and, ultimately, many ways of looking at the work itself.The book is both well-written and entertaining -- and, overall, very illuminating, both in relation to art and to human nature, a highly recommended reading experience."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I loved this book! Vreeland's language is luminous, like Vermeer's paintings, and though each story effectively stands on its own, the sum total is greater than each of its parts. I am looking forward to her book THE PASSION OF ARTEMESIA due in 2002."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"What a wonderful little book! As I was reading this, I couldn't help but make little comparisons between it and Girl with a Pearl Earring, a book which was quite a disappointment to me. Both books tell a (fictionalized) story of a Vermeer painting; Girl in Hyacinth Blue, with its backwards timeline, managed to grab my attention with the first story, and once I started, I ended up finishing the entire book in almost one sitting!I definately know what I will be recommending that people read, instead of Girl With a Pearl Earring!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Each chapter is a story within a story. The common factor between each chapter is a beautiful painting of a sewing girl. The author starts the book in present times and introduces the reader to the current owner of the painting. Each successive chapter links the painting to the various owners of the painting, and traces its roots back to the artist. This was a very quick, relaxing read. I was intrigued by the cover of this hardback because it almost shows the entire painting, but not quite. Much was left to the imagry provided by the writer. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I found this story to be enchanting and wonderful. One of those books that was hard to put down and I was sad to reach the ending. Searched for Vermeer's paintings to see which one might be the subject of the book. Would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue proposes the existence of a 36th Vermeer painting among a professor's possesions. Vermeer was a famous Dutch painter who lived in the 1600s, and he often painted girls with a simple description in the paintings' titles: \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" for one. \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" features a girl in a smock the color of the sky of Heaven.The novel is composed of chapters that look like short stories (at least, that's how I interpreted it). It starts in the present and goes back in time, an interesting literary technique. Cornelius, the professor, had obtained the painting from his German father, who rounded the painting up during a raid on a Jewish house during World War II. The stories trace the painting's history back to Vermeer himself, and among the characters that the painting touches, there are resilient housewives, maturing young women, illegitimate babies, and the Vermeer family. Especially in the beginning, the stories do not seem to have any meaning or any connections to the other stories, but some keen observations point out that yes, all the stories are linked together.Some stories are better than others - I really liked this one: a family finds a baby and a painting in the river with a note (\\"Sell the painting\\"), but the housewife cannot bear to sell the lovely painting because in the dismal farm life, there has to be some beauty in it, too! As the food supply dwindles, she struggles to part with the only beautiful thing she has for money. I could feel the anguish and the longing glances she had toward the painting in this short but lovely story/chapter.The following story/chapter was also breathtaking. The chapter demystifies the lingering question of where the baby came from and depicts a haunting love story that tragically ends in death. Perhaps this is the chapter that gets me to love short stories again because I think this can stand by itself as one.These two stories are what left me amazed, but the so-so quality of the other stories is what prevents my giving this book 5 stars. The other stories were, in writing style, somewhat bland and lacked good transitions, and I saw that other reviewers took note, too. Nevertheless, for a good book on tracing a lineage (here, a painting's), I do suggest this one, simply because of the two stories I found so enchanting in here."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"What does a college art professor from the modern age and an 18th century witch have in common? Susan Vreeland weaves a truly wonderful story backwards in time, exploring the history of one picture as it passes from hand to hand and century to century.This is a beautifully written book that tells the story of a single painting by Dutch Master Vermeer. Tracing it's movement from hand to hand, the author brings to life each individual story surrounding the owners of the painting. As a reader I was immediately drawn into each individual story.A wonderful book and one I would highly recommend. I look forward to reading more of Susan Vreeland's work."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a creative &amp; charming novel of a fictional Vermeer painting. The novel details each of the lives of the various people who have owned the painting-either how they came to get the painting or pass it on and what importance the painting comes to play in their lives. Each chapter is a short story of it's own, beginning in the present and working it's way back in time through the actual creation of the work of art. I really enjoyed how Susan Vreeland took us back in time and the creative way in which she pieced each of the owners together. In the end I was left with a powerful feeling for many of the characters, both the artist, his subject and several of the owners. Not only was the story entertaining, but the themes that run through out the book are very thought provoking. The story touches on differences in perceptions of beauty, appreciation for the fun in life and the importance of love-how each of these play into giving one a sense of meaning and purpose. After finishing this book, it is still provoking much thought within me."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I know what you're thinking. Is this going to be one of those artsy &quot;literary experiences&quot; where almost nothing happens? NO! Incredibly, this book is pretty much of a page-turner, with a group of inter-connected stories about a fictional Vermeer painting. The book is done backwards, with the contemporary story first, followed by the World War II story, the turn of the century story, etc. It works beautifully! The characters are so well drawn that you'll come to know them well in only a few pages and you'll CARE about them. You'll also care about the painting, so remarkably word-painted by Ms. Vreeland that every nuance of it is indelible in the mind. When you finish the book, you'll turn back to page one and start again. One of the best books ever, and I read evrything from Sidney Sheldon to James Joyce."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I am a reader's advisory librarian and am putting this book on my recommended list right now. This book is a compilation of eight short stories that all come together because of the character's fascination with one painting.Unlike some other reviewers, rather than the issue of &quot;If It's a Vermeer,&quot; I truly feel that the heart of this novel comes in understanding that though we are all different, we can each be affected in the same way by art.It's a beautiful message that I feel is especially poignant in this time where we often seem to look for differences more often than similarities in our fellow human beings.This book is an easy read (I read it in one evening) and should appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction as well as art."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This was one of the best books I read all summer! It develops wonderful characters, creates a marvelous plot line, and emphazises the theme of the influence of art on lives. When a man shows his beloved painting which he believes is an original Vermeer to his friend, the friend claims it could be a fake since Vermeer's work had been copied in the 1930s. With that the chapter ends, but the book just begins. With each chapter, Vreeland creates another short story, with different, but always real characters. Only one thing stays constant - the painting. Each chapter/short story takes the reader back in time to the previous owner of the painting until at the end, we learn if the painting was a real or a fake. What a wonderful premise for the construction of a novel. This book is a delight and we need to hope Susan Vreeland continues to write more books!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I have never seen a Vermeer in my 21 years of existence, But now, I would love to see one and appreciate it.

Author Susan Vreeland did enough research to have written a dozen distinct novels.Third, the imagination Vreeland displays in her various stories. Each story has its own voice and the author--without question, deliberately and successfully--fails to signal her own feelings on certain moral issues she examines.Finally, the language, which consistently is lyrical, though the tone changes with each vignette.THE GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE is writing at its best. Susan Vreeland deserves every accolade for this fascinating book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"What an interesting book! How cleverly Vreeland creates a fictional story based on, but not exclusively about, the Dutch artist Vermeer. The premise is this: Starting in current times, she traces back through the ages the various owners of a painting that may have been painted by Vermeer. Vreeland takes what is clearly insightful knowledge of the life and work of the artist and creates a series of separate stories in which the common thread is the ownership of the painting entitled, &quot;Girl In Hyacinth Blue.&quot; It's a fascinating approach, and one that sparked my interest in Vermeer's life, thoughts and intentions in painting. It also explores the relationship between an owner of a work of art and the piece; this painting, the one consistent &quot;character&quot; in the novel, takes on a different significance in the life of each of its owners. This is a very enjoyable read, and a perfect lead-in to another Vermeer-based novel, Girl With A Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"What really threw me at first was that this book travels backward through time -- it really is like unpeeling an onion to get to the inner layers. The first chapter starts in the present, with a painting that may or may not be a Vermeer. How did its present owner come by it? Why does he hide it from view? These questions are answered in the next chapter, which is about the previous owners. And so it goes, each chapter moving backwards through the painting's parade of ownership. Some owners believe it a Vermeer, but most believe it's a copy by one of his contemporaries. It is not until the last two chapters that you learn not only the origin, but the inspiration for the mysterious painting and how it came to start on its journey.I thought this book was marvelously written. Each chapter was like a short story in itself, connecting with all the other short stories until the final product was a very complete and fascinating view of the history behind a single painting. Each chapter was very much its own little world, painstakingly drawn to be different from every other place. You will never be able to look at your simple objects again without wondering what stories they might tell, if only they could!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is a testament to Vreeland's ability as a writer. She uses her words to paint eight very different stories about the people who have owned this painting throughout time and their struggles in life. Some, such as the math teacher who owns it in the first story, have deep psychological secrets to face. Others, like the French diplomat's wife in Holland have boredom in a shallow world with which to contend. Yet what ties these very different stories together, besides ownership of the painting, is the way in which Vreeland makes the painting itself the focus for all of these characters.I especially enjoyed the way she was able to create a sense of time and place over the centuries and still make the individual characters come alive within the space of a chapter. I had just prior read &quot;The Girl with a Pearl Earring,&quot; and found it interesting to see how she would develop the character of Vermeer himself. His aloofness from the day to day concerns of life, even his making of the paints in the attic, were very similar to his depiction in &quot;Pearl Earring,&quot; suggesting that the historical research of this artist was thorough. &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is the type of book that one will want to savor, yet at the same time find difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Vreeland and I found her topic and storytelling to be very entertaining and very descriptive. This story tracks the path of a painting thought to have been created by Vermeer and we follow it from present day to back to the day it was created. This is really a story that is made up of several short stories each standing on it's own and the different effects this one painting had on each owner. I found this to be a very entertaing read and look forward to reading my by this very talented author!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is an excellent and unusual novel which chapter by chapter and layer by layer exposes the history of a fictional Vermeer. Each layer of the story is unique and interesting and keeps the reader guessing as to both the authenticity and origin of the painting as it is passed from owner to owner. The languge of the book is fluid and the concept a refreshing change of pace."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland's Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a thoughtful, richly historical tale about the fortunes of a Vermeer painting. Read in tandem with another popular novel about the great Dutch Master, Tracy Chevalier's Girl With a Pearl Earring, any reader would have an enjoyable and literary short course in 17th century Dutch painting and culture.One of the finest artists of the Dutch Golden Age, Johannes Vermeer painted ordinary people, often women, bent over their sewing, reading letters, pouring milk. Unexciting to imagine, but riveting to view. Besides the dazzling colors--said to contain the \\"dust of crushed pearls\\"--he illuminated life's smallest moments, making them seem less sentimental than profound.Which is also the task of the best short stories, and Vreeland's novel is really a collection of short stories. They are bound by common themes and characters, all possessed by a striking portrait of a young woman looking out a window, lost in thought, brilliantly clothed in hyacinth blues.Beginning in contemporary times with an owner who came into the painting from his Nazi father, the story goes back to the 17th century and the very day of the picture's inspiration. A lot happens in what is essentially a quiet and literary book. There are floods, witch-hangings, infants abandoned in rowboats, and adulterous couples caught with their breeches down. Historical backdrops include the Nazi occupation of Holland and the era when Dutch ships bullied the high seas, looting and colonizing the East Indies and sending slaves to the Americas.But the story's rich characterizations override the outward dramas. You feel the stony grief of the young Jewish girl in an Amsterdam no longer safe for Jews; the turmoil of a great painter harassed by domestic pressures and the impossibility of perfection.If the first chapter is the book's weakest--melodramatic and unlikely--the final two chapters are heartbreaking. The girl who inspired the painting is Vermeer's daughter, who would rather be a painter than a muse. But he is blind to her desire and ambition.Vreeland conveys the poetry of the Lowlands' landscape--the humped, iron bridges, gently hued marshes and lively skies. By telling us the first words taught to a baby-- \\"cow\\" and \\"water\\"--she captures the dominance of agriculture and the sea on Dutch life.Girl in Hyacinth Blue accomplishes a great deal in its compact canvas. What it has to say about human beings--our lost potential and the ways in which we let beauty slip from our grasp--is unbearably sad if you're in a mood to notice.Reviewed by Rebecca BurkeAuthor of When I Am Singing to You"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book was recommended to me by my mother and typically, I adore the books that she suggests. However, this book left me wanting more and was not as good as I was expecting.The story follows the path of a Vermeer painting from present time to when the picture was created several hundred years ago. Through the story, it passes through 7 owners. The painting is described as a beautiful young girl, who is looking out a window day dreaming. She has sewing materials as well. Each owner relates to the painting and has a philosophy of what the girl is thinking; and for some, it also reminds them of loves lost. Most of their stories were sad, but all felt a connection to the painting. Each chapter shares the story of a different owner as well as what was going on in their lives. The last 2 chapters is Vermeer painting the girl and his story and the girl's story 20 or so years later.Vermeer only painted 30 or so paintings and most of the owners recognized its great value.While the premise of the book (hearing the story of each of the 7 owners) is interesting, the beginning 2 chapters were so intriguing that I wished that the author would have continued further with this line rather than jumping to the next owner. The next 2 owners didn't feel connected to the rest of the story as the other 5 owners. For those middle owners I felt that there were details missing in how they came about owning the painting so it felt disjointed at times. The last 4 chapters the story felt connected. However, after 2 chapters of somewhat a disconnect, I felt the book lost much of its momentum.While I thought the book was good, I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars if chapters 3-4 had more details so that the reader could more easily follow the path of the painting."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The title of Girl in Hyacinth Blue could also be titled Life of a Painting. All who read this book will enjoy art more because of the wonderful description of the painting and the way the owners of it enjoy its beauty.Set in Amsterdam from 1939 to 1945, the story gives a wonderful history of the life of the people during WWII. Since the story gives the historical account of the painting Girl in Hyacinth Blue from present day to its beginning, you're reading a memoir backwards to find out how the painting came to be in the current owner's home.Enjoy an easy read while you learn."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"When reading the book Girl in Hyacinth Blue, by Susan Vreeland, I found that it was a good and interesting read. The book takes place in the 1800's and although it isn't very modern, it was still relatable to modern times and easy to understand where the characters were coming from. The book wasn't a challenge to read, it was very basic and straight-forward with what was going on. The plot itself was based on a rare painting and how it affected each different person who gained possession of it. It wasn't a page turner and it was easy to guess what was going to happen next. The characters all had this sadness that came from their attachment to the painting while it was a part of their lives. I enjoyed how the author made all the characters different and the only thing they had in common was their unique attachment to the painting. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys rare paintings and anyone who wants a good quick read. Overall, the book has a pretty interesting concept. When analyzing each of the stories separately and then putting them all together, you begin to realize how one painting can so powerfully affect many different lives."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I loved this book. It starts in modern times and goes back through all the owners of the painting to Vermeer who painted it. They all loved the painting and tried so hard to hold on to it but alas, were not able to. They were all mesmerized by its beauty. All of the owners found something about it that made it all their own. I would whole heartedly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is a gem, like any and all of Susan's novels, it is superbly well written and carefully researched. The characters are engaging and the story compelling. A delightful read!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is the story of how beauty affects those around them. The main character is a long lost painting of a young girl, barely into her teens, sewing, but also staring out a window and daydreaming. About what? Would she like to be out and about instead of confined to her domestic duties? Is this a Vermeer painting? Vermeer was known for painting quiet domestic scenes. This seems to be a search for beauty among the ordinary, the joy of life or joyex d'vivre as the French would say.Some of the paintings owners would have like to keep it, but weren't able to.The present owner of the girl's paiinting was a strange mathematic teacher in a private boys' school. He shows it to an art teacher, another of the schools' instructors and tells him how he obtained it. The painting is kept hidden in the teachers' house and the only one to know about it is the art teacher. The math teachers' father has left it to him. The man was a low ranking Nazi officer who stole it from a Jewish family when they were sent to a concentration camp. The painting was akways to be kept secret.The next story deals with a man whose wife wants to give the painting to his daughter and her soon to be husband as a wedding gift. Laurens doesn't want to part with it. He was busy watching his daughter and his soon to be son-in-law together and is jealous of their youth and new beginning in life. He confesses to his wife that the girl in the painting reminds him of the long lost love of his youth. He treated his love badly so she left him wanting to never hear from him again. Digne gets over her anger and tells Laurens to be happy for who he now is. Digne keeps the painting and the couple realizes how lucky they are to have each other in their later stage of life.Then further back in time a French woman steals the painting from her husband and sells it in order to pay for her trip back home to France. She does not like the Netherlands, it is too provincial, she is tired of her cheating husband, she does not like the lifestyle of this country, and she wants to go home. So she does.Further back in time, possibly in the year 1717. The dykes have flooded the countryside close to the ocean. A family is living on an island surrounded by water. This is their home now, a mother, father, a boy and a girl. Then a basket containing a baby and the painting has been placed in their boat. Who is the baby? Who is the girl in the painting? Could the girl be the baby's mother? The home she lived in seemed to be a wealthy one. The housewife looks at the painting and wished her home was so fine. But hers was crowded and wet animals and everything else crammed into little space. The family decided they would have to sell the painting in order to be able to live. The mother would have loved to keep it, but couldn't. Food was more important than beauty. So off she goes, gets into her boat, floats to shore and goes from town to town trying to sell the painting until she gets a decent price. The painting had been stolen by a young man from the home of his aunt. Why?At the same time a witch was hanged for killing her child.The mystery ends at the close of the book. The reader finds out who the girl is and who the artist is who painted her portrait.This is a great and different way to tell a story begining with the present and ending back to about 1670-73, a time of approximately 300 years. The story is beautifully told, with good and well writen sense of time and place.and also good characterization.There is a video about the story of 'The Girl in Hycinth Blue.' This video made me want to read the book. Both are done excellently."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Some people might be disappointed with this book after reading Tracy Chevalier's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\\" Yet like a Vermeer, Vreeland's book drew me in with elements of mystery. And also like a Vermeer, it gave no straight, linear \\"story\\", but rather allows us to decide for ourselves the significance of its portrayed themes and emotions evoked in us. The vignettes are incomplete, but just allow enough of a glimpse into the pivotal moments of people's lives and how they interact with beauty in their lives.This idea of interaction and response to beauty, also introduced via the opening Keats poem \\"Ode to a Grecian Urn,\\" is key to why it differs from the Chevalier book. Chevalier presents an interesting plot, but it is like a picture book illustrated by Vermeer and more visual than cerebral. Although accessible to those reading only for a plot, Vreeland's book seems to more of a meditation on art, timelessness, and beauty. Its depictions of the 17th century Netherlands, the physical qualities of Vermeer paintings, and the bittersweet juxtapositions of people's external troubles and their solace of finding that inner quiet space via Vreeland's imagined Vermeer painting add extra layers of complexity.The book's weaknesses, I found, lay in the overly sentimental narrative, the unconvincing shifts in some of the character voices. And it panders to the book club crowd with its inane discussion questions. Yet the last few chapters of the book are exquisite in some of their insights and language. Overall, it's a well-crafted book that may grow with you if you reread at different stages in your life. I read it for the first time 7 years ago, and rereading it for the second time a few weeks ago, I discovered new things to appreciate.If you enjoy reading poetry for its visual images, are moved by the beauty of simple, seemingly mundane moments in life, or liked the movie the Red Violin, you might enjoy this book too. As Vreeland illustrates in her book, our response to books and art is often a reflection of ourselves and not always of the book's externally deemed \\"value\\" or \\"worthiness\\" of your time."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I like the idea that the history of the painting is traced back through time to its conception. And several of the stories were well told....but not all of them. It's a light read, not offensively bad. Just don't expect it to be anything like &#34;Girl With a Pearl Earring.&#34;"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"There wasn't enough history in this for me. Rembrandt by Gladys Schmittwas more informative. I think the author is more fanciful when viewing a work of art."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I really enjoed this book. I would not have chosen it but it wads my book club selection this month. The storytelling's is well pit together linking some very different people and times through a portrrrait of an unknown girl done by a an unknowable artist suspected to be Vermeer. Very enjoyable"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book shows how art enriches our lives in different ways. I found the 8 stories compelling. I did have difficulty realizing when the the story shifted from one family to another at times. The chapter titles did not help...perhaps a time line with the chapter title. I wish the painting was real and we could gaze upon the young girl's face in the painting. Her countenance seemed to mesmerize the viewer and cause much reflection within the various stories. I certainly wished that Vermeer had painted more. Not only did the book cause the reader to reflect on the richness of the character protrayals, but to think about how art can impact our own lives. The story is also study of historical events and how they relate to the families in the book and a small biography of a wonderful artist. I invite everyone to read this book. It certainly has made me reflective. I think this will be a great discussion book for book clubs."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is an excellent example of life in Australia during and after World War 11. I was born in rural Australia and could identify with the author's memoir. Every Australian born after these events should read this to learn about the strength,humor and wisdom our parents and those who fought so bravely to defend Australia had to survive during those very difficult years. I will definately be recommending it to my daughters to read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I enjoyed the book. It went from present day back to the begining of the painting. A very unusual but in depth story, with a lot of intresting people and their stories."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I enjoyed the book, it's format was different as it went from present to past. I love historical fiction, and this one gives you some history. It was enjoyable."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A beautiful painting of a wistful young girl is found hidden away from the world. Follow it's journey back to its beginning. If you like historical novels and mystery stories you will like the Girl in Hyacinth Blue."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Although it is at time stilted in the translation, Vreeland takes you on a wonderful journey back in time following the thread of provenance of a fictitious Vermeer. Well worth immersing yourself in 9 Dutch tales that envelop both time and setting."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This was one of those books that contained a story so interesting that I could not put it down. The other piece was the accuracy of the history, and the feel you get for Vermeers work. I genuinely felt transported in time and place to experience lives with clarity and emotion. Each family was touched by the Vermeer and changed for having it's presence in thier lives for a time. I have only read one other book by Vreeland and it too was a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I am a reader's advisory librarian and am putting this book on my recommended list right now. This book is a compilation of eight short stories that all come together because of the character's fascination with one painting.Unlike some other reviewers, rather than the issue of &quot;If It's a Vermeer,&quot; I truly feel that the heart of this novel comes in understanding that though we are all different, we can each be affected in the same way by art.It's a beautiful message that I feel is especially poignant in this time where we often seem to look for differences more often than similarities in our fellow human beings.This book is an easy read (I read it in one evening) and should appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction as well as art."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I had read Tracy Chevalier's GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, which I absolutely loved, so it was with trepidation that I began to read GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE - I was worried it wouldn't be as good. Shame on me. The two books are extraordinary in their own right, and deserve not to compared. GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE is a marvelous reverse pentimento of a little known Vermeer painting - starting with a completed work of art, and tracing its byzantine provenance back to the moment of its creation. The interweaving threads of human tragedy and joy surrounding the painting make for a rich and emotionally charged tale. I went out and immediately bought a book of Vermeer's paintings after reading this, imagining the utter absorption and family chaos that surrounded his life and work - a life and work that Susan Vreeland brings to glorious life in this lovely, lyrical book. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A beautifully written book about so much more than a painting. The author gets across the love and pull of art, and the importance a piece can have in a life. The only drawback to the book was the time shifting was a bit confusing."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland's novel &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is a short, entertaining read, but I found it to be slightly disappointing and very lacking in character development. The dialogue that the characters used with one another sometimes seemed to be on an elementary level, and I didn't feel that Vreeland fully developed the feelings of awe and adoration that her characters supposedly had for the mysterious Vermeer painting that touched their lives. In fact, the painting's beauty was glorified much more than the reactions to it, which were sometimes hollow, empty and cliched. While the idea of going back in time to observe the lives that the painting has touched was indeed an interesting one, I felt that Vreeland did not do enough with this concept - she seemed so overeager to group a bunch of lukewarm short stories together into a novel that she missed the greater and more rewarding challenge of expanding on the storylines that she created. There were characters in this novel whom I wanted to get to know, but never did! It was as if I was being hurried along toward an ending that had no particular purpose. However, Vreeland had some great storylines in this novel, but she just didn't go anywhere with them, and this reader was left feeling a little shortchanged. I have to admit, the glowing reviews that this book had received both from critics and avid readers surprised me in the end, but nevertheless I give it three stars for the potential it had, and the occasional stirring images it drew."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Not only is the writing style unique as Vreeland takes us backwards in time, but her word choices are well crafted. I had to read the book again within a 3 week period and planned to skim it. I just could not skim. Every word is perfectly chosen. To read the story was like creating a painting of people, landscapes, hopes, heartache, history, and love in my mind. As a lover of art and words, the combination of both I found very moving. If you enjoyed it the first time, read it again. Although we never know if the painting is destroyed, we have the opportunity to see how many peoples' lives it touched. That idea is so much more important than the outcome. The story teaches us that a work of art often outlasts its creator and can touch many souls well into the future. As a mediocre artist, this book gives me the desire to continue to create. Touching, uplifting, sweet, and executed with devotion."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The book follows a Vermeer back through history, with little stories about how it touches the lives of the people who see it, own it, or love it. Vreeland does a great job creating a history of the painting, &quot;tracking&quot; it from the present-day owner back to Vermeer. In every instance, someone's obsession with the painting changes their life, sometimes for the better, and sometimes not. While of the stories are gripping,others just fail to engage you. It's a neat idea for a book, but the realization was a little spotty in places. Definitely worth reading, but be prepared to stick out a couple of chapters that may sag a little."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is a masterpiece, like the painting (real or imaginary) which inspires it. Each short story has a life of it's own and yet when read together all are interwoven by the common thread of the painting. Some stories will appeal more than others, some are haunting and painfull; all are beautiful, evocative and real. Anyone who has pondered the relationship between beauty and money, the creative urge and the need to make a living will find this work poignant. It brought to mind Orwell's &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; and Mary Gordon's &quot;Spending&quot;. The former is realistic, the latter utopian. &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; portrays the subject from all angles. Illuminating and perfectly balanced, quite beautiful."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is truly fantastic collection of stories. The fact that Susan Vreeland focuses not on technique or the actual process of painting allows the reader to focus on the emotions and actions of each of the painting's owners. The slightly disjointed nature of the stories and variations in writting style reflect the variations in characters themselves. The most wonderful thing about this entire book lies in the fact that all our questions are not answered and every thing does not tie up into a nice, neat little package. As a result, this novel a reflection of real life."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I loved the way the author was able to capture the poignant vignettes in the painting's past--but more than that, she is able to describe what the painting *means* to each of these past owners and viewers of the work. The book can really set you to wondering about the histories of some other famous works of art: Did they ever fall into a river? Did an owner add some details on a whim? What moments of history have they been witness to? I found myself turning to the jacket artwork time and again, wishing I could see this painting and share in the extraordinary experience."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I really loved this book. I do have to admit though, at the beginning I kept having to remind myself that the stories were going backward in time.I really do not love short stories, but this really attracted me, each story related to the one painting, and each story so connected. This is my first book by this author, she writes with such beauty and insight....I look forward to reading her others."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I enjoyed the fact that it was written in reverse order."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Vreeland is a gifted writer, and I read the bulk of this bulk during a flight. I did enjoy it, but gave it only 3 stars because there were several things that I didn't like about it. One, is that the stories were almost overwhelmingly sad and depressing. Someone mentioned that the author wrote this book while she had cancer--well, that all well and good to get your emotions out, but couldn't she have done it in a journal instead? Of 7 stories, 5 of them just take the life out of you. No resolution to them, just despondancy. The other two weren't as sad, but still, the characters suffer loss or are living with unfulfilled dreams. What was the purpose of doing this? To put all readers on Prozac?Second, was that the dates were hard to figure out on some of the stories. She might have just put the date on the top, so we know when it was taking place. In one story, the farmer speaks of \\"this new century\\" so I just assumed, judging from where it was in the book, that is was the beginning of the 20th. But how beginning? Did the story take place in 1900, 1910, 1920? Same for the story before it. I assumed the date to be early 1800s, trying to piece together the hints the narrator gave, but why not just tell the reader when it takes place. Also, the story of the flood. You don't know it's 1717, or have a clue, until you read the next story, which dates it. Very poor technique.Third, not all of the stories flowed together well. The first two were connected, but then we skip back to presumably, early 20th century, and we have no idea how the owners came by their painting. And then it seems to skip back in time 100 years, and we have no idea what it was doing in between, or who own it. It then skips another 100 years...there is no connection between the first flood story, the Frenchwoman in the Hague, and then the farmer in the early 20th century. There are approx. 100 year gaps between them, and we have no idea what happened to the painting in between.Fourth, there is no resolution. I was hoping that we would return to the original narrator and find out what Cornelius decides to do with the painting, or if it does officially get declared a Vermeer. The story just ends with the painting being auctioned in 1696, and that's it. There was nothing to tie this all together and made for a very dissatisfying ending.Finally, it is hard to believe that Cornelius would think of burning the painting just because his Nazi father took it from the home of Jews who had been deported. It was a bit melodramatic, that this painting has totally controlled his life. Yes, his father was a Nazi, and he took the painting. So Cornelius can now turn the painting over to the Dutch government if it torments him so. To preserve his anonymity, and the memory of his father, he can ask someone else to do it. I don't know, there were a lot of ways to deal with this, but the story of the son living a tormented life is just so cliche by now. But at any rate, this book did need a resolution.And the end of the story broke with the backward chronology. The last chapter should have come before the one before it.It's a good book, entertaining, and Vreeland is a good writer. But it leaves you empty because you want to know more about the characters. Perhaps if she had limited the number of stories, and revisted each one several times, it would have been a more satisfying story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I had high hopes, but I expected more of a literary quality in this book. I found the sentences obvios and the emotion planned. It seemed too simple to be authentic. It didn't draw me in at all."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"If you love books and art you will love this novel it is a great combination of the two worlds. I am not just saying that because Susan Vreeland was my 12th grade english teacher"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Read this for book club and all I can say is yuck. OBVIOUSLY written for the book club market. So lightweight, it floats. Deeply, deeply shallow. A cute trick the way it starts now and goes back in time but so what. It is a quick-read if that's all you want. And I'll tell you what bothered me the most was the chapter that was probably the most developed -- when the mother killed the deformed baby. Do a little RESEARCH would ya? Mothers didn't get hung for killing babies back then. Especially not a baby that would've starved to death in a few days. The whole thing just annoyed me. I left book club and dropped it in the nearest trash can. Not even worth passing along. Yuck."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I found the first half of this book to be fairly monotonous. While the concept for the novel--following a painting's owners all the way back to the painter--is interesting, Vreeland didn't really get me hooked in the first hundred pages. The stories got more interesting toward the end, but if I were a less voracious reader I might not have made it there."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"In fairness, this is not really a rip-off of a better-known book about a Vermeer painting (Tracy Chevalier's lovely Girl with a Pearl Earring.) It's simply a dreadful book. Vreeland's prose is loose and sloppy, and some of the \\"facts\\" she presents in her stories are simply incorrect. However, what really makes this book a loser is that her stories are just dull, dull, dull. Every time I put this book down I had to *force* myself to pick it up again. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland puts words to paper as visually as a painter puts color on canvas. There are no fireworks or attention getting crises to hook you into the book, but you are drawn in, nonetheless. This is a very discussible book for book club groups. This book has the quality of true art, that is, each time you read you see something new in it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue in my opinion was a dull book. It started off slow and it never held my attention. After a certain point I no longer knew what I was reading since I found the book to be too dull."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I wanted this book to be good. It is attractively packaged and the premise of the story seemed promising. Reading the book's words brought only a two dimensional vision, and an unoriginal vision at that. There is nothing new here for anyone who has heard the word &quot;nazi&quot;, and mediocre prose to convey a listless and painfully forced story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I wish I had read this before I read The Girl with the Pearl Earring. That book overrode any references this book makes with regard to Vermeer's genius.But that is not to say the books are similar. It's just that, particularly in the final chapters, Vermeer's genius is too shallowly presented.The Vermeer in this book is a fictional work, and the treatment, following its provenance back through time, is a worthy idea. How much do we wonder at the hands throughout time that have held a masterpiece? Consider how rapt we were at the history of The Red Violin.Each chapter explores the times and personal hardships of its historical owners, but each owner, I think, is dealt with in a summary way. Each life could have been dealt with more thoroughly. But I found that one could easily leave off reading this at the end of a chapter and that's why I called it a good vacation book.I also found that Vreeland used the painting as a sort of talisman, bringing good fortune to the good, and bad luck to others, with a couple of exceptions.All in all an interesting idea, well worked."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland has given us nine gifts wrapped in one book in Girl In Hyacinth Blue. Each of the 8 stories is in itself a wonderful gift - a story complete and rich and thoughtful. The the ninth gift is the book itself. The total of these stories is greater sum of its parts. Together they weave a fascninating recounting of the ownership of the painting. Give yourself nine gifts in one!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Johannes Vermeer was one of the great dutch painters of the XVII century, and his life alone is a great story. Notably, he left few paintings, less than forty, and died in poverty, leaving his family full of monetary debts. Since Vermeer usually didn't sign his paintings, it's hard to tell if they are authentic or fakes. Many paintings believed to be Vermeers were discovered to be fakes, and vice-versa.Susan Vreeland's book is in fact a collection of short-stories concerning one immaginary painting by Vermeer, named \\"Girl in hyacinth blue\\". Using the painting as the binding element, she tells the various stories of people who possessed the work of art, beginning in the late 1990s and going back to the time Vermeer painted it.I noticed that many people believe that this book's main theme is to know if Vermeer was really the author of the painting or not. This is wrong. This book is not a whodunnit, but stories of relationships, loss, fear, forgiveness and love. The painting is only the central artifact, but each story has its own distinct characters and situations. Each story is complete in its own way, but I think the author could develop them some more. Or maybe not, maybe the most charming aspect of the book is that it's short.Anyway, a fast, emotive and very enjoyable reading.Grade 8.6/10"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The Girl in Hyacinth Blue offers a unique perspective. The main character is not a person, it is a painting and each chapter is about one of the lives it affects. Because each chapter is about a different person and the book goes backward in time it can be a little confusing. I also did not like that some of the chapters have been previously published as short stories. The book felt pieced together until the end which flowed a little better. Despite this, the book makes you think about what it means to really know someone and about the things you value in your own life."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book fascinated and pleased me. The author told the stories of each owner of the Vermeer painting, giving a sense of being an intimate onlooker, into the lives of each owner. I recommend this book, and I wish there were more like it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Not much of a book but maybe entertaining for those who want a book for the beach. Tracy Chevalier's book, The Girl With the Pearl Earring, is a much more engaging treatment of the same topic (Vermeer.)"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is a must-read for anyone who loves historical novels. It was wonderful to follow the painting back through time and see how it affected all it's owners and finally see how the painting began and how it affected the painter and the girl in the painting.Vreeland is a superb writer. I was a little confused in the beginning because I wasn't sure where she was going with it, but once I realized what was happening, I couldn't put it down.I was sorry to see it end."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"In Girl in Hyacinth Blue, Susan Vreeland crafts the history of Vermeer's fictitious \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" from the chilly study of a contemporary math teacher to the passionate painter's daughter who sat for the portrait. The eight stories which vaguely map this history challenge the structures of human relationship by delving into the private world of the observer...and hovering there in the tension between passion and perspective.To read the stories in the context of chronology (ie, backwards from the end of the book) is to read of the decline of the personal in favor of the proprietal. To read them in proper order is to join Vreeland in a conspiracy of engagement in human love and passion for life against chronology, current culture and the 20th century's most heinous crime."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is not a book or genre I would normally have picked to read, but a good friend recommended it to me and I was amazed myself by simply loving it. What made the book so interesting and special is the way Vreeland structured the whole story. It is very innovative and refreshing to read such a well written story.They story revolves around a possible 36th Vermeer painting - there are only 35 in known existence. Vreeland makes the painting, in a sense, the main character and whole book revolves around the people that have been touched by it. I don't want to give too much away, because I read it without knowing anything about the book and that makes the unfolding of the story extra special.I like the compactness of the story, but was amazed by the writing. It's one of those books you don't want to finish."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"What is the role of art in life? To anyone who loves Vermeer and can identify with the magic of his paintings, this book will touch a chord. but, even if you don't know Vermeer, the book is touching in how it focuses on how art, a single painting can transform even an &quot;ordinary&quot; person's life. I saw the Vermeer exhibit in Washington, D.C. a few years ago and I came away tremendously moved by his ability to capture a single, private moment on canvas and let the viewer share in that moment. I can see how some might be bored or impatient with this book. The stories are uneven, I probably would have given it 3.5 stars. It is a quiet book. It raises some thoughtful, important issues."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. It is short and simply written, but the concept behind it is so wonderfully intriguing. The book moves backwards in time, telling the story of a Vermeer painting from the current owner, a college professor who obssesses about its beauty and provenance, through to the girl who was the subject of the painting.Every chapter deals with the picture not only in a different time, but also from a different perspective. The actual painting is described by the characters each time, through their own aspects and interpretations.A refreshing, compelling and rewarding read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is the first work by Vreeland I have read, and I enjoyed it immensely. The progression from the present day backward in time is unique and it works well. A very pretty little package, too, making this a natural choice for a small gift. You won't regret buying it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"In the opening of this moving work of fiction, an undiscovered Dutch master's painting, circa 1665, is shown in secret to a professor of art. He is qualified to classify it as a genuine and theretofore undiscovered work of Jan Vermeer but is reluctant to do so because of the shady auspices of its acquisition: it had been seized during Nazi occupation. Since the acquisition is less than honorable, ownership of the painting is both a blessing and a curse. This theme is beautifully woven throughout the story.The impact of this simple portrait of a young girl is immense. Admirers are drawn to the blue of the smock she is wearing, the \\"pearl\\" of her eye, the luminescence of the light streaming through the window near her. And, although the subject is depicted engaged in the simple task of hand sewing, it is obvious that there is something very, very different about what was going on when this painting was being made.Through eight gorgeous and historically detailed chapters, author Susan Vreeland masterfully follows the ownership of the painting backward through time. As she plants and waters the seed of exploring the human ability to become attached to inanimate objects, we are given a view into the life and relationships of each successive owner.The challenge of the first set of characters is an awesome one: how to adequately enjoy something which is, technically, forbidden to own. Immediately, the reader's curiosity is piqued on many levels: Of course, What is the origin of this painting? But also, How does one come to terms with ownership of artistic property gained by questionable means? How can one enjoy it? And, of course, we ask ourselves again and again, if the work is authentic, if the work was actually done by Vermeer. And, if it was, what was the origin? Who is the subject? And, as we may ask ourselves in the case of the famous Mona Lisa, what was the subject thinking while she was posing and how did the composition come about?The challenges of each of the subsequent owners are as awesome as the professor's. And while each has a unique story, all of them are similarly enamored of the same stranger's work. And the delight and the pain of their human drama connects their stories while demanding our attention to a poignancy and delicacy that is unforgettable.As the author draws us in tighter and tighter to the humble creation of the painting, we can fully appreciate how one person's work can impact the lives of many strangers.With wonderfully human characters, a highly engaging and thought-provoking story line, and beautiful, painterly prose, *Girl in Hyacinth Blue* is a glorious and fresh work of fiction, and a book capable of entertaining while also having a deep, marvelous impact on the reader."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"As a professor of literature, I can attest to the grandeur of this little book. Here is a series of eight short stories that are more than discrete tales, they represent a backward tumble into the history of a painting. If you have a narrative prejudice that requires a main character struggling against fierce odds, you will probably not understand the power of this book. The main character never speaks, never acts, never does anything. Rather, the \\"lost\\" painting of Vermeer compels fierce emotions from all into whose hands it falls. But there is more to this tale-told-in-pieces. As we travel back to the moment of inspiration that created the work, we understand something central to the concept of art itself. In the modern world that opens the novel, Vermeer's painting is viewed as something ethereal. Almost unreal in its beauty, the painting has acquired something of a soul of its own by the twentieth century. As we travel back through its owners, the painting diminishes ultimately to a piece of commodity, something with value to be sold that will do nothing more that financially enrich the holder. The questions raised by this little gem of a novel (to what degree is beauty determined by future generations? what of our world will be stripped away for the convenience and through the prejudice of our children, grandchildren, and their offspring? what is the nature of art?) will keep you pondering this book, and its hearfelt, tightly written chapters, for many weeks after you set it down."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Well researched historical fiction at its best. The most appealing aspect of this book to me is the unique manner in which it is presented. The author tells the story of the painting by giving us as an account of each owner, leading us back to its creation. The question in the back of the reader's mind is always whether the artist was actually Vermeer. Intelligently written with a clever use of language and a vast array of interesting characters, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Vreeland will be an author I add to my list of favorites. I would give this book 4.5 stars. Kelsana 8/27/01"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The book traces the history of a possible Vermeer painting through history. As we follow the painting's past, the reader is given a glimpse into the very different lives of its owners in eight short stories that are linked through the painting. Vreeland characterizations and ability to convey emotion are excellent. She is also convincingly perfects each story so that it is its own universe, yet part of the whole. Each story is distinct and each story rings true. Of the stories, &quot;Adagia&quot; shines. It is simply outstanding in its depiction of a long-married couple. Unfortunately, I didn't give the book five stars because a few of the stories can really drag and are a really a chore to get through. Still, an interesting read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland \`s Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a most unusual novel. Positing the existence of a 36th Vermeer painting, the book explores the power that art can exert upon us to the point of obsession.The book is essentially 8 different yet interrelated short stories about the circumstances of the historical owners of the painting in question, the Girl in Hyacinth Blue. The transition between stories is accomplished through a series of interlocutory vignettes concerning the circumstances of Vermeer's life and the actual creation of the painting. Although I actually like Vermeer's work, I knew next to nothing about his personal life and found these passages quite interesting.On the whole I found the stories quite compelling as well, though there were a few that would have benefited from a bit more development and a more thorough presentation.However, on the whole I found the book quite riveting and entertaining. In the end I was left wishing the painting did in fact exist-even without knowing what it actually looked like--the cover illustration aside-I felt a bit obsessed with it myself. That Vreeland could evoke such a feeling says a lot about the quality of her book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This was the third novel I read about Vermeer's paintings At First I was unsure of how related all the stories were,but I was not disappointed. Each story transported me to a world of struggling people and how a work of art affects or transforms their lives. The final story in \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" is narrated by the daughter of Vermeer. Although fictitious, her dreams,desires, and longings are so natural for a young person, and I was so moved with it that I was in tears by the end. If you want to be transported to a faraway time and place...and yet feel your can identify with each character, read this book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland has written a lovely and thought provoking novel with well developed characters that will remain with you long after the final page. There is beauty and tradegy in each chapter, chapters that could stand alone as short stories but together add layers and depth to the history of an object, the painting, and the people and families who loved and cared for it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"It amazes me that after hundreds of years, Vermeer's art is so inspirational that 2 wonderful pieces of fiction about his paintings were published the same year (1999) ! After thoroughly enjoying GIRL WITH a PEARL EARRING (Tracy Chevalier), I was intrigued by this book by Ms. Vreeland.Despite their major similarities, the general plot idea and structure was quite different and unique. While Ms. Chevalier's novel dealt with the life story of Greit, the fictional subject of Girl with a Pearl Earring, GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE begins in modern times with the current owner of the painting. Each chapter is a short story unto itself and yet they are all connected by ownership of the painting as we travel back in time to the time when Vermeer actually painted the masterpiece. Throughout the story, the power that the painting had over the emotions and actions of its owners is explored. Therefore, it is ironic when Vermeer's painting subject doubts her own self-worth and her ultimate importance in the world.A very helpful companion to both this novel and Ms. Chevalier's novel is VERMEER: THE COMPLETE WORKS (Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr., 1997) because it features all the Vermeer painting discussed in these tales.This was a very entertaining short novel and I would highly recommend it, especially if you truly appreciate the power of art!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The concept of this novel, tracing the history of a painting by going back in time chapter by chapter, is just my cup of tea. Susan Vreeland has done an excellent job in transferring this unique notion to paper. I've always enjoyed antiques and wondered about its origination; Girl in Hyacinth Blue was like a dream come true in that respect.The story begins with math professor, Cornelius Engelbrecht. He was bequeathed a painting from his father, who claims it a masterpiece by the Dutch artist Vermeer. There are no papers to prove this statement; however, the bigger picture is the way Cornelius's father obtained the painting...a way that has haunted him all his life.Each chapter moves back in time to the previous owner of the painting. Readers follow the painting from the wall of Cornelius's father to the actual inspiration and creation of it. Each vignette houses new sets of characters with the painting as its central core. Slowly, with each turning page, we reveal another part of the painting's history, layer by layer, and what it has meant to the people whose lives it touched.Girl in Hyacinth Blue made for a wonderful reading experience. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy lovely period pieces or like getting to the bare bones of a story. A very in depth and beautiful premise. I have Susan's next book on my list."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland lovingly pieces together a quilt of provenance in this book; instead of cataloguing a dry list of names and dates of ownership for the imaginary Vermeer painting of a young girl sewing at its center, she provides the reader with interwoven stories beginning in the present and traveling back in time to 17th-century Delft that explore the circumstances of its inspiration, ownership, secrets and renunciation. In doing this, she succeeds in exploring the emotional, aesthetic and sensual ties that bind people to art and to each other across time and place. The strength of this book is its core of tenderness, which sometimes teeters on the verge of sentimentality, especially when Vermeer is the subject, but thematically anchors the disparate stories. Vreeland's language, however, does not often match Vermeer's delicate pictorial vocabulary; she is often awkward and overwrought and her sense of period detail is spotty. Read this book for its insight not into Vermeer's art and his milieu, but the human heart and its everlasting craving for beauty and connection and peace."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot;,eight short stories of a possible Vermeer masterpiece, is a work of art in itself. Vreeland paints with artful, descriptive thoughts, as her palette and brushes. She takes the reader backward through time on an adventure that gives an inner view of the families that have owned &quot;The Painting&quot;and how it's beauty touched there lives. Her detail makes one think that she must have lived through all of these times. She skillfully renders, the artist who,&quot;Painted Her&quot;, and his turbulent struggle of balancing his duty with reality as a father and husband........... and as an artist, struggling to focus at the center of his Art. Vreeland touches that vulnerable part of every artist who feels that they are alone in that same struggle. The feeling at the end of the book is ,&quot;Just one more story....&quot;"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"When a shy, private-school math teacher, Cornelius Engelbrecht, discovers a canvas thought to be a Vermeer, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, a touching and beautifully-written book, begins a fascinating journey back through time to trace the history of the painting.Engelbrecht's father's dying words had been, &quot;An eye like a blue pearl,&quot; referring to the female figure in the painting, that of a young woman in a blue smock and rust-colored skirt, standing beside an open window. Although Cornelius feels captivated by the painting, he also feels a sense of shame at how it came to be in his father's possession.From the revelation of what, exactly, the elder Engelbrecht did, we then move backward through time from the point of view of one owner to another, all the way back to the painting's point of origin. Each time the painting changes hands, there are high hopes, a time of optimism, until it finally falls into Cornelius' hands and he realizes how it has been tainted by history. The single thread running through each story, the one that connects each character, is this lovely painting, the painting of the Girl in Hyacinth Blue.One of the most fascinating things about this lovely little book are the details of family life and the history that can be found in each vignette. Like the painting, each &quot;story-within-the-novel&quot; seems to be a frozen moment in time and Vreeland's language in painting her own word portrait is both formal and concise as she offers lush detail and wonderful insight. Much in the book is tender and sad and it truly touches the heart. We feel the pain of these characters and identify with their suffering. They are real people and we can almost believe the painting is real as well.The central section of the book, and the one that is most fascinating, is called &quot;Morningshine,&quot; and focuses on a Dutch family who are isolated in their farmhouse and surrounded by floodwaters. The following passage is indicative of Vreeland's beautiful, but rather spare, prose:&quot;Saskia opened the back shutters and looked out the upstairs south window early the second morning after the flood. Their farmhouse was an island apart from the world. Vapors of varying gray made the neighboring four farmhouses indistinct, yet there was a shine on the water like the polished pewter of her mother's kitchen back home. Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear, and it was so, she thought. But it wasn't so. And the cow would have to stay upstairs with them until it was so, however long that was, stay upstairs messing the floor and taking up half the room.&quot;The above-passage clearly shows Vreeland's talent for evoking a sense of time and place. This is in evidence throughout the book and makes it highly atmospheric and charged with the energy of the times.Moments of serendipity are scattered through Girl in Hyacinth Blue as are the harsh realities of the times: hunger, poverty, misery. At one point, in Saskia's story, she is scolded by her husband for feeding their hungry children the seed potatoes he intended to plant in the spring.This is a fascinating and extremely well-written book, a little masterpiece, just like the Vermeer it creates. It is a book that will appeal to readers of popular literature and those with more literary tastes as well as to art lovers everywhere. Beauty, says Vreeland, is necessary to life. Judging from the beauty of this book, beauty might be just as necessary to life as are next season's seed potatoes."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland has magically grouped a series of short stories and takes the reader from the present day owner of a Vermeer painting back in time to 17th century Amsterdam and the young girl who was the artist's subject.Along the way, the reader is treated to magnificent insights into the effects paintings have on those who view them, the bonds people make with art, and the joy and hope that a painting can give to even the most destitute.The story of Vermeer's rendering of a young girl gazing out the window begins at a posh boys' academy. The current owner, a professor, is considering destroying the work to make amends for his Nazi father's sins. The future of the painting remains in doubt, but its history unfolds in a remarkable series of vignettes. Most notable to me was the story of a young farm wife who, in the midst of trying to survive a great flood, finds the painting with an abandoned baby boy in a boat. An attached note says &quot;Sell the painting. Feed the child.&quot; The reader is also treated to other stories including that of a young Jewish girl, a middle-aged man who remembers his first love that he lost, a couple whose marriage dissolves---all these events and more witnessed silently by the young girl in the painting.If you enjoy period pieces and revel in being part of the poignant moments in the lives of people, you will enjoy this remarkable little story."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"All I did was open the book. From the first page I couldn't put it down. Never have I appreciated Vermeer so, until I saw his work through Susan Vreeland's eyes. Novels that transport the reader to another time and place are rare these days. This one does. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I was very impressed by this book. I admired the author's ability to handle multiple time periods with such fluidity. And to express the full range of human emotions and complexities without hystrionics. There was a touch of restraint throughout, a quietness that mirrored the contemplative nature of the painting. And with every story, the painting was described differently so that I never tired of hearing about it, and the painting meant something different to each protagonist. One of the most important aspects of visual arts is to touch the viewer somehow, and the author brought that out beautifully. She also handled major historical events as well as intimate family relationships, the micro to the macro, with such confidence. I feel this was one of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"There is so much more to life than mere existence and the everyday requirements of survival if only you strive for it. That's what I feel after reading this little gem. There is beautiful art; there is the joy and love of those around you; and there are amazingly beautiful lovely books like this one. Everything is right about this wonderful novel. Most good books tell a story that doesn't leave your mind right away. This book has a handful of them! Every chapter is a complete world of real characters. Each one could be a novel to itself. But Vreeland has woven them together into a beautiful storyline and has an amazing ability to fill every word, every sentence with meaning and vision.I commute to work, and I read books on the train. I finished this book last night, and today I did not bring a book with me. Instead I stood with my eyes closed and thought about this book the whole way, and the opening sentence of this review is what it led me to. Now if that is not a sure-fire way to tell you that this book is special and lovely and memorable, I don't know what is.Buy it. A true gem."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I bought this book as a Christmas present for my daughter and ended up stealing it myself. It is a small book in a beautiful package, yet the content is large, complex and serious. I learned about history, art, and writing as I read. I travelled in time as I followed the painting back to its origins. This was a perfect book to escape into, and a lovely book to own."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I recently reviewed &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; by Tracy Chevalier. That book was a wonderfully realized account of what may have transpired in the life of the great Dutch artist, Jan Vermeer, at the time that he painted the lovely work named in the title. Susan Vreeland's &quot;Girl in Hyacincth Blue,&quot; is a painting that also may be a Vermeer (we don't know for sure until the end). She traces the history of the painting's owners starting in the 20th century and going back to 17th century Amsterdam. The owners of the painting include, among others, a repressed professor whose father obtained the work under questionable circumstances, a married man who looks at the painting and remembers his first love with longing, and a poor woman who loves the aesthetic qualities of the painting but needs to sell it to support her family. Vreeland explores the themes of how a beautiful work of art has different meaning for different people and how great art has a timeless quality that can survive for centuries. She also explores the price that an artist must pay in order to fully realize his vision on canvas. One problem with this novel is that Vreeland's vignettes are not equally involving. For example, one chapter that deals with a marriage in dissolution is less interesting than the others. In addition, as soon as the reader gets involved with one set of characters, the chapter ends and the characters disappear. This constant change of cast makes the novel a bit choppy. On the plus side, Vreeland beautifully brings to life the relationship between humanity and great works of art. She also skillfully depicts aspects of the culture and landscape of the Netherlands over the past four centuries. One chapter that focuses on the very difficult struggle of Dutch farmers to keep the sea at bay is particularly vivid. Vreeland's &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is, overall, an uneven but often fascinating look at the creative process and the meaning that art brings to our lives."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Is it, or isn't it? That's the question the painting Girl in Hyacinth Blue: is it a Vermeer? The history of the painting is traced backward from present day to its creation in a series of vignettes, each of which could stand on its own as a short story. The painting has an impact upon each of the lives of the owners, and Ms. Vreeland spins each tale deftly. It's highly enjoyable and entertaining, a wonderful, fresh, and unusual read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The thought of a newly discovered (or suspected) Vermeer painting would be an art world wonder. This book is a string of stories connected to the painting, tracing back through the years of how the identity papers were lost, etc. to make it a giant question at the beginning. The tales are more of the people around the painting than anything else, and it is interesting to see what a painting would go through to make it into modern times.However, something just lacks in this book. Dry writing perhaps. The ultimate hook never really latches onto the reader and no motivation to continue the book once one of the stories is over. It never really grabbed me as a reader.I'd suggest this to art lovers. Personally, Chevalier's 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' was much more entertaining."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I know the comparison is odd, but since I just saw Memento a few weeks ago, I find it appropos -- both the movie and this book start in the present and work their way to the past. This style works well in the book although it may disorient the reader momentarily as we slide back into time. The author does a nice job researching the time periods so that the book reads with a fine sense of historical plausibility. I enjoyed the various intertwined stories although at times they read more like separate vignettes than a novel (but they were separate stories). Overall I preferred another current Vermeer book, Girl with a Pearl Earring because it focused more on Vermeer and less on the side characters. This book focuses on the effect of a Vermeer painting on various families which is at least an interesting take on events. A short book, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This is a small and pretty book full of secret surprises. The author takes us backwards in time, tracing the origin of a (might-be) Vermeer painting. The players in each of the eight stories have full character development and each describe the beauty that has come into their lives along with the painting - you almost might be rooting for one or the other to be able to hold on to this precious work of art. An unanswered question looms for the reader at the end - and whether the painting was destroyed or not is a secret the author has kept from the reader."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I hate this book. I had high hopes because some coworkers raved, and I enjoy Vermeer and art and all that. But please...this overwraught, oversentimental thing made me yawn two pages in. The language is cheesy and even the interesting premise--following the painting's life from end to beginning--couldn't save it. The love scenes are laughable and the sad parts made me cringe. I suffered two weeks worth of bus commutes trying to wade through it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This was an extremely disappointing novel that did not flow well and was not well written. It did not live up to my expectations AT ALL.I found out by reading the interview at the end of the book that the chapters were actually short stories that had been published at different times. That explained why they did NOT seem to flow well at all.She wanted to keep the reader in suspense as to whether or not it was a Vermeer. The first chapter was the most recent and it worked back to when the painting was painted, but. . . That didn't flow well either. It seemed jerky and confusing, having the backward chronology, plus the last chapter wasn't actually the &quot;last&quot; if the chronology was being followed fully.The idea for the story line was good, showing the power of art and following a painting from conception to now, but that was overshadowed by the unexceptional writing. There was, for me, only one memorable character and I've already forgotten most of the plot. I really think this book could have been so much better.If you want to read a book about a Vermeer painting, skip this one and read Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier. I can't recommend that one enough--it's been well over a year since I read it and the plot is still as fresh in my mind as Girl in Hyacinth Blue should be."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The concept behind this book is great: how many times have each of us seen a painting and wondered where it had been and what kind of lives and hands the art has passed through? Each chapter in this book would stand as a short story in itself. It is the object of the painting that connects these chapters together in a cohesive manner. The book is a nice journey through history."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland beautifully tells the fictitous tale of a piece of artwork by J. Vermeer. We follow the piece back in time through eight stories of previous owners until we end with the hardships of Vermeer himself.Each story transports you to the time and place of the artworks owner. You begin to understand them through the eyes they cast on this particular work of art as it illuminates moments of their lives making them and the art unforgettable."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book concerns a fictional Vemeer painting of a girl looking out a window and thinking. The action begins with a present day owner and goes back in time each chapter to the previous owner, a pleasing convention. A short and efficient book with some insight into the artistic process. What is the purpose of a painting in life, it asks. How important is authenticity? An interesting sweep through the Netherlands in the ages - holcaust, floods, witchcraft, Vemeer's time, etc. A fast, enjoyable, literary read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is really a book of short stories woven together and proceeding backwards chronologically to trace the provenance of the painting. The stories are not connected very well although they build on each other, the transitions from one story to the next are not very good but the concept works if you treat each as a standalone story. Where this novel really shines is in Vreelands descriptive prose. She excels in evoking the emotions and feelings evident in a piece of art work, even if the art is fictional. I liked the writing so well that I wished the painting existed so I could see it. The story development itself was a little disappointing but it was a surprisingly quick read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"although this book was in print quite a few years agoi must say its one you can reread and enjoy time and again"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I like the way the author describes how art can effect people in very different ways. I like this book and would recommend it for someone who loves art."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I was mesmerized not only by the characters (of course, by the characters) but by the landscapes, by the natural forces portrayed, how they shape the people who shape the lives that follow their own down the path of time."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A very interesting and unique treatment of the story. I thought the story started a bit slow, but then I was presently surprised after getting past first chapter. The story caught my attention and still left small pieces of the history up to my imagination."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The journey of a painting of uncertain origins begins as a college professor reveals to his colleague that the picture hanging in his study is indeed purported to be by the Dutch master Vermeer. We follow the painting back through time to it's origins which reveal a poignant ending to the story which is really the beginning & a story of dreams or destinies unfulfilled... (I loved the ending of this book)"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The rich descriptions of the era and the painting techniques are wonderful, however the story can be a bit jumpy at times. Like all books of this style (aka Dan Brown-type historical novels), you never know what is fact and what is fiction, which adds to the drama but is frustrating for those truly interested in art history."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is an amazing achievement. Centered around one Vermeer painting, the book retraces the lives the painting touched--from modern day to its creation--and takes the reader on a remarkable journey, painting a perfect picture of each moment in time. I was particularly struck by the level of detail the author incorporates into each story. The amount of research Ms. Vreeland must have done to create this book is awe-inspiring, and yet it never feels like she was merely reciting facts or including details just because she had done the research. From the mixing of Vermeer's paints, to the workings of a Dutch windmill, to the tragic history of the Jews in The Netherlands, the author fills each segment of the novel with rich authenticity and depth of emotion. Ironically, the one phony thing about the book is the Vermeer painting it's centered around--but then, I suppose the ultimate fate of the painting made it necessary for it to be an invented Vermeer. I felt as if I had been on a trip through another world after I finished this book and I will never forget how the author shows the reader, as we look through Vermeer's eyes and through the eyes of the painting's owners, to look for beauty in commonplace things."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I needed a little book to read after I've been taking on two mammoth novels that I have yet to finish, and I found almost near perfection in this \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\". Sometimes I'm a little sketchy about reading short books, for a lot of them cannot fit a really good story in such small a package. I was proved wrong in this case.The story is about a painting a math teacher received after the death of his father. Letting a student in on the secret, the teacher swears it is a Vermeer, and from then on the story is about the past owners, eventually tracing back to the daughter of Vermeer that posed for it. With each story, the people who loved the painting so, experienced damnation or salvation in its presence. It saved the life of a little baby in 1717, and brought a new beginning to a French woman trapped in a loveless marriage in 1800. However, in 1900, it brought sorrow to a wife, for her husband was reminded of a past love because of the girl in the painting. And during WWII, the last owners, a Jewish family in Holland, were deported to camps soon after the paintings purchase, and it then fell into Nazis hands.This book reminded me how art can be fascinating beyond the picture itself. Besides what it is of, it also tells us how far it has traveled through the centuries and across borders, from artist to buyer, and from family to family. Perhaps that eventually helps make it so priceless and valued.Anyways, a great book for anyone who loves art, and especially the painter Johannes Vermeer. If you haven't tried \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\", please read that too."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Well written and beautifully read aloud. Each story is read by a different actor."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Vreeland takes you in the world of life and love with multiple related stories thru the fictional Vermeer painting, Girl in Hyacinth Blue. You can feel a little bit of yourself in each of the stories as they see the painting from each of their own unique perspective. A great read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This bittersweer yet vibrant novel has many highlights that reward the reader throughout. Author Vreeland paints an amazing history of a mysterious and hidden work of art, making character after character come to life as she describes their various ownerships of this painting. The journey of the painting throughout the text will fascinate readers with an appreciation for classical art or art history. Vividly depicted scenes demonstrate the heart-felt desire for artistic beauty felt by many, despite social class standing or unbringing. As with any commodity, art and art collecting is deeply intertwined with monetary considerations, fashion and power. All these factors influence the owners, and the history of the picture.Written originally as several related, but separate short stories, each chapter takes you back to another tale of the painting and its possessor. Supplimental naratives were written to fill in historical gaps; each story remains a complete tale in itself. Put together in reverse chronological order, this literary device works to stunning effect in this novel. The mystery of whether or not this painting was actually created by a famous old master, and how it began its long, fascinating journey are kept under wraps until the final chapter, when all the pieces and emotions rendered throughout come to a sad and realistic climax.This is not necessarily a happy work. The focus is frequently on sadness and loss, but always realistically portrayed. Sometimes life is wonderful, but sometimes life is something else. The author was fighting a potentially terminal illness at the time of writing, admitting later that it heavily influenced her style during the writing process. Like Newton's Law of Action and Opposite Reaction, she really connects with the fact that most times, where there is a gain by one person, there is a loss by another. Or to get something, or keep something that you need, you have to give up something else with tremendous value. That's life.This book is highly recommended for its originality and honesty, the exceptional use of reverse chronological order, and a beautiful and fluid story. There is an interview with the author at the end of the book, as well as a brief reader's group guide with discussion questions. Girl in Hyacinth Blue is most accurately rated at 4.33 out of 5.00 stars, rounded down to 4 stars."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I absolutely loved this book from the first few pages, and highly recommend it!A young professor is invited over to his reticent colleague's house to view his prized possession, a painting. But the painting has been gotten through ill means, and the owner, while convinced that the painting is an original but overlooked Vermeer, has no documents proving this assertion. What follows is a look at the origin of the painting, from how the professor obtained it, to how the previous owners came upon it, and so on. It makes for a highly entertaining, thought provoking, and very plausible story. This book is a real page turner, one that you might have to stay up all night to finish (like I did)."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I liked it very much, but I blew though it so fast, it left me wanting more!great job, buy the book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I will never know what if any qualities this book may have. I picked it up because it was my reader's club book of the month. I stopped reading on page 17 (MacMurray & Beck 1999) where Cornelius quotes a character as saying, \\"So I shoved my boot up to the Jew-boy's dirty ass.\\"Vreeland says that \\"Cornelius would never now be sure...\\" [if this quote was from] \\"...memory or his own swollen imagination\\". What is sure, however, is that the scene and the words were conjured up by Vreeland. Not remembered; conjured.I see no intrinsic need for the author to have planted a fictitious story involving true history, great art and a young girl into the particular ugly framework she chose. To be sure, there is a documented case of Hitler lusting after a Vermeer painting (one he eventually bought), and of Nazis en masse plundering valuable artifacts under the banner of anti-Semitism. I understand that we must remind ourselves of history lest it is allowed to repeat itself. But in Vreeland's hands, to use such language and such imagery as artistic devices appears to me incongruous, gratuitous, and shamelessly exploitative."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Vreeland skillfully takes the reader on the wonderful journey of a painting.

Set mostly in Holland and The Netherlands the Dutch names for places can be a bit difficult to pronounce but do not detract from the overall power of this small book.Each individual story line is easy to follow. My only question would be what ultimately happens to the current owner of the painting (who is afraid to show it to the world since his father obtained it through his position with the German police during WW II).I highly recommend this book.Marion Marchetto"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A wonderful book with unexpected surprises and twists.

But just keep reading, it gets really really good. Each chapter is a separate short story, each realted to the painting. And in my opinion, each short story gets better and better (I did not like the first two.) I was also slightly disappointed because I was expecting another Girl With a Pearl Earring, which I loved. Girl in Hyacinth Blue focuses on a chain of owners of the painting, where Girl With a Pearl Earring was the story of the girl in the painting. Girl in Hyacinth Blue is very unique and definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book was not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. The chapters are jumpy, skipping several decades at a time. The author does not seem to really know anything about art history.

Several of the chapters had actually been published first as short stories - later the author built the rest of the novel around them, which may account for the criticism of inconsistent writing by one reviewer. On the whole, I lkied this book very much and would recommend it as an insightful book that compels the reader to consider the impact good art has on our lives."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book was based on a very interesting idea of tracing back the history of a painting. When the book starts, we are introduced to a painting and its origins are in question. Through a series of short stories, we see each of the previous owners of the painting and find out where it has come from. The transition from owner to owner was choppy until later in the book. Because it is a series of short stories, I found it difficult to connect to the characters since they were only part of the book for a short time. The painting was well described, but the one on my copy of the book didn't match the description contained within the novel. A decent read for anyone who likes historical fiction."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland and has written a small and lovely gem of a book. Through 8 vignettes, we travel through the life of a Vermeer painting. From the present day owner, we travel back to meet various owners of this painting, and the affect this painting had on all of them. The stories set in Holland were especially beautifully written and among my favorites. I also greatly enjoyed the depiction of the inspiration for the painting. A little book, but one that truly touched me."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Vreeland's novel &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; is at times sad, at times uplifting but always beautiful and poignant. The novel traces the odyssey of a fictional Vermeer painting from a mathematics teacher back to Vermeer's daughter. The author succeeded in portraying the various emotions and meanings that the painting evoked in and held for these different people in an excellent and very real way. A masterful study of human emotions and motivations."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Unusual story traces a suspected Vermeer painting back through time into the hands of each of it's owners until you find out whether it actually is the real item. Of course, if you've read some of the other reviews the secret is out, unfortunately because that spoils the mystery of it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Very disappointing book. The story never resolves with the introductory chapter, which seemed to be the most logical and interesting step to take. It's nothing but a collection of flat short stories, each predictable and hurried. Only one or twice did I care what happened to anyone, as the writing style rushed along -- I understood that the painting was supposed to be the &quot;main character,&quot; but I found myself not empathizing with why the human characters would risk so much for this object. I suspect that the movie &quot;The Red Violin&quot; did a better job accomplishing what this author set out to do."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Perhaps I wanted to find some of the delight I feel when I look at a Vermeer painting or reproduction of one. But instead I found a technically accomplished work which overall relentlessly focussed on the 'brutal facts of life', which has so little to do with the qualities of love, beauty, light and mysterious intimacy which I find in Vermeer's work. A depressing and disappointing read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"If you have time for only one book this season, make it this one. It is beautifully written and soothing to the mind and senses. The manner in which Vreeland tells this lovely tale is a new approach, one which works quite well.

Basically the author sets out to show the journey of a paitnign from boring and cliched owner to boring and cliched owner... and tell you the exact meaning of life while she's at it. The only problem is this profound and deep understanding of the meaning of life which Ms. Vreeland is trying to convey to us seems to be something along the lines of &quot;Stop and smell the roses.&quot; Oh yeah, and &quot;Love one another&quot; is a big theme too. Anyway, the writing is didactic and sentimental. The fruits of research seem to be to pepper the writing with weird words that you have to research to understand. All in all, it's not worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I liked the way this book felt in the hand while reading it.It's printed on fine quality paper, and has a beautiful cover,which makes it inviting to want to read. I always judge booksby their covers. The quality of the story is often reflectedin the amount of effort the publisher went to to present thebook. The best part of this book was the perspective it gaveon past periods of history, as it traced the provenance ofa purported Vermeer painting. I don't know how accurate theauthor was but at least the reader can get a sense of beingplaced into a world not of one's own immediate surrounding,which most good fiction does. On the other hand, the sense oftimelessness was stunted by that all-too-common contemporarypolitically correct characterization (female writers seem tofind this irresistible) which dictates that all the virtuouscharacters be women. Once again, most of the men arefoolish, misguided, or clumsy. I'm glad I read it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I can't believe that noone (in 47 reviews) has commented on the fact that &quot;after all it's been through&quot; the painting gets destroyed! To me that is the most intriguing issue. Cornelius, who supposedly loves the painting, is willing to destroy it in order to avoid the shame over his father's actions. The knowledge from the beginning of the novel of the painting's &quot;end&quot; really colored my reactions to the other stories of it's history."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book has all the feeling of a book of essays cobbled together into a book so the essayist can get paid for the same work a second time. The thin thread of the painting fails to provide a way to sustain the reader's interest from episode to episode, and the device of working backward in time leaves the uncomfortable feeling of knowing in advance what will happen to this painting that some have loved and some just possessed. I would rate the book even lower but for the wonderful description of Vermeer's technique in the first chapter! The book's small redeeming grace is that it can be read so quickly that not a lot of time is wasted on it."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The first hundred pages of this book were fairly monotonous.

Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I might as well read my own juicy but amateur stories for some entertainment. Vreeland's writing was dry dry dry. No magic, no juice, no beauty, no heart. I felt as if the characters were crying out to me, \\"Please, we have so much potential! Don't let us die on this page as bland imaginings!\\"Her creations and ideas were unrealized and her abilities (hopefully she has more abilities) unutilized. It was more like reading a book of genealogical studies, except I have often laughed and cried more at a family history book than I did with Vreeland's story.

I wanted to read it backwards when I was done... to get all I missed... I still may! Especially recommended for artists!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Susan Vreeland, in what is to me, a very unusual format, brings to life a fictitious painting of Vermeer. So expertly is it done, that you find yourself yearning to stand in front of \\"Girl In Hyacinth Blue\\".There are a mere eight chapters...expertly and artistically created.Each one is a story in itself. Starting with a mathematics professor who is hiding a painting he believes to be a true Vermeer. His obsession with its' beauty has driven him away from the real world.He works and returns home, no friends, no socializing..his only world the Vermeer, locked in a back room.We are led in each succeeding chapter, backwards though time, in a tale of how the preceding owner gained possession and the story surrounding that particular acquisition. A fascinating journey further and further BACK in time until we witness in the last chapter the actual painting of the picture and not only discover who the artist actually was, but also the identity of the \\"Girl In Hyacinth Blue\\".I was taught in my writing classes to \\"paint a picture with words\\"...and indeed Ms. Vreeland had done just that.From a figment of her imagination, by the end of this beautifully conceived and written novel, we too can see the brilliant hyacinth blue of the young girls smock, the half-filled glass of milk, her brother's shirt in her lap awaiting the first prick of the needle as she sowed on the buttons to make it whole again, the sunlight in her hair under her starched white cap and her lovely hand which\\"had fallen palm upward on the shirt, her delicate fingers curled.\\"Ms. Vreeland has truly created a gem in the literary world.Her novel has won three awards and hopefully she will give us many, many more moments of reading joy!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A painting hangs secretly in the basement of a professor's house. With fervor, he swears it is a Vermeer, a rare canvas by a 17th century Dutch artist. In the following chapters, Susan Vreeland skillfully unfolds the story behind the painting, gradually peeling away the years in layers that trace the work back to the artist. What is most striking is Vreeland's use of reverse chronology to build up the plot progressively. In the present, controversies created over time shroud the professor's painting. However, a journey back in time clarifies these questions as each chapter brings the reader one generation closer to the date of production, and the reader is kept in suspense until that moment. In these final chapters, the model for the beautiful painting is revealed, and the reader discovers that she is actually a plain, ordinary girl. Vreeland emphasizes that even the ordinary can have great significance and beauty. This beauty has a cost, however, as many of her characters discover. Through their experiences, she reminds us why we continue to reach for it all the same. These characters are extremely well-developed and possess strong personality traits. Rather than building her characters with obvious statements, Vreeland uses a blend of dialogue and thoughts. These illustrate the characters as thinking, feeling humans that are capable of mistakes Summing up the entire novel in the last paragraph, Vreeland concludes with a very powerful ending that shows the subject of the painting mulling over the permanence of artwork, of the fact that she herself would be stared at for centuries, but none would have known her. This theme had been repeated throughout the previous chapters, with people who had done exactly that. There is also a further emphasis that something ordinary can greatly impact others. As each chapter brings the reader farther back, a new section of history is revealed. However, the focus is less on the history itself, and more on the painting and its impact on people through centuries. Historical fiction and art fanatics may enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Maybe I'm suffering from selective perception, but is seems there has been an upsurge in books on Holland, Tulips, Dutch artists, and other Dutch lore.Having had four great-grandparents born in the Netherlands (Groningen and Sint Maartansdyke in Zeeland), who immigrated to the United States to settle in Holland Michigan in the 19th Century, I'm a big fan of all things Dutch.I'm also a big fan of Dutch art. I've visited many of the major musuems in the the U.S. and Europe, and seen much Dutch art. I've also had the wonderful experience of seeing a Vermeer retrospective and many of Vermeer's 35 paintings, some of them many times. I've also studied art history. So, I was primed to like this book.However, I didn't. It's not a bad book, it just doesn't live up to the hype on the jacket and in the reviews posted here and elsewhere. Maybe I should be glad it was so short and not terribly expensive, but Susan Vreeland writes well, and I wanted more--more plot OR more character developement OR more art history.I'm a very big fan of short stories. Either this book is a collection of short stories strung together with the artful device of a painting passed from owner to owner. Or, the book is a novel. If it is a collection of short stories, the plots are lacking. If it is a novel, character development is an issue.Maybe the book would have worked better if there had been fewer stories, or the plots were less predictable. Perhaps it would have been better if there had been more of an overlap in the various plots so that what is a subplot in one story becomes the main plot in another.Since the book is short, it can be read in one sitting but it may leave you wishing you had devoted your afternoon reading another book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is an &quot;odd fish&quot; offering both less and more than its promise. The first chapter &quot;Love Enough&quot; sets the stage for a book very different than what follows. This story is one of guilt over the father's role in the holocaust and the looting which obtained the picture. The story is open ended - will the art instructor accept the authenticity of the painting, will it be destroyed in an act of redemption; this open-endedness leads one to expect resolution in the subsequent chapters.The structure of the book, however, is each chapter as an independent story - some connected only by the painting, two pairs that connect only to each other. &quot;Morningshine&quot; and &quot;From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers&quot; are a pair that are an excellent piece of narrative. The first tells of a farmer's wife disappointed with the lack of beauty in her life who wants to keep the painting rather than sell it to provide for the family - including a baby it was meant to support. The second is the tale of the parents of the baby. Within these chapters, the author succeeds in presenting the conflicts of life - especially well done in the case of the farmer's wife who nearly misses her husband's expressions of love for her dreams of beauty.The second paired tales are &quot;Still Life&quot; and &quot;Magdalena Looking&quot;, the tale of Vameer selecting his daughter Magdalena as the subject and her encounter with the painting years later. The strength of these stories is the presentation of the mind behind the paintings - the drive for truth and what truth means in the context of art and what thwarts the drive to present truth through art. The characterizations of the Vameer family are well done but not the defining point of these stories.&quot;Hyacinth Blues&quot; is the weakest story, a story of an unsettled marriage of a French official in the Netherlands. &quot;Adagia&quot; is an excellent story of a long term and loving marriage - of what can and cannot be said and of actions speaking what cannot be spoken. In this story, the painting has come to be a reminder of first love. The remaining story &quot;A Night Different From All Other Nights&quot; is a well-crafted coming-of-age story of a young Dutch Jewish girl for whom the future, even a future, is an uncertainity.Throughout the work, the description of the picture by the various characters provides insight to the picture itself, to the character contemplating it, and to the relationship of art to the viewer. This later item is truly to art in general not specifically to visual art.While the construction of the book is flawed, the first story raising expectations inappropriate to what follows, many of the stories are excellent and the exploration of the art-viewer relationship is superb ... hence four stars."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Vivid, simple, and poetic, Girl in Hyacinth Blue reads like a collage of perfect little Vermeers as the author paints brief moments in the lives of several different owners of a haunting painting. Spanning the years from the present backward to the creation of the painting in the 1660's, the book is as intricately and subtly composed as one of Vermeer's paintings. Each episode illustrates two different kinds of love-both personal, private love and a larger universal love or sense of responsibility. At the same time, each episode also traces the ownership of the painting and gives glimpses of the role of art in the lives of ordinary people. Beginning with the dilemma faced by a teacher who acquired the painting from his father, a low level Nazi functionary during World War II, it then moves successively backward to the stories of the Jewish family which owned it, to a father who bought it to commemorate an early, lost love, and backward still to an the unhappy French wife of a functionary stationed in Holland and enjoying an erotic interlude. Ultimately, it regresses to the life of the Vermeer family and the daughter who sat for the painting. Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a literary gem of understated complexity."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Intriguing and engaging, this book draws the reader backward in time, following the history of a Vermeer painting. Working backwards in time to Vermeer himself, each of the owners has a different relationship with the painting, which reflect something about the individual and the time he is living in. Two months after reading this, my mind keeps coming back to the people, the painting, and the times.Girl with a Pearl Earring makes a nice companion book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I discovered this little gem by browsing the Amazon web site book review of Girl with the Pearl Earring. Susan Vreeland takes an unusual approach in tracing the life history of a fictitious artwork back through four centuries to its creation. In the process she gives us some marvelous glimpses into the lives of its varied owners. This perspective results in a very interesting and uniquely different read since the book is actually a volume of short stories connected only through ownership of the painting and the owners' interactions with that object. As we learn its history, the imminent threat of annihilation in the opening chapter becomes all the more poignant to the reader. This fact speaks to Susan Vreeland's skill as an author. We too have developed a relationship to the Girl in Hyacinth Blue, although we have never seen the painting. As with any volume of short stories there are stronger and weaker links. The whole is well worth the effort. For those who develop the yen to read more novels set in 17th century Holland, The Girl with the Pearl Earring ( Tracy Chevalier) and Tulip Fever(Deborah Moggash) make good companion books and a visit to the Metroplitan Art Museum's Vermeer exhibit this month is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"An object does not choose to whom it belongs and yet it has a history however long, however short. For in its stillness, stories are stirring. If only a painting could talk, oh, the stories it could tell. So is the case with The Girl in Hyacinth Blue. With the unraveling of each story, Susan Vreeland unveils the depth of an imaginary Vermeer painting while offering me a sense of my own history. Of German-Dutch descent, I felt like I was reading a part of myself. Somewhere along the way I suddenly knew why blue was my favorite color, itself a symbol of calm. Just like the Red Violin, each story stands in its own strength. The sentiment, the sacrifice, the suffering, the savoring. I was at once entranced and then released to another equally moving story. Walking the streets of Amsterdam, sitting in the attic with the pigeons, wanting, as the girl in the painting, so desperately for life to account for something. The stories reveal what it is to love deeply and how to let go when it is time. An appreciation for art and its history has been forever transformed for this reader. As a teacher I would highly recommend this for English teachers of all levels who want to teach the craft of short story writing and to Humanities professors who wish to use literature to breathe life into the history of art and the art of history."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a quick read -- I read it in one evening -- but, though slight in words, it is dense in images of beauty, sadness, bravado, and love. Each vignette has a different character and mood, yet all of them share a quiet clarity and poignance that draw the reader deeply into the story. True, some of the chapters are better than others (the French woman's affair with the violinist was the weakest), but all are well-worth the reading.It isn't necessary to be familiar with Vermeer's work to enjoy this book, but I strongly recommend looking at his paintings if at all possible. Being familiar with Vermeer's style will make it easier to visualize the well-traveled painting in the book. I can see the painting so well in my mind's eye now that it's almost as real to me as The Milkmaid or Girl With A Pearl Earring. If only it really existed!"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue, a book of historical fiction by Susan Vreeland, is an amazing read. Though there are eight separate stories in this book, they are all connected. It all takes place in the Netherlands, a believable setting since that is a real place. Also, each detail Vreeland includes about the villages and cities for settings make them seem very real.The story begins with a teacher at a boarding school who has inherited a painting from his father, and he believes it to be a Vermeer painting. The first chapter tells how this painting affects the man and what he feels about it. Nearing the end of the chapter, it is unsure what will happen to the painting, if it will be kept or destroyed. After being introduced to the painting, the following seven chapters tell a story of many other people connected to it. They have all been affected deeply by it in some way or another.Susan Vreeland is very descriptive in her writing. As I read, I can just paint a picture in my mind of each thing as she describes it. I also liked the way she divided the book into eight stories that are all connected, because you get to see how an object that passes through numerous generations can really affect people more than it seems to. It's also fun to explore all different times in history, as this book begins in the present and goes back to the late 1600's.Susan Vreeland especially develops the painting, the Girl in Hyacinth Blue, as the main character. As I read through the story, I could eventually just imagine every detail of the painting and was amazed at how an object could be such an inspiring character. The painting affects every supporting character in some way, and really makes this an enjoyable book. Also, the other characters use plenty of dialogue, making it easy to imagine each person as they came along and know how they talked and felt about things.I would recommend this book for teens or above. This would be an especially good book for people who enjoy art. However, the topics discussed in the book are ones all kinds of people could relate to. The book covers many of the things that people go through in their life, which includes love, natural disasters, and death. Overall, I think lots of people would find this book exciting and interesting to read since it is very different from any book I have ever read. It has eight very different and amazing stories that make this book a fast but very awesome read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Wonderful look at a piece of art and its history. Makes one wonder about the &quot;history&quot; of any particular piece of art or antique. If you enjoy this book, check out the movie &quot;The Red Violin&quot; - another &quot;history&quot;. Loved the writing style."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Though built upon a promising premise, this collection of short tales woven around a single \\"lost\\" Vermeer painting gets off to an objectionable start that I found difficult to get over. The suggestion hinted at by the ending of the first story, that somehow the painting itself should be destroyed because it had once been stolen by a Nazi, is unconscionable. A work of art acquires no inherent guilt through the actions of those who handle it; the suggestion is all the more inappropriate given the Nazis' own penchant for destroying art.Otherwise, most of the stories in the book were originally written and published separately, and this perhaps accounts for their somewhat uneven execution. I found the two middle stories, \\"Morningshine\\" and \\"From the Personal Papers of Adriaan Kuypers\\" to be the most compelling tales in the book, each more for the personal stories they tell than any protagonism of the painting itself."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I enjoyed this book, but had to keep reminding myself that it was written going back in time. I think I would have really enjoyed it more had I read the first story last - I actually went back and re-read it when I finished the book. While I do not believe in hauntings or possession, the painting had a curious effect on the last owner (first owner in book) and I am sure it was as a direct result of his feelings for his father and not the painting itself.I recommend this book - it is a beautiful story in my opinion.Kate"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Johannes Vermeer, the great Dutch painter of long ago, didn't alway sign his work. As of date, there are alledgedly thirty-five definitive paintings. From time to time others have appeared only to be found to be fakes. Given this, the author has proposed that there are now thirty-six of these gems, and this is where the book takes off. The story is really a collection of short stories (the way McCrae uses the technique in his &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot;) and each one concerns itself with the &quot;immaginary&quot; painting by Vermeer titled GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE. The author uses this painting to bind together the stories by telling us about the different people who have owened this alledged work. She begins in the 1990s and goes backwards in time.This fast-moving and ingenious work is bound to catch you off guard and of all the books I've read recently, this one was one of the more unusual. If you like the idea of this book, you might also enjoy two other books I've recently come across. The first is &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot; and the second is &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood.&quot; Both unique and entertaining."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"\\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue,\\" like \\"Girl With A Pearl Earring,\\" explores the legacy of Dutch master painter Jan Vermeer. It is a fictitious account revolving around the discovery of a previously unknown Vermeer painting as viewed from several historical eras as the painting falls into the hands of new owners (done in reverse chronological order). The novel begins in the present, with a German math teacher confiding to a colleague about his father's stolen Vermeer, dubbed \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue.\\" The rest of the novel is a series of short stories that trace the lineage of the painting: the Jewish family in Antwerp that Otto Engelbrecht (the father of Cornelius, the math teacher) had stolen the painting from, an adulterous Frenchwoman in exile, a husband remembering his first love, a Dutch family in 1717 that rescued an infant in a flood, the father of the infant, and finally Vermeer's inspiration for the painting.Full of lush details that bring the various historical eras into sharp focus, Vreeland's descriptions paint the fictitious \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" not only as a remarkable painting (\\"certain brush strokes subtly changed their tint,\\" \\"the russet of the girl's skirt glistened like maple leaves in autumn sun,\\" \\"creamy yellow light the colour of the inner petals of jonquils illuminated the girl's face and reflected points of light on her shiny fingernails,\\" \\"the blue in the girl's smock, which hung in graceful folds of that luscious deep blue of the early hyacinths when the blooms are just beginning to open\\"), but as a captivating presence in the lives of its owners. Sweeping across several generations and owners from all walks of life, \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" is a fascinating read about the impact of true art on daily life, and the legacy of a truly gifted painter."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"A lovely novel which traces a painting believed to be a lost masterpiece by Vermeer from its present day owner all the way back to the painting's inception and creation. Vreeland sets the novel up as a series of short stories, each about the painting's respective owners and the spiritual/emotional impact it has on each of their lives. She succeeds in letting each story flow naturally, with imagination and gentle creativity, plucking out a moment in time in the life of each owner and allowing the reader to experience fully the circumstances of their lives, the circumstances within which the painting has comes into their possession, and the direct impact the painting has within that context. It's a daring piece of writing for a relatively inexperienced author (I believe this is her second book) and, to her credit, she handles it quite well, even if some of the vignettes are stronger and more passionate than others."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"It would be difficult to improve on the thoughtful and eloquent reviews already given, but I would like to add that this (blue, paperback) version also contains an interview with the author and some ideas for a book discussion. The latter are only marginally interesting, but the interview was very nice.I really enjoyed this book. Too often novels emphasize a gimmick rather than the story but while this novel used the device of going backwards in time, the content justified doing so, and it enhanced the impact. It gives the idea of an object's provenance new depth. Also, the cover was well-done and tied in nicely withthe idea of the book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book is a masterpiece, like the painting (real or imaginary) which inspires it. Each short story has a life of it's own and yet when read together all are interwoven by the common thread of the painting. Some stories will appeal more than others, some are haunting and painfull; all are beautiful, evocative and real. Anyone who has pondered the relationship between beauty and money, the creative urge and the need to make a living will find this work poignant. It brought to mind Orwell's &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; and Mary Gordon's &quot;Spending&quot;. The former is realistic, the latter utopian. &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; portrays the subject from all angles. Illuminating and perfectly balanced, quite beautiful."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I was touched to tears. Haven't read a novel in one day in a long time. I was captivated by each chapter. The book has it all: love, longing, anger, fear, joy, wisdom, and beauty. Of the eight chapters, &quot;Hyacinth Blues&quot; topped them all."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"It took a while for this book to grow on me. At first I thought I was caught in another Nazi nightmare--and I really cannot stand Nazi books. But the evil fades quickly as the book follows the stolen Vermeer painting as it changes hands backwards in time from a captured Jew to a simple farmer to a haughty Parisienne all the way to Jan Vermeer himself.The novel by Susan Vreeland is a series of short stories. It becomes obvious in many places that she has cobbled together existing shorts with filler. This is the only downside of the book. Points to recommend it are the pure brilliance of her description of the painting, her meditation of the role of the artist (a subject that becomes downright depressing when the novel comes to Vermeer himself), and the descriptions of the flat and often-flooded Dutch countryside. Some say she's described a \\"beautiful\\" Dutch scenery, but having been there myself, I think Vreeland has written honestly about what the low country is: flat, unforgiving, and forever at mercy of the dikes and the sea. It's a hard country, and for that reason, beauty is so much more astonishing when it emerges from the land."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This simple story was easy and entertaining to read. It's art, it's art history and history in general. I liked the reverse timeline and having to think back to the last chapter read to see how this new chapter comes into play. I liked that each chapter was it's own story and even though the chapters were brief I felt I got to know the characters well. Being an artist and having studied art history I enjoyed the perspective of this book."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Vreeland does a wonderful job with this book, which follows the life of a painting, from the present day back to its creation. The style of the story is reminiscent (albeit in reverse chronology) of the movie Tales of Manhattan (Ginger Rogers, Cesar Romero, you remember), which follows a tail coat through its remarkably adventurous life. What makes such a journey insteresting is the way the painting is bound inextricably to the scandals, loves, secrets, and desires of the characters who, at various times, own it. Reading the frankly personal chapters, I almost felt like a private eye, tracing the painting's history and linking the characters together.While Vreeland doesn't claim to be an art expert, she does a wonderful job describing the nuances of the painting, and she clearly has admiration for the craft of the artist. I very much enjoyed this book, and it reads surprisingly quickly. You can easily finish it in one or two sittings. A real gem."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"This book traces the history of a lost Vermeer back to its inception in a series of short stories that hang together as a novel.It is a small book, no bigger than a video case, finely crafted as the Vermeer it is about. Although I usually am not interested in historical novels, I found the historical details about Holland very interesting.For such a small book, it resonates in the mind clearly."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"a lovely novel of art, love, faith and history that envelopes you into it's embrace the further back in history you go"},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"The reason I liked this book so much is because I have taught &quot;Vermeer&quot; in Art Masterpiece to third graders for the past five years, and it made the art and the artist much more real for me.I am scheduled to teach art masterpiece this week and I plan to tell the kids about this book as a modern example of how art can be used in literature. (I usually tell them about the place in a book by Marcel Proust where a character with blood poisoning falls to his death while in a museum looking at &quot;View of Delft&quot; and exclaiming, &quot;The little yellow wall, the little yellow wall!&quot;)I also liked the way Vreeland structured the story from present to past--a clever technique that made the reading fun.

The characters capture your sight, and you feel as though you can experience the depth of their emotions. The characters literally come alive on the page.

It leaves the reader with something to ponder."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Creatively, Susan Vreeland's book is pretty special. Eight stories that move backwards through time that revolve around a Vermeer painting. Through each of the stories the painting manages to evoke particular feelings in each of the narrators, demonstrating the power and allure of art. As much as I appreciated her craftsmanship in the storytelling, the stories themselves left me a little cold. I didn't really have any kind of emotional attachment to any of the characters, so consequently I found myself being more of an observer and less of a participant.Still, it's a fast moving and easy read, and for people interested in art and artists, this would probably be an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"In her book, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, the author Susan Vreeland presents her subject matter in a unique way. Focusing on an unknown Vermeer portrait, the author takes her readers from the present back to the time when the painting was actually done. But this premise isn't conveyed in the traditional manner of a flashback but rather as a series of inter-related stories as the painting goes backwards from the previous owner's hands to the next previous owner's hands.Who knows what treasures lurk in an ordinary home? When an art professor is invited to a to the home of a colleague, he is shown what the owner says is an original Vermeeer which nobody knows anything about. How did this professor get the portrait, wonders the art professor and why is there no provenance or mention of it anywhere in the art world? Could this in fact be the 36th portrait done by Vermeer which somehow became lost over the centuries? And now the author has set us on a course as wevhead backwards in time. And among the periods of time we travel to are the early days of the rise of Hitler, then to the court of a count, to flooded areas of Holland and finally to Delft where we first meet Vermeer in the home of the man who has bought most of his paintings so that Vermeer can feed his 11 children. And finally we are there as Vermeer begins to paint his daughter Magdalena. And it is up to Magadalena to tell the story of what happens to Vermeer, her family, herself and and what happens to this very portrait in the future.While I enjoyed this book, I did have some reservations. Close on the heels of reading Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier which also focuses on Vermeer, I felt that Girl in Hyacinth Blue lacked some of the wonderful descriptions of the artist and his craft. Whereas in Tracy Chaevaliers's book one could smell the paints and see Griet who served as Vermeer's model for the portrait with the pearl earrings and turban, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, seemed to gloss over these aspects concentrating on the characters in each story. And while the characters were well drawn, some of the stories failed to hold my interest as much as the others. But all in all, these were minor reservations and I would recommend this book to others who also enjoyed Girl With the Pearl Earring, the movie The Red Violin and even Jerry Seinfeld's espisode which also began with the end."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"I really enjoyed the book, especially the descriptions of places. however, sometimes I was confused on the timeline because of the changes in each chapter.

Lovely and enjoyable, with fascinating details of Vermeer's technique and life in The Netherlands."},{"Title":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue","review":"Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a lovely historical fiction with a twist~the tale is told backwards starting from the present and working its way back in time. The main character is a painting~supposedly a rare original by Vermeer. Knowing nothing about art history, this means little to me. Luckily, you don't have to know art history to enjoy the book. You just need to enjoy reading.The painting currently hangs in the home of a man whose father willed him the painting. The man anguishes over the idea that his father got the during a Nazi raid on a Jewish home. I thought that was going to be the story line, but that is not really what the book is about. The plot follows the history of the painting back in time to when the artist painted the portrait of his daughter.The brief glimpse into each family's lives is just enough to make you wanting to learn more about that group of people. The idea of a painting (or any object for that matter) touching so many people throughout history makes me even more intrigued by the idea.The characters are gentle and endearing. The story kept me reading~I finished the book in two days. The setting (Holland) makes the novel a bit exotic.I think you will enjoy the beauty and gentleness of this unusual historical fiction.Melissa"},{"Title":"Flannery O'Connor and the Language of Apocalypse (Princeton Essays in Literature)","review":"Kessler examines Flannery O'Connor's use of language, and sees her \\"in the company of apocalyptic poets like Blake and T.S.

It is appropriate for a wide range of levels and disciplines. A moderately paced graduate class can finish most of the chapters in a full year. The first two chapters cover material that is difficult to find elsewhere and nowhere is it better handled. The real boon to this book is the constant integration of physical reasoning with solid mathematical theory. To be sure, many of the more complicated ideas are only mentioned, but the later chapters pick these up and go much further. It covers basic heat and wave applications, but also Brownian motion and gas dynamics. A solid calculus background is needed, which includes vector calculus and convergence issues. Eigenvalues and some functional analysis are needed. Many books on elementary partial differential equations spend all their time on the big three: heat, wave and Laplace. This is too low a level for any graduate class and doesn't create the excitement other applications provide. On the other hand, this book is accessible to many people. Often, graduate texts are thoroughly awash with Sobolev spaces and weak convergence and the physical problem, i.e., the actual model, is all but ignored.

Kuomintang China meddled in the sovereign Tibet's affairs, but refrained from using millitary force to bring Tibet under their control. In 1949 the communist seized power in China in 1950, Red China brutally invaded tibet Tibet, killing thousands of Tibetans, raping, looting, and destroying vilages and monasteries.Mao aimed to completely force Tibet under the sway of Chinese Communism, and bluntly told the Dalai Lama : \\"Religion is poison\\".In 1956 the Chinese authorities provoked uprisings in the province of Kham, and then set ablaze the whole of Tibet.After the carnage, the genocide, which reduced the Tibetan population, the Chinese settled thousands of ethnic Han Chinese in Tibet, and began a practise of apartheid, in which the ethnic Chinese were given prefferable treatment.\\" Not content with 'democratic reforms', the Chinese imposed strict rationing on the peasants, about 30 lb...of food per person per month, though this did not include elderly people, or those unable to work. Before 1959, whether rich or poor, farmers always had enough oil, butter or meat to provide for the needs of all members of the family, both young or old. With the social policies and rationing introduced by China, Tibetans had to be content with tsampa and black tea, all year round, whereas Chinese employees recieved 30 to 35 lb of rice, flour, and 31 to 32 lb of oil per month. Rationing and the need to work longer hours eventually exhausted the population.\\"The Communists decided that 'monks and monasteries' must be totally eliminated, and set about to dimantle thousands of monasteries and murder thousands of monks and nuns.The Tibetans were forced to destroy plants and animals, which they revered. Youth and children were forced into a Communist run campaign to kill thousands of birds, and their families would be severely punished if the quotas were not filled.The population of Tibet was in fact reduced over the decades. forced abortions and the mass infanticide by the Communist authorities of babies, who were exceeded the quota of births allowed, was practised over decades.The standard of living is far lower and infant mortality rate is far higher, among Tibetans than among ethnic Chinese.Finally the author illustrates the cruel abduction of the little Panchen Lama, and it's cynical use of two Tibetan children, to further enslave Tibet.The author illustrates how nothing in recent decades has improved for the Tibetan people, who have been largley forgotten by the world, which has found other more politically correct causes (such as support for the Palestinians, or Islamic terrorists arrested by American forces) to obfuscate the suffering of people like the Tibetans, the Kurds, the Karens ands South Sudanese.In this age where China will be hosting the 2008 Olympics, very few voices are raised against it's monstrous policies, and it's supression of minorities and dissidents.Tibet may never be free, because the world has forgotten her tragic plight."},{"Title":"Multivariate Tests for Time Series Models (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)","review":"This text is a collection of tests for multivariate time series models.

This is a very readable book and while quite somber(ie Vietnam,stroke),some of the recounts of antics with some of his cronies are hilarious. Joe should write a few more anecdotal books, in between his excellent fiction (Snowfly is one of my top ten of all time favorites). If you are a fly fisherman,or a soon to be senior citizen who grew up in the Vietnam era like me, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Covered Waters: Tempests of a Nomadic Trouter","review":"I am a fan of Heywood's 'Woods Cop' Series of novels about Grady Service in Michigan's UP. This book has nothing to do with that series - but, I enjoyed the book. I can't say I picked up any 'hot' fishing locations or technigues . . . but, 'Covered Waters' is just, IMHO, a good read."},{"Title":"The Back Pain Sourcebook: Everything You Need to Know","review":"In 1994, I was severely injured in a horseback riding accident. Since I only had x-rays, I was diagnosed by the hospital ER and an Orthopedic doctor with a broken tailbone and fractured vertebrae. Still in severe pain, and with new symptoms and increasing pain, Susan, a friend who actually knew the author, Stephanie Levin-Gervasi, directed me to contact her for a possible referral. Dr. Dale Richardson, an Atlanta-based neurosurgeon who would not easily prescribe drugs or surgery, and whose bedside manner left much to be desired, became my chosen doctor. Following his examination and recommended MRI, I was diagnosed with a severely herniated disk, L4-L5. Since the disk was in so many tiny pieces, it easily pinched my sciatic nerve. By this time, the result was excruciating pain, often ending with my collapsing, no matter where I was at the time. Dr. Richardson, who was quite aged at the time, slightly concerned me. I could not imagine that his hands were stable enough at his age to perform a surgery so close to my spine, however I elected to have him perform the surgery in November 1995, even though he warned me that I could still potentially require disk replacement or fusion following the removal, aka laminectomy. It has been almost 2 decades, and I have needed neither. I credit Stephanie Levin-Gervasi for sending me to the right surgeon, and Dr. Richardson for his supreme expertise. I will never be pain-free due to my surgery, however my life has been greatly improved considering the alternative."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Thought provoking and brilliantly written \\"Tender is the Night\\" etches itself into your brain: once read, never forgotten. Longer, looser but more complex and much darker in its subject matter than \\"The Great Gatsby\\", Scott Fitzgerald similarly transcends time & place to leave you with quite unforgettable images. For example, describing an open-air dinner party on the Cote d'Azur he writes: \\"There were fireflies riding on the dark air and a dog baying on some low and far-away ledge of the cliff. The table seemed to have risen a little toward the sky like a mechanical dancing platform, giving the people around it a sense of being alone with each other in the dark universe, nourished by its only food, warmed by its only lights.\\" And, thirty years after first reading that wonderfully evocative description, it's still there: burned-in as a reference-point that follows me around all open-air late night parties... just waiting for that distant bark.Replete with similar passages, \\"Tender is the Night\\" juxtaposes romantic idylls with the personal tragedies surrounding most of its characters, and, in so doing, triumphs in exploring the differences between perception and reality, superficiality versus excess, strength of character versus fear & weakness, and uncontrollable madness versus self-induced self-destruction. Drawing you into a hedonistic world that you would sincerely wish to be part of and then exploding its deficiencies in front of you, it leaves you realising that not all is what it seems.Closing with a superbly structured final paragraph that ranks as one of the most effective I've ever read - bringing together everything that the book seeks to explore in a few cogently dismissive and understated sentences - this is writing at its very best: compelling, perceptive, complex, timeless and, beneath its superficially \\"glossy\\" exterior, very true. If you haven't read it do: it's one of the best books out there."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I liked Tender is the Night even more than I expected to. As a fan of a few of his other works (notably The Great Gatsby, This Side of Paradise and The Collected Short Stories), I went into this book with a healthy enthusiasm. . . What I discovered was a story that was painful to watch unfold and one that kept me engaged and interested in what was happening from the first page to the end.It tells the tale of Dick Diver, his wife Nicole, and numerous other equally complicated individuals who sway in and out of their lives over the years following World War One and just prior to the rise of Adolph Hitler. Americans living in or around Paris and the resort spots of France, these are rich people, people so rich that their money has literally destroyed them. They have become those rare people who don't have to wish for anything physical, whether it comes in the dream of a mansion on a hill in some far away country, a group of friends that includes royalty and movie stars, or sexual conquests with anyone you can even momentarily desire. All their dreams have, or could possibly on a whim, come true. And so there is nothing in this life left for them . . .It is a sad tale of likable people coming unglued, of seeing their lives destroyed and watching nobody care, regardless of their goodness. It is a story of absolute and utter desolation, finally, as the almost journalistic ending comes at you. It is like falling out of touch with someone who was once the most important person in your life, hearing vague stories about what they are up to and realizing they are getting fainter and fainter and fainter . . .This was quite obviously a very personal book for its author, a disillusioned man who saw many of his own dreams come true early on and who was left to watch his own joy turn into boredom and finally complete indifference. This book is the nightmare that all of us hope never comes true. It is somewhat comforting, in the end, to realize that in spite of his own early death, his crazy wife and his alcoholism, F. Scott Fitzgerald's story isn't anywhere near as terrible as this one.It is, among a multitude, one of the better books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The Great Gatsby is without a single doubt one of the greatest American novels ever written and has well deserved its position as a permanent fixture in American literarture classes. Everyone and their sister had read The Great Gatsby. I personally loved it, but that was before I read Tender is the Night. It touched my heart and got under my skin an infinity more deeply than The Great Gatsby. It is a work that cries with hopelessness, loneliness, and broken dreams.Tender is the Night chronicles the downfall and eventual ruin of Dick Diver, a smart, handsome pshychiatrist. He has everything in life going for him. He has friends, beautiful children, money, ability, and so much love for his wife Nicole. But this idealistic life can not long endure and Dick's sparkling world soon begins to unravel. Nicole turns out to be a schizophrenic. Though her mental illness has been dormant for years, it begins to resurface, destroying Dick's confidence, optimism, his marriage, and his very life.Tender is the Night is almost painful in its emotion. Fitzgerald seems to have filled the very pages of the book full of his tears. As this book was written, his own wife Zelda institutionalized as a schizophrenic, making this novel semi-autobiographical. This work is so astounding simply because of the feeling it reveals straight from the heart of its author, making it one of the most intimate portraits I have ever read. Tender is the Night is an absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This is my favorite Fitzgerald novel, primarily for its biographical proximity to their similarly glamourous and ghastly marriage. The story opens on the unspoiled Riviera where money and adventure ruled, the Divers were the epitome of the expatriots of the Lost Generation/Jazz Age. Not only mythically gorgeous, Mrs. Diver was an ideal as a mother and dramatic gardener. She removes to an Eden-like retreat of lush and fragrant blooms that is infamous for its mistakes, i.e. Fitzgerald's lack of familiarity mixing tulips with sunflowers and other late summer blooms. The endless parties and thrill seeking begins to cloud the horizon and the startling secret that the couple have been trying to elude, breaks into a storm.The unraveling of this pharntom perfection is indeed \`Tender' and ineffably sad. Zelda and Scott scaled Olympus as well, and suffered from excess and what was explained as a streak of madness in Zelda's family like a fatal flaw.The alcohol factor, in Zelda, given the advantage of the times, seems far more likely the major factor for her suffering than some arcane mental illness. Fitzgerald and Zelda were co-dependent, last stage alcoholics with irresponsible and self-centered natures, the ingredients of tragedy and self-destruction. The ingredients often of great writers.Yet, in Tender Is the Night, it is more as if madness comes like fate to challenge such god-given beauty and glory. The hot Riviera, white walled, and perfumed heaven is no where else so perfectly envisioned. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is generally considered a better work, but for pure mood to attach to the Lost Generation, this is by far and away the one that touches my heart."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Not the most cohesive of Fitzgerald's work, Tender is the Night does deliver on Fitzgerald's beautiful prose and heartbreaking characterizations. The novel explores the disintegration of a promising young American doctor whose idealism comes under the crushing weight of hard capitalistic power. At times it becomes difficult to believe in the main character's steady decline since early in the novel he is depicted as so brilliant and thoughtful. However, Fitzgerald tries (and generally succeeds) in making the argument that American idealism is a fragile thing and not impervious to the destructive power of money.Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"No matter what the pundits say give this book a chance, and you'll find it to be Fitzgerald's best. The Great Gatsby may be more elegantly written but Tender Is The Night packs a wallop that makes the former seem a bit too cute and melodramatic. With the revelation of Nicole Warrens's source of mental illness (which you'll find in the unabridged version), the plot moves along at a snappy pace with premonitions of a future tragedy hinted at but never revealed (which is the sign of master storyteller). The ending is incredibly sad and because of it incredibly beautiful. Unlike Nick Carraway's eulogy that acts like a balm, the 3rd person narrative of Tender Is The Night offers the reader no such solace. There's only the lingering image of a man born to be great, broken beyond repair."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"At first I thought this was about a marriage, then adultery, then co-dependency, then madness, then and then and then..... This is a book about unraveling in all its forms. Everything of importance -- love, places, people, and finally dreams unravels until there is nothing left and everything has been stripped bare and drained. This is not just a portrait of a man, his wife, a marriage, a family, a lifestyle, a time -- it is all of these in turn.I actually prefer this book to Fitzgerald's masterpiece dissection of the American Dream, The Great Gatsby. Tender Is the Night is not always easy to read, and it does cover some of the same thematic ground (alienation, for one), but it is much more of an intimate, psychological portrait. It is detailed where Gatsby is spare, as it shreds layer upon layer of resilience and dignity. A devastating and achingly beautiful book."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I thought I had reached the high point of Fitzgerald's work when I read The Great Gatsby. I was wrong. This book is not as organized nor as focused as Fitzgerald's more popular work, but, in my opinion, it is better. The characters are astoundingly complex, and are fascinating to read about and get to know. The setting--various places in Europe--is brilliantly depicted. But what makes this book great is the interaction between the characters. It is a story of the Divers, Dick and Nicole, a couple who all but trade roles in the course of the novel. The story opens with Rosemary, a young actress, as she meets the Divers and is completely enthralled by them. Through Rosemary we see that the Divers are, in fact, very nearly the ideal couple at the beginning of the book; but this apparent bliss is a mask of a deep, complex, and difficult history, and an awful foreshadowing of a tragedy to come. The story moves backward to Dick and Nicole's meeting, then forward again to the tragic climax.Dick, a psychiatrist, met Nicole at his clinic, where she was a patient. He was a brilliant young doctor and successful author, she, a broken and troubled youth. Dick helped her put the pieces back together, and married her. They lived an almost blissful existence for a time, but then Nicole began to relapse. The bulk of the novel deals with Nicole's problems and her struggle to overcome them, as well as Dick's growing problems, which he, with all his training, is not so able to move past. Dick and Nicole's relationship develops into something ugly, a shattered remnant of its past glory. And what is worse, it isn't even really Nicole's fault.Fitzgerald has a gift for beautiful prose and a talent for storytelling that is almost unparalleled in literature. This book should be considered a classic, and surely deserved to emerge from the shadow of its sister work, The Great Gatsby, and be regarded as the masterpiece that it is."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I have read this book maybe a half dozen times and everytime the book gets better. This book was produced inbetween nine years of distraction and disapointment, and while Gatsby is lean and tight and fluid--this book is anything but. It has its problems, but Fitzgerald writes his way out of them. The Difference between the twenty-eight year old writer of 'Gatsby' and the thirty-seven year old author of 'Tender' is just that--Fitzgerald had grown up. He wrote a book he hoped to be the model for the age--Joyce, Stein, Conrad, Proust. But instead he produced a book that is all Fitzgerald and consequently a model for any age. His style has exceeded 'Gatsby' and so has his content; his characters are real--breathng, smiling, crying, lusting, drinking, smoking, loving, and thinking. A book about \\"the dying fall\\"--something we all understand. Filled with soul--it is Fitzgerald's absolute finest."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender Is the Night is one of the most interesting examples in 20th century fiction of reversing the usual social metaphors. Dr. Dick Diver, a psychiatrist, is examined as a case of mental health. He is also placed in a classic woman's role, that of the desired, amiable beauty sought after by all and sundry. These juxtapositions of the usual social perspectives allow the reader to touch closer to the realities of human need and connection, by piercing our assumptions about what is &quot;right and proper.&quot;The story begins from the perspective of Rosemary Hoyt, an 18-year-old motion picture star, recuperating on the Rivera. One day she goes to the beach and becomes entranced by the Divers, Dick and Nicole, a golden couple with whom she immediately falls in love. Beautiful, young, rich, and looking for adventure, she quickly sets out to capture Dick who is the most wonderful person she has ever met.Later, the story shifts to Dick's perspective and traces back to the beginnings of his marriage to Nicole. She had formed an accidental attachment to him (a classic psychiatric transference) while residing in a mental hospital. He returned her friendship, and found it impossible to break her heart. They married, and he played the role of at-home psychiatrist tending her schizophrenia. All went well for years, but gradually he became weary of his role. His weariness causes him to re-evaluate his views on life . . . and the psychological profile of Dr. Diver, charming bon vivant, begins.The tale is a remarkably modern one, even if it was set in the 1920s. Fitzgerald deeply investigates the meanings of love, humanity, and connection. In so doing, he uncovers some of the strongest and most vile of human passions, and makes fundamental commentaries about the futility of fighting against human nature. The result is a particularly bleak view of life, in which the tenders may end up more injured by life than those they tend. What good is it to please everyone else, if they offend rather than please you instead?The character portrayals of Rosemary Hoyt, Dick Diver, and Nicole Diver are remarkably finely drawn. I can remember no other book where three such interesting characters are so well developed. You will feel like each of them is an old friend by the time the novel ends.If you have ever had the chance to read Freud, the novel will remind you of his writings. There is the same fine literary hand, the succinctness and clarity of expression, and the remorseless directness of looking straight at the unpleasant. I felt like I was reading Freud rather than Fitzgerald in many sections.This book should open up your mind to thinking about which social conventions you observe that leave you uncomfortable . . . or which are in contradiction to your own nature. Having surfaced those misfitting parts of your life, I suggest that you consider how you could shift your observation of conventions to make them more meaningful and emotionally rewarding for you.Be considerate because it pleases you to be, not as a ruse to obtain love!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this book is the freshness of its language: except for a few slang words used in speech, the prose is so cutting and modern that it reads like a recent creation.Much of the discussion surrounding this book has to do with its semi-autobiographical nature, at least to the extent the Divers' marriage and Dick's personal unraveling mirrors the effect Zelda's mental illness had on Fitzgerald. Yet knowing too much about the parallels between a writer's life and his work can be distracting, and this is a good enough story to stand on its own without recourse to voyeurism. Fitzgerald shows the effects of insanity on a marriage and on its (initially) stronger member, but is discreetly circumspect as regards his inner feelings. We can see Dick working to create a sphere of normalcy around Nicole, yet his motivation is not entirely clear. In fact, Dick Diver is ultimately the least fully explored of the bunch: we never really learn what makes Dick tick. Why does he have this compulsion to make himself liked, to briefly be the life of the party then move on before his charm wears thin? In this behavior Dick displays a restless sociopathy worthy of a Bret Easton Ellis character - which also, again, proves the essential freshness of this novel written a lifetime ago."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald's lyrical gifts shine here, faintly tinted by a mellowing sense of tragedy. While 'Gatsby' will remain the seminal Fitzgerald, readers may find this novel a refreshing change from the revisionist, dogmatic, politically correct, feminist times in which we now are forced to live. The heart, of course, transcends all of these, and this is where Fitzgerald stands apart, and will continue to do so. He had a favorite phrase which he used to describe his approach to writing: &quot;a romantic eagerness&quot; and his prose style really does reflect &quot;some sort of epic grandeur,&quot; as Bruccoli titled his book on F. Scott. Those who attempt to remake this novel in light of present times are missing its unique charm: the charm of an indolent, golden time which predates the soundbyte and the end of rational historical research."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The first 100 pages of this book were vey disappointing. The characters seemed shallow and the plot, seemingly non-existent. There were many times that I was going to not finish the book. I thought that Rosemary was the shallowest character, even more shallow than Daisy in Great Gatsby. I also was not intruiged by the rich, careless lives of Dick and Nicole Diver, or that of their multitude of non-descript friends. And then, after the hotel scenec, it all made sense. I was amazed that Fitzgerald could tie all of his characters to the plot, as well as bring to life the deep problems of Nicole and Dick. After the first hundred pages (which took me nearly 3 weeks to get through) I read the last two hundred in three days. The demise of Dick and the subsequent rise of Nicole was quite captivating. Fitzgerald didn't demean his readers by telling them every bit of information . . . he let the readers draw there own conclusions as to the plight of the characters. Really, a very intelligent piece of work, even more so than Gatsby. In some ways this book felt like something John Steinbeck could have wrote (my favorite author), so if you enjoy his books, or Fitz's Great Gatsby, this is a definite read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I read Tender is the Night soon after completing a somewhat haphazard survey of a selection of Fitzgerald's earlier stories and novels. The first thing that struck me about that book was the sophistication and maturity of the storytelling. The gossamer thin plot neither unfolds nor plods. Rather, it drifts through the life of Dick and Nicole Diver spanning five years. If I do have a criticism of the book it's that there is so little plot. It has elements of a romance, of a mystery, and of a tragedy, but defies most of the essential characteristics of each. The reader is instead left with a rich yet curiously oblique portrait of a couple falling out of love. Ironically, that's also the book's saving grace. Where traditional plot lines tend to dramatize with thick, clear lines, Fitzgerald's light and poetic prose paints with a more refined brush. You get to see Dick's decline with the same sad pity as his wife, and in the end are left with a better understanding of his downfall. More of a psychological study than a true drama, it's not a book that will leave you caring about the characters or wrapped up in the action."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"very few authors touch me in the way fitzerald does. most of his works usually include disclaimers pointing out his errors in location and spelling. if you can overlook these flaws you will realize that there is no other writer that so expresses an era. to read his novels takes you back into that magical yet innocent time. this book especially mirrors fitzerald's personal tragedies and triumphs; from the mental illness that took his wife away to the constant feelings of inadaquetly fulfilling his professional goals. the settings are spectacular and forever gone. one walks away feeling somewhat saddened by the characters and by the deterioration of dr. diver while his wife becomes strong once again. he has failed somewhat in his profession but has succeeded in his views by finally making his wife well. her life just starting once again full of promise; his life at its downturn. it is a good novel that follows his usual patterns but is a classic none-the-less."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"F. Scott fans, sorry to disappoint, but I can't regard this book as much more than a semi-autobiographical paean to rich and hollow youth, graced redeemingly here and there by the deft lyrical touch.-But even the trumpeted writing in this book is mostly Princeton Sophomoric- Every single character, not just the primary ones, is as beautiful as he or she is hollow. One gets the feeling, after a while, that one is watching one of those mindless beach films of the early sixties---It may be true that Fitzgerald cried every time he read Keats's Ode to A Nightingale, from which Fitzgerald gets his title for the book, but Dick Diver, so obviously Fitzgerald's alter ego, is, in so many passages casually relating his omnipotence over women, and in one explicitly stating the similitude (p. 258 in my edition) much more a Byron figure than the greater poet.Life in this world seems to end at 29, where Nicole leaves our hero in the last few pages.-The whole to do about Fitzgerald's/Diver's alcoholism as an excuse for the book's banality just won't do.- Fitzgerald made the excuse to his editor that he wrote the whole of Section III while tight as an owl-And so what, Scott? - Hemingway was an alcoholic and suicide. Faulkner died of the DT's in a sanatorium near his home in Mississippi Jack London died at 40 of alcoholism and Tennessee Williams, and Eugene O'Neil, and Hart Crane and Carson McCullers and.....and it's really hard to think of a major American writer of Scott's era that didn't succumb to the perils of drink. This did not stop any from writing mature works that dealt powerfully with the human condition, not just the rich and beautiful. ---The one exception seems to be Ezra Pound, who merely went mad and spent most of his time broadcasting Fascist propaganda for Mussolini during WWII.The book's credo might well be summarised by Abe North, who disappears early in the work, foreshadowing Dick's later demise, asseverating before his own alcoholic death: \\"When you're older, you'll know what people who love suffer. The agony. It's better to be cold and young than to love.\\"As an alternative to this rather cold and young book, I would recommend either Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and The Damned, written when he WAS young and his lyrical powers, quite frankly, were at their height and allowed him to pull it off. Or, for a truly great lyrical book, probably the best of Fitzgerald's generation, Thomas Wolfe's (not to be confused with Tom Wolfe) Look Homeward Angel...Not a witless bathing beauty from first page to last.. ."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald is the greatest American writer ever to pick up a pen. It is a character study unparalled in any of his works. The imagery is stunning and beautiful and then all at once shocking and sad. You can't call Dick Diver a pathetic man, but rather a man who sensed he outlived his purpose and then realized he was an old man, very much alone and unhappy. I was happy that Nicole was able to recover as she did, and at the same time deep down inside hoping against his own self-destruction that Dick would be able to pick up his own shattered pieces of wasted life, before he killed himself or was killed. But you knew it couldn't end that way, and anyhow when fitzgerald puts together a scene, you merely brace yourself and go along for the ride. He always makes you glad you did. I think this book is a masterpiece, fully realized but tragic."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"OK I will try to retain my temper while rectifying some of the inexcusable comments made by various reviewers. Someone has said that this book has no structure to it and that it is confusing and difficult to read. That is strange, since one of my first thoughts after reading the first few chapters was 'By God this is nicely structured, isn't it? This Fitzgerald fellow must be a genius to pull it off like he does.' Furthermore, the story is told chronologically and causes no confusion in that aspect. I would also like to note that my mothertongue is Dutch and that English is only my third language, still I had no problems with the writing of Fitzgerald and found it easy enough to read.I also get sick and tired of people who'll tell you the book is bad because the book and/or the characters are morally incorrect. Look, life isn't morally correct and neither are people, so why would you want your art to be? Perhaps you like to be lied to? I always wonder where these people get the authority (and the nerves) to question other people's morality.Then another reviewer wrote that there is no central point to the story. I mean what book did you read? There is only one point to the story and that's the marriage between Dick and Nicole, how it came to be and how it eventually faded out like the day into the night, ever so tender.And I think this is what most people have trouble with: Fitzgerald's subtle, almost minimalistic writing. In the whole book (my copy was 392 pages) there is not one redundant word, it's like a poem. If you want a good book that's beautifully written and masterfully structured, you can't go wrong with this one. If you want action, plot, speed, heroics, morals, endings and whatever it is you crazy kids crave for nowadays: go to the movies!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Classic must read .....great writing ...

They don't really say much except that the person reviewing the book knows a lot about the author. You could take this as meaning that he or she is an authority and therefore to be trusted on the issue, but it also means that person is very biased. I'm an English major and I can spout off that information but I choose not to for the same reason that I became an English major (and teacher) in the first place: because I love to read and to write. The writing in Tender is the Night amazes even in scenes that may not push forward at a very fast rate. Fitzgerald doesn't have to fill the book with little literary tricks to keep you interested. The writing shines on with every page. You don't need to know every detail of his and Zelda's life to get Tender is the Night. You just have to love to read. This book ranks as one of my absolute favorites."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night is a frustrating read. I found myself likening it to setting out intending to pick some highly coveted and delicious berries, only to find that the berries grew on a very dense bush that protected its fruit with pain inducing thorns. While it was at times an arduous task, it did have its rewards.Having not read any F. Scott Fitzgerald previously, I would caution others to learn from my mistake and not start with this difficult read. Having not read any other of his works, I am not qualified to pass judgement regarding if this dense thicket of words is marred by an alcoholics diminshed skill or not. I fully suspect if anyone other than an already noted author of such high acclaim had written it, that it wouldn't be nearly as well regarded as it is.Part one was so unwelcoming that I had to force myself to continue. Part two was immediatley better, but lapsed back into a painful read near it conclusion. Part three, which benefited from all the ealier heavy lifting was more palatable.The main characters are not fully formed, it is difficult to find one to like or even admire. The secondary players are disposable. The establishment of time and place is weak and the narrative flow is halting at best. In truth, the story itself is not compelling either. With these flaws it undertandable, how a reader could be moved to provide only the meager one or two stars seen in some of the User Reviews.However, there are many passages, phrases and moments buried in the otherwise painful prose that demonstrate a powerful writer's skill that alone are enough to make it worth the read. It is in descriptions such a \\"He came upon her in the garden , with her ams crossed high at her shoulders\\" and \\"He sat listening to the hum of the electric clock. To time\\"...Out of context these may not seem persuasive illustrations, but in the otherwise halting narrative they stand out like ripe berries amongst the thorns. The craftsmanship that created them, is what generated the many albeit generous four and five star reviews found here.In the end, my three star rating is a reflection of the display of this talent, rather than a salute to a well executed example of it...I now plan to read the Great Gatsby with the hope and expectation, that it will provide an opportunity to see this formidable talent fully realized."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I read F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Tender is the Night\\" (1934) following a recent online discussion on Amazon's discussion board in which a number of good Amazon reviewers offered their thoughts on the book. I am please to note many fine reviews on this site as well.\\"Tender is the Night\\" is a story of part of America's \\"Lost Generation\\" in the period following WW I. Most of the story is set on the French Riviera in the 1920s with a large cast of wealthy, dissipated and idle Americans with little to do with themselves. The book tells of the fall of Dick Diver, a promising and idealistic young American psychiatrist. As an intern in Zurich, Dick had married a beautiful wealthy young American woman, Nichole Warren, who had been his patient. Nichole had severe and lasting psychiatric issues resulting from sexual abuse by her father. While on the Riviera, several years into the marriage, Dick is attracted to a callow 18-year old American movie actress, Rosemary Hoyt. Although he resists Rosemary's advances at the time, her memory stays with him. She and Dick have a brief affair a few years later. Dick ultimately sees her as shallow. By that time, his life has dissipated through drink, idleness, problems with Nichole, and the corrupting effect of Nichole's money. Nichole leaves Dick, and he returns to the States for a lonely, wasted life. It is all very sad.I found the story effectively organized and told. The opening scenes take place on the French Riviera with Dick seemingly at the height of his powers as a socialite and budding medical writer. After an extended opening, the story doubles back to Dick's life in Zurich and has fateful courtship of Nichole. We then witness Dick Diver's inexorable deterioration, alcoholism, and degeneracy, and the break-up of his marriage. The writing is eloquent and spare, with good characterizations of mostly unappealing people and pictures of places. We see the rootlessness of a class of Americans after the great War and the corrupting effects of money and idleness. Dick Diver's story, I thought was sad and sentimental rather than tragic. There is little of the hero about him.\\"Tender is the Night\\" is the story of wandering lives, lost innocence, and the waste of human potential. In some ways, the book reminded me of the writings of the Beats, following WW II. It is a 20th Century American book, well worth knowing.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"In many ways this books is less complicated and easier to understand if we go back and look at Fitzgerald's own notes that he recorded in his famous ledger pror to writing the novel. The biographer Mathew Bruccoli does an excellent job of pulling together many of the details surrounding the life and the works of Fitzgerald (FSF).The present novel was written more thatn 10 years after his breakthrough novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" His marriage had soured, his wife Zelda was hosplitized with mental ilness, and he was living in Baltimore. He needed a novel to demonstrate that he was still a force and he wrote this two part book with the time flashback as that vehicle.The novel opens in 1925, set on the Riviera, and is narrated by a young actress Rosemary who deveops and attraction to a married Dick Diver. In his notes, he says that Dick looks like him, FSF; Dick's wife looks like Marlene Dietrich; Rosemary looks like the young actress Lois Moran. He had met the latter in Hollywood while screenwriting and had developed an attachment to her. He was 30 while Moran was just 18, ages similar to Dick and Rosemary in the novel. Although nothing happened, this caused quite a stir with his real wife Zelda who started a fire in their apartment in protest. The Dick Diver character is based on a Baltimore doctor that was treating FSF for his alcoholism. Those are the people that create a framework for the novel.The novel reflects the complexities of FSF's own life, the failure of his marriage, his driking, the decline of his career, and his attraction to, or distraction by, Lois Moran.The novel is divided into two parts. Part I opens on a beach on the Riviera in 1925 and describes the chance meeting between the Divers (a married couple Dick and Nicole) and the young actress Rosemary. She is attracted to Dick, but nothing happens. In part II, the story re-starts in 1917 without Rosemary and we trace the meeting and marriage of the Diver couple. One reson for the two parts is to introduce the time fahsback, that FSF thought would make the novel a lot more sophisticated, and it would quiet down some of his critics that thought that his writing ideas were too simple.Rosemary's role is primarily to throw the weak Dick off his marriage, get him frustrated since they never consumate, make him think of other women, so he starts to have these side affairs and ruin his marriage, independent of whether or not she comes back into the story.The core of the story is about a weak man distracted by drink and women, as perhaps FSF was as well. In real life his wife never recovers from her mental illness, and died in a fire in a home in the early 1940s.The story is a bit backwards compared to FSF's real life. In real life FSF went into seclusion on the Riviera to finish Gatsby. Zelda had the affair, not him, while he was writing. So it is a slight role reversal here. Her affair opened the door I suppose for him to have an affiar, and since he went to Hollywood often as a screen writer, there might have been something going on there but probably not with the original distraction, Lois.\\"Tender is the Night\\" from Keat's \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\". This is a poem that wouldmake FSF cry, every time he read it.Excellent novel, and highly recommend."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I, like probably everyone else, read 'Great Gatsby' as my first Fitzgerald novel. 'Gatsby' was his greatest work, no doubt. In 'Tender Is the Night', he expertly displays why he was such a good writer. He was a master. He is great at building up rich, beautiful worlds that are barely imaginable. He opens them up to us, and drops us right in the middle.In 'Tender Is the Night', you get to follow the story of a man's less than ideal journey through life. It takes you trough different women, different locations, etc. You effortlessly get inside Dick's (the main character's) mind. If you've read 'Gatsby', make this book your next Fitzgerald read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"WHile it did not enjoy the acclaim of it's prodeccesor, The Great Gatsy, Fitzgerald succeds once more in capturing the melancholy, self-disapassionated apathy of post-world war one america. WHile the the tangled lives of the DIvers are in themselves intersting enough to drive the story, it is Fitzgerald's astounding capacity to capture human interactions that makes it wonderful."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald is an author that represents the 20s in the US, this period where everything was crazy and rich before the Great Depression. This novel is the story of a love affair and of a career, that of Doctor Dick Diver. He is promised to a bright future as a psychiatric doctor. He marries one of the richest heiresses of America who was a patient first of all and became his wife. This love affair is described in the smallest and tiniest details. But Dick Diver comes to the point where he needs to distanciate himself from this ex-neurotic if not schizophrenic wife who was raped by her own father. Dick Diver is also extremely sollicited by many women because he is handsome and charming. He has a short-lived affair with a young Hollywood actress, Rosemary. But his wife Nicole is absolutely dependent on her love for him and cannot survive without his love.The story leads us among the circles of rich Americans and English people who mostly roams the highlighted areas of Europe, spending the money they have and that is always more than they can spend. But a breaking point builds up slowly and explodes sometime in 1927-28. He gets more and more aloof as for his job, if not frankly sloppy and finally gets out of it due to alcoholism. He gets also more and more distant from Nicole. But the real breaking point is when Nicole conquers her freedom through a liaison with another man. Then the end is inevitable : divorce and going back to America to have a general practitioner's office in the state of New York.But the book is a lot more interesting than just this picture. It shows how the very rich are living a complete dream life with caprices, good manners and civility, but no touch with the real world and how they get so far from the real world that they have to develop some kind of a screen to be protected from the fall this distance may represent : alcoholism, an artificial lifestyle and environment, spending as a daily occupation. This is in full contradiction with working to earn a living, which Dick Diver is always doing and a collapse is always at hand and it finally happens. One cannot live the contradiction between a real professional life and an artificial lifestyle. What's more interesting is that the fall comes from this very artificial lifestyle. Alcoholism is a coping strategy that dooms a professional life. Good manners and nicely controled love affairs are also in contradiction with a family life (the doctor has two children) and a professional life. So one day it has to break.Thus the night of the title has many meanings : the nightlife of this detached society, the shadow of all the little affairs and liaisons that remain unrealised or hardly realised, the night of the movie theater since the cinema is always in the background, the night of the end of a love affair, a passion, the night of a lost career. And Doctor Dick Diver submits to this gentle slope going down slowly, to this coming night as if it were a liberation from the obligations of this artificial life. He goes back to reality and gets lost in the night of the unknown, unknown at least for the members of this artificial society of over-rich kids who never grow up. Finally it is a style in the book : every detail is always draped in some kind of shadow, in some kind of night that helps any contradiction and evolution to exist and to survive any kind of crisis."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"My high school English teacher had a big thing for Lost Generation writers, and while I've taken on her love for Hemingway, I may need to read another Fitzgerald to get back into the Lost Generation as a whole. Tender is the Night was not what I expected. It took too long to get into, dragging the reader with one character and then dropping her half way through the novel to pursue the flashbacks about the main couple. I was totally bored with it. I give it three stars because I can respect the beauty of FS Fizgerald's prose, but the story just didn't grab me."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"\\"Tender is the Night\\" is obviously a more complex novel than \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and more difficult to read. I picked this book up twice. The first time I gave up after reading only half. The second time I got bogged down then hopped onto Amazon.com to read the customer reviews. Here someone wrote that you should spend sufficient time with the novel and read it with careful concentration. That was good advice indeed, because the novel then rolled along and became a pleasure to read once I gave it sufficient attention.The first part of the novel is a little annoying. The unmarried Rosemary pursues the married Dick Diver with complicity from her mother. Why would her mother encourage her daughter to get involved with a married man? That part I found frustrating.I was also confused as to what motivated Dick to marry Nicole. Some characters in the novel said it was money. One reviewer here at Amazon.com, whose opinion seems learned, says he did so out of pity for her schizophrenic state. The novel circles back from the beaches of Cannes and streets of Paris to the mountain hospital where the two characters first met. At first I found myself backing up and rereading parts of this because the change in venue was so abrupt that it left me somewhat lost. It was a major shift from the breezy momentum of the early chapters. But this part of the novel is where the real drama in the story begins to unfold. So it was a necessary detour.Other reviewers have noted that this novel varies in style from Fitzgerald's other novels. I read \\"The Great Gatsby\\" for the second time in one sitting. That novel is more lyrical and rolls along more easily than this one. There are certain sentences here in \\"Tender is the Night\\" that I wondered how they escaped the careful editing of Maxwell Perkins (editor at Charles Scriber and Sons).Finally fans of Fitzgerald who long to read about rich American expatriates living in Europe will find plenty to entertain them here. The scenery is the beaches of Cannes, the streets of Paris, and the spas of France. Nicole and Dick Divers go from one gathering of glitterati to the next. Fitzgerald drops you squarely into the lives of the idle rich as he did in \\"The Great Gatsby\\". But here he also reveals a lot about their miseries and heir drunkenness. Maybe that is the chief difference between the two novels (if you ignore that crimes in Gatsby)."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I am not worthy of reviewing this book. It is simply brilliant. I read it and have not stopped thinking about it and the characters. Absolutely lovely, perfect novel. I liked it much better than Gatsby. My heart swells and breaks just thinking about it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender Is the Night is the story of a very dysfunctional American couple, the Divers, slowly disintegrating in Europe. Much less economical and symbolic than The Great Gatsby, it is a personal work. There are some problems with this novel, such as the coincidental way in which characters meet each other again across Europe and the poor development of some of the important secondary characters. However, one is convincingly drawn in to the initial magic of the Divers' relationship and its gradual collapse."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald was a supreme talent, and he showed what he was capable of with The Great Gatsby...but Tender is the Night lacks direction and inspiration. (I read the restored version, so my chronology may differ from other readers'.)The plot is a bit scatter-shot and uneven, with a very sweaty ending (for a slice-of-lifer, many developments come across as factitious rather than organic), but the writing is still unmistakably that of a master. Numerous sentences stick with the reader, and Fitzgerald's facility with the phrase causes me no end of admiration.However, the air-tight perfection of Gatsby is noticeably lacking. (I know: they can't all be as good as Gatsby...but the comparison is natural, and leaves Night far behind.)Tender is the Night is ranked #28 on the MLA 100, which puts it ahead of some better stuff, but I can't quibble too much with the novel's placement. It's virtuoso writing by a literary titan, and definitely should be read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Scott Fitzgerald famously noted that the very rich are different from you and I. Agreed. However, in this tale of the wanderings of a segment of the post World War I \\"lost generation\\" one could argue that some things do not escape even the richest. I would note the scars left on Nicole Diver, nee Warren, by her father's incestuous behavior. I would further note the extreme mental problems that caused not only for Nicole's life but for Dick Diver, her husband and a psychiatrist, and their children. If that is Fitzgerald's point it really hits home because this book at the very least reflects his own personal problems with his beloved wife Zelda when she went over the edge. As for the rest of the story line this is a typical Fitzgerald Jazz Age story, well written, but with no necessity to empathize with the plight of the other denizens of the story."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"i read The Great Gatsby 7 years ago when i was eighteen and thought it flat and completely uninteresting. So i decided to read Tender is the Night and was not expecting much. But seriously, I had no idea Fitzgeral could write with such depth and beaty. Almost every paragraph in this book is enjoyable, and some of the writing is just as breathtaking, and as origianl and pure as basically anyone...Interesting to me was the fact that this book reminded me of some of Nabokov's books that were also written in the 20's and 30's (particularly King, Queen, Knave and Glory). Perhaps it is the priviledged, European feel that Tender has, or maybe the painful lyricism of some of the passages, but either way he has earned the highest compliment by being compared to Nabokov. I believe I am the first to make this observation.This book, like On the Road, will have moments of energetic optimism and loveoflife while at the same time harboring a sense of impending doom and finality. This book will break your heart. It is just beautiful and sad and everything a book should be."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Dick Diver a promising young pyschiatrist falls in love withan emotionally disturbed young woman with a troubling past and a great deal of money.Dick forgoes self to shelter Nicole from the harsh world and shelter friends and family from Nicole's demons.

Afer a few short stories and Gatsby, I thought I'd love Tender is the Night. In the beginning of the book (book1), I was totally absorbed with Fitzgerald's descriptions and idealism and perfection of Dick Diver. When Rosemary left as 'narrator,' I thought the book went somewhat downhill, along with Dick. But then, that's how the story goes. I fell for the disillusionment at the start, and was disappointed as the 'real' was revealed."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Dick Diver fist fights with insolent Italian cab drivers, calls an arabian princess a &quot;spic,&quot; screws around with a hot young actress, insults dull society women, humiliates himself, destroys his life with affectation and affection that is unparallelled in literature. He is a Modern version of Pechorin from Lermontov's &quot;A Hero of Our Time.&quot; Nicole Diver, his wife, is also well drawn by the master of the Jazz Age, but Dick's character study is the goldmine of this novel. I feel that the &quot;madness&quot; aspect of the novel is the dullest part, what Fitzgerald is truly interested in is catalogueing the slow unraveling of a talented, egotistical, alcoholic man, i.e. himself."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald's words are like music dancing off the page. He is easily America's most lyrical novelist and this tale about Dr. Richard Diver, his tragic wife and the young actress Rosemary Hoyt is amazing. The characterization and language set this book apart and leave Fitzgerald with Hemingway in a class by themselves among American writers."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The book was great. Honestly, for a required reading book, I really enjoyed it. I loved the way the three parts of the book finally made sense at the end. The relationship between Dick, Nicole and Rosemary is really cool. The ending is pretty good, even though I didn't expect them to get divorced."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This was the first Fitzgerald book I have read since high school. (Actually, I think I used Cliff notes then) I don't think you read &quot;Tender Is The Night&quot; to learn any great answer to life's problems. However,I do think it has a lot to say about relationships between men and women. I also think it makes a comment about conscience. You are not a serious Fitzgerald-head if you have not read this book."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I liked F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing because of its metaphors and imagery that enable the reader to get a real sense of what is happening to the characters. The characters that he creates are also fascinating. However, I found parts of the storyline to be confusing. The book jumps around in time which was also a little confusing. On a scale of A to F, I would give this book an A-. It is a really great book and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I first read this masterpiece in college. It impacted me greatly. To that end,\\" Tender is the Night\\" gets my vote as the all time greatest American novel. Every private library must have this work of absolute genius. The author is gifted and is able to write great prose at an early age, with the publication of his first novel, \\"This Side of Paradise.\\"However, upon his return to the United States after spending many years in Paris with \\"The Lost Generation\\" F. Scott Fitzgerald finally completes \\"Tender is the Night.\\" He tells the story of Dick Diver whose life and work tumbles because of his marriage to the wealthy beauty Nicole Warren. This book is heartbraking. Fitzgerald's command of dialogue and masterful understanding of human emotions shakes the soul of the reader."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I purchased all six of these books from the Canadian Amazon website (amazon.ca) several weeks ago because I couldn't bear to wait any longer for them to show up on the American site.The covers are just gorgeous. The art is metallic and beautiful and the covers have a soft feel to them. The inside flap of the cover is perforated and is designed to be removed and used as a matching bookmark.The cover art for this set of F. Scott Fitzgerald books was designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith - the genius behind the similarly beautiful Penguin cloth-bound classics series. Not only is the literature itself classic, but the books look like a classic collector's item as well! Friends compliment me on them all the time when they see them on my bookcase!Unlike another reviewer, I have no issue with the text in my copies. It is clear and dark throughout, and definitely doesn't look faded or photocopied. Also, I can confirm that the introductions to the other Fitzgeralds in the series are written by different authors than the author of the introduction to Tender is the Night."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I hadn't read Tender Is the Night for at least a dozen years. Maybe more. Though I thought of it as one of my favorite books, I realized when I began re-reading it that I had forgotten much of the story. The one thing that was still fresh in my mind was the sense of tragedy I associated with Dick. By that I mean, I remembered him as a tragic figure. What was the source - arrogance, impatience, fatigue, attraction to money, alcohol? All of those? None of them? I'm not sure. I am sure that Dick is an intensely personal representation of Fitzgerald himself. Tommy Barban be damned. He's a charlatan. If nothing else, I can only hope Nicole realized how much she lost when she lost Dick."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"i recomend this to anyone who enjoys fitzgerald, it is perhaps his best work ever"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald is one of the most interesting authors ever, and you will enjoy how his real life parallels the characters in this book. I would reccommend reading this book slowly so that you can follow the plot and really get into it. If you liked Gatsby, you will surely love Tender Is the Night.. the Gatsby of a different color."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I had mixed feelings about Tender is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I enjoyed reading about the romance between Nicole and Dick, and then between Rosemary and Dick, and I found that I cared deeply for the characters. I was involved in their lives and felt concern and sorrow for them. Despite these aspects which I enjoyed, there was much of the novel which I felt to be irrelevant and uninteresting. I didn't understand the significance of the story of Abe North's difficulty with the law, the problems between the Divers and a remarried Mary North, and the arrest of Mary North and Lady Sibly-Biers. I was also disappointed in the way Fitzgerald chose to resolve the story. Dick was my favorite character throughout the novel but it seemed in the end that he was sucked dry by Nicole, used and abandoned by Rosemary, and made an outcast by all his friends. I felt that Tender is the Night was weak in terms of historical content. There was little discussion of World War I and the novel didn't create a clear picture of its aftermath. I also had a mixed reaction with regard to Fitzgerald's style of writing. His description was interesting and creative but I was often confused as to the character speaking, the passage of time, and the exact aspects of an event. I finished the novel uncertain about whether or not events had actually occurred and not completely understanding the motivation behind much of the story. Overall I found Tender is the Night to be entertaining to read but at times difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Read my full review below, I just would like to make one ammendment - it seems my words might have been edited a small bit for space and I just want to make one thing clear - I recommend skipping the first portion of the book, makes it a much better read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I was expecting to like this book more, and only checked it out because the library didn't have 'The Great Gatsby.' I liked this book more than Gatsby, but after having read both of them, I feel it's about as undeveloped and unconvincing as Fitzgerald's more famous work.I really liked Part One, but things really went south in Part Two. I really didn't see how Rosemary fit into the plot at all; she's this big-name rising starlet who is instantly warmly and closely befriended by all of Dick and Nicole's adult friends when they're in France, and she and Dick are mutually attracted to one another, an attraction strongly encouraged by Rosemary's mother. Unless there's something going on between the lines that I failed to see, this didn't seem like anything more than a young girl with a crush on an older married man, a crush that doesn't go much farther than some secret rendezvous where they don't do anything more than kiss, hold one another, and say sweet nothings. Then she drops out of their lives and doesn't appear again till close to the end, where she and Dick are talking like they shared some affair. How could the brief appearance of a young girl disrupt Dick and Nicole's marriage so much, esp. since they never even slept together? This is just like a lot of books with alleged affairs or love stories which are never given any motivation or credibility, explaining why these two people are attracted to one another and would want to leave an existing relationship for this new dangerous one. It really insults the reader's intelligence.Besides the alleged love story, the character development of Dick and Nicole were also really wanting. We know that Nicole has been psychologically unstable anyway since she was a young girl (indeed, she and Dick met while he was treating her in a mental hospital), but there's no insight into why she goes back to her old unglued ways. Her behaviour doesn't even seem that out of control, just erratic and a bit strange. We also get no insight into why Dick also starts on a course towards his own mental breakdown. I had no understanding of why they began acting that way; why should I consider him the hero and root for him when I'm given no insight into his condition, no explanation or rationale for his behaviour, and when he doesn't want to deal with his wife's serious problems, who indeed even worsens them? There were also a few pointless and dead-end subplots, like Abe North's problems in Paris and the incident towards the end involving Mary North and Lady Sibley-Beers. The edition I read also had a lot of untranslated French passages, as though everyone still speaks French as a second language or even speaks it more often than their native tongue. Those days are gone, and there's no need to belabour the point by having whole conversations in French when the reader knows that they're in France and speaking to French people. The end of the book was also a big dead-end. The story was interesting, just not convincing, realistic, or believable."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The novel Tender is the Night by F.Scott Fitzgerald, a tragic romance, is about a young 18 year-old actress named Rosemanry Hoyt, and her realtionship with the Diver's, an American couple. Their realtionship starts off with a growing friendship, which leads to Dick's (the husband)downfall and causing his wife to marry another man. The setting allows the reader to understand life during the 1920's before the time of the Depression, with close attention to characters and how our ways of living have evolved since the 1920's. F.Scott Fitzgerald uses a style of writing to fit both the time period and the setting of the novel.With F.Scott Fitzgerald being born in 1896, he has first hand knowledge about a time period important to our country's history that most of can only read about. He depicts the life of a young actress trying to fulfill her dream and a sophistaicated couple whose wealth forces them to live a life that they do not desire, and have to be people that are not. Dick is a brilliant psychiatrist who has an affair on his wife who enters into many clinics for a mental breakdown brought on by sexual abuse from her father. I can see why the novel may have received mixed reviews in 1933 when it was published. Even though life during the 1920's is depicted (in which it seems to me) accurately, but the plot of the novel is not what you would expect. I believe that it is a good novel, but not everyone would want to read this type of novel.

Sadly most of them only have one. This certainly appears to be the case for Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby, while flawed, is nonetheless a great novel. Gatsby is a tragic figure motivated by a self destructive pursuit of his vision of the American dream. Dr. Dick Diver, the central character of Tender is the Night, on the other hand, is naught but a dissipated wastrel. As his wife, who he met while he was working as a psychiatrist &amp; she was interred in an asylum, gains mental stability &amp; some kind of shaky personal wholeness, he descends into drink &amp; carnality &amp; ends the novel roaming from town to town practicing medicine briefly before moving on. Diver is the kind of insipid navel gazing character who has plagued the Century's fiction.Tom Wolfe, touring in support of his new novel, has launched himself on a jeremiad against the Modern novel &amp; novelist. His central point is that novelists need to stop looking inward and look without. He's saying, Go out into America &amp; tell the wonderful stories that you find there. There are wonderful stories, waiting to be told, but our greatest novelists are cloistered in Universities, Manhattan apartments, etc., picking at the scabs on their own psyches &amp; the vomiting forth their internal monologues.

So is the middle 100 pages. The ending is probably one of the most unsatisfying endings I've ever read as it ends not with not a bang but a sad whimper in diminuendo as if the author just didn't want to work on it anymore and dashed off a coda.Fitzgerald's lyricism, in my opinion, is simply overrated. Granted, there are some breathtaking passages (which I took note of), but most of the writing was just dull, dull, dull. He would've benefited tremendously from studying storytelling as well since he makes the middle portion so deadly dull that it made me want to chuck it across the room, and butchers the last portion so badly that it came across as amateurish - choppy, rushed, and consequently ungraceful - which gives credence to his own remark about the book: \\"I would give anything if I hadn't had to write Part III of Tender Is the Night entirely on stimulant...\\"He also makes tons of basic storytelling faux pas, such as redundant attributions (e.g. \\"I think so, too,\\" he agreed), unnecessary and dull passages that add practically nothing to the story, a whole section (the middle section, more specifically from p.114 to 207) where we follow the main characters wander around without any specific objective except to kill time, and the last part that's haphazardly and painfully put together. The result is a very uneven book with deep pits of absolute boredom.Didn't really like it"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I struggled to finish this book. It is laden with trivial charactersand the plot drags on endlessly while Fitzgerald keeps blindly grasping for the magic he had before he destroyed his mind with alcohol.The writing in this novel is sloppy at best, and, as he confessed to his sometime-friend Ernest Hemingway (see Hemingway's &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;), he often altered his writing for the sake of financial gain. This novel, which took over ten years to create, looks like the pained work of a man who has run out of gas. His focus was diverted by his alcoholism, his lust for financial success over artistry, and his wife's instability, and it shows.The book drags on endlessly, and it looks like Fitzgerald is just trying to fill up pages (which he may have been, because Scribner wasn't happy with the much shorter length of The Great Gatsby).Sure, there are a bunch of pretty sentences, and even a few unbelievable paragraphs scattered throughout, but good sentences don't make a good story, and they certainly don't overcome the weakness of these characters."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This book turned me off F. Scott Fitzgrald. I was very excited to read it, as I've heard it portrays what Fitzgerald was going through at the time, and that he \\"poured his soul\\" into writing it. Well, I caution you to stay away from this book and stick to Gatsby. I feel terrible giving it a 1 star review, but I literally cannot recommend this book, ever... and I'm a fan of literary fiction (which this book is like), i.e. Raymond Carver, Chekov, etc. But Fitzgerald seems to drone on and on about the same topic, following the life of affluent drunks. If you like to read about what older rich people do when they drink (fight, sleep together, debate politics), this will be an interesting read for you. If not, stay away."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I only bought this book for its cover. I needed it for a craft I was working on and I paid more for shipping than the book, so Im not totally disapointed. However, I am disapointed that the image of the book is not what the book actually looks like since that was the only reason I purchased the book. If I knew what it looked like I would not have gotten it. The book was in good condition and if I were to read it was well worth it. It was just not right for my craft."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"If you like style and storyline, this is a pretty good book to read. If you like likeable or interesting characters and an absence of misogyny, this is not a very good book to read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"No one in my book club liked this book Why is it a classic. Different times I guess. The characters had no depth, it rambled. I think F Scott was drunk when he wrote this."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I found &quot;Tender Is The Night&quot; to be a very captivating story from the beginning to the end. It is an engaging story which grabbed not only my attention, but also my imagination by leading me to make early conclusions about how the story was going to turn out. I was reading the book always waiting for my predictions to come true, which kept me in some suspense. I found this facet of the book to be very exciting. However, unfortunately for me, I was wrong in some of my premature conclusions, and so, I was inevitably a little disappointed by the end. My suggestion is to read with some wonderment about what is to happen, but try not to set yourself up for any initial conclusions you might come to about the final destiny of the characters. Speaking of the characters, you definitely take on their emotions or develop your own about them, making the book that much easier to read and enjoy. I was liking some, feeling sorry for others, and still completely disliking others. The only negative thing I would say, looking back over the book, is that I do believe that there are some aspects of the characters' emotions and predicaments, which are alluded to, but then dropped. So, I was left with the feeling at times of expecting the deeper meaning of a character's wants, needs, and reasoning to unfold later. However, I found they never did. I, of course, could've been reading more into the words than what was intended. All in all, though, I recommend getting a copy and allowing yourself to be drawn into this emotional story. I think most people will find it enjoyable and easy to read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"If you are considering reading a number of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novels I would highly recommend the chronological approach, so that you can see his style develop from his graduation from Princeton to his untimely death.Scott published little that is not deserving of 5 stars...such titles as This Side of Paradise, A Diamond as Big as the Ritz, Winter Dreams, The Great Gatsby, etc, etc, etc, and of course Tender is the Night...what a fine piece of work! Whether you prefer one of Fitz's novels, novellas, or short stories to others, I think, is a matter of time and place... For each person who truly makes the effortless effort to enjoy the man's writing, you will find a love of letters and a brooding look at lives of the young from a time not unlike this one.Tender is great stuff! Read it! I personally have never been exstatic about Gatsby, it is unfortunately over analyzed in high school classes thus cheapening it...those less often raped by stupid teachers such as TITN are more interesting to read and think about."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I should have read it with the reader's comanion. I wanted to read it on my own without any bias and I didn't want to dissect it. But it sounds like the reader's companion would have been a good choice, simple working as a kind of ''dictionary'' for the book, explaining references of the time, as well as locations and timelines.There were moments of truly beautiful writing injected into a sometimes confusing yet gripping story. (I'm sure the companion would have helped). If you take your time with it, it will work better for you.It was kind of surprising and amusing to see the little comments about women, no doubt the way most of society felt back then. For example, there was a comment something to the effect that most women want their opinions formed by men. We've come a long way, baby!By the end of the book, I didn't much care for Dick Diver. He seemed to think he was doing Nicole a big favor by being her husband. Yeah, that's a great attitude to have in a marriage. Also, he had this ego that had a big problem with the fact that she had money, even thought she never threw it in his face. Also his drinking and overall downfall seemed to be blamed on her.Geez, Dick, take some responsibility for your own actions! I couldn't help but root for Nicole. And even though we didn't get a lot of insight into Tommy Barban, I had the feeling he truly loved her for her."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald's writing style is brilliant in places here, and I found it fascinating to see how he built up some of the novel's themes -- especially that of wealthy American tourists invading war-scarred Europe. At one point, he writes something about a nation (the U.S.) that had spent the last ten years (1918-1928) wanting nothing more than amusement: Just wait a few decades! But I didn't have much sympathy for Dr. Diver, who I felt was ruined more by his own self-pity than by his marriage. And therefore, I didn't find much point in reading about his downward spiral."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night is certainly a professional effort, however it is dull, it is a bit dense, and the timelines occasionally are confusing, making the first two obeservations even more glaring. It is a sad story, but one in which I found a chore to read for the most part. It seems to cerebral to conjur up the passion of a taboo love affair and the malaise of a dying one. We can't compare all of a writer's work to his greatest triumph (gatsby in this case) but since I read Tender is the Night because I liked Gatsby so much, the comparison is inevitable.Maybe I'm too young to truly understand this story or better yet feel it, but I have a feeling when I'm older I won't want to attempt another pass."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"To be blunt, there is no plot. I hate to be overly critical, but if Herman Schwartz (ficticious name) had written this novel, it never would have seen a printing press. What I mean by &quot;well written&quot; is that you will be able to identify the fact that F. Scott Fitzgerald was certainly a talented writer. His phraseology is excellent and insightfull (hence the extra star). The problem is that there really isn't much of a story here. If this book is sold on audio, it should come with a warning to not drive while listening as it could cause the listener to slip into a coma while driving! Basically, it chronicles much of his own life with his wife who also struggled with mental illness, much like the wife of Dick in the story. Ernest Hemingway held the novel in high regard, but his opinion was biased as he enjoyed a close friendship with Fitzgerald. The esteemed Mr. Fitzgerald would have done much better to confine his struggles to a diary away from the public. As such a capable writer, he could have done much better than this. Final analysis: boring and disappointing."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"&quot;We are rich and beautiful, and I am in love with you!&quot; &quot;But I am married, and it is forbidden!&quot; &quot;But we are rich!

Even though my wife is also beautiful and rich!&quot;Depression era publishing, and F.Scott was SURPRISED that this book wasn't well received? The characters are so distantly removed from reality (the successful doctor, the daughter of ridiculous wealth, the movie star) that it's impossible to connect with anyone in this book, even coming from an upper middle-class lifestyle. If I were scrapping for food in the depression, I can't IMAGINE reading this book--it would've infuriated me.I dragged byself through it largely because of Gatsby: we've all read Gatsby, and we all liked Gatsby. This book might follow the course of Fitzgerald's own life, but it's hard to read and impossible to associate with, and it was painful to get through. None of Gatsby's rich imagery or deeper undercurrents. A 'Confession of Faith' for F.Scott, perhaps, but overall a shoddy 'other book' by an author of high standing.No surprise to me, whatsoever, that Tender is the Night flopped and broke Fitzgerald's heart. I can't say I'd recommend reading it, unless you want to be one of the few who's read 'the other book' by the Gatsby guy."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald has well developed the novel Tender is the Night. There is a lot of conflict throughout the whole entire novel. He begins by introducing two different groups of people into the novel. Then he movers into the main conflict which is the love affair between Rosemary Hoyt, a movie star, and Dick Diver, a psychologist. This affair then causes many problems at different times throughout the novel.The characterization shows how people can be categorized in different groups. The characters in Tender is the Night are very well rounded and kept. There is a lot of controversy among the two groups of people. The first group consists of high-class, wealthy, and good-looking people. While the other group consists of more middle-class people and they are not so attractive either. Conflict first begins with these two groups because Rosemary likes a man, Dick Diver, who is from the high-class group, but would still like to associate with the other group of people. This conflict is what led to the next conflict being the affair between Rosemary and Dick.The actual affair between Rosemary and Dick made the novel interesting to read...The novel was very well written and interesting to read. Fitzgerald does and excellent job developing the different conflicts throughout the novel. His use of the different groups of people is well related to how many groups are and act today. Which can be comparable to everyday life."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I did not appreciate this novel when I first read it in High School.

(1) My mother was a Fitzgerald who grew up in Ireland, around the corner on Mary Steet from the castle of the Knight of Glin. (The current knight and his family still live there. My mother was not related to him nor his forbearers.) Unfortunately, I disliked the book. It did not hold my attention, probasbly because it depicts a life style that, to me, made borely reading.

Plus, hey, it's Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"F Scott Fitzgerald's prose, sometimes brilliant, sometimes opaque, too often seeming to search for effect, manages to bring to life his unlikeable, brittle characters in their class-cocooned world. A disagreeable but intriguing book. Watch out for the anti-gay passage, two-thirds through - unempathetic and dismissively judgmental, to the point of being homophobic, even by 1920s standards."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I had never read this before but did so recently with high hopes. I was disappointed. I found it mawkish and mannered. The Great Gatsby makes for a better read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's second-highest regarded novel reveals the psyche of its tortured author. As a reading experience, it draws interest from the character of that author, equal parts eloquence and self-loathing. But it lacks the easy engagement and storycraft of Fitzgerald's other fiction.Published in 1934, nine years after Fitzgerald's prior novel \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (and the only other novel after \\"Gatsby\\" Fitzgerald lived to complete), \\"Tender Is The Night\\" centers around a young, handsome couple who live as wealthy American expatriates on France's Mediterranean coast. Dick Diver is practical but somewhat frustrated, a situation exacerbated by the arrival of ing&eacute;nue film actress Rosemary Hoyt. Encouraged by her mother, Rosemary takes a fancy to Dick and decides to lose her virginity to him. Dick's wife Nicole senses something is brewing, but her husband's fidelity is far from the only issue on her very full plate.Two psychoanalytic profiles dominate this book. The first, of Nicole Diver, is shallow and unconvincing. The other, of the author himself, is far more engaging, if more a matter of connecting the dots between Fitzgerald and Dick than what the text itself affords. Dick, we come to learn, is a man of great potential, a leader in his chosen field who chooses to exile himself at the height of his success. As the book goes on, Dick descends deeper into alcohol and social-outcast status. While his profession is psychoanalysis, he is often found late in the novel working on a giant manuscript he never seems able to finish. The Fitzgerald parallels are obvious and will fascinate admirers.But the novel feels thin at its core. I don't think I could put it any better than the title of Michael G.'s review from July 2011 - \\"Slender Is The Plot.\\" Divided in three sections, each primarily seen through the lens of a different person - first Rosemary, then Dick, then Nicole - \\"Tender\\" is a lot of to-ing and fro-ing about the continent, with people giving random voice to their concerns in the Age of Anxiety in-between squabbles and trysts. The characters seem more like narrative constructs than real people. Dick, for example, goes from solid citizen in the early and middle section (a large part of which is a flashback to an earlier period in his life) to dangerous drunk for no better reason it seems than a girl he pines for. Jimmy Buffett knew better than to lean on that excuse too hard, but it forms the spine of our story.Fitzgerald seems more self-indulgent here, both in his writing (a lot of description gets troweled upon incidents of little or no importance to the larger story, like a visit to a World War I battlefield or the drunken antics of a doomed friend) and in what he writes about, with Dick reduced on account of allowing himself to be used by both his wife and his would-be mistress. It's not his fault he's so damn sexy! The drinking issue comes up as an afterthought, as if Fitzgerald felt lost without employing his trademark malady. But Dick's issues, like Nicole's, never seem very real. Neither, at their heart, do Dick and Nicole, however much they are being used here as stand-ins for Fitzgerald and his famously troubled wife Zelda.What I enjoyed about \\"Tender Is The Night\\" is the wonderful sense of place one gets, right from the beginning when we see the coast of France from a hotel \\"and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach.\\" Fitzgerald overloads on the adjectives and adverbs, it seems more than usual for him, but his amazing craft carries this off to solid and sometimes spectacular effect. There are a hundred perfect sentences buried in this book, sometimes attached to killer paragraphs: \\"In the dead white hours in Zurich staring into a stranger's pantry across the upshine of a street-lamp, he used to think that he wanted to be good, he wanted to be kind, he wanted to be brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. He wanted to be loved, too, if he could fit it in.\\"Reading prose like that made me hungry for the deeper experience of other Fitzgerald works, not only the impossibly perfect \\"Gatsby\\" but \\"The Beautiful And Damned,\\" which like \\"Tender\\" is focused on a couple's travails within a social set but of a more engaging, visceral, humorously-alive kind. The problem with Fitzgerald is he's a good writer here, but looking rather lost in comparison to his younger self."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"As I finish up my tour of Fitzgerald, I find Tender Is the Night a good representative of him as a whole, both what I like and what I don't. Here, we find the strength of his maturity, which is lacking in earlier works, but it still strays into more self-indulgence and more-of-the-same hopelessness (along with its partners alcoholism and immorality) than the much better Great Gatsby or even the unfinished Last Tycoon.I felt the first half was by far the stronger. The second lacks strong plot movements and, even more importantly, strong examples of the schizophrenia that's supposedly at the root of the characters' motivations. All in all, an interesting outing, but not the author's best work."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Dick Driver is a psychiatrist with a crazy, though rich wife. They travel together around France and don't seem to know what to do with themselves.Driver meets a young actress who is taken with him, but it not until five years later, that the two become involved.

What a great, understanding seller. Buy with total confidence."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Despite its sombre tone, I really enjoyed reading Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night. At first, it appears that the novel will follow Rosemary Hoyt, a young American actress traveling abroad with her mother. Rosemary meets Dick and Nicole Diver, a young, affluent couple, on a beach in France, during her travels. She soon finds herself falling in love with Mr. Diver.From there, however, the story takes an abrupt turn. We learn the history of the Diver couple. Dick is a psychoanalytic doctor, and his relationship with Nicole began as a clinical one. An impossibly rich young girl from America, she'd been committed to a mental facility in Europe after a disastrous turn in her relationship with her father. Dick happens upon her one day in the facility grounds, and the two begin talking and writing to one another. Later, Dick almost seems compelled to marry her in order to fully cure her of her illness.At any rate, the remainder of the tale primarily follows Dick and Nicole (with brief re-appearances by Rosemary) as their marriage evolves and eventually disintegrates. It is a sad tale, indeed, and it definitely smacks of Fitzgerald's fascinations with social power and money. It also sadly rings with autobiographical elements in Fitzgerald's later life - adultery, mental illness, the feeling of failed potential."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Through his unparalleled social insight and clairvoyant, intuitive, and translucent dialogue, F. Scott Fitzgerald has masterfully established himself as undeniably one of the greatest writers of all-time - as well as my favorite writer. Having read Fitzgerald thoroughly, I can pithily opine that his amazing use of the English language approaches the sublime. Tender is the Night, written arduously between 1925-1934, is the work of a more polished, mature, as well as hardened, writer than that of the young 23 year-old rookie who wrote the idealistic, yet splendid, This Side of Paradise.That being said, F. Scott does not disappoint by any means. This poignant and provocative tragic allegorical narrative of Dick and Nicole Diver strikingly, albeit unshockingly for Fitzgerald devotees, resembles F. Scott and Zelda's convoluted & tumultuous marriage. While F. Scott's alcoholism parallels Dick in an eerie kind of way, Zelda's mental instability and infidelity echo through the character of Nicole. When reading Tender is the Night, I felt as though I were on the beach in the French Riviera or on the Champs-Elysees in Paris with this group of pretentious and morally depraved bourgeoisie. Only Fitzgerald has that unique, intangible, & utterly indescribable ability to transport you into his vibrantly decadent world of the 1920's - a world that he brings to life unlike any other ever has - or ever will. How Hemingway could trash this great work that F. Scott poured his soul into is infantile and beyond me.To quote F. Scott, \\"Gatsby was a tour de force, but this is a confession of faith.\\""},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"TENDER IS THE NIGHT is composed of three books. Altogether, these tell the story of Dick Diver, a debonair psychiatrist, and his wife Nicole, who is wealthy but depressed, mostly in a five-year period that apparently ends in 1929. In Book 1, Fitzgerald presents the Divers as they appear to 18 year-old Rosemary Hoyt, a budding Hollywood actress, in 1924. At this time, the Divers are living a glamorous and dissipated life on the French Riviera, with the irresistible and socially masterful Dick, who is not practicing medicine, overseeing his wife's recovery. In Book 2, Fitzgerald shows the Divers four years later, after Dick has resumed his psychiatric career. In this book, Dick has become emotionally torn between his wife/patient Nicole and the nubile Rosemary. And, he has become a problem drinker. In book three, Fitzgerald presents his denouement, this time emphasizing the rejuvenated Nicole's perspective on her marriage.As Nabokov said, readers make a mistake when they confuse the design with the designer. Nonetheless, TItN certainly contains many parallels to the lives of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. There's glamour and affluence in Europe, immature stunts, mental illness, a period of difficult professionalism, intense resentment within marriage, and ruinous alcoholism. Read as insight about Fitzgerald, the novel is interesting, since it does convey the plight of unfulfilled promise and too much booze. Books 2 and 3 are especially effective with these themes while featuring many passages of effectively lyrical writing. IMHO, this peaks with a final few observations about Dick, which are suggestively lyrical and even touching.In contrast, the long Book 1 contains what I deem many pages of ineffective lyrical writing, since Fitzgerald frequently brings everything to a halt as he describes, say, a hairstyle, the fabric of a dress, or a ripple of social awkwardness. In large part this lyrical overelaboration stems from the immaturity of Rosemary, whose perspective dominates Book I and who misses the desperation of the Divers and their friends. Instead, she conveys what a socially ambitious 18 year-old girl probably perceived in 1924, when her glam and social older friends let her have a first naughty drink. As a result, Book I reads as if the Fitz is overly concerned with social nuance among the wealthy and has, really, nothing to say.TItN is the Jazz Age without the jazz.Recommended if your ancestors belonged to the Brook Club or, perhaps, the Racquet Club."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Beautifully packaged and designed -- one in a series of Fitzgerald books covered by Coralie Bickford-Smith -- but the print is oddly misshapen and faint at times, as if it were photocopied, and this has one of the worst introductions to Fitzgerald's work I've ever read, by Arnold Goldman. His notes aren't any good either. I was thinking about picking up all the books in this series, but until I can determine if the rest of the introductions are as bad (which I can't do on Amazon) I'm going to hold off."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"To put it as simple as possible, Tender is the Night is the story of a man and woman in a codependent relationship. She needs him for stability and he needs her to feel useful. A relationship like this is unhealthy, therefore, it can't last. But the two involved are the last to know.The story starts off with the actress Rosemary, not the principle characters Dick and Nicole. This is done for a reason. Fitzgerald wants us as the reader to be introduced to the couple the way the world would. We're supposed to see Dick and Nicole as the glamorous, sophisticated couple who are rich and happy--hence, from the outside. Only as time goes by do we see them for the flawed individuals and disturbing couple they are. Dick loses himself in his attempt to be the rock to his emotionally and mentally disturbed wife. I'm still not sure how medically accurate it is for a woman to become a schizophrenic due to incest. But I digress.Tender is the Night isn't as breezy as The Great Gatsby: it is more complex and longer; yet, it's not as good. Some of the characters here remind me of the empty, vacuous characters of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises: the so called \\"lost generation\\" who spend their time traveling and cavorting across Europe drinking and licking their emotional wounds while enjoying their expatriate status in the more \\"sophisticated\\" countries. Only, Tender is the Night is much meatier and more thoroughly enjoyable than Hemingway's drudgery.Bottom Line: A thinly veiled autobiography of Fitzgerald that fails to be a masterpiece, but is still a worthy piece of work that I wouldn't be opposed to reading again."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"A.J. of Maryland, a former reviewer, said it all about the gorgeous writing. The word \\"ambrosia\\" was used - yes, this book is like a great gourmet feast, where literary skill is concerned. Fitzgerald cannot be copied because his style is so uniquely his own.As for comparison with \\"Gatsby\\": I did not enjoy \\"Gatsby\\" as much as \\"Tender.\\" \\"Gatsby is, indeed, nearly a perfect novel. It has been described by the great literary critic Milton Hindus in a monograph about the book as resembling the tiny inner workings of a Swiss watch...you peer inside and wonder how the craftsman could have created something so intricate, jewel-like, perfect.And yet, \\"Gatsby\\" did not move me like this book. \\"Tender certainly has its flaws. Some of them are quite laughable because of what we know today about mental illness, alcoholism, homosexuality (that these things are not \\"curable,\\" for instance...that homosexuality does not lead to a downward spiritual spiral, etc.) And yet, the \\"Tender\\" part of the title stands. This book quivers with love and tenderness.Historically, this book is uniqely autobiographical. I couldn't help feeling, as I read, that Fitzgerald wanted to set things straight about his relationship with Zelda. Refuting the belief that \\"Dick (read: Scott) married Nicole (read: Zelda) for her money\\" might have been the pivotal idea Fitzgerald was trying to get across, though it probably seems unlikely to most readers. Still, that line, spoken by a minor character, leapt out at me. I thought, He wants us to know that it is not true: he adored Zelda; he wanted to take care of her because she was mentally fragile and only succeeded in being dragged down by their co-dependence; he wanted to be his own man, but as a writer never could live up to her huge wealth; still, he liked the things money can buy - who could blame him; in the end, the madness and drinking and inequality of resources caused him to \\"dive,\\" like his hero, Dick Diver, into dissolution and failure.I disagree with the comment of another reviewer that the lack of development of the children's characters meant that they were not loved. Of course, it was a dysfunctional family, so in that case \\"love\\" has a lot of strings attached to it...however, I know that the Fitzgeralds loved their daughter, Scotty. She turned out to be a delightful, well-adjusted person, from what I've heard. But more than that, I felt that Fitzgerald didn't want to drag his daughter or even fictional children into the sordid adult tale. He actually did them a favor leaving them out. Also, it must be remembered that adults and children interacted differently in earlier times in this century. Children played a far more minor role in their parents' lives - especially children of the very rich, who were often cared more by governesses and other servants than their own parents. In fact, it's amazing that the Diver children played such an important role in the book at all.It is fun to read about the psychiatric community in the 'twenties, and the old attitudes people had about mental and addictive diseases. However, there is a certain amount of condescending racism, classism, sexism and even an anti-semitic reference here and there in the book.And yet - Fitzgerald is a master. I recommend the short stories...I think these are the jewels in his crown."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I read &quot;Gatsby&quot; and was awed by Fitzgerald's ability to both describe the 1920's and to draw his readers into that postwar period. His characters felt real to me. So, I couldn't wait to read Tender is the Night. &quot;Tender&quot; seems to reveal more about Fitzgerald personal pain than anything else. His novel elaborately blames Nicole for Dick's emotional decay. To me, this story line just doesn't bear close scrutiny. Dick's behavior is controlling,habitually deceitful and at times misogynistic. Time after time Dick control's Nicole's actions and refuses to allow her to even discuss her viewpoint. Nicole's behavior is unbalanced but is it schizophrenic?It's very revealing that a 28 year old man would fall in love with a 16 year old girl. Later, when Nicole has grown up a bit, Dick falls in and out of love with Rosemary, a very child-like 18 year old.Granted, women's rights were along way off in 1925 the year Fitzgerald began writing Tender is the Night, but Dick seems more in charge of Nicole's life than seems warranted by either the prevailing culture or by Nicole's illness.I'd say that Fitzgerald unconsciously revealed his own role in his decaying marriage and like most folks tried to point the finger elsewhere."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Had not read F S Fitzgerald previously and was expecting a better read. The character development was great but found the story line lacking and the whole of it bland in the end."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tracing the arc of F. Scott Fitzgerald's marriage to his schizophrenic wife, Zelda, \\"Tender is the Night\\" is a tale painfully autobiographic. At times fragmented and confusing, the reader may forgive the rough spots for moments of lucidity and self-reflection that are achingly poetic. Thinly veiled in the guise of Dr. Dick and Nicole Diver, the fun, well-heeled \\"must know\\" couple who live for the moment, we are witness to the rapid devolution of their psyches and eventual car wreck of their lives. The first section is the most scattershot and uneven but the later portions of the book turn confessional about Dick's entrapment by his wife's instability and her family's insurmountable wealth, his self-destruction through alcohol as a means of escape, and their social ostracism as they become too intolerable to host. There is no irony that their descent into madness is partially due to their frantic life of leisure made possible by unspendable sums of money; it's enough to make any multimillionaire rethink leaving the bulk of their wealth to their offspring. Although not Fitzgerald's best, \\"Tender is the Night\\" gives us a rare window into the tumultuous life of American's literary icon, which sadly was tamed down from the even harsher reality they lived, and the complex love he had for his wife."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"For those of you who are Fitzgerald fans, this is a book that captures an individual's inner struggles and demons. Fitzgerald is always adept at identifying the weaknesses and aches of even the most 'powerful' or 'together' person. A book of substance and easy to read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Mr. Fitzgerald, excuse me for this brief criticism of your masterwork, &quot;Tender is the Night.&quot; To begin, TITN is a articulate, beautifully detailed work. Fitzgerald brilliantly mantains a languid, imagery and motif-filled text. Dick Diver, Rosemary and Nicole are each real people, in stunning contrast to the superficial emotions and problems of Gatsby, Nick and Daisy. Overall, the book is captivating, the characters intoxicating. Yet it was the poor flow of the book that annoyed me. Gaps in time, unartful character and plot development, and inconsistancy in chapter breaks led me to be shocked at his lack of care for what could have been his most amazing piece. Pehaps the themes struck too close to home or its magnitude became too intense for F. Scott Key. Regardless, this book makes for a great vacation read as it is one infinitely more complex and deep than &quot;Gatsby&quot;."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Many people consider The great Gatsby to be Fitzgerald's greatest work. In doing this they are shortchanging him from all his other novels, and his short stories (which are also gems of craftsmanship). Tender is the Night is a mature work of Fitzgerald and therefore may not be as readily acceptable to the masses as The Great Gatsby. In addition, the vocabulary in Tender is the Night is decidedly complicated and slowgoing. However if you are patient, and have a good dictionary, you will be awarded by a beautiful plot in a matchless setting, that takes you to a time that has long past. Enjoy!!!!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"What I will focus on here is the fact that scribners probably ruined Scotts career. In later editions esp 1962, they edited passages and I am curious as to the difficulties Scott had in getting continuing contracts with them and elsewhere . Of course this work has brilliant prose by Scott: it is revolutionary in that it deals with incest and homosexuality(one of the parts that were edited in later editions.) The discussion of the treatment of mentally ill patients in the era are important , for he describes Zelda as one of the patients, and also links that patients problem to syphillis!! For interesting counterpoint of life in Europe i read Miller &quot;Tropic&quot; . They go hand in hand . Did Scott star in &quot;Tropic&quot; Read and decide."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This was a beautifully written, though somewhat disjointed narrative about American expatriates in Europe between the wars. It was very similar in feel to Hemingway's &quot;Sun Also Rises&quot;, and shared some of the same sunny locales. Like many readers, my concentration was tested with the abrupt narrative shift from Rosemary's to Dick's point of view several years earlier. But on reflection, I think it was the most effective way to dramatize Dick's deterioration, beginning when he was at his radiant peak. As with Hemingway, we are forced to infer motives for some surprising behaviors by characters (Dick especially) for whom little cognitive insight is provided. It seems to have been a literary virtue for authors of this generation not to over-elaborate a character's state of mind. Of course this may have something to do with many of their works being so plainly autobiographical!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I wonder why this was so unpopular, as reflected by sales after its first publication. It's a tragic depressive book, true, but then so were 'The Great Gatsby' and 'The Beautiful and Damned'. It features the same bright and beautiful people who, through fatal flaws in their characters, fall through the cracks and never clamber up. This is the only one of the novels, though, that focuses on Americans out of America - rich expatriates in Europe. It's rather Hemingway-ish, except that of course instead of bull-fighting and big-game-hunting they go to beaches and do a lot of shopping. :)It is true, however, that this book is generally darker and grimmer than the others. The others started off with hope and excitement and wonder. Except for the first section, this is not the case here. Even when we view events through Rosemary's eyes, we are always aware and disturbed that things are not as they seem and people are falling apart. The prose is more muted, too - less of the lovingly lyrical imagery of TBAD, fewer descriptions of the wealth and opulence of TGG. There is a sense of concealed decay throughout this novel.This has a lot of disturbing undercurrents under its bright and polished surface. The events of the novel, in fact, reflect the characters of Dick and Nicole Diver themselves (Nicole more obviously, with her schizophrenia). Perhaps there isn't the same sense of optimism and idealism that one senses from the protagonists in the other books - Amory Blaine in 'This Side of Paradise'; Anthony Patch and Gloria Gilbert in TBAD; Jay Gatsby, however deluded he is in his case, in TGG; even what's-his-name? in The Love of the Last Tycoon. The first fifth of the book shows Dick and Nicole young, but henceforth they are tired and jaded and struggling desperately to keep up appearances. Rosemary Hoyt is likeable when she first appears, but by the last two sections she is hopelessly corrupted as well. The characters all seem particularly depraved; or perhaps amoral. This is clearly exhibited through their adultery. Yet Anthony Patch had an affair as well; and Jay Gatsby was intent on breaking up a secure marriage.Another aspect of it might have to do with the fall. Anthony and Gloria were played out by fate. He was the heir to a large fortune and he lost it due to a moment's folly. His error was constructed on a foundation of weakness and ignorance, true, but circumstances play a part. For Gatsby, one can't possibly blame him for not doing enough - if anything, it was that his vision was flawed in the first place and so whatever he did couldn't possibly have achieved him his desire. The reader feels sympathy for him. Yet Dick and Nicole don't have that luxury of blaming things on fate. They have money, they have attainable dreams, they have beauty and power. They foul it all up with no help from anyone else. To a certain extent the reader recoils from such characters.Fitzgerald appears to have pinned Dick's fall on his need for approval, attention and affection - which fits quite well. It would explain why he married Nicole, who needed him so badly; why he chased after other women, to ascertain to himself that he was still attractive and desirable. Nicole is tougher. I get the impression Fitzgerald uses her schizophrenia as a cover for a lot of things, a one-size-fits-all explanation. Why is she like that? Oh, she's crazy. Why did she do that? Oh, she's crazy.So what have we looked at? Theme - grimmer, but similar to other books. Characters - less likeable perhaps, but overall still similar. Setting - I can't see that it makes much of a difference. Timing plays a part too, of course. This book came out in the aftermath of the Great Depression, after the Jazz Age had blown past. People didn't want to be reminded of the glitzy parties of a past they couldn't return to; they were focused on hard work, picking up the pieces, moving forward in a steadier saner world. Poor Fitzgerald - he couldn't have helped that, after all."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"After telling my boyfriend &quot;Tender is the Night&quot; seemed so sad, he asked me: &quot;So, why are you reading it?&quot; Good question, but I knew. &quot;Because I care about these people. I am involved with them now.&quot; Dick Driver will remain in your heart as one soul really trying to take care of the people he loves but not so good at taking care of himself."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I'm flabbergasted! A lot of the reviews on this book are mostly concerned with how hard it is to get something out of Fitzgerald's novel. Messy and incoherent, people seem to think. The point is that this is what it's all about. The world's recently fallen to pieces in what has become known as the Great War. Most of the characters in the novel are aware of this, in one way or another. Consequently, they too are falling to pieces. Hints about this are to be found everywhere in the book, although Fitzgerald often hides them in subtle ways. If you've read this book recently and found it difficult, I strongly advise you to reread it. This is not a book just to glance through."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"When I read this novel, I felt as if everything else I'd ever read was garbage. This is because Scott Fitzgerald had a way with words that was beyond compare. I would stop myself and reread pages because I couldn't believe that what I'd just read was so beautifully written. I never do this with novels! Beyond that, this is an incredible story involving breaking a taboo that has a frightful attraction rate. Dick Driver is a psychiatrist. Nicole is his wealthy, beautiful, younger patient. This is not a story about Dick's abusing Nicole as her therapist. Dick saves Nicole and marries her even though he is warned by his own mentor that such a relationship never works. It becomes quite clear as the story continues to unfold that Dick is the one paying an exorbitant price from his marrying Nicole whereas Nicole is thriving. The alcohol and parties among the jet set abound as they usually do in a Fitzgerald novel, set in the 1920s. By all means read this novel. I can guarantee that you will hold onto it for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"F. Scott Fitzgerald's book, Tender is the Night, is widely regarded as his second best offering (after The Great Gatsby) and, as with other second best efforts, it suffers by comparison. There are three things wrong with this book, two of which can be corrected and one which cannot. The first problem is that Fitzgerald uses far too many obscure (to an American reader) references and words in French. While such use lends a certain authenticity to the book, it also makes it difficult to read without a considerable amount of knowledge of France, French culture and the French language. One way to overcome this obstacle is to read the Wordsworth Classics edition which provides a list of 399 notes to explain the text. It is somewhat awkward in that you have to flip back and forth between the text and the notes which are in the back of the book. It would be a good idea to make a photocopy of these notes so that they can be referred to as you read the story.The second problem, also correctable, but more awkward, has to do with the structure of the book. The main story idea is the disintegration of an idealistic and decent man, Dr. Richard Diver, who is corrupted by money and the loss of purpose in his life. To fully experience this tragedy the story should begin at the beginning, namely when Dr. Diver is working as a young psychiatrist in Switzerland. Instead Fitzgerald starts in the middle, that is to say after he is married to Nicole and they are on the French Riviera When we first meet him he comes across as a rich, indolent man given to hanging around with rich, unpleasant people. We also don't know, as Malcolm Crowley has pointed out, what the book will be about--some Americans in the South of France or its true purpose, the \\"the glory and decline of Richard Diver as a person.\\" The Introduction to this edition by Henry Claridge of the University of Kent does a good job of explaining this problem. Professor Claridge indicates that in fact another edition was put together to correct this very situation, but for various reasons it is no longer in circulation. One could, of course, simply start reading the book at the chronological beginning (the start of Book 2) and then backtrack as necessary.But the biggest problem, the one that cannot be corrected, is that we just don't care about these people, this insufferable group of Ugly Americans. The book begins by introducing us to Rosemary Hoyt, a 17-about-to-be-18 year old actress who has made one teeny bopper movie (Daddy's Girl) and regards herself, and is regarded by others, as the next coming of Greta Garbo.(For those of you too young to remember Garbo think Meryl Streep with a Swedish accent.). Rosemary has the de rigor mother who is micromanaging her career. She arrives in the South of France and meets a whole host of unpleasant people. There is Tommy Barban, a soldier of fortune apparently on leave between wars, Abe North, an alcoholic who gets more unpleasant as Book 1 continues, the fey Luis Campion, Earl Brady, the stereotypical Hollywood movie director, Mr. McKisco whom nobody likes, Mrs. McKisco who \\"sees something in the bathroom\\" and touches off a duel) and other assorted neer-do-wells. Even the Diver children, Lanier and Topsy, seem too too perfect, singing a tune in French. In this bunch Nicole comes off as clearly the best of the lot. And then there is Dick. But this isn't the idealist Dick, this isn't the tragic Dick. It's the idle rich Dick, whiling away his life on the beach, giving parties, doing the tourist thing in Paris.One is hard pressed to admire Dr. Richard Diver at any point in the novel. He is certainly bright--Yale, Hopkins, Oxford--but the picture that Fitzgerald paints of him is more one of professional ambition than service to humanity. We are not talking Dr. Switzer here. He is also a bigot, witness his attitude toward Italians, which gets him into an argument with Italian taxi drivers and leads to negative consequences. And then there is his problem with women or should I say young girls? When we first meet Nicole she is barely 16 and still in shock from a traumatic incident that would affect any child. Yet we find him \\"falling in love\\" with her. At this point Diver is 27 years old. Later (chronologically) when the same thing happens with Rosemary Hoyt she is just turning 18. This is not Romeo and Juliet; it is not even the 47-year-old Bogart and the 19 year old Bacall in To Have and Have Not. It is Humbert Humbert and Lolita redeux. Perhaps the problem is that Fitzgerald is trying too hard. It took nine years to write the book and after creating one of the most memorable characters in American fiction, Jay Gatsby, Fitzgerald was trying to top him. But the result is just not very successful. On the other hand Book Three is easily the best of the lot. Here Fitzgerald picks up the action and includes some scenes that are basically slapstick comedy, such as when Mary North (now Mary Minghetti) and her friend Lady Caroline Sibly-Biers are thrown in jail for impersonating two sailors and picking up some local girls. The scene ends fittingly when the local person who can arrange their release (Gausse), after taking much abuse from Lady Caroline, gives her a well-deserved boot in the rear.The ending is also disappointing. Instead of a dramatic climax the book goes out, as t.s. eliot might have said, \\"not with a bang, but with a whimper.\\" The whole Nicole and Tommy thing is simply not believable--and Dick as a GP in Palookaville??When we read a novel it is like entering into another world. The characters become real and we want to care about what happens to them. When Quasimodo meets a tragic end at the end of The Hunchback of Notre Dame we are saddened because we have come to care about him. But by the end of the first book of Tender is the Night I found myself not really caring about any of these people and plunged on with the novel only because it is Fitzgerald.Then is there any reason to read the book? The answer I think is yes, for two reasons. First of all for the language. Fitzgerald is simply a marvelous writer of English prose. His language here is beautiful and evocative. Take for example, these lines from page 129: \\"She crossed and recrossed her knees frequently in the manner of tall restless virgins.\\" \\"...she was a compendium of all the discontented women who had loved Byron a hundred years before...\\" All this about a relatively minor character, Baby Warren. And this line from page 193 about a policeman: \\"He had possessed the arrogance of a tall member of a short race, with no obligation save to be tall.\\" Then there is this exchange between Nicole and Tommy Barban on page 246: (Tommy) \\"You know, you're a little complicated after all.\\" Oh no,\\" she assured him hastily, \\"No--I'm not really--I'm just a--whole lot of different simple people.\\"The second reason for reading Tender is the Night is that one should not confine one's self to just one book by an author. Just as we cannot fully appreciate Thackeray if we just read Vanity Fair or Dostoyevsky if we limit ourselves to Crime and Punishment we should read more of Fitzgerald's work than his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby. To fully appreciate this book and Fitzgerald, one should read his first novel, This Side of Paradise and a good biography of his life as well as Gatsby. As with many authors much of his work is autobiographical and it is only by knowing his life that you can understand and fully appreciate his writing. In the end Fitzgerald is writing about himself and his own wife, Zelda. Knowing the lives these two led is vital to a full appreciation of this book.Amazon forces reviewers to make a choice between a positive or a negative review. But this is a false dichotomy. This book is both very good and very bad. I recommend reading it as a part of Fitzgerald's body of work,, but not as his only work and not as your first reading of his novels."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I am puzzled by readers who found the plot lacking but loved the prose. I was entranced by the story which enabled me to slog through the turgid, and pretentious writing. While I prefer the Great Gatsby where the writing is crystal clear compared to Tender's murkiness the plot of Tender Is The Night for me is unforgettable. I remember it from my first reading when my childhood memories of a family vacation in the mid 1930's in Switzerland and on the French Riviera were sharper than they are today. I am infuriated by the Divers' snobbery and condescension toward people who were not members of their self appointed inner circle, not to mention their racism. Yet I am moved by Dick and Nicole's love story. Rosemary's presence and her mother's role in her life and love affair are puzzling and I can only justify their inclusion as a tool to demonstrate how much the Divers were admired, but why? They were shallow people with shallow interests and equally shallow friends. Dick's acclaimed politness might be praiseworthy but what else did he have to recommend him? In the end even that quality disappeared in the most dramatic way.They weren't even good parents. The children's care was left to hired help, but I guess that was de rigueur among the upper classes of the time. The first part of the book was the weakest with especially florid almost impenetrable prose. Where was Hemingway when Fitzgerald needed him? Part 2 was a big improvement. The scenes at the clinic near Lausanne were well constructed and the dialogue rang true. The good Swiss doctor and his wife were believable. The dying patient with the tormenting skin condition was exactly as I remembered her from my first reading of the book so long ago. Dick's gradual disintegration is troubling while Nicole's ascent toward self-reliance and freedom is uplifting. It's ironic that the story's denouement foretells Scott's own tragic ending while Nicole's happy life with a new husband in no way resembles Zelda's later years. Zelda perished in a fire which destroyed the mental hospital in which she had been confined. So much about Dick and Nicole angered me. But they were creatures of their age and social milieu and they were well captured in this book. Fitzgerald portrayed the glamour, the cynicism, and the smugness of a certain type of wealthy American better than almost any other writer of that era. The weariness of living life in an alcoholic haze has been depicted more graphically by other authors but not in posh locales Fitzgerald made so real. You can almost hear a Cole Porter melody as you read about these ghosts of the roaring 20's and the wraiths of the troubled 30's. A good period piece if you want to learn about that era which is rather dear to this old lady's heart."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The first thing you have to understand is that this novel is one big wreck. It's brimming (well, sometimes) with beautiful prose, but the structure is just loose and lazy, in a way that many people will not understand and therefore label the book 'complicated'. It's not complicated at all. You just have to stop trying so hard to understand every little thing, and relax and enjoy the bigger picture.... When I opened it up...and started... - WOW! - what an incredible book! Although it does trail off and start dissolving again. But take my advice, the middle of this book is where its worth lies. I've never recommended skipping part of a book before, but here it really works well.Also, I think it's important people understand that in many ways this is a poorly constructed and written book. But the critics like it in spite of that, as do I, because there's genius showing through anyway. If not for the beautifully flawed and human development of Dick and Nicole's relationship... the book would be pretty worthless, but they are there, a wealth of poignant, sensitive, real storytelling. Tender is the Night is a special gem because of its flaws, because it exemplifies Fitzgerald's desperate life, his cry to use youth for its genuis, it talks frankly enough about all this while at the same time being the sinking ship of technicality and madness and real life that hardly any author can avoid. It's 'human', in a word. It's not a masterpiece, it's a hodge-podge of human-ness. A worthless hundred pages. A brilliant, soul touching hundred pages. And then some lighter descent. It is something to experience and be curious about if you ever find the book around."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"It is presumptuous of me to try to \\"review\\" F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of the premiere authors in American Literature. But, having recently read an eye-opening biography of Zelda Fitzgerald, wherein I learned that F. Scott had purloined many of Zelda's writings verbatim to use in his own novels, I felt compelled to reread this work.I always considered \\"Tender Is the Night\\" to be Fitzgerald's finest work, unlike most Fitzgerald scholars, who lean toward \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" I am no scholar, nor do I pretend to be, but to me, \\"Tender Is the Night\\" was always the most mature and most tragic--and showed a greater insight into Fitzgerald's psyche than perhaps he meant to show.The thinly veiled story of his tragic marriage to Zelda, the story takes place in all their real-life stomping grounds, from the Riviera to Paris to Switzerland--with a few side trips to the United States. In the story, Dick Diver, a prominent psychiatrist, is the protagonist. His wife, the beautiful, fey and often mad Nicole, is Zelda. As they aimlessly flit from place to place (the Fitzgeralds, and thus the fictional Divers, were the original \\"beautiful people\\"), the scholarly and noble (oh, so noble!) Dr. Diver begins to disintegrate under the weight of caring for a mentally ill but outwardly quite normal wife. In the end,it is he, not her, who is destroyed.There is a lot of anger in this book, and still more, almost unbearable pathos. I still think it is brilliant--a work of art in words. And I found, as I was reading, that I didn't really care which words were Zelda's and which were Scott's. As in real life, they formed a tragic whole--bent on destroying themselves and each other--and this book shows Scott's clear-eyed insight into that fact.The art is the tragedy--and the tragedy is the art. My admiration of F. Scott Fitzerald, and the lovely and lost Zelda, remains intact."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"When Rosemary Hoyt first glances at Dick Diver standing on the beach in the Riviera, he desperately intrigues her. She is in love at first sight, and she wants to know everything about him. There is a lot to know about Dick and his wife Nicole. As the story unfolds, naturally, more and more about the Divers is exposed.The effects of mental disorders are complex and devastating. Tender is the Night talks gracefully about mental disorders, not putting them down, but showing that even the most beautiful \\"normal\\" people can be affected. Dick and Nicole Diver have a seemingly perfect marriage until Dick's life begins to come apart at the ends. Nicole's schizophrenia becomes too much for Dick, who is also her psychiatrist, and their marriage.This book was really a writing from Fitzgerald's heart. It directly reflects his wife, himself, and the failing of their marriage. His wife was also a schizophrenic, and her institutionalization marked the end of their marriage. Her mental disorder had torn them apart.My favorite quality about Fitzgerald's writing has consistently been his ability to transport the reader directly to the 1920's. One feels like he/she is in the scene, watching the characters play out the book."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Why does Dick and Nicole's marriage disintigrate? Because Dick is haunted by his loss of integrity for marrying Nicole as much for love as for money? Because Dick, above all else, needed to be needed, and as Nicole's mental health improves after his many years of care and attention, he is no longer needed as much? As evidenced by his post-divorce aimlessness and professional failure, was Nicole his only true life's work? And the descent into alcoholism and Dick's preoccupation with Rosemary, the \\"other woman\\" - why?After much reflection I concluded that, not only did all of the foregoing factors contribute, but another factor exists, a great overarching truth for which neither Dick nor Nicole are responsible, and which Fitzgerald so delicately articulates. That truth is that we simply get older, and as youth recedes, so does starry-eyed optimism. A man and a woman become familiar to one another; their marriage routine. And a man like Dick, who thrives on attention and excitement, becomes trapped and miserable in the commonplace. He self-medicates through drink and reaffirms a flattering sexual self-image through the attention of a much younger, adoring woman, even if he eventually loses her, too. Ultimately, Dick is a caged animal who must have out - for what uncertain destiny is beside the point.TENDER IS THE NIGHT is, perhaps, the most psychologically complex novel I have ever read. Fitzgerald captures the ephemeral ebb and flow of human emotion within the context of the closed circle of intimacy with stunning accuracy, realism, and beauty. Apart from the immediate plot concerning Dick and Nicole, TENDER IS THE NIGHT is also a vivid portrayal of Fitzgerald's generation and strata of society abroad in the 1920s. In this way it is similar to Flaubert's SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION: both are love stories set against backgrounds of social upheaval wrought by a new prosperity, replete with hustlers, strivers, and posers, all on the make.In an Amazon review of James Joyce's ULYSSES a few years ago, I criticized Fitzgerald's work for being \\"dated\\". Well, it is; and TENDER IS THE NIGHT is, in many ways, dated; but it was a product of its time, and it is easy to be critical about a preceding generation's values, now discredited. That said, however, Fitzgerald's preoccupation with wealth and class nevertheless borders on the pathological. And, unless it is merely to illustrate his characters' limitations, his tiresome Anglophilia and alarming antipathy toward (of all people!) the Italians is pure racism. I often found myself thinking that Fitzgerald was a far better writer than his characters deserved.Insofar as lanuage, vocabulary and style, TENDER IS THE NIGHT is demanding. Read it slowly and re-read passages you fail to fully absorb on the first go-round. Fitzgerald's vocabulary is sophisticated, so use a dictionary. Finally, this book is ethereal: it is poetry and must be approached as such."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Or: Of Love and Loss: the Sacrifice for Gain. *Tender is the Night,* F. Scott Fitzgerald's tragic fourth novel, shimmers with palpable autobiographical pain; it is catharsis, plain as day, for the regrets and reduction of a personal life, and the era that encompassed it. Fragmentary yet fully contained, brilliantly lucid as it describes the derailment of sanity, via incest-trauma or the alcoholic haze - *Tender is the Night* flows like a tone poem, vividly capturing the illusions and sickened foundations of its flawed protagonists, and the escapist existence in which they dwell. Herein lay ghosts, drifting through splendor, oblivious until it is too late, and then insensate still, crippled by self-imposed restrictions: the patterns of denial, dissipation and dream-death.The novel concerns the relationship between married couple Dick and Nicole Diver, the husband a promising young psychiatrist with obscure goals about published research, the wife a fragile flower soiled early in life, the \`damaged goods' he takes on to teach, heal, and subconsciously reap in turn. At first, presented through the innocent gaze of child-actress Rosemary, the Divers seem like the quintessence of their sophisticated era: clever, classy, both elegant and subtly sensual, people so comfortable with themselves as to avoid the games and struts of the current \`season.' Young, restful, in love with each other and life in general, the Divers exhibit the ideal of the American Dream, if expatriat-ed from American soil . . . but the cracks begin to show, one by one, until the cultivated artifice is shattered and the sickness beneath exposed: the author therein chronicles the dissolution of this relationship, from beginning to end, drawing significant parallel from both his own life and the turbulent age in which he lived.*Tender is the Night*: A requiem for a dream. Certainly the fallout with his wife Zelda influenced the novel's course; but I believe there is more to it. F. Scott Fitzgerald, and by extension his work, was/is inescapably tied with the exuberant faade of the Jazz Era, an era defined (at least in the socialite sense) by its splendor and waste, its heedless optimism blind of cost. And though Scott basked in the cradle of this opulent \\"season,\\" the author seething beneath the fly-by-night exterior could not help but be keenly aware of its follies and hypocrisies: his novels and short stories savagely depict the inward condemnation he felt. But unlike earlier efforts, this, Scott's last completed novel, was composed between 1925 and 1934, and the disintegration of the roaring 20's into the dust-bowl Depression of the 30's seems to me clearly represented in the progression from *Tender's* first to third books - the illusion has crashed and there is no regaining it, despite the determined dissipative efforts contrary. This is a personal impression, one I read between the lines; and even considering the fact that Fitz lived overseas and that the events of this novel occurred almost completely in France and Switzerland, the metaphor is quite stark - to my mind, at least.A more literal analysis, in any regard, clearly shows the price of atrophy, lost ambition and alcoholism; despite the \`happy' resolution to Nicole and Dick's co-dependency, the pain of loss - on both a psychic and physical level - is harrowingly delineated. Having recently been in the position of Dick Diver - that is, faced with the temptation of sacrificing personal goals in order to \`save' another from the manic-spiral - I can sympathize with the capitulation of his dreams for more immediate concerns: genetic-inspired attraction as strong a demand as the survival-instinct drive. Yet Nicole's rise, surmounting both the Father and the Father Figure in her quest for identity, is just as poignant. The antagonist here is simply _weakness_, and how it can be shared to disastrous result.To define the myriad qualities of *Tender is the Night* into simplistic buzz-word recommendation: this is a haunting, occasionally stunning work, with beautifully lyrical prose and well-defined conflict, interspersed with casual insights into the urges/constructs of human reality. All in all it's a fantastic read, and perhaps my personal favorite of F. Scott Fitzgerald's work; (...)Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"One of the best works of American literature ever, \\"Tender is the Night\\" is often overlooked due to the popularity of Fitzgerald's more well known work, \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" In my opinion, great works of American literature simultaneously capture the time in which they are set, and perfectly arc these struggles and triumphs to wider, common themes. Somewhat reflective of his own life, Tender tells the story of a psychiatrist who pulls a reverse Florence Nightingale and falls for one his is patients before she's truly better. The resultant relationship is less than perfect, but he struggles with duty to his vows, and the longings of his heart when a new interest- scandalous in her own way- makes her way on his scene.As always, reading Fitzgerald is like watching an author make slow, passionate love to the dictionary. He's brilliant with words, but not hifalutin like many of his contemporaries. What he tells is a captivating bittersweet tale of confusions and conflict, set against a beautiful backdrop of pain, joy and strife."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I remember my first experience reading it, back in 11th grade. It is not really the best book for high schoolers, but perhaps in that suburban milieu of doctors' kids and dissolving marriages, it was a good choice. Another reason I wanted to read it was that a Fitzgerald biography said this was pretty much FSF's take on his own, deeply troubled, marriage.The book begins from the point of view of an innocent - Rosemary Hoyt, an American movie star (this was the 1920s) visiting some people on the Cote d'Azur, at a fictitious place on the shore between Cannes and St. Tropez. She quickly falls for an older man, an American doctor named Dick Diver who is married to a beautiful, and very rich, woman named Nicole. On the surface, everything is beautiful, glamorous, luxurious, and rich. But below there is trouble - quarrels, drunkenness, crazy behavior, homosexuality, and other ills. Rosemary doesn't see it though, and with the stubbornness of a beautiful, nave girl, she goes after Dick. He resists, but begins to fall in love with her. There is a cast of supporting characters such as Abe North, a wacky drunk, and Tommy Barban, a hotheaded young Frenchman with a military career behind him. 'Rosemary is drawn in, as the reader is, and as the wealthy but mentally disturbed Nicole Warren was. Dick radiates calm, knowledge, success, strength, and joie de vivre. As the story turns to the Divers' marital history, the impressions alter, and the book becomes the tale of Dick's undoing. Diver was a young, hardworking, Yale educated doctor at a clinic in Switzerland. A young, but seriously troubled (probably schizophrenic, as Zelda Fitzgerald was, although this word is not used) gets the hots for him, and against everyone's advice, Dick marries her. She has a mindlessly arrogant rich girl sister, named Baby, who is portrayed superbly. Dick and Nicole have a couple of kids and some good times, but he is as much her medical caretaker as he is her husband, and it starts to wear him down. Things start unravelling. The whole book has a tragic, downward trajectory, a feeling of impending misery that no amount of sunlight and good wine and comfortable surroundings can dispel. 'The book is a downer, but it is a fascinating one, with moments of brilliant writing. Fitzgerald can string words together and juxtapose them with sparkle and casual elegance. The characters' conversations are real and believable, as are the depictions of gay people (ahead of its time, I should think) and the playful rich. It is a very good novel, and deserves to be remembered even if it is not the icon that The Great Gatsby is. No doubt there is some satisfaction in watching the Divers crumble, those people that had every advantage imaginable, but it is still a sad read, and the product of a great artist who was in a great deal of trouble."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"\\"Tender is the Night\\" is a poignant story of a psychiatrist who fell in love with his patient and married her to stay close. Fitzgerald wrote the book under the impression of psychological problems of his wife Zelda; thus, the story is very real and sincere.The book manages to show complexity of characters underneath the casual masks. Dick Diver (the psychiatrist) is not merely a great doctor; he is a husband as well, which means two most important things in his life (work and Nicole) closely intertwined. Nicole (the patient) is not merely a rich psycho; she manages to remain strong through her disease, understand and forgive her husband, and find a new, happier marriage, after Dick became miserable in his alcohol addiction. Rosemary (a young promising actress) does not have a crush on Dick; she loves him for the first and, arguably, only time in her life. Fitzgerald's characters are not ordinary people, as there are no ordinary people in life, in general.Fitzgerald did not create a happy ending for the story, as there would be no happy ending in life. Confessions are made, and characters found their niches in life, but at the same time, there is some sense that the story is not over by the end of the book. \\"Tender is the Night\\" leaves the reader astonished, eager to know the end, at the same time showing that there is no end to some stories. They dissolve in the air and disappear slowly, as the letters from Dick to Nicole."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"In a Swiss sanatorium above lake Z&uuml;rich, Dr Richard (Dick) Diver meets a fascinating young patient, Nicole Warren. Nicole suffers from Divided Personality at its acute down-hill phase which translates in her fear of men because she was the victim of incest after her mother's death.Nicole's state improves after some time at the clinic and Richard marries her. They move to the French Riviera where they live in the glamour provided by Nicole's family money but soon their luck runs out.This novel is Fitzgerald's most personal one if one considers that his own wife Zelda became increasingly troubled with mental illness in the 1930s and so the story of Dick Diver and his schizophrenic wife Nicole shows the pain that the author went through himself. It is the moving account of the collapse of a marriage and an attempt to diagnose the sickness and destruction that money breeds. Dick's final loneliness in the novel reflects Fitzgerald's own dive into drink and despair."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I don't see how anyone could give Fitzgerald's monumental imaginative world anything less than a \\"5\\" for its sheer density AS a world. Throughout the book, I also felt deeply moved by the plight of Dr. Dick Diver, who certainly fits all definitions I've ever seen of a tragic hero...and to some degree, of Nicole, who is not portrayed as a person with quite the painful awareness Dick has of the complexity of life.While in awe of the scope and concrete detail of the book, the power of its arc of downfall of a basically noble character (most of the time), and its accurate perceptions of the complexities of intimate human relationsips, I felt at times that this was something of a \\"novel of manners\\", revealing one transitory emotional state after another in its characters, with no clue of any solid bedrock underneath.I also felt that though the novel focused on Dick's sad end, or, more accurately, disappearance \\"off the map\\" of Nicole's consciousness, I can scarcely imagine the hell that will await her as wife of Tommy Barbot, the professional mercenary, and a cold-blooded character in whom I could not see a single redeeming quality, or even qualities that might have earned his early membership in Dick's \\"inner circle\\" of friends.I find Fitzgerald both a gifted with genius and, at times, exasperatingly superficial.For some literary thrills, please visit my website,http://www.REALnothings.com"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"It all begins on 1924. We have many characters which caught great attention to my eye.Let me start out by saying how much I liked this novel. It really caught my attention because it seems that Fitzgerald transported gatsby to the south of France. Dick Diver is a talented psychiatrist that has invited everyone to his mansion. \\"I want to give a really bad party. I mean it. I want to give a party where there's a brawl and a seduction and people going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out in the cabinet de toilette.\\"Sounds just like Gatsby.We don't know Dicks' story yet and are left to make a judgement to what it was. The party all include many people, but of all there are three that are very significant. This whole idea that there'e to the novel is very confusing at times. Even though I may have liked the book alot, I think it's not directed to the audience I stand in. Fitzgerald compounded the book with many words that were unfamiliar to my understanding. Which required alot of searching in order to comprehend the novel. There's even some French in this novel. So if you're looking for a challenge and to enrich your vocab this would be a good book. Moving off that subject i need to state thate this novel is written in three different perspectives. Such that it's diveded in three books. It was a first to me, and i kind of liked that style. Moving back to subject, I would not recommend this book to others just because of the time it took to read it. I know it's a great book and all but many of my peers like to stick with t.v. Thereof its not one of my recomendation if you don,t like to read.Overall i give it a four out of five.P.s This book left alot of unanswered questions. Some like Who is the victim Dick or Nicole? Will either Nicole or Dick find happiness? See if you can figure them out."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This book was the book written right after the famous of Fitzgerald's writings, The Great Gatsby. Tender Is the Night took him six years to write and it was very close to his heart since some scholars believe that this book represented his down fall after his wife Zelda died. Also, many have stated that this is second best book, but I will say otherwise and call it his best book which he wrote.This book will seem very boring at the beginning because the main character, Dick Drive will not appear until the end of the second chapter, and will also talk about certain &quot;plots&quot; or other games which are not relevant to the story. Nevertheless, the plot will start to build when Rosemary starts to fall in love with Dick and the point where the story starts to cook with gas is at the Driver's party.Throughout the book, there are points that will leave you in suspense, and will also get you to motivate you to read more into the story to see what happens. One example is why did Dick marry Nicole. Though the story, their marriage has a facade over it, when they are around a crowd, they act with love and is flawless, yet when they are by themselves, it is a whole different world. They act very unfriendly, the couple do not really talk to each other or get into arguments. The Driver's marriage is not strong, and the weakness will lead up to chaos and the conclusion of the book.Also, in the book many subplots will make the book even more suspenseful to read. The subplots I believe are what keep you going in this book because it will show that true life is not just one problem (like having an affair) there are many. Some include, what happened in the restroom, why is Mr. North hiding, and the overall one, how did Dick and Nicole get married. When they are first introduced into the book, they do not give the answer right away, you must read and continue reading the solution to the subplot, and then will lead you to the main one.Finally, I really found this book to be a great one. The main characters are great, the story plot is good, but the only bad item is how it would throw me off the track when another problem arrived. The effort of the six years that Fitzgerald actually paid off, although he was not as successful with this book."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I had to read this book in high school. It was a nice change to be able to read something by Fiztgerald because I had to read Macbeth and Twelfth Night which I thought was extremly boring. The characters in Tender Is the Night were real and the story line wasn't like all the rest. It seemed like Dick only married Nichole because she was mentaly disable and he thought his love would &quot;cure&quot; her. And she married him because she felt comfortable and loved, but that's because he was all she knew for so long. Reading this was quite difficult because it would skip from one scene to another. Dick Diver would have flashbacks of when him and Nichole were together, then when he first met Rosemary. It was all jummbled together so I didn't know when it was the past or present. It didn't end the way I thought it was going to, but I guess that's what made it so intresting. I would probably suggest to all readers to read it twice to get a good understanding of it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Don't you ever wonder why somebody with so much potential doesn't make it in life. The pain is in watching a character who is sincerely charming become aware of his own shallowness. Right up to the last 50 pages I'm hoping Dick is going to pull himself together. He has flashes of insight but never enough to make any difference. They knew so little about mental illness and alcoholism it's really amzazing they were able to function for as long as they did. Fitzgerald's ability to observe human nature was acute. This was quite a narcissistic crowd but what an absorbing read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"my first crack at fitzgerald; i'm very impressed. but it requires patience- while overly wordy in places, often incredible actions and insights are buried in single sentences. fitzgerald seems to treat his characters with contempt at times, but we can't stop feeling connected to them. also a wonderful look at the art-deco world of europe between wars."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"As a lecturer in Anerican Literature, I have always been partial to this novel. To me, Fitzgerald is Dick Diver. The anger that Diver manifests towards Rosemary and Nicole is representative of Fitzgerald's own self-loathing, and his frustrations with his wife, Zelda. The novel itself is so much more dense and full than The Great Gatsby, for example. The characters are more real, if not always as appealing. Read this novel, but read Gatsby first."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This book is full of paradoxes that make you wonder who exactly could invent such a theme. FitzGerald is the answer. He has a capacity like very few others to captivate an audience who may not completely understand his point of view or motive. Nicloe's illness gives an interesting twist to the plot which otherwisse would be a boring story of romance, deception, and of course society. This is a great work of Fitzgerald's but should not be the first book one reads by him."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night is THE most confusing book I have ever read. It was required reading for gifted students over the summer. I recommend that if you do read this book, read section 2 first, then 1 and 3. The book goes to a flashback in section 2. This is where it is so confusing. The content was okay, if you like the love and phsycho mix."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I think that this book is definitely the most beautifully written book I have ever read. The settings are gorgeous and well-crafted; F. Scott takes us to the Riviera and whoosh- we're there. I also found the characters to be remarkably well-crafted, just like people you would meet at some wealthy socialite's house"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender Is the Night is by far the greatest literary work of Fitzgerald's time. His use of vivid description and imagery is breathtaking. I could not put this book down! Fitzgerald created characters in this novel which were so complex you feel as though you already know them. Tender Is the Night is sexy while heartbreaking, adventurous while thought-provoking. The story of the love, and loss, between the wealthy Dick and Nicole Diver, and how their lives together are forever changed by the young Rosemary Hoyt. This book is for anyone who has ever felt love, lust, joy, or sorrow. If you like The Great Gatsby, you will absolutely adore Tender Is the Night."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Though valuable to those interested in Fitzgerald, or to those who would find the historical and cultural aspects of the book interesting (the decadence of US ex-pat society life in 1920's southern Europe), compared to The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night was disappointing. Though the prose and literary style for which Fitzgerald is known is evident (and admittedly enjoyable), the book's plot is disappointingly weak and as shallowly developed as the lives of its protagonists. Though some might argue this is intentional, for one who's looking for a read to provide them with more mind-churning fodder on which to feast, this would not be the book in which to find it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Notwithstanding the outstanding quality of Fitzgerald's other novels, this one is definitely not a must read. The plot drags along wearily at places, settings and places are not always well captured (Fitzgerald's sketch of the Riviera life does not really convince me), characters are weakly drawn, undecisive, some caricatures. The life of the main protagonists of the story does not offer enough interest in order to keep the reader interested in them for such a long novel. Except maybe you are specifically interested in psychiatrist maladies. It is neither a tragedy nor a humorous book nor just a tantalizing story, but an unsuccessful mixture of all three. Read The Great Gatsby to get the best of Fitzgerald. The book spent three years on my shelf after being bought and having read the first 30 something pages, and justly so."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I am not a big fan of F.Scott Fitzgerald's, but I do believe he had genuine talent. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald's talent is sorely lacking in this novel, Tender is the Night. The characters are neither attractive or entirely believeable, and the jerky transitions from scenes and time frames are exhausting to follow. I regret to agree 100% with Hemmingway's scathing review of this novel. Fitzgerald fans should check out the movie version of Tender is the Night starring Jennifer Jones and Jason Robards to appreciate what Fitzgerald may have been aiming for in his novel of love and the unintentioned consequences of a mismatched couple."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Some of my all-time favorite literary quotes and passages come from this work. If you love the works of the early 20th century, there is no reason why you wouldn't read this book and have it included with your adventure. You'll love it from beginning to end and eventually fall in love with F. Scott Fitzgerald himself. Be warned - haha."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I can only tell you that I have been reading books my entire life and this is the only one that made me cry. It is simply amazing!!! This is what fine literature is all about!!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I first read this novel 25 years ago. Its brilliant use of our language made me want to become a writer. Now, that is my profession. And each time I read TENDER IS THE NIGHT again, I am stunned by its beauty; and my early aspiration to be as fine a writer as Fitzgerald is renewed."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I read &quot;Gatsby&quot; and was awed by Fitzgerald's ability to both describe the 1920's and to draw his readers into that postwar period. His characters felt real to me. So, I couldn't wait to read Tender is the Night. &quot;Tender&quot; seems to reveal more about Fitzgerald personal pain than anything else. His novel elaborately blames Nicole for Dick's emotional decay. To me, this story line just doesn't bear close scrutiny. Dick's behavior is controlling,habitually deceitful and at times misogynistic. Time after time Dick control's Nicole's actions and refuses to allow her to even discuss her viewpoint. Nicole's behavior is unbalanced but is it schizophrenic?It's very revealing that a 28 year old man would fall in love with a 16 year old girl. Later, when Nicole has grown up a bit, Dick falls in and out of love with Rosemary, a very child-like 18 year old.Granted, women's rights were along way off in 1925 the year Fitzgerald began writing Tender is the Night, but Dick seems more in charge of Nicole's life than seems warranted by either the prevailing culture or by Nicole's illness.I'd say that Fitzgerald unconsciously revealed his own role in his decaying marriage and like most folks tried to point the finger elsewhere."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"If You read Kerouac and Steinbeck, You can find here the roots of all that excitment."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I found the book rather difficult to rea"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The prose is ridicilously florid and at times downright bad...The characters are idealized versions of the flights of melancholy...But the story...the sheer bravado of it's telling...is enough to almost overlook, the numerous, almost stupendous flaws of the book.Fitzgerald was not a great talent...let's get this out of the way up front...however, there is something of the sublime running through this absolute carnival of ridiculous events and even more ridiculous people. There is something almost holy about something this sure of it's own importance.It reminds me a little of Von Trier's work, in it's absolute, go-for-broke, intensity to the point of nonsense; however, like Von Trier, Fitzgerald, slams on the gas when the book goes out of control and in his pursuit of utter craziness almost reaches something transcendental. I suspect this is what makes this absolute train-wreck of a novel of interest to people. And it's certainly why I stuck through with it. There is something magical here..."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The book was in okay condition -- but the spine of the book was very dry and as I read it the book literally fell apart. The book itself was very good. The plot was compelling, the characters detailed and the readability excellent.I could see the influence of filmmaking on Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Written with difficulty over a period of nine years, 'Tender Is The Night' (1934), the last novel F. Scott Fitzgerald published during his lifetime, was something of a critical and commercial failure upon its release at the height of the Depression. Though it has had many prominent public admirers over the decades, the book is a dull, strained, and rambling failure concerned with transparent, narcissistic characters, who, in a later era, might have comfortably stepped out of any of Sidney Sheldon' novels.'Tender Is The Night' is sadly shorn of the maniacal spontaneity of initial Fitzgerald novel 'This Side of Paradise' (1920) and the depth that the first person narrative provided in 'The Great Gatsby' (1925). Though the peripheral characters find protagonists Dr. Dick Diver and his wife, Nicole, to be dazzling, irresistible, and dynamic, on the page they are so blandly drawn that each is barely discernable from the rest of the equally nondescript cast. Diver, who is supposed to be a reputable psychiatrist, simply appears like a slightly more dapper cad among cads, and something of a fool.The lives of these affluent men and women seem empty indeed; when not flattering one another or merrily drawing a firm line of exclusivity between themselves and the rest of humanity, the characters amuse themselves by making cutting and sardonic remarks about the hoi polloi. Shallow good manners, rather than substantive values, fuel their lives. The extroverted Dick and Nicole Diver are initially portrayed as compulsive socializers who are locked into their public personas, which fit them as snugly as straight jackets; left alone together, the silence is deafening and the minutes yawn. As if suffering an ethical failure, Fitzgerald appears to hold his unlikable characters and their lifestyles in high esteem, a factor that finally damns the book completely, since the collapse of Diver's sunlit house of cards is meant to represent a poignant tragedy.Though some scholars believe that struggling Depression audiences simply weren't capable of focusing on a novel about the lives of the wealthy, the more probable reason is that the book is unenjoyable and feels concocted and self conscious at every turn. And with good reason: during the period in which the book was written, Fitzgerald continually rearranged the novel's plot, theme, and focus as his own life became increasingly troubled and unsettled. This uneven patchwork approach is evident in both large and small ways, such as when naive but poised Hollywood ingenue Rosemary leaves a party and is inexplicably \\"shaken with audibly painful sobs,\\" though four short, uneventful paragraphs later on the same page, Fitzgerald writes, \\"it was time for Rosemary to cry,\\" apparently forgetting that Rosemary is crying already. Throughout Book One, Fitzgerald moves haphazardly from vaguely-conceived scene to scene, overwriting but still failing to include the essential, and thus allowing what little credible plot there is to evaporate like a mirage. Contrived set pieces involving a duel, a railway shooting, and a murder in a hotel--none of which add anything pertinent the plot--suggest that Fitzgerald simply didn't know how to proceed or express what he wanted to say.Throughout Book One, the omnipresent narrator's point of view, like the characters whose story he relates, is pretentious and smugly inauthentic; Abe North's mouth, for example, is characterized in terms of its \\"inability to endure boredom,\\" while in another scene, the group, eyeing the casual behavior of strangers, discusses the reasons why Diver \\"is the only sober man\\" in the world capable of \\"repose,\\" a quality they apparently hold in inestimable regard. When Diver is briefly accosted by a strange man while waiting on a Paris street corner, rather than state this plainly, Fitzgerald writes, \\"After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he became suddenly involved in a human contact.\\" Though a discernable plot remains elusive and the characters are ghostly and insubstantial, Fitzgerald repeatedly focuses on the extraneous: when Diver scribbles out a check drawn from questionable funds, Fitzgerald writes, \\"As he wrote he engrossed himself in the material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing laboriously upon the high glass-topped desk.\\"The more prosaically written Book Two reveals that Fitzgerald had little genuine insight or hard knowledge about psychology, despite references to Freud, Jung, Bleuler, and Adler, though he continues to offer poorly expressed pseudo-philosophical insights such as \\"He knew, though, that the price of his intactness was incompleteness.\\" Not only does Fitzgerald make the common mistake of identifying schizophrenia as \\"split personality,\\" but the closest the author comes in attempting to describe mental illness is \\"a cousin happened upon her mad and gone.\\" As if hoping to correct the structural errors of the first section, Book Two compresses so much explicit activity in its pages that events degenerate into a series of convenient and unbelievable coincidences. There are passages of unintentional hilarity, such as \\"He was beaten to death in a speakeasy in New York. He just managed to crawl home to the Racquet Club to die,\\" suggesting that even on the very lip of perdition, Fitzgerald's diehard characters are snobs to the end.With 'Tender Is The Night,' Fitzgerald played an ostensibly clever, dangerous, and deceptive game. The omnipresent narrator's point of view in Book One is clearly colored by Rosemary's naive and idealized perception of the Divers, thus making the objective truth about the couple impossible to ascertain. Book Two, which adopts an entirely more factual tone, then peels away the false glamour and purports to reveal the rot beneath the shimmering surface. But Rosemary's presence doesn't explain Book One's narrative pretensions or the manner in which Fitzgerald has misled the reader in an attempt to produce what he calculates will later become a tragically ironic effect. But since the lives the Divers appear to lead in Book One is spurious at best, Fitzgerald's gambit falls flat."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"When I critique a literary work, I often consider the same elements that any other critic may: plot, theme, diction, style, etc. However, it is a rare occurrence when someone reads a story to which he/she can absolutely relate. After all, literature is best at providing a person with a way in which to be entertained, yet learn something about him/herself. In my case, I read Tender Is The Night during a period when I was breaking up with my girlfriend. If it were not for this situation, I would not have appreciated this work, but due to my circumstances, I became especially interested. I found that I could relate to many of Dick Diver's emotions, while at the same time I realized the genius with which Fitzgerald writes this novel. I knew that a person could learn a lot about him/herself through reading since literature can act as a mirror which people can see themselves, but I never knew that reading could create such an intimate experience that would hit me so close to home. Nevertheless, this book is one of the greatest literary works that I have ever read, and I would suggest that this would be a great novel for anyone who enjoys tragic human behavior."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The renowned success of The Great Gatsby (also an exceptional book) often overshadows the brilliance of Tender is the Night. The later being Fitzgerald's semi-autobiographical masterpiece that gives the reader a glimpse into the writer's frame of mind and personal struggles. &quot;Tender&quot; is a true testament to the author's talent and arguably is his most important literary effort.Dick Diver is a young psychiatrist; a follower of Freud and Jung who is working his way up in the field of mental health medicine. He is intelligent, handsome, altruistic, and an overachiever. Dick falls in love and marries the beautiful, wealthy Nicole Warren who also happens to be his patient. Dick and Nicole start out living the high life. They travel to exotic locations and mingle with aristocrats. All the while Dick establishes a successful private practice with the help of Nicole's money and becomes a well-respected and sought-after physician. But soon the happy front the Diver's display to the world crumbles. Nicole's mental problems begin to resurface and Dick becomes involved with a young Hollywood starlet. These events trigger a domino of disappointments and downfalls.Anyone who has studied F. Scott Fitzgerald the man will no doubt see that Tender is the Night mirrors his own life with his wife Zelda. Fitzgerald, a perfectionist in his own career worked tirelessly to establish himself. Meanwhile, he and Zelda traveled the globe, attended parties, consumed alcohol, lived extravagantly, and carelessly spent all their money before Zelda slipped into insanity leaving Scott to pick up the scattered pieces of his broken life. The character of Dick Diver grows to become cynical and is left feeling he is a failure. Sadly, six years after the publication of this book, Fitzgerald himself died prematurely believing he was a failure and destined for literary obscurity.It would be impossible for me to do justice in describing the splendor of Fitzgerald's prose. His passages are emotionally sweeping and his words strum along as rhythmically as fine music. If you have time for only one book this year, make a wise choice and consider Tender is the Night."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Sometimes a writer doesn't just capture a place in time, but manages to capture that place for all times. F. Scott Fitzgerald is THE quintessential chronicler of the roaring twenties. Like 'The Great Gatsby', 'Tender is the Night' is about tragedy at the heart of the American dream. The novel delves into his rocky marriage, both of their affairs, the ongoing mental illness of his wife along with his own alcoholism. This semi-autobiographical novel is an intimate portrait of the peak of both of their lives together and what comes after it. His style of writing is so complex yet easy to follow and conveys feelings and emotions with a truly subtle perfection. Some author's voices continue to endure and this book is more proof positive as to why Fitzgerald's does...."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night is a somewhat lengthy, meandering sort of novel. Its facination comes from this very obscurity; a tightly written mystery-murder(The Great Gatsby) it is not. I highly recommend this book for its vivid portrayal of Diver's complexly layered relationships; with Nicole his wife, and with the budding starlet, Rosemary.The author skillfully shuffles in the minor characters as well. FitzGerald's observations about the psychology between women and men /Americans and Europeans is ultra keen. His father's death, Abe North's death, his and Rosemary's quick but temporary liason, the fight with the Police in Rome, the illness of Mr. Warren, his parting with Franz and Kaethe, the antagonism between Baby and himself, the mental and emotional drain of Nicole's affliction, and his drinking... portray the minor tragedies that constitute life.FitzGerald tells his story to us better than any other 20th Century American writer could hope to, and in a lyrical style that keeps the reader spellbound."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"When faced with a classic novel, how do you come to terms with the fact that you don't like it ?At the risk of being labeled boorish and unsophisticated, I'll take the plunge and say it : I didn't like Scott Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night.I'd heard of that novel all my life. Expecting a real treat, I decided that it was time I did something about it. May be I was expecting too much.First disappointment : the style. I know : it's wonderful at times, with moving and enchanting comparisons and metaphors ; flashes of beauty in the night. However, when you stumble across sentences that have to be read two or three times before you can be sure what they mean (and even then...), it spoils your pleasure somewhat.Second disappointment : the plot. It sounds hollow.Third disappointment : the characters. Even more hollow than the plot. Hard to identify with poor little rich girls and boys who have never encountered any real problem, setback or suffering in their lives.Ibsen used to say : \\"The rich know how to have fun, but they don't know how to be happy\\".In Tender is the Night, you wonder if they even know how to have fun."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"At the opening of Tender Is the Night, the reader encounters Dr. Dick Diver on the French Riviera, surrounded by fashionable and wealthy admirers. Diver is terribly attractive and charismatic, but there are signs of trouble. Some type of scene at the Diver's home - we don't know what - leads to a duel, and the Divers decamp for Paris. There, Diver enters into a serious flirtation with a young actress, and the instability of his wife, Nicole, is revealed. Diver's father dies, and this loss seems to loosen some restraint in him. He begins a long debauch and ultimately he is diminished while Nicole is strengthened.This book explores some themes found in other Fitzgerald novels. Most prominently, it examines the need for people who are superficially attractive and intelligent - people who \\"have it all\\" - to base their lives on something more substantial than the approval of others. It examines the role that alcohol can play in a personal collapse. And it examines the nature of emotional damage:\\"One writes of scars healed, a loose parallel to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing in the life of an individual. There are open wounds, shrunk sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still. The marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger, or of the sight of an eye. We may not miss them, either, for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to be done about it.\\"This is a sad book, but it is beautifully written and the settings - in Switzerland and France between the two world wars - add interest."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"While I am glad I read this book, it left me with a nagging feeling of dissatisfaction. What I liked most was the author's ability to convey, usually brilliantly, a sense of the locations where the action took place, of the ex-pat social scene in the 20's, and of certain specific incidents in the plot. However, I had problems accepting much of the dialogue, which struck me throughout the book as being not only thoroughly dated but, I suspect, as having probably rung false even at the time of publication. Nor did I fully buy the portrayal and development of the main characters (except perhaps of Rosemary Hoyt). Nicole's mental illness was impenetrable all the way up to its sudden cure, and Dick Diver's &quot;degeneration&quot; occurs without any understandable impetus. Maybe that is how it is in real life, but it was not inspiring reading. At the end, what did I get from this book? - a vaguely depressing and, finally, rather forgettable story but some lingering pleasure from the beautiful descriptive passages portraying the Riviera and Switzerland during that era. I would suggest that anybody who reads this book also try &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and see which they prefer...."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Why does Nicole and Dick's marriage disintigrate? The obvious answer is that Dick compromised his integrity marrying Nicole for her money and that Dick is an egomaniac, needing to be needed.The deeper more true answer is that Nicole and Dick didn't have a partnership. She was sick and couldn't give very much back to Dick--to the relationship. And it gets tiring or boring always doing the same things for the same person to save them from themselves over and over again. Co-dependent relationships don't work.Although a lot of the discussions about mental illness are extremely dated, some of the descriptions are painfully accurate. I identified with Nicole's sister who could only stop worrying about Nicole if: 1) Nicole married a Doctor to take care of her, and 2) if Niole lived near a sanitarium.This is what it is like to have a loved one who is mentally ill:\\"It was necessary to treat her [Nicole] with active, affirmative insistence, keeping the road to reality always open, making the road to escape harder going. But the brillance, the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of water seeping through and over and around a dike. It requires the united front of many people to work against it\\".Too bad there are no organized ways of providing an organized front in our culture to help the mentally ill.Perhaps Fitzgerald (FSF) would have swapped his well being for Zelda's--a prayer, \\"Lord, take my sanity but give Zelda back hers. Unlike Nicole, Zelda didn't get better.I loved the description of the Rivera and Switzerland in the 1920s. I wish i could have been a part of it. The first part of the book is like watching the movie \\"To Catch a Thief\\" with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. You just love the ambience.I liked this book better than _The Great Gatsby_ because I cared more about the characters and because it is autobiographical, and because I have had a loved one who is mentally ill."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"If anyone ever paid close attention to the old literary dictum, \\"write what you know\\", it must have been F. Scott Fitzgerald. His novels bear a striking resemblance to his own life. TENDER IS THE NIGHT does not qualify as an exception---it contains alcoholism, mental illness, and the post WW I, Jazz Age American youth scene in Europe; the Riviera, Paris, Switzerland, and Italy, central themes in the legend of Fitzgerald himself. Not having read or heard much about this novel beforehand, at first I felt I was reading a second-rate \\"Hangin' with the Homies over There in Frantz\\" or maybe \\"Rosemary Crashes the In-Crowd\\". As the novel unfolded, though, I began to appreciate its wider vision and deeper concerns. By the end, I felt that here was another chapter of the Great American Novel, a single version of which may never exist and maybe cannot possibly exist, but which may be perceived as several books that comprise the Great American Story when taken as one. If the rise from poverty to wealth and power is one strand of the \`American story', then surely the descent from wealth and respectability to the lower depths is another. While Dick Diver's crash is not as complete as Hurstwood's in \\"Sister Carrie\\", he certainly winds up expelled from the Promised Land, [barred from his former social world] practicing medicine in ever smaller New York towns, his European days of glory long disappeared.Fitzgerald is able to paint a slowly-revealed picture of talent and wit being worn down and defeated. The forces that accomplish this are subtle and not easily named. Dick, the rising young star of psychoanalysis, marries a beautiful patient who suffers from childhood abuse by her own father. She is extremely wealthy to boot. Together they form the core of a shining group of wealthy but rather aimless expatriates in those halcyon days of the dollar after World War I. Great things are expected from Dick, but ever-increasing alcohol and dissipation rob him of his career. He pours his energy into caring for and curing Nicole, his wife. Slowly, dependence on her wealth, living the life of a sybarite, and his decreasing attention to work turn the tables. She becomes the strong one; he begins to decline, has inconclusive affairs, ends up losing everything including Nicole. The sense of loss is palpable. \\"Her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd.\\" A number of interesting minor characters and excellent description of life at that time, in those places, of that class, bring the novel to an extremely high level, along with Fitzgerald's mastery of dialogue that reflects the times perfectly. TENDER IS THE NIGHT is not only a great novel, it is an unforgettable portrait of an era that has completely vanished, yet which, with the help of movies, we still feel almost able to touch."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I liked this better than The Great Gatsby. There's more going on here. Fitzgerald touches on the demons of mental illness and infidelity and alcoholism that he struggled with in his own life and marriage. The Divers and their friends are complicated people living through long periods of promise, disappointment, and change in this book, in a way that feels very contemporary almost 100 years later. Plenty of re-read value."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I really like this author and he has an unmatched ability for subtle description, his works are definitely must reads."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Comparisons between Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night and The Great Gatsby are inevitable. Both are viewed as his most complete artistic visions; and both are in the enviable position of being on the Modern Libraries list of the 100 best pieces of fiction of the twentieth century.Gatsby is gorgeously written, and the language is expressive, nuanced, and multi-leveled. One can read and re-read Gatsby and find new things with each reading. A better definition of a classic I cannot find. Gatsby is also a radically economical novel. Coming in at just 50,000 words, it is nearly a novella. A short book, it seems long due to its reputation and genius. But in the end, it is petite, and Fitzgerald had to work within the confines of this short narrative structure.Not so with Tender is the Night. At 108,000 words, the novel allows Fitzgerald to sprawl; in the course of the novel, we see far less compressed development of the characters than in Gatsby. There are far more graphic representations of scene, the flow of time, and the outcome of events. Tender shows the reader how good Fitzgerald could be in a longer form. He stretches his wings, and the results are astonishing. It is a moving and tragic novel of love and life gone astray.Even with some of the novel's problems (does the text really give us enough of Nichole's insanity? Is Dick Diver's descent given enough grounding) Tender is the perfect accompaniment to Gatsby and Gatsby to Tender. For writers, it shows that if lighting does not exactly strike twice, similar results can be produced by and expressed by the same electric charge."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"A very powerful work of fiction , but still close to reality .Fitzgerald was a master story teller .Between \\"Tender is the night\\" and \\"The Great Gatsby\\" ,it is difficult to decide which one I like more .Both are masterpieces.I quote Sam Taylor-Wood:\\"It is one of those books that you read and feel a shift... the story is told so poetically and eloquently. It is one of those books that you read and think: if I could only remember that sentence -- it is so beautiful.\\"If there is one book to be read in this year,it is this .Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Perfect? So very close.Occasionally, the story lags a bit and parts are unbelievable (this is fiction, however) but I love the book regardless.The author can say so much and so vividly that the rest of us just don't use with such fluidity and grace. Jaded, heartfelt too, I can't help but recall that as Fitzgerald wrote about a beautiful crazy wife his own beloved was facing a similar fate. It shows. A stunning book. I love it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Great book, fluid, insightful, detailed, gripping and haunting. I read the Great Gatsby year's ago, which I liked, but this also is a classic that may be better than Gatsby. Excellent description of life in post WW1 Europe amongst the exceedingly rich, but not too detached from the reality of the environment and times to be like an episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. There is history, psychiatry, art , leisure and seriousness woven throughout. I'm struck anew by Fitzgerald's smooth prose and uncanny ablity to sum and summarize people and places so creatively."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I really like Fitzgerald, so my review may be a little biased. This is a hauntingly beautiful story about how relationships can change people, for better or worse. Fitzgerald, as always, writes with breathtaking lyricism. If you've read Gatsby, and you liked the writing, you'll probably like Tender is the night. It's darker and more mature. When I read this book, I'd find myself re-reading passages just to wallow in the luxuriant beauty of Fitzgerald's prose.On the other hand, the novel isn't as facile as some of Fitzgerald's other works. It drags in places, and the lyricism can sometimes distract from plot and character development. It's certainly less \\"perfect\\" than Gatsby. I think it's more human. You may get bored from time to time, but I think the book is worth the occasional slow patch. I certainly don't regret reading it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"The novel tells the story of the Nicole and Dick Diver, a wealthy, American couple living in Europe in the early 20th century. As the story opens they are introduced to a young movie actress, Rosemary, who is infatuated with Dick and with the lifestyle the Divers and their friends enjoy. Slowly Rosemary, and the reader, watches the Divers' marriage disintegrate, and Dick, in particular, descend into alcoholic despair.There is no question that Fitzgerald could write brilliantly. It is a complex and thought-provoking look at human failing, at fear and weakness, and at self-destruction. However, I could not stand any of the characters, and really did not care what happened to them. Maybe it's his focus on this very hedonistic lifestyle. This is not the first work by Fitzgerald I've read and I've had a similar reaction in the past. I've also read books by other authors who shone a bright light on a wealthy class - Edith Wharton for example - without feeling that same disconnection with their characters or complete distaste for their lifestyle. I give it 4 stars based on the strength of Fitzgerald's writing; it is full of exquisitely crafted passages which simply took my breath away.Trevor White does a wonderful job of performing the audio book. His pacing and voice inflection breathed life into the characters."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This is really more of a 4-and-half-star review. First off, of course, it's Fitzgerald's lyric writing that makes this and his other works stand out. I loved The Great Gatsby, but I hadn't heard as many terrific things about this book as Gatsby going in, and maybe that colored my overall impressions (but in a good way), because I came away liking the book more than I expected. It's a fine novel, and works as both a touching romance and a lovely piece of literature. It feels deeper than most of Fitzgerald's novels and stories (I love many of his short stories), and the time jumps in the book, though a bit jarring in a way, made the work fresher and more intriguing to me. I think the book is certainly (partly because of this chronological leap-frogging) one of his most ambitious works. And there's a certain power to it from using this structure that resonates long after you put the book down. If you're new to Fitzgerald, I'd maybe recommend \\"Six Tales of the Jazz Age\\" or Gatsby before diving into this one. The rewards might be more substantial as a result. Just the same, it is a well-crafted, thoughtful novel from a bygone age. Overall, a good read."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender Is the Night by legendary author F. Scott Fitzgerald chronicles the tragic fall from grace of Dick Diver, a brilliant American psychiatrist. Through most of the book's angst laden narrative, Dr. Diver has only one patient, Nicole Diver, his wealthy and beautiful wife.The reader's introduction to the Divers is through the eyes of Rosemary Hoyt, an 18 year old silent screen starlet, as she meets the Divers and their entourage on the French Riviera. Rosemary falls madly in love with the charismatic doctor whose supremely confident demeanor makes him the focus of attention wherever he goes. As the story slowly unfolds, Rosemary is relegated to minor character status and Fitzgerald concentrates on describing the relationship between Dick and Nicole.We learn how the two met while Nicole was hospitalized in a Swiss psychiatric facility and how it was they decided to marry. Nicole's wealth allows them to live like royalty as they make Europe their playground. But eventually Dick succumbs to alcoholism and his career and marriage suffer as a result.Tender Is the Night had special meaning for F. Scott Fitzgerald, who reportedly worked on it over a 9 year period from 1925 to 1934. His wife, Zelda, was a diagnosed schizophrenic who was no stranger to Swiss psychiatric hospitals and Fitzgerald himself battled alcoholism. Unfortunately, whatever deep meaning the author intended this novel to convey is not at all apparent. Most readers will see this book as a disjointed collection of curious anecdotes about spoiled rich people.Reading Tender Is the Night in its entirety is a tough slog. I'm not sure the story it has to tell justifies the effort."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues. Lots of drinking and gossip."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald's most aggravatingly uneven novel is thinly disguised justification for the way he treated Zelda, the novelist's beautiful and multi-talented wife.In reality, Scott had her committed to a mental hospital where she was effectively beaten down into a very lifeless and sorry state, her glow and drive vanished. Tender is the Night paints a creepily pretty picture of a handsome, brilliant, young psychiatrist two-timing on his beautiful and flawed heiress wife.It's just a rough read when you know what really happened between the two.I regret my time spent on it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"It's an utter failure. Because it's a character study without the slightest trace of characterological depth. Dick & Nicole remain dead on the page all the way thru. And please don't give me any crap about how Dick & Nicole were \\"deliberately written as ciphers in order to reveal their emptiness\\" because I'm not buying it. I certainly don't think that it was Fitzgerald's intention to render them as ciphers. But that's about the extent of his accomplishment here."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Because Tender is the Night is a novel without any central conflict (such as the well-known story of Forest Gump), I didn't find it to have any real point. There was no central theme to tie it all together and teach something about life. The imagery and detail was phenomenal, and every aspiring author should aspire to his level of diction, but the plot left something to be desired.First of all the characters' morality is certainly lacking. Dick has an affair with a budding young actress (Rosemary), has a drinking problem, doesn't care about his children, and seems out to insult everyone he comes across. Nicole has a history of mental illness, which resulted from incest with her father, cares nothing for her children, creates a plenitude of problems for her husband, and eventually has an affair with Tommy Barban - who she later marries after divorcing Dick.Second, Dick and Nicole Diver seem to live in a fantasy world where money is never lacking, they can always stay in the poshest hotels, and mingle with the elite of American society abroad. Everyone seems to know the Divers, and have an opinion of them. Even the Great Depression seems not to have fazed them even though much of Nicole's family money was invested in America. The only conflicts they have are with each other. This results in a distance from the rest of the world and a profound internalization of conflict.Not only are the main characters morally bankrupt, the entire world is as well. As Dick and Nicole travel they come in contact with murderers, the violent, the intensely selfish, the alcoholics, and the insane of two continents. There is no \`guiding light,' no \`shining example' to reveal their decay by contrast.Lastly, there is no concrete conclusion and readers are left hanging, waiting for closure. I felt vaguely dissatisfied for several days after finishing this book because there was no resolution of conflict.While the characters are astoundingly complex and realistic, they are set into an improbable world and dubious plot twists. Fitzgerald has a phenomenal ability to transport readers to the worlds in his books, but, unfortunately, the world in this novel is not one that most would care to visit."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I had been reading Hemingway and thought I might as well read Fitzgerald. Oh dear. What a waste of time. I read 3/4 of the book and threw it in the dump. I fully agree with another reviewer.

Although escaping the horrendous casualty lists of the European nations, Americans aped Continental disillusionment with their own, anaemic version, of it. Retaining greater resources, America's wealthy survivors returned to Europe, filled with cynicism and indifference. Few books have caught the attitudes of interwar Americans as vividly as this one. It is a Judas kiss in depicting America's social values of the time. Few could enjoy the life he describes, yet all aspired to it. Fitzgerald caught and portrayed the segment of that society most people seem to remember. It's a limited view, but tightly focussed.Richard Diver, married to what was then termed a &quot;neurotic&quot; woman, encounters a young movie star. Films were still silent and actresses were chosen for their physical appeal. Rosemary, although still a teen-ager, fills the image perfectly. Immature, notorious and vivacious, she sets her sights on Diver. Encouraged by her mother, although the motivation for this remains unclear, Rosemary applies her wiles on a man twice her age.As the two encounter, separate and meet again, they interact with members of the expatriate community in France. Fitzgerald portrays most of them through the couple's viewpoint. The depictions are compelling and evocative, but there isn't an appealling one in the lot. Diver's role in the new [then] Freudian psychology gives Fitzgerald a mechanism for exploring the human psyche. The dismemberment of Freud's analysis by modern studies doesn't detract from Fitzgerald's descriptive prowess. Even from this distance in time he's remains a writer to turn to and reflect on. He's deservedly acclaimed as one of the &quot;greats&quot; of the twenties.[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"After finishing this book I was reminded of a beautiful grand house - if you take it in its entirety, you can't help but admire it. Within, there may be some rooms that leave something to be desired, but the overall effect is breathtaking. So it is with this book. Fitzgerald manages to write a story about a relationship that manages to be acerbicand tender at the same time. Like the other traditional inheritor of the \`Great American Novelist' title, Hemmingway. Fitzgerald combines a genius for writing wonderful character insights with great \`background painting' - some of his descriptions of settings are truly masterpieces. Even the \`extras' - they don't have anything to do with the story so it is hard to call them characters - get wonderfully drawn descriptions. I feel that this book truly captures its age and place.And the added bonus - this is a wonderful insight into a relationship built on the worst of foundations slowly but surely heading to its end, told to us from various viewpoints. I don't know much about Fitzgerald's life, but if this is semi-autobiographical as literary critics say, you have to feel sorry for all that were involved in the real life events. Dick and Nicole are really caricatures of the Americans of their generation that lived the high life in Europe, and yet could never quite put their finger on what is was that they were actually meant to be doing."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald's fiction about the rich is written from the vantage point of one who is romantically, maybe neurotically, obsessed with them and articulates it so well. His writing, pulsating with the restless and reckless rhythms of the Jazz Age, finds its strength in empathy, its uncanny ability to describe emotions with clever, original metaphors. You find yourself pitying the problems of these perfectly created characters, but you'd still like to be one of them.&quot;Tender is the Night&quot; turns our attention to several American expatriates who live, work, and play in the French Riviera and various fashionable locations around Europe in the 1920's. At the center of the novel are an affluent young couple, Dick and Nicole Diver, whose marriage has been built on a shaky foundation. Dick is a prominent psychiatrist of modest means who met Nicole when she was a patient under his care in a Swiss sanitarium. Diagnosed as a schizophrenic, Nicole is still dangerously capricious and fragile. She is the daughter of a fabulously wealthy American man with a dirty secret, and she has a frigid, highly protective older sister called Baby who attempts to be the stabilizing factor in the Divers' lives. Dick and Nicole have two children whose infrequent mention is indicative of their relatively low level of love for them.One day on the beach at the Riviera, a young American movie actress named Rosemary Hoyt almost literally swims into the Divers' lives and quickly falls in love with Dick. Her mother encourages the affair, thinking Rosemary needs such risque life experiences to stimulate her passion. Nicole also has an extramarital affair with a magnetic playboy named Tommy Barban. By the end of the book, it is disheartening to see that Dick has to pay the price for both of their infidelities and Nicole, although &quot;cured&quot; to the point that she no longer needs his help, is still spoiled and frivolous. (That the rich can render themselves impervious to misfortunes and go on with their carefree lives, leaving the less fortunate to pick up the pieces, was also a major theme in &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;)The scenes play out against a picturesque European backdrop populated by a host of interesting characters, including the flighty Abe and Mary North, the awkward McKiscos, the haughty Lady Caroline Sibley-Biers, who gets her comeuppance most satisfactorily, and Collis Clay, a likeable collegiate fellow who hangs around Rosemary and seems to have wandered way outside his cultural element.This novel, the last Fitzgerald completed, reinforces his position as perhaps the greatest American prose stylist. His writing is like literary ambrosia; it bathes the tired, gray world in vibrant color and leaves it basking in a rosy hue. The experience of reading it is similar to that of listening to the most brilliant, sublime music ever composed or eating the most delicious food ever prepared -- something to be savored once in a long while if only to remind ourselves how good things can be."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I've read Tender is the Night a few times and every time I do I'm struck by how sad it is.

But his meeting with the ethereal Nicole proves to be the one thing that could take it all away from him. Nicole is unlike other women he has met. She's willing to convey her deepest and darkest thoughts to him. She cares little about the current fashions. She worries about him when he's not around. Basically, she's everything he could have ever dreamed of. But the circumstances of their meeting aren't exactly perfect. Nicole is not some random women he has met out on the street. Quite the opposite, in fact. Nicole is a resident at a mental health facility. The victim of Dissociative Identity Disorder (a.k.a. split personality). While she is loaded with money, the poor thing has fallen victim to DID after an indiscretion with her father - something she has buried in the back of her mind. While Dick is not Nicole's personal Psychiatrist, he can't help but feel that, by becoming romantically involved with her, he may risk her completely losing her mind; or him losing his license to practice. But he marries her nonetheless.As a couple, Dick and Nicole Diver are wealthy and fabulous. People are drawn to them like moths to a flame, and shower them with love, attention, and affection at just the mention of their names. They are glamorous and respected by all. Even the young Rosemary, a screen actress who has the world at her fingertips. Rosemary is quickly drawn into the world of the Diver's, and finds herself falling in love with Dick, and he with her. But Dick is not one to place Nicole's mental health on the line, and must work to control himself when around Rosemary - which proves harder than he ever expected. Between shopping sprees on the French Riviera, and glitzy dinners at the most wonderful restaurants, Nicole and Rosemary become better and better friends; of course, this is at the risk of damaging Nicole even more than she already is. And if Dick is not careful, he may find himself lonely once more, if Nicole is driven into the dark depths of madness.I read THE GREAT GATSBY quite a few years ago, and have always counted it as one of my favorite novels. Now, however, TENDER IS THE NIGHT has also garnered a spot on that particular list. Perhaps it is the fact that I am a Psychology student; or because I love tales full of romanticism and riches, but F. Scott Fitzgerald's TENDER IS THE NIGHT spoke to me in more ways than one, and truly gave me a glimpse inside the lives of a wealthy socialite and her husband/Psychiatrist. Nicole is such an elegant character whose frequent trips into madness are riveting, and impossible to tear your eyes away from; while Dick's constant philandering, yet extreme passion for his wife is hard to ignore, and makes the reader sympathize with and adore him, yet, at the same time, loathe him. Together they are a couple full of power and popularity who stay on your mind long after the last page is turned. Fitzgerald has an uncanny ability of glamorizing anything and everything - from mental illness to starlets and everything in-between. His descriptive language, and impossible to ignore characters are poetic and lovely; while the undertones conveyed within TENDER IS THE NIGHT are somber and tragic. Another winner from Fitzgerald!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender Is the Night is uncomfortably autobiographical, written after Fitzgerald's wife, Zelda, was institutionalized. Though it begins with the story of Rosemary, an actress on vacation, hopelessly attracted to Dick Diver, a married man and successful psychiatrist, the story changes, without transtition, to focus on Dick and his wife's unsettling past. Rosemary fades almost completely out of the story while Fitzgerald, vicariously through Dick Diver, explores his coming to (or failure to come to) grips with ageing, his marriage, postwar stress, and the fear that ultimately his promising career would fail. Fitzgerald literally fulfilled his prophecy and never published another novel.As with most Modern American literature, Tender Is the Night is a depressing story. We witness the dissolution of marriage, man, and find the Lost Generation ultimately just that--lost.It's been several years since I read The Great Gatsby, but if memory still serves, Tender Is the Night is more captivating and, in my opinion, the better of the two."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"High flying, fast living F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) attained great commercial and critical fame early in life--and then began a rapid fall into a ferocious alcoholism. In 1925 THE GREAT GATSBY, now regarded as his masterpiece and often described as \\"the great American novel,\\" was published to only mildly enthusiastic reviews and sold poorly; in order to fund the lifestyle to which he had grown accustomed, Fitzgerald set aside his next book length project and turned to short stories and the occasional bout of \\"writing for Hollywood.\\"Although Fitzgerald began to formulate ideas for TENDER IS THE NIGHT as early as 1925, the project was slow to take form and was not published until 1934--by which time it had become a reflection of Fitzgerald's stormy marriage to the equally high flying, fast living Zelda Sayre, who gradually sank into insanity and was permanently institutionalized by the early 1930s. Originally published in serial form in Scribner's Magazine, it received mixed reviews, and when it was published as a novel it did not prove the great commercial success Fitzgerald hoped. It was the last novel he completed before his 1940 death.The story is set in Europe, where the Fitzgeralds themselves lived through much of the 1920s, and begins with Rosemary, a very young woman who has recently jolted to fame and fortune as an actress in silent film. Beautiful but in many respects innocent, Rosemary vacations on the Riviera--where she makes the acquaintance of Dick and Nicole Diver, an incredibly wealthy, exceptionally attractive couple who seem to be the height of all the modern era has to offer. Rosemary quickly subcums to Dick Diver's immeasurable charm and falls in love with him, but Nick is determinedly bound to Nicole, as much from responsibility as love. Nicole's apparent flawlessness is a facade. Dick is a psychiatrist; his wife, Nicole, is also his patient. She is insane.Fitzgerald was often accused of writing about rich and pretty but trivial people. In one sense this is true, but in Fitzgerald's work the shiny surface is precisely that, a false front that the characters present to the world in order to maintain both their social standing and self-image. As the novel moves back and forward in time, we see how Dick has been \\"bought\\" by Nicole's family and how he is repeatedly torn between love for Nicole as a husband and care for her as a patient so that--even as Nicole begins a final recovery--he begins his own destruction, sucked dry by the endless personal and professional compromises required of him. Increasingly dark in tone, TENDER IS THE NIGHT is not so much disillusioning as it is ultimately, painfully nhilistic.Fitzgerald seemed to regard TENDER IS THE NIGHT as both his most personal and his favorite work, and there are few who would not regard it as a masterpiece. Even so, it is very much a flawed masterpiece, occasionally problematic to a point at which it snaps the reader out of the very reality it attempts to create, most often due to Fitzgerald's own authorial self-indulgence. That said, the characters and their situations are not always as convincing as one could wish and the structure of the novel is occasionally muddy. And yet--Even with these glaring issues running throughout the novel, TENDER IS THE NIGHT is the sort of book that you think you will not finish and then suddenly find yourself on the last page. Whereas THE GREAT GATSBY tended to focus on the mask, TENDER IS THE NIGHT focuses on the face beneath it, and the result is uniquely powerful. You care about the Divers and even though you sense their ultimate fate you, like they themselves, fight against it. It has moments of brilliance as powerful and often more so than any other novel of the first half of the 20th Century. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I cannot help think that I started reading one story and ended with another.In book one we muddle through a pleasant world confused at all the characters that seem unnecessary.

This is set in the roaring twenties amidst the hedonistic lifestyles of the aristocracy and you can imagine the times and places perfectly. Told in a deceptively simple style, it has great depth in it's story telling and a way of making you feel as deeply as the characters.

This novel made me feel like I was watching a silent film. I could just see Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. walking along a veranda along the Mediterranean Sea. I could feel the sea breeze and smell the air. What's is more is that I felt like I was there along with the characters as if I were in with their group of devil may care expatriates. I could truly see the strength of the title in the story. I could also see the parallel of Zelda's mental instability in this novel. I loved it and wholly recommend it if you want to feel transported to the early twentieth century or if you just want to know that even the rich have problems too."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"An entertaining and illustrative portrayal of a golden time. This is Fitzgerald at his best!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"What a difference the edition makes. The re-ordered sections change the entire pacing. The original version, published in 1934 echews the chronological narrative and packs a different punch. Revised in the early 50s (posthumously), the later version is easier to follow, but loses a bit in the build up.A classic either way - perhaps strong than Gatsby."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This is one of Scott Fitzgerald's masterpieces. Insightful, touching, dramatic. It shows how sometimes helping others and doing the right thing may lead to self-destruction. Just read the book. You'll understand what I mean at the end of it."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Unarguably, Fitzgerald's greatest work will remainThe Great Gatsby. The theme of being unable to escape one's legacy is so universal that it's no surprise the work shows up on so many best-of lists. But another one of his novels, Tender is the Night, also shows up on a number of these lists, and it does so with good reason. While lacking in Gatsby's laser-like focus of message, Tender is the Night still tackles a number of truths beneficial to most who read it.There's a lot going on in this novel. Unlike Gatsby's quick summer of collapse, Tender is the Night follows the agonizingly slow descent of its main character, Dick Diver, which plays out over the years amongst the chronicles of a disreputable group that flits in and out of his and his wife, Nicole's lives. In the beginning, Dick is the man everyone wishes they could be: charismatic, successful, liked by everyone. But as the story progresses, cracks form in the facade of the character. His ignoble beginnings are documented later in the novel, which serve as an excellent foundation for the fall that eventually occurs. Along the way, other themes interject themselves -- loss, innocence, the loss of innocence -- but the one that overwhelms is self-destruction. Dick Diver is the man who has everything, but who eventually destroys it all for some pretty base reasons. In between all these lines, Fitzgerald draws a remarkably clever blueprint for how one should not live their life.If there's one criticism I have of Tender is the Night, it lies in its prose. Maddeningly flowery in too many places, it nonetheless contains innumerable passages that are either quite poignant, amazingly well-crafted, or just damn good. As I read it, I dog-eared for future reference countless pages that contained such lines or paragraphs; to have let such expositions glide in and out of my memory would have been a travesty. I'm certain that metaphors like Nicole's \\"crossing herself reverently\\" with perfume and speeches like Tommy Barban's on ethics will remain with me for years to come. In the end, though, I just wish Fitzgerald had performed some more paring of his manuscript to let these nuggets shine brighter.When all is said and done, I still prefer the brevity and honed essence of The Great Gatsby. Tender is the Night just tries to say too much. But it was Fitzgerald's labor of love, and it shows. For that, it's worth a read and a hearty recommendation."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender Is the Night by F. Scott FitzgeraldThis is a classic novel. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a master story teller who infuses rich dialogue with the magnificent story. Wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I think you need a quiet place and state of mind to really appreciate this book, because it is not only the stories of these characters but the way they are presented...so incredibly tragic, poetic and beautiful. The author did an incredible job in inviting readers into the labyrinth of hope, despair, conflicts, alienation of the characters so intimately. Great book."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night was written over a decade, and it shows. Characters grow, stop, we fast forward, and they change and mature without transition. Tempting is the correlations between Fitzgerald's companionship with mentally unhinged Zelda and Dick Diver's nurturing husband/psychotherapist to Nicole, an heiress and ex-schizoid in occasional relapse who was traumatized by her father at a tender age.Tender is Dick's caressing but scientific approach to loving Nicole. When Rosemary Hoyt, a young starlet-to-be, pursues Dick with all due diligence, Dick loses the cool stability of his marriage experiment for the exciting, verily unscientific, if affected, opportunity to feel something new. Having committed himself to Nicole's love and care despite his better reason, Dick lives with the consequences he signed on to live with. His wife, recovering from her deep, despairing mental illness, sucks the life out of Dick, gaining strength with each drop of vigor he loses, fully aware of his inevitable failure.Tender is the Night, where Fitzgerald starts to show the influence of Hollywood (not incidental, the Rosemary character, ey?) on his narrative composition, feels like a cast of actors playing their roles with converse dramatic irony. Nicole's and Dick's anticipation of the paths they are on, curves, divergences and all, perhaps account for the absence of dramatic tension and suspense in Tender is the Night. It is, instead, a journal of selected scenes catching the moods and musings of a doomed marriage, often striking poignancy at a perfect pitch."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I enjoyed this novel very much, but it's not as good as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; or &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline of Dick Diver and his wife Nicole. It's beautifully written, but I hated the way the book ended~I guess I was hoping for a more positive ending, rather than Nicole and Tommy Barban becoming romantically involved instead remaining with Dick. However, I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald wrote a perfect short novel in Gatsby. I find the more ambitious and longer Tender is the Night disappointing. It is too loose, occasionally rambling, and the overly artful language now seems dated. The storyline is simple- the progress of a marriage from infatuation to its end, and the collapse of the main character. But the book only comes to life in the final fifty pages. Unlike his contemporaries, Proust, Hemingway, Miller etc, Fitzgerald now seems antique. Instead, I would recommend Fiesta- The Sun ALso Rises, or, if the reader has a couple of years on his hands, Remembrances of Times Past. Both cover the essential theme far better."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender Is The Night was a book I found hard to get into in the beginning. I found it boring for me because it was not something that I would prefer to read. The characters in the book where simple minded. The only character I was able to somewhat get a connection with was Dick. He is the psychiatrist of the store. He is the basic, do everything that is expected of you then be on your way, kind of guy. He is also a great guy that makes everybody laugh, and everybody loves him. However, as the book goes on, he goes through this metamorphis phase of his personality; for me that seems more exciting to read than his (goody two shoes) act. His actions made the book a little more interesting. In addition to Dick's performance, two women, Rosemary and Nicole, gave me the reality splash of fighting over a boy that last from generation to generation. Nicole, being the wife of dick, is like the ditzy girl in high school who doesn't know that her boyfriend is a lying geezer. Rosemary, on the other hand, is the girl who you think is your friend ,but ends up stabbing you in the back and steals your boyfriend, yet manages to keep a faade of a smile on her face. I found it amusing to read this about grown women and men in here, acting like teenagers in high school. Now, I am unaware of the literary significance of Tender In The night. I am sure to someone else it would be worthy of a high reward for romantic novels. Its quality of romance and its likely points, it is a highly renowned book that would be good for anyone looking for that. In addition to, when I think about the theme, I think is that love is only as strong as its beholders. Dick keeps telling Rosemary that he loves her and that he loves Nicole as well. While Rosemary keeps telling Dick that she loves him , and Nicole keeps telling Dick that she loves him too. They are all nothing but a bunch of hypocrites. They're swimming around in circles like fish stuck in a tank. They keep saying the three most powerful words , with passion and glorification. Onlt to let it slip through their grasp like a sudsy bar of soap. Hopefully this book will be more of a page turner for you then with me. Let it take you on its voyage of thunderstorms and calm seas. Like I said, it was boring for me."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Where do I begin? Okay, so I finished this book last night and I've been really thinking about it for quite some time; yet, I still have no idea how I really feel about it. The book starts of extremely promising, Book I is utterly brilliant. I was experiencing dejavu, it was comparable to my first reading of The Great Gatsby. His prose are riveting, the man could write about peeling an onion and make it enjoyable to read. His greatest attribute, his prose, could also be, at times, his worst. It seems at times within the novel, much more so than Gatsby, that there are passages, sometimes large chunks, of the novel that can be skimmed over. Tender doesn't really engage you, it doesn't leave a lasting impression besides the confirmation of Fitzgerald's awe-inspiring prose. The plot almost seems irrelevant at times. By creating such imperfections of characters, did Fitzgerald intentionally create an imperfect novel? I find it extremely odd that he said this novel would be his greatest creation, greater than Gatsby. It really leads to me consider that maybe it was intentional. By me even considering the possibility, am I giving him too much credit? Doesn't the mere fact that I've spent hours agonizing over the novel say something about the novel? Maybe I'm not giving him enough credit for writing a thoroughly enjoyable novel. Maybe it's because I compare everything he writes to my unrealistic expectations for him-because of Gatsby. I get the feeling that had I read Tender before Gatsby, I'd probably give it a much more positive review. It's like reading Chabon after Kav & Clay, or Woolf after Mrs.Dalloway, et al., nothing you'll ever read would be sufficient. That being said, my opinion of Fitzgerald as the greatest American author to ever live remains unchanged."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Dick Diver, whom Fitzgerald introduces through the implied point of view of Rosemary, a young Hollywood starlet, resembles the author's more renowned and equally enigmatic creation, Gatsby. Except Dick actually does something we can get a handle on: he's a doctor who knows a few things about psychology, one with a few blind spots about his own makeup. When we begin to see Dick's vulnerabilities, and the Gatsby-like underpining of his backstory, Tender Is the Night takes flight.The same can be said Dick's wife, Nicole, a character drawn from on Fitzgerald's problematic real-life partner, Zelda. A formidable woman, as seen by Rosemary, the young ingenue, Nicole too is psychically fleshed out as the perfect couple begin to flounder. A head case of a different sort than Dick, she is in her own way as enigmatic.The two of them lead the high life on the French Riviera, in Paris and in Switzerland. Money, and the society that takes it for granted, supplies the setting, the travel, the hotel rooms at the Ritz and skiing vacations in Gstaad. But psychology, of course, is another matter. Money won't buy happiness in that realm, which we discover is not quite Dick's sinecure, that in fact he sees himself a kept man as the effect he has on those around him wanes--though his acuity remains intact--and as Nicole begins to assert herself.Tender Is the Night has much in common with its predecessor, This Side of Paradise, as well as Gatsby. In the latter, however, Fitzgerald put it all together, moving beyond the subjective inconsistencies of the privileged class and its assumptions about which he was both acutely aware but as a writer occasionally shorthand. Nevertheless, his struggle to define his protagonists is there in all the books, and makes this one a worthwhile read.Digging Deeper - A Memoir Of The Seventies"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night was a great novel! Many have compared it to The Great Gatsby, however, I would say that this book is much more complex and interesting and differs very much from it. The novel is very descriptive and catches my attention through is vivid explanation of the setting on the Riviera, and Dick and Nicole Diver's home, the Villa Diana. The novel maintains a sense of mystery in the beginning, and allows the reader to grasp a sense of the relationship of Dick and Nicole, and how the perfect appearance of Dick and Nicole masks their true struggles. The novel is a partially autobiographical novel about F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, and this emotional book becomes more and more intriguing until the last page. This book will be interesting to those who enjoy reading about the splendor of the 1920's and the beauty of the Riviera, while still analyzing a very wonderfully complex plot."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Through the narrative, it's clear that Fitzgerald cannot choose which character to develop, and in the end, none is explored satisfactorily. As a panorama of failed marriage, \\"Tender\\" lacks the strength of \\"The Beautiful and Damned\\", which I consider to be similar and superior, though less popular.But still, F. Scott Fitzgerald is F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the writing is wondrous, but this is not his quintessential book.If the absurdist movement is regaining steam in American culture, this explains the resurgence of popularity in this novel, which though strong in the first third, turns out as an unsatisfying mess."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Fitzgerald never grows old, whether I'm revisiting THE GREAT GATSBY or reading another of his novels for the first time, in this instance, TENDER IS THE NIGHT. His ability to deliver on big themes and his use of the elements of imaginative writing--symbolism, character, conflict, setting, dialogue, narrative and plot--improves every time I read him.NIGHT is a rangy novel depicting a time, place and its people: the expatriot (\\"Europeanized\\") Americans who habituated Europe after World War I, trying to come to grips with the turbulent speed of modernity and an escalating sense that life has lost meaning. Fitzgerald's community clings to exclusive French beaches and cliff-top villas, spinning around its own royalty, Dick and Nicole Divers, whose parties are to die for. This crowd lives for the night when everything is fun and the liquor flows. The bright light of day and what it can reveal is not always so kind. Fitzgerald charges the novel with melodrama and tragedy, but he also gives free reign to the wry wit, pranks and mores of this desperate crowd. Someone else might abridge some of that, but it would be a loss. It is an important statement on the early 20th century American experience and throws the role of the individual into remarkable relief.Charles Scribner III, descendant of the book's original publisher, offers a brief but engaging historical introduction that speaks of Fitzgerald's long commitment to producing this work as Zelda fell deeper into mental illness, his own conviction that it was his best and how his peers reacted to it. It's a non-spoiler of an introduction and should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This book is certainly less popular than Gatsby or This Side of Paradise because it requires the reader to be committed. It does not flow with the same tempo as some of Fitzgerald's other works but it is SO MUCH more &quot;literary&quot;. Tender is the Night, therefore, is only enjoyable when you are reading passionately and allowing yourself to be immersed in all the various messages, patterns, and thematic influences that are constantly being projected by the author. It's like looking at one of those pattern pictures at the mall with the images buried in them-- it hurts your eyes at first, but once you see the image beneath it can be sublime. If there is a flaw to Tender however it is what could be considered as its inconsistency. There are moments reminiscent of the most brilliant elements of Faulkner's characterization, Hemingway's style-- even Gertrude Stein's insight. Unfortunately, these moments don't always coincide with each other. Nevertheless, this is Fitzgerald at his best and a strong recommendation."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night is a very well written and engaging novel. However, it is a far cry from some of Fitzgerald's other works. By no means did it impart the dramatic and profound portrayals of The Great Gatsby, yet it did create a certain amount of sympathy for its leading characters and the lifestyle as a whole. Again, Fitzgerald does what he does best in portraying the lifestyles of the upper-class during the 1920's.I would recommend this book for those interested in the culture of the 1920's and for mere entertainment's sake, but it is not as profound a novel as it could have been."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night is a novel of bourgeoise boredom. The book has a very promising premise - what would happen if a young psychiatrist was to marry his rich and beautiful but unstable patient? Big fat conflict, just like the size of the book might suggest? No dice - an occasional glimpse of genious sinks in a routine and boring ramblings about the characters' life in high society. I was really dissapointed. So I advise everybody to start with the Great Gatsby, I hear it's much better and I know now that Tender is the Night is a bad book."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Now, I have an admission to make. In my own fiction, I tend to get lost in my own little world, fall in love with my language and my parataxis, and subject my reader to little in-jokes that make me laugh. For example, in a recent work of mine, I included a little part about T. S. Eliot's Wasteland. I referenced, what I though to be heavy handedly, the \\"game of chess\\" section, and what I hoped to be more oblique, the \\"death by water\\" part. This was done because I was trying to get across the theme of decay. Ok, so it did not work. I can accept that fact. Maybe I have to be more aware of the audience, or something along those lines. The point here is that my own idiosyncrasies perhaps do not translate well. I have the same problem reading Fitzgerald that I suppose that people have when reading my own work.Alcoholics living out their own malaise in high society do not interest me. I cannot find the characters that Fitzgerald writes about compelling. I find myself disgusted at their self-indulgent and harmful acts. The knowledge that these characters come from real life in the circles that Fitzgerald lived in pushes me over the edge. He obviously had interest in these sorts of people. It cannot be denied that he the prime chronicler of the Jazz Age. Dick, Nicole and their lot are loathsome characters. I first read this book, two years or so ago, and I have to say that I have no desire to revisit it. There are other more pressing things on the schedule, like washing my hair.Fitzgerald got closer to a sympathetic character when he fleshed out Nick in The Great Gatsby. I think this is because he was portraying someone more like himself. Nick was more of an outsider looking in, or in his case, at the other end of the egg. Fitzgerald is able to create someone who you can sympathize with, because Nick somehow comes across as the most human of the characters that I can remember. Nick possesses a certain sense of longing to belong that seems to be indicative of Fitzgerald himself. He appears as an outsider in this expatriate community, or even the riche community of Gatsby.The question I have is, \\"Why is Fitzgerald so attracted to such loathsome characters?\\" He to seems entranced by broken people in circumstances that would seem to be the embodiment of success on some levels. These characters all have a faade that seems smooth and glassy, only you can see the imperfections the closer you get. Dick, Nicole, Rosemary, Abe, Jay, and Nick all have their failings in the realm of fiction. Fitzgerald has his own, and so does Zelda.I have no answers for my own question, and as a reader, I cannot get past this isolation that Fitzgerald uses by focusing on such unsympathetic characters. His writings have long been canonized, and are taught all over, but I have a distance with him that is greater than the one I feel when reading Hemingway."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I tried to read this because it's a standard of the American novel in the 20s. But I could not finish it. The characters are rich, spoiled, glamorous and fascinating to each other. But that's all. Imagine a novel length fantasy written for a Hollywood gossip magazine. That's what you have here.The writing is occasionally striking, but there is nothing in it that I want to read about.I think it was Hemingway who quoted Fitzgerald as saying \\"The rich are different from you and me.\\" Papa's answer: \\"Yeah, they have more money.\\" That sums it up quite well."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"based on what I had read about it, but I did not. There were parts that I liked, passages that are well-written, but overall the writing is stilted and the narrative choppy. There is an air of self-importance in the narrative itself that rivals that of the characters, which has the effect of downplaying their snobbery. There are also a few instances in Book 1 where Fitzgerald felt the need to tell the reader about, even though he had already shown, Rosemary's naivete. I also agree with the reviewers who said that Fitzgerald failed in presenting the psychology of Nicole's illness accurately."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I loved this book, as I do all of Fitzgerald's works, especially \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" You can't go wrong with any of his books.The beauty of this book is that Fitzgerald's elegant prose flows so nicely into the story being told. It is wonderfully written, but not distractinly so. Five stars for a perfect book."},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This book is so deep, I can't describe it in any other way but life changing. It takes the reader deep into human emotions so true to life and touches the heart of the reader with the ability to change one's way of thinking. It is an example of how people can do things to each other without thinking of consequences and the reaction of others to such things. Poses the question, is it worth the history of a relationship to seek out some new and exciting pleasure, and should someone examine the possible emotional outcome before delving into something so quickly?"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night, for me, this book was painful to read. The style in which F. Scott Fitzgerald writes is too descriptive and drawn out for my taste. The messages the book had were pretty deep and sometimes hard for me to spot or understand. After reading the book, I used sparksnotes.com to help me with some of the book's symbolism. Once I understood more of what was going on and what happened, I appreciated the book a little bit more. It was interesting to see the change that the main characters go though, especially Dick Diver. His original intentions were to become a great doctor and cure Nicole, his wife. But he ends up not succeeding and becoming bored with his life. The only way that Nicole is cured is by his downfall. The book was also interesting because of the author wrote it in 3 different sections or books, all with different viewpoints and overlaping stories.In conclusion, this book was hard for me to understand in the beginning, but once I was able to realize what was going on, I enjoyed it more. I didn't like the style of writing or even the subject and theme of the book, but it was worth reading it because it exposed me to a different style of writing and a different type of book that I usually wouldn't read"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"I couldn't get into this book. It was a very hard read and I never finished it. We picked it for our book club and no one finished it!"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"This is infuriating. No book tours to do, no editing, no publicity, nothing. WHY is the even more than some current books?"},{"Title":"Tender Is the Night","review":"Tender is the Night is no Gatsby (though what is), but it is still an important novel. It is more personal than the other of Fitzgerald's work and covers happy days in France through the madness and alcoholism that follows. As great as this novel was, there were some weaknesses. It did seem to get weaker as it went along. Part One is the best, Part Two is weaker and weakens as it goes along. And Part Three is the weakest of all--even Fitzgerald himself admitted that. Still, it is well written and you can see why Fitzgerald is an American classic."},{"Title":"Principles of Tantra, Part 2","review":"Sir John Woodroffe (1865-1936), also known by his pseudonym Arthur Avalon, received his B.C.L.

He provides some really good information on why people believe. Polls taken show that men in general try to justify their beliefs in myths through rational means while women tend to focus on the emotional. Though the analysis was for the most part factual, I could certainly see why women might be offended.The most interesting aspect of the book to me was the evidence regarding men believers. Confronted with evidence that shoots them down, men true believers of all myths have resorted to amazing mental gymnastics to believe what they believe. In this regard I found the book remarkable and useful. Though it seeks to understand believers, in the end it exposes them as the weak, superstitious, intellectual panty-wastes they are."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Michael Shermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, the director of the Skeptics Society, and host of the Skeptics Lecture Series. I don't need to tell you what sort of direction this book is going to take. But even knowing what to expect, this was a fun book, well worth the read!Shermer, noting that 96% of Americans believe in God and 73% believe that angels regular visit earth, asks one question: Why? Why do even 40% of scientists proclaim a belief in God? Why do more people believe in paranormal phenomena now than they did 100 years ago? Why do we believe at all, and why must we seek meaning in higher places? What is our fascination with ghosts and s&eacute;ances? Is belief in God genetically programmed? Some kind of \\"God module\\" in our brains?Mankind is a pattern-seeking animal, whether this talent is used to see the Virgin Mary in patterns of light and shadow or to see meaning within the randomness of coincidental events. Mankind is also a storytelling animal. We love our stories, and our stories do more than describe our reality, they help create our realities. So, as we move from pattern-seeking to storytelling, we naturally journey on to mythmaking. Origin myths abound in various cultures. But the journey of humanity doesn't end there. From mythmaking we jump ahead to morality, from morality to religion, from religion to God. Perhaps we are wired to believe; perhaps there's a certain inevitability in the way the human experience has evolved.Shermer presents a number of studies and interviews as he leads us on this journey. One of the most fascinating studies in Shermer's book compared answers to two questions: \\"Why do you believe in God,\\" and \\"Why do you think other people believe in God?\\" The answers don't jibe. Other people believe in God because they were raised that way, or because it brings them comfort to believe, or because people have a need to believe. But what do people answer as to why they believe? Well, because they've thought it through, of course; the universe is too orderly, or the experiences they've had could only come from God.Shermer's approach is scientific, yet controversial. The conclusions are his own; but I guarantee the book will make you think, and I guarantee you'll enjoy the read."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"As usual, Shermer covers of hodgepodge of related topics in this work as has been his style in previous writings. The subject matter is, in a word--nebulous. God, religion, belief, politically incorrect topics in an age where variety of ideas about these topics abounds. Basically, Shermer puts forth the thesis of an evolutionarily evolved human pattern-seeking system which compels us to find meaning in the endless static. This conceptualization is broad enough to explain the basics of religious though, as well as our ability to be taken advantage of by frauds masquerading as scientists--a subject that Shermer, the high priest of skepticism, is quite familiar with. In the end, the book as a whole is an intriguing read, however it could have been improved with better editing. The middle chapters contain loosely tied together concepts and often get off-topic. However, Shermer makes up for this by writing a brilliant summary (and defense) of Stephen Jay Gould's writings on science and religion in the last chapter.Shermer believes that the question for God in insoluble and therefore sees nothing wrong with religion and belief in the numinous. However, as a skeptic, Shermer, in other writings, espouses the basic tenet that one should believe the simplest scientific explanation for a given phenomenon. From a purely scientific viewpoint, God is unnecessary and therefore a superfluous concept. However, Shermer's willingness to allow for an &quot;expection to the rule&quot; in this instance may be viewed as slightly hypocritical. Nevertheless, while logically inconsistent, I thing Shermer comes to the right conclusion."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"By the time I am writing this review there are already several posted by others.

A couple of interesting moments toward the beginning of the book are Shermer's conversion to Christianity & the problems he encountered afterward & Dr. Laura's issues with the Skeptics Society. I am writing a brief review and giving it 5 stars hoping that other admirers of Shermer's books who have not written a review will post theirs. Shermer deserves more than a 3&1/2 star rating."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Within his framework, Shermer does a good job of making a case for skepticism with respect to religious belief, but the problem is that his framework is remarkably limited, superficial, and oversimplified. In effect, he argues with straw men, so his findings are prone to mislead unwary readers and he does nothing to advance the \\"search for God.\\"There are too many things wrong with Shermer's presentation for me to address them in a review, and I would refer you to books likeScience and Religion: From Conflict to ConversationandThe Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science (Oxford Handbooks in Religion and Theology)for examples of how this topic can be approached in a genuinely informed and intelligent manner. But let me at least give a few general examples of where Shermer goes wrong:(a) His criticism of religion is based on a narrow conception of a personal God in the Abrahamic traditions. He thereby fails to address the diverse range of conceptions of God within these religions (many of which aren't even remotely personal), nor does he address the many metaphysical conceptions outside these religions (where arguably the word \\"God\\" isn't even appropriate).(b) He talks about \\"proofs\\" for the existence of God. Such proofs may have been in vogue centuries ago, but serious people nowadays recognize that the notion of proof is childishly oversimplified when talking about the big questions. Rather, we each need to carefully weigh a large and complex body of evidence and arguments accumulated over a lifetime of experience and contemplation, trying to maintain a balance between skepticism and open-mindedness in the process. This can lead us to lean one way or another in our beliefs, with the option of changing our leaning as our search continues, and without the need to commit dogmatically to a particular belief. Ever heard the word \\"maybe\\"?(c) He declares that the question of existence of some sort of God is insoluble. Really? Does his personal failure in this regard mean no one else can have experiences which represent a genuine connection with the divine? I don't claim to have had such experiences, and I'm well aware that countless such claims have been demonstrably false, but that doesn't mean that no one has had or can have such experiences.(d) Related to the above point, he spends a lot of time giving examples of religious beliefs which were eventually clearly shown to be false. I fully agree that much nonsense has been promulgated in the name of spirituality and religion (as with other spheres of life), but we need to be careful to avoid throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Finding many examples of false beliefs doesn't prove (to use Shermer's word) that all such possible beliefs in this domain are false.(e) I don't think Shermer even begins to do justice to the potential metaphysical implications of science, especially modern physics. Just think about how radical it is to posit matter-energy interconvertibility, relativisation and fusion of space and time into spacetime, quantum indeterminacy, wave-particle duality, quantum entanglement, the quantum measurement problem, and Heisenberg uncertainty (not to mention G&ouml;del's incompletness theorems in the seemingly more pristinely logical realm of pure mathematics). These ideas completely undermine conventional materialism and should at least point us in the direction of considering that reality may be far different from what we normally imagine (or can imagine).Considering these fundamental problems, I was tempted to give this book 2 stars, but in the very end Shermer partly redeems himself by talking more open-mindedly about mystery, soul, spirit, and spirituality, so I'll go with 3 stars. But I still can't recommend this book because it's so flawed, and because there are countless genuinely good books available on this topic."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"In this book, Shirmer shows an astonishing knowledge of skeptical books and writings over the ages, and of recent publications, too. In Appendix 2, he shows excellent knowledge of and use of mathematical statistical analysis as applied to the social sciences.I would highly reccomend reading Shermer's WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS as a prequel to this book.As a skeptic beforehand, I found parts of HOW WE BELIEVE to be rather hard to digest, and even tedious at times. Such is the case of the many pages on mythology, and how it developed in the human race, and how it developed into religion.Sometimes, I guess that I have a taste for simple explanations of things. For example, how did ancient \\"prophets\\" and \\"wise men\\" receive the \\"word of God\\"? I would answer simply that they went out into the wilderness, fasted, and had hallucinations.Shermer (a former Christian like me, who has become an agnostic), never says so directly, but he apparently believes that Jesus and Abraham were real historical characters. I think that the likelihood is high that they were fictious. In other words, and to use the word \\"myth\\" in a different sense than Shermer does, it is likely that Jesus was just as mythological as the other gods from Apollo to Zeus. The same is probably true about the other ancient religious leaders.As an example of how Shermer can be tedious about a topic, consider his several chapters in WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS, where he confronts Holocaust disbelievers. I think that the simpler explanation of these people is words to the effect that \\"they have their heads buried in the sand\\".In HOW WE BELIEVE, I found Shermer's Chapter 10 on \\"Glorious Contingency\\" to be overdone and on shakey ground. I think that as a consequence of the nature of the physical universe, the forces restraining contingency are much stronger than Shermer does. Just how strong, I cannot know. Something that I do know is that one one planet, at least two (not just one) large-brained families of animals evolved. I think that dolphins are just as intelligent as humans, but they cannot have technology where they live.Overall, I give HOW WE BELIEVE three stars, but WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS, five stars."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"I agree that people believe in God with too little evidence.They believe many things without any evidence, and as a result believe in lies. Many of these people are religious fanatics (I include evangelicals and fundamentalists in this group, who believe in the inerrancy of the bible) who cause great damage because they so convinced they are right. However, Shermer himself is more of a fanatic than the tone of the book would suggest--he is a fanatic atheist. This does not detract from the book too much, but you should know it. I heard him on PBS in October 1999... and it is clear that he becomes angry when people profess their faith in God to him. I do not fault him for being an atheist, not at all, but I do fault him for his fanaticism. It should be mentioned that Shermer has a tendency toward fanaticism, in his youth he was a fanatic born-again Christian, Shermer readily admits this. For an alternate view from a more respected source in the skeptic community, read Martin Gardner's wonderful book The Whys of A Philosophical Scrivener, where he discusses (among other things) his belief in God, though he affirms that God is unprovable. What Shermer is missing is the mystical experience of God, the personal experience that cannot be proven but that many people have powerfully, often overwhelmingly experienced, nevertheless. For discussions about that read the classic by William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"The only people it would offend are the people who believe wierd things. Seriously, though, Michael Shermer is an asset to the world. It's is time we let go of mythology an embraced reality. A wonderful first book for anyone who hasn't yet got their feet wet in the Skeptic waters. It contains my favorite picture: inside Noah's ark..the Stagosauras in the next pen kills me.Was the above reviewer worried about offending the holocost deniers? That's like being scared of offending the Klan. Galton had a point."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"I have just been introduced to Shermer's work.

Absolutely engrossing. Written with a passion and perspicacity rarely seen even among thinkers of Shermer's caliber. In short, a damned fine read that everyone ought to peruse forthwith! :)ALSO RECOMMENDED: Shermer's WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"If you're looking for a well-written book, which will give you a basic understanding of religion and faith in our time, you'll get what you need by reading this one. Shermer unveils for the reader the mechanics of the belief engine of the human mind, and he fairly describes the role of belief in the post-modern society. However, he is using the works of other scholars who addressed this issue, too extensively. This relates to one of the basic flaws of the work, as it lacks a coherent theory which should lead the reader towards the expected answer to the riddle which seems to be the cause for writing the book: the victory of religion over rationalism in the twenty-first century. While Shermer's tendency to focus on himself and account numerous incidents from his personal experience as the head of Skeptic Society, may be part for his writing style, it gives the reader a taste of a newspaper article rather than of a scholastic work. For myself, as a person who believes that religion is a dangerous social structure, I was disappointed not to come out of the reading process with a comprehensive understanding as to what is wrong with human society."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Very well written. It's humorous and poingnant. Very inciteful and informative. Shermer's best yet (that I've read)."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"On page 220, Shermer repeats one version of the QWERTY myth when he says the normal typewriter layout was \\"designed for nineteenth-century typewriters whose key striking mechanisms were too slow for human finger speed.\\" He then goes on to point out the sequence DFGHJKL on the home row and says, \\"It appears that the original key arrangement was just a straight alphabetical sequence, which made sense in early experiments before testing was done to determine a faster alignment. The vowels were removed to slow the typist down to prevent key jamming.\\"The first quote is partially wrong or confusing, and the second is incomplete, as illustrated by an entry on the typewriter at one of the two main urban legends-refutation websites, About.com's Urban Legend Reference Pages.From About:\\"For years, popular writers have accused Sholes of deliberately arranging his keyboard to slow down fast typists who would otherwise jam up his sluggish machine. In fact, his motives were just the opposite. ...\\"If two typebars were near each other in the circle, they would tend to clash into each other when typed in succession. So, Sholes figured he had to take the most common letter pairs such as \\"TH\\" and make sure their typebars hung at safe distances.\\"So, the modern key spread was not done to slow down typists; it simply was, in a phrase Shermer should appreciate, a near-optimal evolutionary adaptation of the original keyboard layout to mechanical constraints of the time.And, as for his implication that an alternative layout might be better? (Something believed by many others, not just him.) About answers that one, too:\\"The Dvorak keyboard sounds very good. However, a keyboard need to do more than just 'sound' good, and unfortunately, Dvorak has failed to prove itself superior to QWERTY. ... A U.S. General Services Administration study of 1953 appears to have been more objective. It found that it really didn't matter what keyboard you used.\\"Not a huge deal, but a professional skeptic should get this one right.====Now, on to the more serious objection.Shermer, in my opinion, explains HOW religious belief may have come into being, but not WHY.Man the pattern-seeing, or even man the pattern-making out of white-noise seeing, I agree with. But, why do the seen patterns have to have a religious vision to them?THAT's the question Shermer doesn't answer. To attempt an answer, he would have to delve into psychology of religion, as well as cognitive science, even more than he did, IMO. Paleoanthropology of early homo sapiens would also be needed.Also, pattern-seeing falls somewhat short on the \\"how,\\" in my opinion. Rather, I believe that religious belief was developed in part to FORCE patterns onto massively contingent medium-term temporal patterns.For example, some ancient culture asks why it has a drought, which is NOT part of the normal rain patterns.Answer... the seen pattern of some divinity, malevolent or angry."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This is a pretty weak book which attempts to delve into some of the deepest philosophical issues of all time. Shermer promises to study them &quot;objectively.&quot; The whole rest of the book, Shermer resorts to his background in psychology and simply sets out to psychoanalyze theists for having the beliefs that they do. Now, if Shermer &amp; friends wish to play this game, fine. HOWEVER, they do not have the right to so much as wince if the theists come back &amp; attempt to psychoanalyze them for the beliefs which they have. Shermer almost invites this on pages 236-237:&quot;I am often asked by believers why I abandoned Christianity and how I found meaning in the apparently meaningless universe presented by science. The implication is that the scientific worldview is an existentially depressing one. Without God, I am bluntly told, what's the point? If this is all there is, there is no use. To the contrary. For me, quite the opposite is true. The conjuncture of losing my religion, finding science, and discovering glorious contingency was remarkably empowering and liberating. It gave me a sense of joy and freedom....&quot;Hmmmmmmmm.........sounds to me like Shermer needs to be psychoanalyzed, eh? I mean, he can't have it both ways. Either way, the thesis is un-falsifiable &amp; either way nothing can be proved. To me, it is just one big waste of time.The book is also filled with countless errors. For example, on page 170 Shermer writes that &quot;God and religion are inseparable.&quot; Oh, really? And what of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism? All three are categorized as religions, yet none of them have any references to God or gods. Are we all supposed to amend the denotation of our vocabulary just to accommodate Shermer?On page 17 Shermer writes that &quot;It was barely more than a century ago that the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche penned the words for which he has become so famous [i.e.: God is dead] in a book considered by philosophers to be his greatest work, &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra.&quot; That is complete rubbish. By the time &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot; came out, the whole death-of-God paradigm was old news. Nietzsche is not famous for the passage Shermer alludes to in &quot;Zarathustra.&quot; It was, rather, section 125 of &quot;The Gay Science&quot; (allegory of the madman) in which Nietzsche announces the Death of God. The passage in &quot;Zarathustra&quot; is nothing more than a rehashing of the premise. Any first year philosophy student could tell you that. Is it too much to ask of a skeptic like Shermer that he get his facts straight?The weakest part of the book is Shermer's token treatment of the traditional arguments of God. In his counterargument to St. Thomas Aquinas' &quot;First Cause&quot; argument, Shermer writes: &quot;God must be within the universe or is the universe. In either case, God would himself need to be caused...&quot; (p. 92). Say again? Why does an omnipotent God need to be &quot;in the universe&quot; or &quot;be the universe&quot;? Because Shermer says so? Here Shermer advertises his complete ignorance of the writings of St. Augustine &amp; so many other theologians. Shermer seems to think that if he can't comprehend something, then it must not be true. Now, whether one buys the First Cause argument is another matter, but it would be prudent to at least understand the argument prior to rejecting it.Shermer goes on to say that &quot;Perhaps, as cosmologist Alan Guth suggests....it [the universe] just sprang into existence out of a quantum vacuum, uncaused.&quot; (P. 92) Now, Guth is a professor of theoretical physics at MIT &amp; is most certainly a smart guy. However, Shermer sounds as though all of the skeptics and atheists of the world should merely uncritically accept Guth's answer and move on. If this is the definition of a &quot;Free thinker&quot; (as Shermer likes to call himself), then I feel sorry for all free thinkers. What gets me about this nonchalant introduction of the topic of quantum mechanics is this: skeptics and atheists have for years complained (rightfully) about fundamentalist Christian websites which attempt to answer the deepest, most puzzling questions with a few sentences of Sunday School rhetoric. However, here we have Shermer trying to answer these same questions with the atheist's counterpart to Sunday School rhetoric. Shermer would like to lead the reader to believe that the atheists always have the final say on everything, and that is complete nonsense. The criticisms of Guth's universe-as-a-free-lunch paradigm are legion. If Shermer did not notice this, then he must not know anything at all about QM (which, considering his remarkable ignorance, would not surprise me in the least). [For further reading both pro and con of &quot;vacuum genesis&quot; read &quot;Atheism, Theism And Big Bang Cosmology&quot; by William Lane Craig and Quentin Smith]. Martin Heidegger once said that the question of why there is something rather than nothing is &quot;the darkest question of all.&quot; Nowadays, even with all the advancements in physics over the course of the 20th century, that statement remains true.He also tries to water down the Anthropic Principle and, like so many atheists, misunderstands its implications. In fact, Shermer writes &quot;...if recent cosmological models pan out it would appear that there are a near infinite number of bubble universes all with slightly different laws of nature.&quot; (P. 229) Oh, really? And how, might I ask, does Shermer think these theories might &quot;pan out&quot;? Just like the &quot;God&quot; hypothesis, these wonderful universes are all unfalisifiable and cannot be proven true. [For further reading on this issue, see John Leslie &quot;Universes&quot; and Timothy Ferris &quot;Science And Genesis&quot; (an essay from &quot;Cosmic Beginnings And Human Ends).&quot;The German Philosopher Arthur Schopenhaur once said of Georg Friedrich von Hegel that his ideas were &quot;three quarters nonsense and one quarter crazy notions.&quot; I could say the same for Shermer &amp; this book. If you would like to delve into the big questions of science and / or religion, then by all means read Carl Sagan, Stephen J. Gould, Stehpen Hawking, John Polkinghorne, Bertrand Russell, Phillip Kitcher, Ian Barbour, Del Ratzsche, John Leslie, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka and Albert Camus (among others). Don't waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"The fatal flaw that makes the tires fall off the Shermer Skepto-mobile is that he always, always, always fails to question HIS OWN philosophical assumptions. Agnostic materialism can try to tell us why we do things. But it can never, ever tell us why we SHOULD do things. A consistent evolutionary materialist can only say he FEELS something is wrong, not that it IS wrong. Only problem is the guy on the other side of the moral fence can say the same darn thing:.........The parts on Hal Lindsey and Van Praagh and the Bible Code are good. But a previous reviewer was correct in saying the book is a bit disjointed.The cursory looks at the arguments and counterarguments for God's existence were, no disrespect to the author, almost laughable. Shermer's response to Aquinas' &quot;First Cause&quot; argument is unbearable. Shermer says that it is possible that the universe &quot;sprang into existence out of a quantum vacuum, uncaused.&quot; Shermer (like Bertrand Russell, who also tried to weasel out of Aquinas' chain of reasoning) makes THE ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL ERROR OF LOGIC, and that is violating the Law of Non-Contradiction: A cannot be A and not-A at the same time and in the same relationship. Self-creation is a violation of this law. Van Praagh may be a fraud, but at least his theory of talking to the dead is not a blatant contradiction of a fundamental rule of philosophy. A self-creating universe is a contradiction in terms and a surprising number of otherwise mentally astute people seem to entertain this theory.Antidotes for this book, if anyone is interested: &quot;Not A Chance&quot; by R.C. Sproul; ANYTHING by Aquinas; &quot;Creation and Change&quot; by Douglas F. Kelly; &quot;Written On The Heart&quot; by J. Budziszewski; and the essay &quot;The Poison of Subjectivism&quot; by C.S.

Besides at looking at things such as scientific and philosophical arguments for and against Gods existance, \\"intelligent design\\" and the \\"bible code\\", Shermer delves into all sorts of things to show how belief and experiencing God points to nothing outside of our own brains.This is the untimate God book."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"If you are a skeptic or your god is 'reason', then you will get great support from reading this book.

The book also discusses the standard arguments for the existence of God, as well as the typical counter arguments.However, I was disappointed that the author found it necessary to interject his own opinions regarding the existence of God, immortality, etc.Although Mr. Shermer claims to be an agnostic, I found his opinions to be closer to that of atheism. In fact, it is apparent to me that he chose the agnostic position more out of reason than out of a true sense of humility at what we don't or can't know. I found the book to be very biased due to the emphasis on 'reason' as the only way to valid knowledge.I found it interesting that Mr. Shermer and I have read some of the same authors, but have come to completly different conclusions regarding what they meant by the word 'God' (e.g. Harold Kusner, Paul Davies).

Ignoring that since Copernicus the role of divinities in the cosmic picture has become irrelevant, Clinton dragged his god into the ceremony. The past half millenia has revealed a wealth of information from galactic spectra to the operating details of life itself. But the work was done by people, not some ghost. Mark Twain railed at [g]od coming in to claim the credit' after human research effort produced cures for yellow fever and other ills. Clinton must have made the spirit of Twain gyrate furiously when he credited [g]od with creation, and by default, as the cause of the structure of DNA. With so much knowledge of a god's irrelevance confronting him, why did Clinton fall into the trap of giving credit to The Sprite?Michael Shermer has made a significant effort to detail the background thinking [or lack of it] that sustains the concept of The Sprite so firmly in the American psyche. How does the idea of a divine creator persist when the logic supporting it weakens with every forward stride of knowledge? Why do so many Americans, supposedly the most literate nation on earth, retain such adherence to superstition? Who are the believers and why do they believe?Half a century ago, Robert Nathan wrote a delightful social satire, DIGGING THE WEANS. Archeologists from a future Africa crossed the seas to learn about the extinct people known as the US. In particular, they sought answers to why the US seemed so different from other people. One wonders what Nathan might think today. Since his time \`globalization' has become a smokescreen term for Americanization. How these new imperialists think is a compelling issue. Shermer's book has provided insight to one facet of that thinking. It's of particular meaning to those of us living elsewhere. If there's a serious flaw in this book, it's a failure to make some valid comparisons with other people and their faiths.Still, Shermer tries valiantly to fulfill the mandate he's given himself. How Americans believe is depicted by numerous quantitative studies. How many PhDs, bank managers or trash collectors, burdened with fears of the afterlife [or lack thereof] cling to the image of The Sprite? Shermer can't truly extract which of these is hopeful of something better on The Other Side, or simply fleeing an envisioned post-perish punishment. We can't blame him for this, since the faithful probably can't express, either.Shermer's attempts to provide insight into WHY so many Americans are so persistent in their piety fall rather flat. The studies quoted seemed rather simplistic, but the question can only be, do you believe in The Sprite, or not. The discussions about agnosticism, non-theist or theist are engaging, but don't address the difficult question: why does the nation with the most Nobel winners remain the most superstitious? Perhaps Shermer would have done better to simply beg off attempting the question as too difficult. At least in only 290 pages. Yet, the question arises repeatedly. It titles the fourth chapter and an appendix and is the theme of Chapter 5. He uses it as a subtopic and for table headings, but we never find out why such a powerful people need to escape reality for the elusive solace of neo-Christianity.The cure for yellow fever [and smallpox and polio] came from science workers, not faith[ful] healers. Twain wanted priority recognition for those researchers and instead watched the credit go to [g]od. With such a high proportion of Americans expressing faith, it's inevitable that even scientists will find themselves in different camps. In one of the strangest sections in this book, Shermer launches an assault on Daniel C. Dennett's critique of Steven J. Gould. Gould, co-author of the \`punctuated equilibria' mechanism of evolution, is particularly deft at disclosing Gould's mental gymnastics in expressing his ideas. In this context, Gould sells Shermer on eschewing the term \`random' in favour of \`contingency' in describing evolution's process. Dennett, following Richard Dawkins, rightly sees Gould introducing \`skyhooks' in his attempts to modify Darwin's theme of natural selection. Shermer is clearly unhappy at this tarnishing of his hero, firmly chastising Dennett at \`protesting overmuch'.Why does Shermer take off on Dennett so strongly? Is it merely because Gould forwarded his last book? Shermer awards Gould too much credit for giving \`contingency' a deep philosophical meaning in contrast to \`random', a quirky and apparently less definable term. Gould rises in his own defence of contingency, wrapping the evidence in the term \`sequence' in his definition of evolution's modus operandi. This seems to give \`contingency' a respectability lacking in \`random'. The presentation is convoluted and the evidence misleading, however. Random necessarily avoids sequence; otherwise it's no longer random. Nor is contingency sequential - unless, as in this case, evolution makes it so. Saying Dennett \`doth protest overmuch', Shermer ignores the stature of Gould as America's best-known science writer. If Gould gets it wrong, the impact will be widespread. And he got it wrong."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"If you're looking for a well-written book, which will give you a basic understanding of religion and faith in our time, you'll get what you need by reading this one.

Indeed we are presented with quite interesting material in this regard. Mr. Schermer uses the fields of psychology, evolutionary biology, sociology, philosophy, and anthropology, amongst others, to help explain belief systems.While I found that almost all the book held my interest, it seemed somewhat disjointed. Some of the material is also quite controversial. While such matters only serve to entertain me, others may get offended - Christians may take umbrage at having their beliefs repeatedly referred to as &quot;myths&quot;.The book presents intriguing survey results on why people believe in God. What is most fascinating is that respondents felt that other people believe in God for reasons that differ considerably from their own. Shermer moves on into a discussion of evolutionary biology and a &quot;belief module&quot; (more controversy). Then, surprisingly, we move into a section concerned with traditional philosophical arguments (primarily those of Thomas Aquinas) for belief in God. When you get right down to it, no one embraces religious belief purely on the basis of philosophical arguments. Creationists will be offended by a section on their beliefs. A chunk of the book is given to the Indian Ghost Dance of the 1890s, and we read a discussion on a mathematical refutation of the recent best seller The Bible Code. Good stuff, but its like reading a collection of essays that are not often obviously related to each other.The final chapter had me scratching my head the most. It's a section discussing the controversy surrounding Stephen Jay Gould's theories of evolution regarding necessity/contingency/chance. While poring through this I kept wondering what it had to do with religion. My question was never answered satisfactorily. Shermer forces this subject into a paean to the wonders of living in a contingent universe. He states that his abandonment of religion allows him to bask in the beauty of our magnificent universe. I get annoyed with concept that if you are religious you can't appreciate science and nature. Not every religious believer is constrained by fundamentalist young earth/intelligent design theories. I am an agnostic who was brought up a Catholic. My intense curiosity and admiration of nature was as strong when I was a believer as it is as a non-believer today."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"One of the finest and most comprehensive books I have ever read on our beliefs and why we believe the way we do. I truly have to give Michael Shermer the utmost respect for being so rational and not going out to bash, but to unearth reality. Michael Shermer is truly a person whom has well researched his information and made his study, research, and findings understandable by showing how we as human beings have become the way we are. At the same time, prepared his information in an understandable way that focuses on logical thinking, not mythical, which so many of us like to do so often. The bottom line, this book illustrates how we have created a very mystical world to help us better cope with life. Hey, Shermer does not feel it is bad to believe in a supreme being as it offers many people needed comfort, at the same time, he urges us to \\"Think for Yourself\\"-Cogita tute, which is absolutely one of the greatest messages within this book because it points out some serious errors humankind have made in their belief organisms, in turn, generating great pain and affliction that could have been circumvented through placing trust in themselves by using good old common sense and by thinking for themselves. Shermer does not ask you to take his word for it, he simply states, you shouldn't believe what I say or anyone else, \\"Think for yourself\\" and if it makes sense then, believe. This is a definite read!"},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"As one goldfish said to the other, &quot;if there is no god, who changes the water?&quot;, Michael Shermer gazes through the bowl at the possibilities and the distorting refractions caused by it and tries to get a clearer picture. I can't imagine a better summary of such a vast amount of material on such a universal subject. Why so many people have always believed in a divine being based on so little evidence other than the fact that we're constantly amazed by our own consciousness and the &quot;orderly&quot; world around us is his main interest. He discusses these issues so that almost anyone paying attention can understand all the facets of this multifaceted subject and how the arguments have played out down through the ages right up to the present day. I'm sure he must have left something out but after I put the book down I couldn't imagine what. He gives you all the basic imformation you could ever want and just leaves you with yourself to wonder and think and reach your own conclusions. I can assure you that your conclusions will be of a higher quality after having read this book than not. Enjoy."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Michael Shermer is the founder and leader of the Skeptic's Society, and in this, his most recent book, he takes on religion in a collection of essays. Although his direction seems to meander, the research that went into this book provides an excellent aggregation of facts and ideas that explore why people believe in anything or anybody, from James Van Praagh to God himself. Shermer's proposal of a Belief Engine is an interesting one and explains how humans, as pattern-seeking creatures, could have evolved an inherent propensity to believe. Unfortunately, I feel that this book will offend religious folk (rather than create skeptical converts), despite Shermer's claims that he means only to understand.In my opinion, the religious and the skeptical are always at one another's throats because neither accepts the other's criteria for acceptance of an idea. The skeptic relies on science to discover the truth; the answers to his or her questions are things to be discovered. Someone with a more religious outlook starts at the opposite end of the spectrum. That is, all answers can be found through faith in God and it is up to us to conform our worldview to confirm that philosophy. With one group seeking an answer and the other starting with the answer, it's no wonder that both wouldn't mind seeing the other ousted from schools, government, and other positions of influence.Having said all that, I wonder if anyone's mind will actually be changed by this book, or if it will serve only as a rallying point for like-minded skeptics as a sort of skeptical equivalent of _Evidence That Demands a Verdict_. No matter the eventual outcome of the science-religion conflict, this book provides a solid intellectual foothold for the skeptic."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"As in his Why People Believe Weird Things, Michael Shermer makes it clear that people who believe in God are not stupid. He breaks important ground by making a home for two types who have been lately rejected by the mainstreams of Skepticism and Religion: those who believe in God even though they know that they cannot prove God's existence empirically; and those who simply refuse to answer the question.Shermer makes an excellent case for an alternative form of Skepticism with this book, based on the premise that if there is a God, He/She/It is of such a character as to be beyond human knowing. God, Shermer reminds us, is supposed to be omniscient (all-knowing), omnipresent (present everywhere), and omni-potent (all-powerful). We human beings are none of these things: so how can any of us claim to be certain of this other beings existence or nonexistence?It is a premise which will make those who want empircal proof for their beliefs unhappy: neither the Creationist or the Atheist will be satisfied with Shermer's formula. Yet, I think, that thinking people of spirit and nonspirit will appreciate Shermer's liberating observations. He is consciously trying to create a world-view about religion for the coming millenium and, I dare say, his is the most realistic and sensible that I have seen so far.From this beginning, Shermer goes on to discuss the human creation of religion, an artifact which is separate from the question of whether or not God exists. Shermer contends that we humans are, by the grace of natural selection, pattern-seeking animals. Religion is an attempt by us to make sense of the chaos and the uncertainty which is always there. He concludes his discussion by establishing his view as an independent theory of religion, offering it to religious scholars and others who are seeking a common-sense position about the way we believe.The concluding section, about the theory of Evolution and its relationship to issues of modern faith, has been cited by some as superfluous and out of keeping with the rest of the book. I contend, however, that it is a logical conclusion to Shermer's epistemology given that nowhere has the conflict between the Godless and the God-inspired been so evident as it has been in this debate. Shermer pulls evolution and Science as a whole out of the political void created by this conflict and sets it where it rightly belongs: as an objective, well-grounded explanation of the fossil evidence which does not tell us a thing about whether or not God exists. This question, Shermer believes, cannot be answered by we mere humans. We are best served by realizing our limitations, he concludes, and accepting empirical Truth as limited to what we can find out with our own senses.It was appropriate that this book appeared in the first month of the year 2000. It is a book to guide epistemological debate in the next millenium."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"In the Preface, which is titled &quot;The God Question. A MoralDilemma for Dr. Laura&quot;, he talks about how Skeptic magazine usedto get letters from people complaining that DL was on the editorialboard. He then talks about the fact that skeptics could care less about what a person's faith is, UNLESS that person begins telling others that their faith can be proven with facts, then the skeptic will challenge them to do so through rational arguments and empirical evidence. He gives a short synopsis of how DL came to be on the board (she was invited due to her outspokeness on the failed recovered-memory movement), and how she asked to be immediately removed after a Skeptic issue about &quot;The God Question.&quot; Shermer called her to see what's up, and she basically said that anyone (past or present) who questions God is &quot;arrogant.&quot; And after more discussion she told him there is only ONE God--the God of Abraham. From here he leaves her behind (with her own 'arrogance') and gets into what the book is about which he outlines as: &quot;(1) Why people believe in God; (2) the relationship of science and religion, reason and faith; and (3) how the search for the sacred came into being and how it can thrive in and age of science.&quot; He notes at the end of the preface that skeptics use the stance that was so eloquently put by Spinoza: &quot;I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them.&quot; Such a stark contrast to the dispassionate stance of DL.I suppose DL would throw Spinoza into her vague, catch-all conspiracy theory about 'liberals'. This also-faith of hers about 'agendas', 'conspiracies', 'indoctrinations', 'pseudo-religions', etc., are therefore demanded by the skeptical position to be proven rationally and empirically, because she is saying they are facts. She hasn't provided any credible evidence, and probably never will, i.e. she'll never put up nor will she shut up.Anyway, the rest of the book is for those who seek to understand, and it succeeds amazingly."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This is an extraordinarlity brilliant book. It achieves the one major thing that I think a book like this must achieve: it is thought-provoking. If people on both sides of the believer vs. athiest, science vs. religion would give this book a chance, eyes would be opened. Of course, what are the chances of that?I am a scientist and a Christian. I am a teacher of math and physics with a firm faith in God. I am comfortable with who I am. How did that come about? I can see my own path but it is interesting to read about some of the sociological and psychological paths of faith-development.I also like Shermer's stress on the difference between the techniques of science and processes of faith--something which I often comment on myself. Why do theologians (and, more often, pseudo-theologians) feel the need to apply scientific rigor to matter of faith? Conversely, why do scientists attempt to assert scientific &quot;certainty&quot; on things that lie outside the realm of the measureable which is the heart of science. These fields certainly have things to offer each other but they are different and require different techniques.Shermer covers a lot of important ground in what is a relatively brief book. As a summary of the state of the secular vs. religious conflict alone it is a valuable book. He also does not equivocate about his own beliefs but still manages to give a fair hearing to both sides, pointing out where each side tends to step over the line into the ridiculous. Of course, this is Shermer's quest and one he handles well. It's people like him who make the rest of us shore up our arguments and stay intellectually honest. Read this book and agree or disagree with Shermer but don't just close your mind to it because he (or anyone) thinks differently than you."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"How We Believe is a disjointed compendium of various topics, many taken from previous articles in Skeptic. Much of the material is useful and interesting for the reader who has not already seen it in the magazine. It is debatable whether Shermer succeeds in delivering the explanation promised in the title.Shermer gives us a brief summary of the most popular arguments for the existence of god, and shows how each is flawed. He himself would appear to be a closet atheist. He calls his position &quot;nontheism&quot; which on close examination is essentially identical to negative atheism, i.e. absence of belief in god.Yet Shermer bends over backwards to be very, very, nice to religious believers and practitioners. But he is not too shy about misrepresenting science (just what does he mean by statements such as &quot;science is a type of myth&quot; or &quot;deep and sacred science&quot;?) and belittling atheists and humanists (dimissing them as fanatical, or unrealistic, or overly obsessed by clarity and logic). He tells us over and over and over that &quot;God&quot; is certainly not dead, as if equating widespread belief in god with confirmation of his/her/its reality. He implies that that widespread belief will always be with us, and that's cool.The great flaw in Shermer's worldview is the specious way in which he separates science and religion in order to let the latter off the hook. He fully endorses S. J. Gould's NOMA (non-overlapping magisteria) view according to which science and religion are relegated to distinct separate domains, thus avoiding conflict.Nevertheless, Shermer does have some important things to say. In the book's last, and best, chapter, Shermer discusses the interplay of chaos and order -- or contingency and necessity as he refers to them -- in evolution, in the flow of history and in the unfolding of an individual's life. In the course of this discussion he responds to those who claim that their religious beliefs are necessary to give meaning to their lives. On the contrary, Shermer argues, the freedom to think for himself and to take responsibility for his own actions is what allows him to give meaning to his life and to live it to the fullest.[ A more complete review is available on-line.

I feel the same gratitude toward my family, and greatly enjoy the game of truth-hunting without having to drag along the millstones that childhood indoctrination can attach. Shermer's book covers a lot of ground, ranging from general philosophical commentary on belief systems, to Cargo and Messiah Cults, to the author's personal intellectual journey and conclusions. Along the way (Chapter 4) we are shown interesting results from a study, co-designed by the author, in which selected groups of individuals were asked to explain and interpret their own religious views. Shermer is able to deduce some fascinating, revealing, and occasionally amusing generalizations from the survey data.In terms of creative content the book's most important contribution is Chapter 10, &quot;Glorious Contingency.&quot; Here Shermer expands on a theme credited to S.J. Gould, the central idea being that the evolutionary chain leading to H. Sapiens (us) was contingency-intensive, and therefore probably irreproducible if a repeat trial could somehow be arranged. Gould attributes the irreproducibility not primarily to true randomness or asteroid-type disasters, but rather to overwhelming practical uncertainties rooted in the sensitivity of final outcomes to initial conditions and early events in lengthy, complex processes. As the author points out, recent trends in Chaos Theory lend support to such a conclusion. After addressing some criticisms of Gould (primarily from Daniel Dennett), Shermer introduces his own concept, Contingent-Necessity, which is generalized to cover not just biological evolution, but any historical sequence or process. He proposes a shifting balance (bifurcation) between contingency and necessity that could clarify the nature and genesis of events ranging from punctuated equilibria in evolution to the great social upheavals in human history.A common complaint about Shermer's books is that he tends to ramble; that is, every chapter is not centered on the book's title subject. True enough, but I don't see a serious problem if the material is at least related to the book's main theme. One Amazon reviewer saw no satisfactorily-explained connection between religion and the above-described Chapter 10. It seems to me that in the chapter's last section (&quot;Finding Meaning in a Contingent Universe&quot;), the connection becomes clear enough: To evaluate intelligently any religion's view of how and when we got here, one requires more than passing familiarity with what science, with its built-in BS detectors, can tell us about the very same subject. On the critical side, I have to agree with the reviewer who found Shermer's reference to science as &quot;a type of myth&quot; quite annoying. The problem isn't so much the statement itself as the author's assumption that no supporting explanation was necessary."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Why people believe in the things they believe has always interested me. Shermer, who is the head of the Skeptics Society, takes a deep look into questions of &quot;faith&quot; and reason, and discovers answers that may surprise you.Personally, I found this book both lucid and elegantly written... almost reminded me of Sagan. (And that is a huge complement coming from me.)While Shermer treads lightly on religion, his message remains clear.I highly recommend this book to anybody who either has an open mind, or wants one."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Don't let the title, &quot;How We Believe&quot; mislead you. A better title would be: &quot;A skeptic's philosophical answer to recent proposals of Intelligent Design as the probable cause of life and our universe&quot;! The modern search for origins is an essential search for truth, truth which can be verified by reason (mathematics), models of systematic logic (the sequential organization of DNA), and the astounding correlation of laws of the universe. To keep it simple (and it is not), consider the permutations of the possible combinations of the number of nucleotides in a single living cell, such as a bacteria. We are talking about 7 million DNA nucleotides. To get an idea of the startling numbers of permutations of these 7 million, consider the permutation of just the number 14. This would be: 14! = 14x13x12x11x10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = more than 87 billion combinations. Think of the possible combinations of not just 14, but of 7,000,000! This is for the chance of &quot;self-organization&quot; of the correct sequence of DNA nucleotides to form a functioning single cell. Would you like to try it on your PC? Don't bother, it's much too big...something like 10 to the 56th power! One chance out of 10 to the 56th power??? To get an idea of this comparison, imagine two scientists standing in front of Mt. Rushmore National Monument. One of them says, &quot;What a wonderful likeness of our presidents!&quot; The other says, &quot;Isn't if amazing that these faces were carved out of the solid rock by the chance natural action of wind, rain, snow and lightning!&quot; Foolish? Not really, since the actual chance for these faces to occur by natural forces are actually BETTER than the 1 to 10 to the 56th power chance of the correct sequence of DNA nucleotides to form a single cell. Proof of Intelligent Design? Most mathematicians would think so, but not a Skeptic Magazine editor! For those searching for the the truth of our origins, perhaps it would be better for them to study Stephen Hawking or Nobel Laureate, Steven Weinberg, rather than the caustic comment of Skeptic Magazine editor, Michael Shermer."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Shermes book is a boring, unoriginal, rehash of old arguments for and against the existance of God. The single fact of the matter, which is never addressed, is that at the very earliest stages (nanoseconds) of the big bang universe, all the law of physics where known beforehand...that is unrefutable fact as far as anyone can mathematically or experimentally prove.The universe, as stated by Freeman Dyson and others, is &quot;surely the greatest put-up job imaginable.&quot; If that isnt an argument (along with the thousands of &quot;coincidences&quot; that are necessary for life even over billions of years of evolution)for design, I dont know what is. &quot;Skeptics&quot; should finally get their collective heads out of the collective sand."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Having just finished two other books by skeptics (Sam Harris and Pascal Boyer) who want to explain and / or abolish religion, Shermer's easy style and cheerful approach were a welcome change of pace. Sure, he meanders a bit, but in the process covers many interesting topics, and offers some great quotes. Unlike Harris or Boyer, Shermer is not afraid to credit faith with good influence on occasion (making his argument far more credible), and he has a pretty decent grounding, overall, in Christianity, the \\"orthodoxy\\" he goes after most often. (Though he also discusses the Bible Code, NDEs, Ghost Dances, Nation of Islam, and other Messianic cults -- most of which I found fascinating.) I also liked the last chapter, on Steven Jay Gould and historical contingency -- the butterfly effect. As an historian, I think the theory helps explain both the pattern of Chinese dynastic power, and the way schools of thought mix as they form, then congeal into orthodoxies.Elsewhere, though, I found Shermer's arguments unsuccessful, and often confused.For one thing, sloppiness often undermines Shermer's credibility. He flubs the story of Augustine's famous conversion - the verse quoted in Confessions did not tell Augustine to sell all he had and give to the poor, but to avoid sexual immorality! No one who has read Pensees should talk as if \\"The Wager\\" were Pascal's only argument for Christianity. Shermer's ten arguments for God, and his responses, are as others remark embarrassing - not only because they are short and therefore inadequate, but they often also miss the point. Shermer introduces Michael Behe as his primary antagonist on ID, but then most of his arguments seem to argue past Behe.Shermer also fails to critique his own arguments objectively. Shermer often tells us, \\"People are pattern-seeking animals.\\" True, but we can also be pattern-avoiding, overlooking signs of cancer or an affair. The question is which faculty is most in play when it comes to religion. One cannot simply assume that faith in God means connecting too many dots, rather than disbelieving, means not connecting enough. This is the weakness of a psychological approach to religion without an adequate discussion of objective evidence. After all, math and logic and science and history also connect dots.Shermer relies on Burton Mack on Jesus. This is a poor choice. See my Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could, for a critique of Mack, Crossan, Borg, and Funk, among others. I argue that Mack is more a maker of myths than a believable historian.Shermer's surveys of why people believe, or do not believe, were probably the most interesting part of the book for me. He summarizes the data at the end of the book in a series of useful graphs. He finds that skeptics are more likely to be well-educated, open-minded, male, and to conflict with their parents. But here too, his analysis is premature. First of all, he assumes that a person who describes himself as \\"inventive, curious, original,\\" is these things - which seems a bit nave. Secondly, the only society he surveys is America. He does not therefore control for the sociological difference between orthodox views and new sects. A different kind of person is likely to convert than stick with the views of his ancestors. To decide what difference theism itself makes, it would be necessary to take similar surveys in (say) communist China or Russia, Tibet, Iran, and Japan. If Shermer did so, having studied culture and religion all my adult life, I am sure he would get quite different results. While education may make Americans a bit less likely to believe in God, it seems to make Taiwanese or Singaporean far more likely to become Christians. And this, Rodney Stark shows, was also the case in Medieval Europe, among the first scientists.Shermer asks, \\"How can one set of people find no evidence for God's existence, while another set finds quite the opposite? Both are observing the same world. The answer, as we shall see, lies in the psychology of belief.\\" To be fair, he should also consider whether the answer might lie instead in (1) the psychology of unbelief (see Paul Vitz, Faith of the Fatherless); (2) the sociology of unbelief (see Stark, For the Glory of God); (3) the fact that people observe different parts of the world; (4) the possibility that science has become a rival god (there is evidence for that in this book); (5) sex on campus (see Tom Wolfe!); (6) different ways in which people on different levels of society falsify or deny God (see Cornelius Plantinga, A Bestiary of Sin); (7) public education may discriminate against faith. (Shermer himself says, \\"It is not acceptable in science\\" to offer supernatural explanations. And indeed, many of us have learned, even a hint of openness to the supernatural can be bad for one's academic health;) (8) the public education system may have become a propaganda machine for humanism, as envisioned by Dewey; or (9) the sociological tendencies described by Stark. Each hypothesis, I say, should be considered.Finally, Shermer puzzles much over the relationship between faith and reason. His survey shows that the most common reason for faith is intellectual. He thinks this is a modern heresy, an inappropriate response to skepticism on the part of Christians, who should admit that they believe because they want to, end of story. He praises the pope for writing, \\"Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth.\\" But when the pope describes faith and reason as both \\"inseparable\\" and \\"distinct,\\" he complains: \\"Either faith and reason are inseparable or they are distinct.\\" Why? It does not occurr to him that the poetry he has just praised shows that it is possible for two things to be both \\"inseparable\\" and \\"distinct.\\" Both wings on a bird are inseparable in the sense of being joined through its body, and in being required for flight - yet are distinct as well. The world is full of objects both \\"inseparable\\" in that sense and \\"distinct:\\" electron and proton, head and shoulders, mother and child. Skeptics often assume \\"faith\\" means \\"blind faith:\\" it is to Shermer's credit that he digs up evidence to the contrary. But the evidence takes him by surprise, and he resorts to the improbable assumption that Pope John Paul does not properly understand the Christian tradition, and educated Christians have heretical notions of epistemology. He is, of course, mistaken. Far from a modern heresy, however, John Paul (and Pascal!) accurately understood that faith and reason complement one another in the Christian tradition. (See the anthology on Faith and Reason on my web site, christthetao.com, for quotes on faith and reason from leading Christian thinkers over the centuries.) So while I credit Shermer for being open-minded enough to learn new things about religion, it remains to be seen how open and self-critical he really is."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Michael Shermer gives a comprehensive review of public opinion regarding religion and religious beliefs. He provides detailed statistics on a number of religious questions and reviews Christian, Jewish, and Muslim beliefs. If you want to know what people think about religion and their personal faith and beliefs, this is a good source of information. Shermer is objective and goes into details that are relevant and insightful. He provides referneces that are extensive and reputable. He exposes illogical resoning and the lack of scientific, observable data to support religious (faith based) beliefs that are inconsistent with observed archeological, geological and anthropological (as well as neurobiological) evidence. This book is good reading for students of religion, psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, history and statistics."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"I found it interesting that Shermer's dedication to the book stated \\"For examining God, religion, and myth as Spinoza would have it: not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn, but to understand.\\" In spite of this, I failed to understand how Shermer hoped to remain neutral throughout his book when he only argued for the side of science. However, as the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, you couldn't really expect less.Regardless of Shermer's personal opinions, I found his book to be well written, well researched and enjoyable. He posed numerous fresh arguments in a world where the God v. Science battle constantly rages. Also, several of his arguments caused me to rethink my own beliefs and why I stand by them. While Shermer is clearly biased in favor of science, after reading his book I think that he desires to respect all types of people along with their individual beliefs. I enjoyed his writing and the many thoughts that it sparked in me."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"If you combine this book with Richard Dawkin's &quot;Unweaving the Rainbow&quot; then you have armed yourself with more knowledge than the vast army of idealogues will ever have amongst themselves combined. There are things in this book which will annoy both fundamentalist dogmatists and militant athesists alike. But this is the book's great strength-- that it deals with the subject of Religion with compassion and sensitivity (which annoys atheists) and that it sets firm limits upon which Religion should not be allowed to tread will annoy the fundies. Normally I would only give this book four stars instead of five, since it is more about WHAT weird things people believe rather than WHY. But anything that annoys fundies rates an extra star in my book."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This is one of those excellent examples of getting something extra in the bargain.For, when one buys this book, not only do they get a very thorough treatment of the psychological, social and historical factors which incline humans toward religion but they also get Mr. Shermer's own unique take on the matter in the form of his chapter 10 which suggests that we accept the miracle of humanity's chance existence and our own by trying to make the best of it.If you expect by skepticism, either a cynical distance or dispassion, you will find yourself pleasantly surprised with Mr. Shermer's genuine command of the multiple disciplines he must - of needs - rely upon in building his thesis that religion is the simple byproduct of human behavior and history.The most notable characteristic about these books is usually the invariable Rorshach quality in which the author reveals himself in his views on religion and the almighty. To the careful observer sometimes one can even see the seeds of childhood disfunction in the author's projected worldview.Again fortunately, such is not the case here where Shermer not shows an appreciation for the outside view of religion but rather also its own subtle capacity to beauty and inspiration. Indeed, this subtle beauty informs Mr. Shermer's world view.Don't get me wrong, if you begin this book from the vantage point of one religious world view, I would offer that that's where you'll end up. That being said, you'll arrive there a little better informed."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This is an excellent book detailing Christianity and arguments thereof regarding God, creation, miracles, etc. You'll either like this book (because you've always been having these doubts and this book voices those doubts and makes you aware of them) or hate it (and thus give a very low rating) because you're probably a Christian...This is a must read for anyone seriously interested on the matter of God and Christianity."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"One of the most interesting studies for How We Believe was in asking people why they believe in God. Most people said they believed for logical reasons that they had carefully considered. When asked why they thought OTHER people believed in God almost everyone said other believe because of emotion and the need for comfort.What Shermer's book helps make clear is that most of us (all?) far overestimate our ability to make intelligent decisions. We try to convince ourselves that everyone else is driven by faulty emotions while we are using critical thinking.Why don't we more people admit they believe because of emotions like comfort? Mostly we want to sound intelligent to others and to ourselves. If I can convince myself I believe in God because I have taken the time to think it through it somehow convinces me that I am right in what I believe, after all I weighed the evidence carefully. In truth, this is an illusion. We believe first, then try to back our beliefs with logic (some don't even go this far).This doesn't discount our beliefs (I believe in God); but it should give us pause to consider that we are not necessarily \\"right\\" and everyone else is \\"wrong\\". However, bridging this gap is probably all but impossible. Imagine telling Democrats and Republicans to admit that their side is wrong and the other side is right. It won't happen; in fact wars are fought for less. We are not nearly as rational as we would hope to believe."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This book summarizes a huge amount of data but the data is not what is most impressive about it.

I read Michael Shermer's other book and thought that was great, but this is even better... Without attacking belief he simply shows us how we may &quot;need&quot; to believe.

There are several wonderful recent additions to this area: Ebert's Are Souls Real? and Kaminer's Sleeping With Extra-Terrestrials are very good, but this book is the most consistently thought provoking. Shermer examines why we believe in God on a number of levels, practically, cosmologically, philosophically and logically. At every level, I found new insights. This is a book that will give you lots to think about and will send you to the bookstore to follow up on his ideas. Well worth reading twice."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"I liked Shermer's previous book because, though I disagreed with it, it nonetheless honestly presented an interesting viewpoint with a minimum or errors. So I was understandibly sad when I got done with this one.1. The main theme of this book is not &quot;How We Believe&quot; (a subject which is barely brouched), but &quot;Shermer is a great guy.&quot; We hear about how his friends think he is too accomodating to religionists, etc.2. For a skeptic, Shermer happily ignores the rules of logic and critical thinking. This begins right away, when he says the Shroud of Turin should not be considered 2,000 years old unless there is great proof of this. Fine. But then Shermer claims that it should be believed that it is 16th century until proven otherwise. He can't have it both ways.3. He advises the use of ad hominum attacks on religionists. Ask them if they would be good without god, he advises. If they answer yes, they have proven god irrelevent. If they answer no, they show that have a bad character, and so the religionists lose no matter what the answer.For a good apologetic of skepticism, &quot;The Demon Haunted World&quot; by Carl Sagan is a much more interesting, more honest, and better written book."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Michael writes persuasively.

Haven't read it yet so can't say whether or not it is a good read."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This book looks at religion from a mostly psychological stand-point, the unstated assumption being that is sufficient.It is acknowledged atheism is difficult to defend (to claim God doesn't exist requires knowledge of everything), so rhetorical salvation is sought by the author declaring himself agnostic. The book then continues on, implicitly assuming atheism without having to defend it.The book presents people's responses to polls on questions of religion. Seems irrelevant. Is there value in a poll on why people believe Newton's laws of gravity? An agnostic would study it to determine the truth. Only an anti-newtonian would take a poll to characterize people's persistent &quot;wrong&quot; thoughts. Again, the book is framed by a prejudice denied.It goes on to discuss human pattern recognition, myth-making and much Darwinian theory. Most everything but the kitchen-sink is presented as an explanation for why people believe in God, except for the possibility it is true. That possibility is excluded from consideration without comment.This is a bit of a problem, since the central claim of Christianity is that it provides a correct and sufficient understanding of reality. It is not a &quot;special&quot; kind of understanding, but presents the cognitive and informational facts which all historical, moral and physical understanding can be based. It is an evidence-based understanding of reality which demands that it be tested.The book does not do this. Christian apologetics (the analysis of the logic, evidence and historicity of Christianity) is mentioned once. The author reports he is aware of it and tries to &quot;stay in touch&quot; with it. However, the approach and statements made in the book indicate this cannot be.The book has problems defining terms and concepts. &quot;Faith&quot; is repeatedly used in ways that suggest &quot;blind faith&quot; is meant. This is not what educated Christians mean. Faith does not mean believing something known to be false, or ignoring evidence. It's the finite trying to understand the infinite. The &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; in a jury trial. Or when mathematician Kurt Godel began his Theorem of Incompleteness with a statement known to be true, then demonstrated it could not be proven so, establishing mathematics (even integer arithmetic) contains true statements that cannot be proven so. Faith must be grounded in evidence and reason.This fundamental misunderstanding of faith leads to an erroneous analysis of the Catholic Pope's 1996 statement on evolution (Chapter 6), although another problem there was selective quotation of the Pope's statement, which excluded Darwinian evolution.The books' reluctance to define certain words encourages separate ideas to be blurred into jumbled mess. The book defines religions a-priori as being myth-based. Makes me want to know how many myths the author has read and the criteria used to determine this.By the time one gets to the part where the author inserts his head in a strong magnetic field to cause temporal lobe disruption in his brain, inducing a floating sensation (like an out of body experience), it's only slightly surprising to read the conclusion that's probably NOT the cause of religious thinking in most people; perhaps just religious leaders. Whew!The book had a surreal chapter analyzing arguments for the existence of God. Five are yanked from the 13th century(!) That is they were phrased centuries before a branch of Christianity degenerated into atheism. There's been some activity in the area in the last 700 years. As it is, the books' counter-arguments depend on using a word in a different sense than the original argument (like &quot;universe&quot;), then claiming the argument has been refuted. Kid stuff.Whenever the idea of a reasoned, evidential basis for faith intrudes, the book immediately dismisses it because &quot;religion is based on faith&quot; (remember, the author means &quot;blind faith&quot; when he says faith). This reflexive, narrow focus is unscientific.The discussion of Behe's irreducible biological complexity strongly indicates has not read -- or at least retained -- the argument. He simply restates the Darwinian myth of eye development, using the same Victorian-era knowledge of biology Behe dismantled. Similarly with intelligent design studies. Instead of analyzing the implications of a statistical description of specified complexity, the author skips past, treating it as identical to 19th century science. It is clearly important to think there is nothing new happening -- or to at least make sure the flock thinks so for awhile longer.Still, the books' attempt to moderate is fascinating. As the book mentions, the author heads the the Skeptic Society. I often receive invitations to the Society lectures (mentioned in the book) at Caltech that quote Spinoza's &quot;... ceaseless effort not to ridule, but to understand ...&quot;, then go to the lecture. It usually starts off with the author telling mocking jokes about religious figures for 20 minutes as the crowd of skeptics roar. Someone stands up and gives a talk about how Moses was a fictious pimp, before the floor is opened. Between the denunciations of religious people as ignorant forces of evil, a skeptical question or two is posed, like &quot;You recommended an unusually low mandatory dose of psycho-active agents for children caught praying in school ... do you think that is wise&quot;?Thus a conciliatory marketing tone in public books is a hoot. Skeptics continuing Spinozas's quest &quot;not to ridicule but to understand&quot; is reminiscent of OJ Simpson's on-going search for Nichole's real killer on the 16th green.For scholarship and sparkling, intelligent, eyes-wide-open thought on the reasoned basis for God and Christianity, see &quot;Christian Apologetics&quot; (Geisler), &quot;Reasonable Faith&quot; (Craig), &quot;Scaling the Secular City&quot; (Moreland), &quot;Atheism and the Erosion of Freedom&quot; (Morey), &quot;Historical Reliability of the Gospels&quot; (Blomberg)."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"If you've read Skeptic magazine, you've already seen everything in this book which in my opinion says nothing new. I'm an occasional reader of Skeptic and found this utterly disappointing."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"For someone who keeps abreast of all the Science/spirituality literature, this book was a synthesis of other people's words and works, and in itself neither says nor offers anything new..."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"I always find it amusing that skeptics (who Michael Shermer seems famous for being) are able to dissect every pattern of belief around them and yet ignore their own. For example, Michael Shermer and other skeptics such as Paul Kurtz are rabid materialist, meaning they believe that all of reality can be comprehended by purely material means. Well like it or not, studies are pouring in (most notable from Princeton's Robert Jahn and others) that human consciousness can affect &quot;outside&quot; material reality by intent alone in ways which seemingly violate known causation. If this is the case, which I and many others in the area of physics believe , then the argument for God steps up to a higher level. For if intelligent consciousness alone can affect external reality, then what's to say that the universe was not in turn &quot;created, organized, designed, etc.&quot; by an intelligent consciousness? Back to my point, Mr. Shermer has repeatedly said that these studies are faulty (which is an arrogant presumption considering the people doing these studies and their anal-retentive attention to detail). This is a knee-jerk reaction and a clear indicator that his opinions are not shaped by the noble science he holds dear. This book is just another attempt to seperate science as truth and spiritual belief as deluded fantasy. We must realize that dogma has no religious affiliation and infects every endeavor of man."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This book is essencially for Skeptics, or anyone who believes in materialism. It may be interesting to anyone involved in Judaism, Christianity, or Islam and who wants to hear some critique of their belief system. Other than that it truly lacks depth.The book does not deal with Hinduism, Buddhism, or Taoism although it uses the word religion generally. It does not deal with Mysticsm to any length. I believe that the bulk of Skeptics believe that Mysticsm has something to do with a wizard, a pointy hat and a magic wand, or a crying virgin mother marble statue.There is no indepth critique of mysticsm. There is an age old debate between assuming logic and an analysis of logic - particularly in religions such as Zen Buddhism. This is not addressed in the book ..........yet the word religion is used generally.The book is basically about pie-in-the-sky religion. It heralds Science, as the key to find the important questions, but while it addresses the faults with religions, it does not address the basic problem with science and non-quantative experiences."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Shermer stresses that his research, and that of others, has found that the \\"number-one reason people give for why they believe in God is a variation on the classic cosmological or design argument: The good design, natural beauty, perfection, and complexity of the world or universe compels us to think that it could not have come about without an intelligent designer\\" (p. xiv). He then states that he is opposed to believers using \\"science and reason to prove God's existence\\" (p.xiii). Why he is opposed he does not say. My concern is who says that one should not \\"use science and reason to prove God's existence?\\" Is this akin to the 'law' that says only naturalism can be used in science, and that intelligent design is off limits? Who makes up these rules? I have heard this over and over from scientists (mostly evolutionists). Doesn't this rule put limits on science? I was taught in my Ph.D. program in a natural science discipline that science is a search for the truth and no field is off limits including religion. Shermer's subtitle is \\"The Search for God in an Age of Science\\" when it should be \\"Why we cannot Search for God in an Age of Science because the Science Elite have decided that we cannot.\\" Sounds like science has become a religion."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"In yet another tome that proves the intellectual bankruptcy of contemporary atheism, Shermer sets out to prove that all religions are psychological phenomena that ultimately teach the same things. He identifies common themes - like the apocalypse - in all religions, and equates these themes with psychological experiences.Wrong. Religion is not equivalent. Three interrelated faiths - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all deny each other's central doctrines. When we move out from the West, we see such diversity of religious beliefs that no common theme emerges.Religious experience ranges from animism (where you can be healed of your ailments by absorbing the soul of a bird) to certain types of Buddhism that don't even believe in a god. The idea of a common &quot;religion&quot; is simply false - especially when you realize that Atheistic philosophies like Communism and Nazism are fully-functional religions in their own right.Shermer's warmed-over Jungian approach is 100 years out of date."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Whether you are a believer or a non-believer this book is an excellent exploration of the mechanisms of belief. It is neither an attack on religion, nor a promotion for agnosticism. It's a study of our need for belief. In it he explains the creation of certain mythologies and why they keep reoccurring. It also reveals our perceptions of the nature of belief in others and what that says about ourselves. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"I have the same feelings about this book as I do for Shermer's \\"Why People Believe Weird Things.\\" I enjoyed reading both books but felt they were lacking in substance. This book, however, is guiltier of that offense than the former one. In \\"Why We Believe\\" Shermer does a good job of conveying his opinion on god and religion and he does present facts and logical argument to bolster his case. Basically, Shermer considers himself to be an agnostic. However, the agnostic position is an easy one to support. As an agnostic, you are saying that you either don't have enough information to take a position and/or you really don't care either way. One of Shermer's main conclusions seems to be that questions such as, \\"Is there a god?\\" can never be answered with any certainty. Once that position has been taken, it seems pointless to continue the text.Given the title of the book, I expected this book to contain more information on why humans seem to have an innate need to believe in god, afterlives, and the supernatural. Shermer does propose his concept of a \\"belief engine\\" in which this topic is addressed to a certain extent. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt that this topic, which I assumed would be the central thesis of the book, was covered rather briefly.My other main criticism for this book, and his other one, is that the author tends to include chapters that are somewhat off the topic. In this book, for example, Shermer discuss the millennium and all of the hype, paranoia and misguided information about it. This is an interesting and timely topic (given that the book was published in 1999) but it is a departure from the central topic of the book,Although I do have these misgivings about the book, I did enjoy it. Shermer has a nice writing style and it is an enjoyable read. I did like the way that he weaves his own personal experiences and beliefs throughout the book. I thought that the book could have included more \\"substance\\" but I did learn some things. I have no regrets about purchasing, and spending the time to read, the book. If this is a topic that interests you, I think that you will enjoy this book, but keep your expectations low."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This was one of the most fascinating books I have read, everyday I looked forward to it. I was most impressed with Shermer's mastery of multiple and diverse disciplines, my IQ must have gone up a few points from reading such a well written and elegant tome. Its comprehensive style reminded me of Carl Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" because it opened my mind to things I never considered and made me think. I find it difficult to point out what I liked about the book because it has so much to offer however I was moved as Shermer touchingly explained how he has found meaning in a world without god. I too was a Christian once and have gone though the same existential and philosophical struggles. I felt an intellectual and emotion freedom as I read of his appreciation in the awe of the natural world and his coming to understand his place in it as a \\"homo sapiens\\" or \\"wise man\\". Such considerate expression gave me a new understanding of what it means to be a freethinker."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Having grown up only a few miles from Shermer, I found his references to local landmarks, institutions, and locales drew me into his reflections more easily. A dangerous tendency by me, but I found his insistence upon non-theists apart from atheists, and agnostics apart from believers, to be a helpful breakdown of more realistic and flexible categories within which many of us think about the presence or the absence of a deity or force. He makes his arguments clearer by crediting his friends, teachers, opponents, and fellow scholars, and this adds to the humility and credibility of his message. However, I found the chapters uneven in strength, and the book could have been 150 pages and lost a hundred pages of padded--if admittedly interesting--supplemental material.Lacking a stronger editor, therefore, Shermer relates his anecdotes, findings, and research in an accessible manner, avoiding for the most part technical and academic jargon, but his chapters do skip about like different lectures or set-pieces that often feel disconnected from the whole, as with his contingency/necessity explanations, his musings on Ghost Dances and related messianic myths, and his rather sudden incorporation of the Belief Engine into his thesis. The uneveness grows as the book progresses, and weakens the power of his opening arguments.I question his claim (xiii) that \\"Never in history have so many, and such a high percentage of the population, believed in God.\\"Shermer does not footnote this assertion, and while many billions do of course believe in a monotheistic deity today, he cites no worldwide figures to support his claim that this is a higher percentage of the world's peoples than ever before. Yes, perhaps many today had ancestors who were pantheists or animists, but again he does not offer statistics to back up \\"such a high percentage\\" as that he proposes.Likewise, his surveys concentrate on educated (a bias he admits--they tend to return more complicated surveys!) Americans (a bias he in passing acknowledges in nodding only once in passing to lower levels of belief in the rest of the First World). This clouds his findings about levels of faith among scientists and the greater U.S. population alone--which has statistically higher levels of belief than the rest of the industrialized world. Leaving out the rest of the planet, developed and less-so, his findings appear limited and open to debate.On pg. 121, in his otherwise sensible attack on Michael Drosnin's work of psuedo-scholarship \\"The Bible Code,\\" Shermer cites Drosnin's claim \\"that all Bibles in the original Hebrew language that now exist are the same letter for letter.\\" Shermer goes on to prove this is nonsense, but I think he may be taking out of context Drosnin's context, which may be referring rather to the Torah scrolls which are hand-copied letter for letter by scribes--admittedly a different context.On pg. 123, Shermer sums up his argument well: \\"Why do you need science to prove God? You do not. These scientific proofs of God are not only an insult to science; to those who are deeply religious they are an insult to God.\\" Also, on pg. 141, he quotes Edward O. Wilson's \\"reality check\\" for skeptics, which those on Amazon trapped in the imbroglio of trying to use reason to prove or disprove faith should remember: \\"Their crisply logical salvos, endorsed by whole arrogances of Nobel laureates, pass like steel-jacketed bullets through fog.\\"Shermer spends much of the remaining hundred pages off on tangents that intrigue but do not add substantially to the basic argument he has already made: keep the two areas of fides et ratio apart, for neither can convince the other. He does get in some good points taking apart the pros and cons of the current Pope's proclamations on the these two approaches to human inquiry. Shermer, unlike the Pope, insists that we leave each realm up to its adherents. He ends his book in a moving testimony to the sense that a skeptic can carry of the numinous, a fitting resolution to the open-ended embrace this book seeks."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"How We Believe is a nice read--very informative, often fascinating, and very timely. Written in a straightforward style somewhere between Dawkins and Sam Harris, How We Believe should be read right along with The God Delusion and Letter to a Christian Nation. Mr. Shermer publishes some very interesting information about the general characteristics of \\"believers\\" in the U.S. and who are those most likely to have no god belief. He does a nice job of succinctly describing messiah myths and the endemic nature of \\"end-times\\" thinking in cultures throughout the world.There are a few small problems with this book, however. The first is its lack of cohesion. Is Mr. Shermer writing a general interest nonfiction book about god belief in the U.S. or is he addressing specific pet peeves that he's come across in his research? For example; in chapter 6, we are subjected to long quotations from Pope John Paul II and Shermer's feelings about these excerpts. I really didn't care much for this, and I didn't think it was that relevant to the book's theme. The second main problem is similar--Shermer finishes the book discussing contingency theory, and this is as good a way to end the book as any. Unfortunately, this segment is overlong and too focused on responding to Daniel Dennett's response to Stephen Jay Gould.Mr. Shermer could have even left these ideas in his book, but he should have trimmed them down considerably. Keeping all this in mind, How We Believe is a vital and needed addition to the nontheist library. I highlighted (highlit?) many passages as very pertinent to our society's blanket acceptance of patently ridiculous mythology and the reasons behind its folly. Put this one high on your list!"},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This book was great. I read some of the other views which were alot less kind and did point out errors, but I really loved reading this selection nonetheless. Though I can't say that my beliefs mirror the authors, I felt that he is someone who thinks very similar to me, he is a true agnostic. He's honest and not bitter towards religion, and interested in &quot;sacred science.&quot; The term that is probably best, that he uses, is nontheist rather than atheist. On debating (a)theism he has many good points made and refutations, such as that we could not even comprehend God (assuming that He existed) It goes back to using the analogy of explaining the 3rd dimension to 'Flatland.' Theres lots of debunking, he criticizes the most commonly used arguments for theism. (Ouch--some of the same ones I used to use..we all have our pasts) He shows the statistics derived from surveys on Why people believe in God, etc. which makes for some interesting material. And it goes to show that &quot;God is dead&quot; is a very false statement. Religiosity is on the rise in recent times. A couple of his debunking arguments did though make me reconsider some things that I used to agree with to some extent; however its not like he 100% renders them utterly useless...most of the arguments I would never use any way, the others may still remain as subtle evidence, but of course far from 'proof.' So as most books discuss WHY people believe, he surprisingly finds away to discuss HOW we believe, and our belief engines. There is alot of evolutionary perspective to this too, as well as anthropological, and the motifs that appear from us 'story-telling, pattern-seeking animals.' The chapter &quot;The Fire that will Cleanse&quot; is tantamount to a condensed version of Richard Abanes's book &quot;End Time Visions.&quot; (I couldn't believe for a second I found a book that talked about Leland Jensen [leader of the Baha'i Under Provisions of the Covenant] ) With all this he basically looks at the theology we humans created in our history here on earth, and I take it he infers that history will repeat itself. I recommend this to basically anyone, definitely the philosophically inclined and especially those debaters on (a)theism."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"As many other reviewers have already mentioned, Michael Shermer's book, \\"How We Believe\\", is both an interesting and controversial parlay into an often muddy subject. While Shermer's direct, no-holds-barred approach to the topic is refreshing, its often confusing to seperate his firm convictions from firm knowledge. One thing that has always bothered me about his works is that he often confuses Science with philosophical naturalism. While science is a method for gaining knowledge about the world, naturalism is a set of metaphysical assumptions about the world. Shermer often uses the two interchangeably as if they were equivalent.Aside from this the book is very enlightening. Shermer uses a lot of science to back up his naturalistic beliefs and in the process we all get to learn a thing or two about what psychology, evolutionary biology, and sociology have to tell us about how an why we come to believe in just about anything. At the end the day Shermer seems mostly concerned with converting would be \\"believers\\" into skeptics and seems satisfied that he has provided an unassailable case. I find it unlikely that many will be swayed from their positions, unless they are looking to be swayed. Shermer brings home a lot of facts in answering the questions he has proposed but his constant yet subtle reiteration of the conslusion, \\"therefore, theism is false\\", is bound to get on some readers nerves. An excellent and informative read, if only a little biased."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"This brilliantly orchestrated journey into the depths of human emotion and science are a joy for the beleiver and the skeptic. Dr. Shermer examines every facet of the sociological and psychological impact of people and their belief systems. To the keen reader, this book asks hard-hitting and provocative questions as to the nature and depths of those ideals we hold to be truth. While at the same time dissecting pseudo-sciences and archaic models for belief and rationality for what they truly have become: Dying paradigms in a critical thinkers world!! Books such as this have special places in the hearts of those who hold truth to be the ultimate goal of scientists, secularists and religious scholars. A can't miss piece of philosophical examination into the mind of the human animal, and a joy from beginning to end!!"},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Shermer is a former born-again Christian, which is probably why he is more respectful of believers than, say, Richard Dawkins. I'm about half-way through this book, and I can say that it is probably the best book out there for any fence-sitting believers. He doesn't talk down to believers, he doesn't bitterly attack their belief system, and he doesn't try to be partisan. Instead, he gives a well-written, respectful critique of religion. I'd be willing to say that even Pat Robertson couldn't get offended by this book. Shermer's rhetoric is far too respectful and reasonable to draw lines between theists and atheists. He tries to unite both sides instead."},{"Title":"How We Believe: The Search for God in an Age of Science","review":"Please note that the title of the book is &quot;How we Believe&quot; and not &quot;Why we believe&quot; and this is probably why Shermer doesn't cover the notion that you believe because you think it to be true.It must be pointed out that there are some 1500 religious viewpoints in the world and they are all contradictory. It goes without saying that only one of them (if indeed any are) could be true and I fail to see, when every believer thinks his religion IS the truth, why Shermer should give preferential consideration to any one over the other. Either he treats all equally in which case it would be a very long book or he treats belief in itself as something worthy to be investigated.If he pulls arguments from 700 years ago to examine I would suggest that although theists have had millenia they haven't come up with many logical arguments and all the modern ones are essentially variants of the old and hackneyed cosmological, teleological and ontological arguments the which were refuted ages ago. Dress them up all you like but they're still logically flawed.Claims that Shermer is being unscientific don't hold water, if he glosses over Behe maybe it's because he's heard unlike some wishful-thinking theists, that Behe's arguments were in the process of becoming old hat whilst he was writing them and are evaporating like morning dew with the progress of our understanding. Never believe anyone who can claim that their faith is grounded in reason and science, they've kidded themselves and they're trying to kid you."},{"Title":"Lower depths","review":"This is a warning. This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator. The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted. There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it.

This spurs the plot along a bit, because many in the group are hard-bitten realists who have no truck with faith or hope.This is a fine play by Maxim Gorky. Gorky doesn't have the number of famous plays that someone like Henrik Ibsen or George Bernard Shaw does. In fact, he might be better known for his memoir of his childhood than for this play.Nevertheless, The Lower Depths is a great play.

I will agree that he does go out of his way to discredit Grant's drinking. But on the whole these are pretty informative books not as dry as the other review says they are. The two new editions by the University of Nebraska Press have great introductions by Grimsley and Simpson. Simpson gives more credit to Williams than the review here gives. These introductions are excellent. But the volumes are not always about Grant. The Kentucky Invasion is covered in the second volume as is the battle of Murfreesboro. I recommend these books to anyone interested in Grant and/or the Western Theater of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Grant Rises in the West: The First Year, 1861-1862","review":"Kenneth William wrote a series of five books on Ulysses S. Grant in the 1950's. He died before he could complete his supposedly &quot;definitive treatment&quot; of Grant the general. Williams' books are well-researched and you will find few factual gaffes. However, his writing style is often torturous and his passion for meaningless minutiae will probably drive you crazy. He excels in listing every detail of a battle until you're shaking your head or holding it as you reach for the aspirin bottle.Williams' reverence for Grant is evident throughout. He is also peculiarly defensive about the issue of Grant's occasional over-indulgence in whiskey and in his footnotes he becomes almost hysterical on this topic. This type of hagiography is misplaced in a serious work and seriously undermines the credibility of the work. William's five volumes have been pretty much forgotten in the modern era and for good reason. He tells the reader almost nothing about Grant as a human being, his private life (pivotal in Grant's story) is regally ignored throughout.If you are interested in examining Grant as a general, opt for the much superior books by J.F.C. Fuller, available on Amazon. This is a lifeless and boring treatment of a highly complex and fascinating man."},{"Title":"Introduction to type and careers","review":"I was sceptical when I first heard of type theory. I thought it was just another pop psychology fad. It first came to my attention when I joined the MENSA society over 15 years ago and there was a place for the four letter Meyers-Briggs type code in the personal data section (and I didn't know what they were talking about.) So, I looked into it. When I found that it was based on Jung's theories it intrigued me. Maybe there was something to it. I was lucky enough to be able to have it administered professionally at the local community college. I was amazed at what it confirmed about my personality. This simple four letter classification code is actually MEANINGFUL! Until that time, I had pretty much concluded that nothing associated with the academic world could have any real meaning, value, or relevence to actual life and actual people (other than a few extreme, atypical, cases that happened to fit pet theories.)Now I am quite convinced that if you know this code you know volumes about how other people see the world and interact with it. Moreover, it can be huge help in picking careers and environments that are compatible with your own personality. While there is some evolution over time, most people seem to behave \\"true to type\\" thoughout their lifetime. If you would \\"Know Thyself\\", this test, and this booklet, are a excellent place to start.I would like to add two caveats here. First, have this test professionally administired by someone who is certified. It is too important to mess it up. The test taker needs to sit down and concentrate on giving answers that fit how they actually ARE and not how they WANT to be. Secondly, anyone who wrongly uses this test to \\"screen\\" people for employment should be sued out of existance.

Don Camillo is a big, strong man with a hot temper despite being a priest, and he strongly disagrees with communism. The leader of the local communist party and Mayor of the town is an equally strong and hot-tempered atheist called Peppone who believes Christianity and Communism are incompatible. The two constantly fight and resort to all sorts of tricks and schemes to best the other -- Don Camillo to convince Peppone to respect god and the church, Peppone to convince Don Camillo that Communism is the way of the future and that Christianity is standing in the way of progress. Don Camillo often treads a very fine line between defending the church and behaving inappropriately as a priest, and occasionally gets a reprimand from god for going too far, as well as whatever Peppone may have dealt him.The stories are great satire on the follies of people in general, and very funny. I don't believe in god, but if I ever did discover I am wrong and there is a god, I would like him to be Don Camillo's god. The overall message is not anything preachy, but simply the basic goodness of people and the importance of tolerance and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and his flock","review":"okay, til i read the reviews above, I had no idea these were \\"kids\\" stories! duh! Tho' the friend who lent them to me had them as a child: They show how secular politics and religion find common ground through the shared history of the townspeople and our best human nature. Wish more people knew about them."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and his flock","review":"I read most or all Don Camillo books as a kid. I loved them then and I love them now. Only one of those books survived in my collection so I'm glad they're available through Amazon. These books were originally my father's and I have no idea where he found them. These books have been circulating around in my family's and friend's homes forever, and must be like the most often read of all of our books.I used to reach out to these books whenever I needed a good laugh. Still I think the books often send out a story of love and loyalty towards the reader as well. When push comes to shove the villagers stick together against outsiders and common enemies. This of course while trying to outsmart and get the upperhand over each other in the process.While there's a lot to laugh about in the books there are also more serious issues dealt with in the books as well. I'm sure that these books will appeal to both the younger and the older generations. If you don't know these books, please pick up one and I guarantee that you will be in for a real treat. Don Camillo books are entertainment at its finest."},{"Title":"Don Camillo and his flock","review":"I grew up with this book- it's children's fiction at its best- witty and readable at the ripe old age of 23. Adults may even enjoy it more than kids, but it presents an even-handed and sympathetic portrait of &quot;the little world&quot;- the Po valley in Italy. It's unfortunate that it's not read more often. i'm told that Guareschi was very well loved by a generation of European children, regardless of nationality. If in doubt, just get it!"},{"Title":"Don Camillo and his flock","review":"Don Camillo books are such wholesome treasures. The first time I read the series was more than 25 years ago and I wanted to revisit them. They were still fresh and applicable in many ways to our day to day lives. Don Camillo's eternal rivals are the Italian communists of the day. A communist Italian sounds like a joke today and the Don was the first to see it in his day, I suppose. (How can you make a communist from an Italian? This impossibility becomes quite obvious in the visit to the former USSR.)When I was reading it again I could not help finding parallels with the corporate bureaucracy and its systems that we created in the past decade or two. The tactics to maintain the corporate bureaucracy seemed quite similar to those humorously described in Don Camillo's world. A very entertaining read, that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Northwood Carnival Glass: 1908-1925 Identification & Value Guide","review":"Another great book by Mr Burns!

One of the interesting notes in the book was that the author was among those who did not survive the *Titantic* disaster. The stories are in line with Sherlock Holmes, only slightly updated...one involved a wonderful prison break that would make ANYone think. It's definately worth reading if you can find it. It's a shame the author had his career cut short or he would have been more well known."},{"Title":"Best Thinking Machine Detective Stories","review":"It is always difficult to get out-of-print books. Because of that I should like to point on the only available book about Futrelle: The Thinking Machine : Jacques Futrelle by Freddie Seymour, Bettina Kyper (Introduction)\\". You will find it in Amazon.com under Title Word = Futrelle.\\""},{"Title":"Best Thinking Machine Detective Stories","review":"Just by chance, I'm writing this review on the 100-year anniversary of Jacques Futrelle's death. He went down on the Titanic on April 15, 1912. In a heroic last act, he pushed his wife into a life boat, refusing to save his own life.Futelle's literary survival is due to his memorable character Professor Van Dusen - The Thinking Machine. The Professor's great cerebral gifts follow the tradition of Sherlock Holmes. But his diminutive body, enormous head, perpetually crabbed voice, petulant expression, and squinty blue eyes behind thick glasses lend him a character all his own. A world famous scientist, Van Dusen occasionally applies his wonderful analytic brain to solving insolvable crimes. He likes nothing better than to crack a perfect alibi or expose a carefully camouflaged plot.Often he makes use of an eager newshound, Hutchinson Hatch, to gather facts. This character feels very real, probably because of Futelle's own work as a newspaper man. Cops and criminals also ring true. Even Van Dusen's superpowers are reality-based, arising from logic, imagination, and keen insight into human nature. Futelle was a pioneer of realism in the literature of detection.In the lead story, \\"The Problem of Cell 13,\\" Van Dusen claims he can think his way out of any jail cell - and agrees to be locked up in a maximum security prison. The story was published serially in 1905. With the first installment readers were challenged to guess how the Professor would do it, and cash prizes were offered. (An early advertising promotion!)Although Futelle's fame rests upon this one piece, he devised many other ingenious Thinking Machine stories, as this collection demonstrates. I heartily recommend it to fans of vintage detective fiction. The Dover edition is good quality and includes a short but illuminating introduction."},{"Title":"Best Thinking Machine Detective Stories","review":"I misremembered reading a novel entitled THE THINKING MACHINE while in high school. I recalled enjoying it and wanted to reread it. It was an ordeal to find it. From Amazon, I purchased the wrong book (THE THINKING MACHINE by Pfeiffer).* As a result of expressing my frustration to a friend, I received a gift of these short stories. My memory from 1966 was incorrect! The book was a series of short stories and not a single novel.The book represents a WONDERFUL series of 12 short stories. I read them while on the exercise machine. The stories are intense and I can forget that I am exercising. Of the 12, I was able to predict the ending of the following:The Problem of the Stolen RubensThe Phantom MotorI would have predicted \\"The Fatal Cipher\\" correctly, but because of cultural differences between now and then, I missed the key element of motivation. I found that I enjoyed the stories that I could NOT predict better than the ones I could.

I read it because Nancy Mc Williams recomends it as secondary literature on the subject in her book \\"Psuchoanalytic Diagnosis\\".For Guntrip the schizoid defence is at the core of all psychopathology. It is also the key to understand the human condition. He writes on page 12 of the 1992 edition:\\"...that the basic anxiety-producing conflicts in human beings are not over 'gratifications of desires' but over the frightening struggle to maintain themselves in existence at all as genuine individual persons.\\" He builts on Winicotts notions of \\"true Self\\" and \\"False Self\\" and Fairbairs inner model in which the schizoid reaction is a sort of retreat of the \\"pristine\\" Self as a flight from \\"bad object relations\\". The part that is left \\"behind\\" to deal with the world is the \\"distant\\", mechanical, schizoid Self.The aim of the therapy is to connect with \\"non-communicating central Self, for ever immune from the reality priciple, and for ever silent. Here communication is non-verbal..absolutely personal. It belongs to beeing alive.\\" (Winnicott) Beeing able to connect to that part means opening up to ones \\"beeing\\". Page 271: \\"There cannot be a whole complete human beeing whithout an integration of feeling with thinking and acting, provided by \\"doing\\", arising spontaneously out of the fundamental experience of \\"being\\".

The biggest disappointment was the Shopping Guide section which, according to the front of the book, \\"features shopping lists for fat-flushing foods\\". They are merely bulleted lists of foods used in each phase of the plan, grouped by category (vegetables, proteins, etc.) It would have been more helpful to have actual shopping lists by week, based on the plan menus."},{"Title":"The Fat Flush Journal and Shopping Guide (Gittleman)","review":"This is a journal in which you write your thoughts for the day; what you ate; what exercises you did, etc. From the beginning, I wasn't interested in the shopping guide. To me, that isn't the important part of the book. I've been using this journal since January 2007. I get about 6 weeks in one book. I'm on my fourth. I find this to be a healthy tool. Every day I record what I have eaten; my exercise routine; any problems with my health; my thoughts on how I did for the day. I end my journaling on a positive note. I always find something good that I did for the day, even if I totally screwed up. There is always something positive that you can find. The journal helps me to focus on those positives. Each day starts with a positive quote from a well-known person for motivation. Then there's a weekly journal page for you to record your measurements and your thoughts on how you did for the week. Helps you to plan goals and rewards. The price for this book is really low. I've taken a look at a couple of other journals (Stong Women has one), and they are around $15. So, this is a bargain. I give it four stars because I didn't need the shopping guide, and would have liked to have used them for journal pages instead.

If you're planning on buying this book primarily for the Shopping guide to make grocery shopping list etc. Do not buy it. But for just a journal to keep track of eating habits, (Whether you write them down before you eat or after, I'm doing before because it gives me a plan to go by) to keep track of daily exercising, reflections, Sleep time ,etc. For that , it is a perfect Journal, but not at all much of a shopping guide. Like a previous reviewer stated, there are simply bulleted lists of foods used in each phase of the plan, grouped by category (vegetables, proteins, etc.), and this only takes up about 12 pages in the back of the book, the rest are journal pages to last you 6 weeks. But overall I still give this only a 3 because it is perfect Journal wise and even has motivational quotes and reminders for every day of the 6 weeks it provides you a Journal for. BUT it would be much more helpful and less time consuming if they provided a vivid shopping list for every 2 weeks of the plan or so, or at least blank lined pages where you could make your own to tear out."},{"Title":"The Fat Flush Journal and Shopping Guide (Gittleman)","review":"Ann Louise has really thought of everything!

It's small size makes it convenient for quick reference for allowable foods for each phase of the plan. Yes, at any given time I have TWO! Even a SEVEN year Flusher like me can forget what phase certain veggies and herbs and spices are in, so I keep one in the kitchen and one in my car for food shopping trips. The well organized lists also help me to add variety to my meals by reminding me to select foods I haven't had for awhile or perhaps never even tried. No room for food boredom on this plan!The journal portion of the book is fabulous. Admittedly, I don't journal all the time, but when I feel I need to reframe due to an extra busy lifestyle or stress, this journal becomes a very good friend. I especially love the progress notes page located at the end of every week. Sometimes it's hard to notice progress on a daily basis, but that summary is a great way to see just how far I've come in such a short time!I heartily recommend this smart little book...and if you're like me, you'll want to order two!"},{"Title":"The Fat Flush Journal and Shopping Guide (Gittleman)","review":"The Fat Flush Journal and Shopping Guide is a wonderful resource.

All of those \\"bites\\" and \\"handfuls\\" of junk food throughout the day were sabotaging my health and my weight. When I started Fat Flush, I decided to keep track of what I was REALLY eating, and honestly, that's what has kept me focused. When I started to let myself cheat, I remembered that I would have to write it down, and that would make me think twice. Also, as someone who sometimes gets busy and forgets to eat the important stuff (protein, breakfast, etc.) this was what made me take the time to eat something! As one of the other reviewers said, it's reasonably priced (about the price of a regular journal) and has the legal food lists, so it makes for a great on-the-go guide that I keep in my purse to stay on plan when I'm out and about. Just seeing it in there is a good reminder! And...the best part of all is going back through it and seeing how far you've come from the beginning!

This would be, in my opinion the most complete, informative and unbiased work on the subject.The book covers just about everything most readers would like covered on Serial Murder. It covers fact, fiction, history, definitions, in fact everything you could imagine. I could not believe just how much is packed into the 380 odd pages.Not only is the book a wealth of knowledge on the subject (and many related areas eg Stalking, Insanity Defences) but is also loaded with 'Profiles' of many individuals (and teams) to illustrate the area under discussion. Many tables also provide interesting reading.The book also looks at the phenomina of Serial Murder in countries other than the USA.Another thing I really like is the way Hickey presents various aspects and theories. Hickey discusses all the theories, views etc along with their apparent strenghts and weaknesses. For example, other authors I have read flatly dump the FBI Psychological Profiling Model. Hickly presents all the pros and cons on the topic in a very unbiased manner.This book is not just a good book, it is a great book. It is a 'must have' in your collection, if this is your area of interest or you really want to learn about it. If someone asked me for just one book to read on Serial Murder, this would be the one. It covers so many topics within a topic, yet it is concise and very readable. The average person with no knowledge on this topic would walk away with a good 'working knowledge'.I have read the book twice and have now been drawn back to a third read.I will now be searching for other works by this author and congratulate him on a 'classic'."},{"Title":"Serial Murderers and Their Victims (with CD-ROM) (Contemporary Issues in Crime and Justice Series.)","review":"Hickey has written one of the most comprehensive books on this enigmatic phenomenon.

I came to this institution specifically as a matter of curricula, and I must say that after a review of the literature both broad and exhaustive Dr. Hickey's book is the closest thing we have to the reality of our special killers' doctrine. What is most compelling about this piece of literature is the open mentality that is greatly lacking in nearly every other book out there. We have relied to a great extent on the works of the FBI and, in a much more aniquated way, the works of Freud and the general positivists.This text is certainly a sociological treatise, but even more so it underlines the issues inherent in both criminology and a general study of human nature. What should be garnered from this read is what we DON'T know as compared to what we do. One must applaud Dr. Hickey for his ability to admit that the evaporative quality of this field of study is prevalent and must be dealt with.Of particular interest is the discussion of the mythology surrounding \\"serial killers\\" and the true affect with which they operate. Take these things for what they are worth and you are left with many questions. I have no doubt in my mind that this was the objective of Dr. Hickey, and is ideally the objective of any social scientist. Those who wish to comprehend the nature of serial killers will not find all their answers here, but they may find some questions that our humanity dearly needs to be addressed; the most important part."},{"Title":"Serial Murderers and Their Victims (with CD-ROM) (Contemporary Issues in Crime and Justice Series.)","review":"This book is required reading for a Justice Studies class I am taking at Arizona State University....

NCLB requires that all children progress in the general curriculum. Teaching Every Student in the Digital Age lays the theoretical groundwork and offers practical examples and recommendations on how digital technologies can be used to break down barriers to learning that impair the performance of many students.Authors Rose and Meyer cite two converging dynamics at play that are helping eliminate such barriers: one is the discoveries of neural science that explain the great diversity in student learning; the other is the growth in digital technologies. As they see it, digitization makes possible a rich array of media that are beginning to match the complex of ways that students learn and express that learning.Rose and Meyer urge material developers to follow principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Just as buildings today are designed to be accessible to all, without added ramps, so say the authors, educational materials should be created without barriers to content. If type is a barrier, alternative routes to content (such as audio, enlarged type, or shifts in foreground and background color) can and should be provided.As I noted, this book has an excellent balance between theory and practice. It is supported by a rich Web site (http://www.cast.org/teachingeverystudent) and would make an excellent text for pre-service or in-service programs."},{"Title":"Teaching Every Student in the Digital Age: Universal Design for Learning","review":"The Universal Design for Learning will have to have administration support for it to succeed.

I couldn't have been more wrong. Laura's book is a delightful addition to other tomes such as 'Mastering the Art of French Cookery' but much less intimidating to the average cook. The steamed fish dish 'Pink & Green Papillotes' has already entered family legend and is indicative of her elegant but simple style of cooking. Laura has captured the essence of French food without the fussy touches. Try and catch the TV show of the same name as well."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I must admit that whilst this book is what I ordered, it is quite different from what I anticipated! Having watched Laura Calder's TV series which is called 'French Food at Home', I assumed that this book would have all the recipes from the series. Unfortunately it has not - it is still a reasonably good book but not what I had hoped for and is therefore a little disappointing! Also it is printed in a very cheap form, without any pictures of recipes and not even one of Laura Calder, and one feels that this book was very cheaply put together. I realise that the price wasn't very expensive although when converted into our NZ $$$ plus postage etc. it became quite expensive. Maybe more information on the web page would have helped - a picture of the book and a sample of the recipes! I do like almost everything that Laura Calder does so I will use this book, but it just wasn't what I was expecting!"},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I love cooking and I have a lot of cooking books.

Her TV show is an international success, but this book did not do well because it was introduced when all things named French were unpopular in this country, and it had no pictures. The recipes are excellent, however. The book gives one the feeling of enjoying an aperitif at the home kitchen island while a talented cook prepares dinner and shares her tips and her personality with her guests.

Her narrative style of cooking and her easy-going demeanor are what drew me to her recipes. This book definitely will not disappoint if you have seen her show before and just picture her cooking the recipes. But you will have to do a lot of imagining because there are no pictures, of anything. I think that was my biggest disappointment with this book. I like looking at pictures to get a sense of what the end result of recipes will be and just to ogle at the food while reading a cookbook in bed.I have to admit I don't think I've made any of the recipes in the book yet, but they all seem pretty simple. And note, simple does not mean quick. It means easy to prepare, with few ingredients and not a lot of fuss. Most of the recipes are good for slow, weekend cooking; they are definitely not \\"30-minute meals.\\" Also, most of the ingredients should be recognizable to the home cook, nothing really jumped out at me that seemed ultra exotic or new, so I assume most people will be able to find all of the ingredients in their local grocery store.**I plan on updating this review once I have tried some of the recipes in my own kitchen."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"after 30 years of cooking and thinking there was nothing new under the sun, along comes this simple little nougat of pure delight and whimsy...just what this tired and cynical cook needed to lift his culinary spirit. the best cooks have a kind of spiritual connection with their craft and it's obvious that laura still has the devotion to inspire others to move onward and upward. i've loved chasing down guinea hens, hay and a world of spices as if i am not only cooking a lovely meal but engaged in a scavenger hunt as well. not to worry, dear reader, most recipes you can pull together from your local safeway store.thanks for a really fun book...and teaching me how to de-bone a bird."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I feel if a new cookbook has at least one recipe I can use, it's a worthwhile purchase.

If she is delightful in person as she is in print, I would be in for a real treat. French Food At Home has turned me into a fan of French cooking -- at least the way Laura does it. Who ever would have thought that these simple recipes could yield such succulent results?! You know a meal is good when you can't help but smile from its deliciousness in mid bite. But this is French Food At Home throughout. I've made the Pineapple Tuilles, Summer Lentil Salad, Thyme Licks, Leek Tart, Spiced Almonds, Coffee Chop and all were hits. And remember not to skimp on the ingredients as this is key.

Bon Appetit!"},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"What a gift for those of us with neither the time nor the patience for classical French technique! From the \\"helpful hints\\" to the wry comments, this book makes French cooking a lot of fun, not just accessible. I have yet to make anything that disappointed even my finicky five-year old. And with the increasing emphasis on fresh, seasonal fare, this book has been a great source of ideas for things to do with (even more) tomatoes, corn, peaches, etc., etc. No matter your skills, or lack thereof, in the kitchen, you will find yourself reaching for this book again and again."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I am a big fan of Laura Calder's show of the same name (on the Lifestyle Food channel here in Australia). She is great fun, quirky, a real Francophile, and cooks great French food easily and with charm.Her scrambled eggs made just with butter and separated eggs is some of the best food I've ever cooked or eaten.It was because I wanted to have that recipe (and others like it) that I bought this cookbook. I was disappointed to find that the egg recipe she has in the book is not the same as the one on the show.I was also disappointed that the book is all text. I was expecting to have pictures of the finished dishes at least.So, I'm afraid the book has left me a little disappointed because the show had set my expectations much higher."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"This is a fantastic book both to read as well for its recipes and cooking advice. Laura Calder obviously enjoys feeding her friends good, simple and delicious food without any fuss - not difficult, ornate French dishes that may keep you in the kitchen all day . Her recipes are at the same time simple to understand, easy to execute and simply delicious. I have used her recipes to put together several dinner parties for my friends, and I didnt spend the day or the evening in the kitchen. Her writing is both warm an funny - an excellent read in itself! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I don't know why this book has been overlooked, but it is a treasure. Laura's writing style is light and personal; reading along, you come to feel that you're cooking with a good friend in the kitchen. Of the recipes I've tried, all have been stellar. I've modified her lemon tart recipe with a different crust; it is by far the best lemon tart I have ever tasted. The recipes aren't fancy, either, in terms of effort in the kitchen, but the dishes look and taste like you're a food guru. Lemon Spinach, for example, is way simpler than pie, but elevates this vegetable from its usual sorry heap into something bright and mysterious. Savory Carrot Cake, a recipe I've seen nowhere else, is a marvelous, light velvety concoction that makes everything else on the plate taste better. I don't understand it, but there it is. Best of all, she demystifies Tarte Tatin, the French version of apple pie. That alone is worth the price of admission, but to top it off, nearly all of the recipes are healthy and good for you (but you know you're going to eat that walnut tart anyway).I have shelves full of cookbooks. This is one of four books that I regularly return to."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I first found this book in the library, and was enjoying cooking from it so much that I didn't want to take it back. I've gone and gotten myself a copy, and cooked many of the recipes from it, and each one has been delicious and fairly simple to make. The instructions are clear, and as others have mentioned, she's a very engaging and amusing writer. I have a lot of cookbooks, but this has quickly become a favorite."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"The real magic in this great book is that it's approachable and inventive. It's full of things you'll actually make. Things that taste good and look good. But don't let the simplicity fool you--the flavors are fresh and surprising. And Calder's heatnotes are a joy. Encore!"},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"Laura Calder has written a miraculous cookbook. She has taken the mystery and difficulty out of cooking French food at home. The recipes are inventive, clear and easy to make. And taste nothing short of fantastic. Plus, her writing style is engaging, knowledgable and eminently readable. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough for anyone who loves to food and loves to cook."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I really loved this book for the most part - it is well written and her recipes are not complicated. She makes french food seem less intimidating. I have made the Salmon Camembert (delicious), Wine Sausages (easy and rich), Beet Stacks (impressive - a burst of different, complex flavors and very gorgeous to look at); as well as the Potato Gratin and The Lemon Tart Of My Dreams. The last two recipes have some minor problems - both were rather runny - especially the tart. The tart had the best flavor of any lemon tart I have ever had, but I was disappointed with the texture. It might either need to be cooked a little longer than the directions, it may need a thickener of some sort - or it may simply need to rest overnight in the refrigerator. I am not sure which is the best way to correct this. I will try it again and try to perfect this thing. The taste alone is worth the effort!Other than those minor problems, everything in this book is doable and I will certainly be trying more!"},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"I bought this book when it first came out in 2004 and have cooked from it extensively. Not only is Ms. Calder's writing fun, personal, and interesting, her recipes are really great. For example, she offers a recipe for Carrot Juice Chicken -- chicken cooked, yes, in carrot juice. In the introductory paragraph to that recipe, she states that she saw the recipe demonstrated by a famous chef and thought, \\"Yuck!\\", but she tried it anyway and found it to be wonderful. So did I. She has another recipe later in the book for carrots cooked in carrot juice, which is a great thing to do with all that carrot juice you bought or made, and those carrots go splendidly -- just as she says! -- with the Tuna in Fragrant Water, another very good dish. I've made the Beet Stacks, Pistou Zucchini Ribbons, and Fennel Salad (all in the \\"first courses\\" section) many times over, and these are always well received and are fresh, delicious ways to start a meal.The book is organized in a very helpful way: Aperitifs (including some alcoholic ones), first courses (including salads), \\"dinner fairly fast\\" (which I have personally used a lot), \\"dinner somewhat slower\\", side dishes, and desserts. We do not eat many desserts in our home, so I have tried few of Calder's dessert recipes; however, the wine-poached pears (a French classic) are wonderful and can be made while you are making the rest of dinner.I disagree with other reviewers that it is disappointing that there are no photos. I buy cookbooks for the recipes, which is my number one consideration, and secondly for the writing. Calder is a very good writer, which more than makes up for the lack of illustrations and photos. Her instructions are very clearly written, and I like that she makes a fair number of suggestions about food pairings. The absence of photos actually gives me more incentive to be creative in the presentation.A couple of the recipes in the book that I have tried were disappointing. The Sea-Salt Salmon was more mess than it was worth. The Alsatian Potato Salad was too oily, but that can be easily corrected. One of the best features of this book, however, is how inventive, unusual and contemporary many of the recipes are. Not everyone's taste will agree with Ms. Calder's.I highly recommend buying and cooking from this book. And thank you to Laura Calder for sharing this fine collection of recipes and your knowledge with us enthusiastic Francophile home cooks."},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"The recipes are great, HOWEVER, this is about the worse version of an ebook as I have seen. The recipes are not listed individually by names and/or main ingredients ( I.e beef, chicken, etc). There are no hyperlinks for anything and to top things off, the indexing is wrong so you have to do a search for anything you happen to find in the index.I feel \\"ripped off\\" by Harper Collins and will NEVER purchase another ebook from them!...a \\"Scan of a physical book, is not an ebook\\""},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"Nice book BUT ... with no pictures.

It is ordered. I have experienced, however, something arguably even better than the book - the muse herself, first hand. She is presently enrapturing audiences in this corner of South-East Asia with 'French Food at Home' on BBC Lifestyle and it is about the only television I have to see apart from the odd documentary or drama (and neither of these are sufficiently common in Hong Kong).Laura Calder is spectacularly beautiful but less obviously conscious of the fact - hmmm Nigella! - looks the fresh and faultless epitome of French elegance, and apparently can sample and eat her most deliciously calorific food without putting on a single gramme of avoirdupois despite a plentiful use of butter, cream and all those necessary ingredients to la bonne cuisine.Her food is French - absolutely so - but it is as inspired and as modern and still as authentic as only the best French cuisine can be. It is light years away from the dreadful messes that Fanny Craddock used to pass off as haute cuisine, and is redolent of happiness, joy and conviviality. This is the cooking of a person who loves her family and friends, and who loves little better than cooking for them.My maternal grandmother was French, and I learnt to cook from her.

The biggest question which occurs to me at the get go is why write a 229 page book on a subject which has been covered in so much greater detail in the1270 pages of \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking', the great cookbook classic by Julia Child, et. al. If that was not enough, you have the legions of volumes by Ms. Child's disciples such as Patricia Wells, Susan Hermann Loomis, Ina Garten, Amanda Hesser, and a dozen lesser lights who have touched on this subject. And, that doesn't even touch the professional chef's contributions to the genre with such prominent names such Thomas Keller (\`Bouchon') and Tony Bourdain (\`Le Halle Cookbook'). Last but not least are the books by professional teachers such as James Peterson, Jacques Pepin, Anne Willan, Richard Olney, and Madeline Kammen. So why add a new book to this very long list.My puzzlement was doubled when I noticed that many of the recipes in this book are chestnuts which appear in virtually all general books on French recipes, not to mention the tomes put out by \`Betty Crocker', \`Better Homes and Gardens', and Martha Stewart. Exactly how many recipes do you need for Tapenade, Crudites, Gougeres, Tuiles, Hot Mussels (moules mariniere), Hollandaise, Endive Salad, Ratatouille, Tarte Tatin, and on and on and on!Then I started to read Ms. Calder's headnotes and noticed that Miss Laura has a sense of humor about her writing. I can't give her complete credit for this, as a lightness and humor comparable to her famous high spirits on her TV shows also distinguish the great Julia's writing. But aside from Julia Child and, among writers of French cookbooks, Tony Bourdain, there may be just a little too much seriousness about cooking.I also discovered a few recipes that did have a strong novelty about them, as with \`duck on a string'. In some of the classics, I also noticed a fairly high level of ingenuity in giving special twists to classics, such as the tapenade rolled into a spiral with pastry.The author is also pleasantly realistic about the fact that cooking some dishes simply does take time. To this end, she provides main courses in two different chapters, one entitled \`Dinner Fairly Fast' and the other entitled \`Dinner Slightly Slower'. Like the better \`fast cooking' apostles, Ms. Calder's fast dishes are classics which are easy to prepare without introducing any artificial shortcuts. These include lots of fish and egg dishes. The slower dishes are braises roasts, gratins, and tarts, among other things. One of the most interesting recipes in this section is entitled \`Housewife Chicken' where a 3 pound bird can be cooked on top of the stove, en casserole, with veggies thrown in for good measure.There are a number of better than average sidebars on techniques such as how to debone a chicken. Unfortunately, there are no pictures, so you are probably much better off going to Monsieur Pepin or Herr Peterson for some illustrated guidance.One page Ms. Calder takes from Patricia Wells' book is that many of her recipes are cribbed directly from major French chefs. The most common contributor is Michael Bras whose three star recipes are turned into something easy for the average amateur.I am really happy I found and read this book, but the extent to which it duplicates material in many other books makes it difficult to know if the book is really worth the cost. For someone who owns no books on French recipes, and who just wants to see what all the excitement is about, I strongly recommend the book. It is entertaining and it has many of the recipes which made French cookery famous. For someone who owns and has assimilated one or more major good books on French cooking, you may want to save your money for a more complete book such as Madeleine Kammen's \`The Making of a Cook' or a book with more different recipes, such as Patricia Wells' books on the cooking of Provence.This book gives a pretty fresh look to a very well worn path!"},{"Title":"French Food at Home","review":"A nice read with French cooking simplified to a normal home cooking level.

Lincoln Rec is a constant for him, a positive one, unlike that series of light-colored minivans that have repeatedly arrived at the group home over the years carrying foster parents who pick him up, make him big promises about a real home...promises that for various reasons always go up in smoke and leave him, once again, chillin' back at the group home.Court one is where he, a seventeen-year-old white boy, builds his skills playing an extremely physical style of pickup basketball with an assortment of tough, older black guys. On court one, where either you are seriously in the zone or you're spending all day with your butt in the bleachers, Sticky is determined to play and win.As Dante, a former pro player and a regular at Lincoln Rec explains to him, Sticky has started the \\"life being a race\\" thing \\"three stones back.\\" Not only has Sticky had to deal with the failings of his drug-addicted, prostitute mother and, later, with those repeated rejections by foster parents, but he also has \\"that mental thing, where you gotta do stupid stuff over and over and over.\\" The depictions of Sticky's frequent ritualistic behaviors, revealing his struggles with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, are agonizing. But, ironically, it is that same compulsion that keeps him so focused on constantly perfecting his skills, whether they be related to basketball or to other, less noble, pursuits.\\"Won't you help me girlJust as soon as you can?\\"--Al GreenThere's the bright high school girl with the beautiful green eyes, Anh-thu, who works in Miller's Outpost. Sticky meets her one day when he drops in there to steal some new pants. \\"Annie\\" seems able to see through the hard shell to the real Sticky.The story bounces back and forth from Lincoln Rec to scenes of Sticky's early days with his mother, the different experiences with foster families, playing J.V. hoops at school, hanging out partying with the guys, and being with Anh-thu. All together, there must be a hundred different characters we meet, and each one is unique and memorable. A number of those characters are homeless, some sleeping on cardboard on court two, others in a public toilet somewhere. Sticky's world is on the underbelly side of L.A. And regularly we get glimpses of the \\"other world\\" in the form of faceless businessmen who come walking in on their lunch break to watch what's going on and then return to their offices to tell their co-workers about the games, the fights, and, undoubtedly, about the skinny white kid with the moves.\\"Rob's weight is on the back of his heels on defense. Waiting.\\"The face rattles off truth in situations like this. Fear flickering in Rob's wide eyes: Get too close and Sticky sticks a jumper in his eye. Too many possibilities when the man with the ball gets to say which way and when, how fast and for how long. And you can multiply all that by ten if the guy can play. Get busted on in front of everybody. Get dragged all game by the skinny white kid everybody talks about.\\"All the loudmouths on the sideline are at full attention.\\"Sticky jab-steps right and pulls back, keeps his dribble.\\"Rob retreats.\\"Sticky is: through the legs, around the back, playing hoops with a yo-yo. Walk the dawg when everybody calls for a trick. Hold the ball too long.\\"He is: stolen Nike shoes, stolen mesh shorts, ankle socks. Back and forth handling the ball, knees bent, his eyes in Rob's eyes. Piss off the old purists who cry for a return to fundamentals. The ones who've lost so much vision they're blind to the dance of it all. The spin move like a skirt lifting pirouette on callaused toes. The dip. Jump shot splashing through the net like a perfect dismount.\\"A damaged white teenager, a bunch of tough black \\"ballers,\\" a dark rec center in L.A., and the girl with the eyes come together to make this gritty, urban story a powerful, rhythmic read. The thrumming beats and the sweat dripping out from between the pages also place author Matt de la Pena squarely in contention for Rookie of the Year honors.You'll see this on my Best of 2005 list later this year."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"This book is really beautifully written. It's poetic and flashy and ultra hip. But the story is what makes it a great novel. Sticky's reality will break your heart. His passion, his inability to relate to others. But in the end it's all about redemption. You will be touched by this novel."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"This novel has as much heart as anything I've ever read. The main character, Sticky, isn't trying to be anybody, he's just trying to survive. The narrator doesn't judge him one way or another, he just presents him to the reader. And you feel for Sticky because he's so real. He has so much heart--even though he doesn't want anybody to see it. I fell in love with this incredible work of fiction. You will, too."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"What a phenomenal book! I hope there is a sequel because I fell in love with Sticky. Mr. de la Pena is a gifted writer."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"...and listen, don't get me wrong, this is a book about ball. Crack open the binding and you'll find the best basketball writing I've ever read. You'll see Sticky dribbling left, sliding right, spinning to the hoop for a sweet layup. You'll see him looking like a pinball, bouncing off one defender after another on his way in for the score. You'll see him pull up on the break and drop nothing but net. You'll see him shatter egos and leave guys busted all over the dark courts of Los Angeles. But there's more to it than that. There's more to it than basketball, just like there's more to the game than scoring. This book is also about love. The love a boy feels for a girl. For his friends. The love that starts from nothing, that creeps up slow on you until one day you realize you love this place, this thing, these people. This place you never stopped to think about. These people you hardly know. It's about falling in love and being in love and doing anything in the world for the sake of love. It's about the love between a mother and her son. Between a son and his mother.And of course, it's about the love of the game."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"Sticky is one of the most original literary characters I've come across in a long time. He rarely speaks. He doesn't relate well to others. He's alone even when he's surrounded by people. He's OCD. But underneath all that he's an incredibly talented and vulnerable kid. Throughout the book I wanted to reach into the story and take care of him, make sure he was okay. De la Pena has created an unbelievably real adolescent boy. Beautiful book."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"..it doesn't take much to fall IN LOVE with this book (or the author for that matter.) Aside from the eloquent writing; the kind that makes you feel like you are inside a movie..the author captures every part of every character. Paints beautiful pictures. Sets up all the scenes perfectly. You know Sticky because you feel him. You become part of his world; part of his pain and witness his raw, unedited, without limits and boundaries kind of passion for finding and understanding love, and for basketball. After I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend!!!"},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"Ball Don't Lie is a gritty, fast paced novel filled with sweetness. You'll be enthralled from the first page to the final buzzer. Great story, wonderfully rich characters, and fantastic writing. A must read."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"It is a shame that this novel hasn't gotten more recognition in the literary world. True it has appeared on a couple very notable best-of lists, but it deserves more. No reviews in any major newspapers, no evaluation in the major literary journals, and no pub in the pedestrian sports books like Sports Illustrated and ESPN. That's a disgrace. It merits prominent attention from the tastemakers. Sports fans consistently beg for prose and films that are faithful and sincere depictions of the world they revere with unbridled, rampant passion. Literary folks, in turn, constantly, and quietly, whisper on college campuses, at book readings and within intellectual circles about the pathos of modern fiction. Yet, here sits on the shelves of Amazon a debut, which should be considered groundbreaking and ingenuous to these two separate sets that could not be on further ends of the flavor spectrum.A reader can feel simultaneously honored and stupefied by the prose of de la pe&ntilde;a. Honored because a stranger is ushered comfortably into a world of truth and stupefied because this same candid world can feel so foreign to our \\"normal\\" emotional barometer. Venice, CA is a magical place to anyone who has stepped off the well-treaded boardwalk and into the tangled vines of class, dreams and race on its narrow, overgrown streets. de la pe&ntilde;a not only steps, he stomps into these neighborhoods, pulling no punches as he acts as a literary translator to the hieroglyph of Venice culture on the papyrus of constricted beach walk-thrus, unrecognized sandy ghettos and voiceless orators of working-class ethos. This author is a troublemaker.Venice has always been an eccentric enclave by the sea that attracts and rears troublemakers. Usually these so-called troublemakers are castaways from the mainstream. Aging hippies, counter-culture punk-rock surfers, gangsters, skaters, and visionary \\"deadbeats\\" historically have made Venice their home. These folks had no place in Outback Steakhouse Americana, so they found their way to a milieu where they could safely and loudly challenge the status quo. After all, Venice had the first major pocket of African-American owned land in Los Angeles (Ghost Town) and Dogtown essentially birthed the X-Games lifestyle here. Folks come to Venice to find themselves and then let the world know that they are here in the most unique and idiosyncratic of voices.Sticky is a hoarse foster kid that needs to be heard. On the surface, he is a typical Venice knucklehead, looking to throw down with society because that is what is expected of a troublemaker who's been dealt a foldable hand. But dig deeper with de la pe&ntilde;a and find a wounded soul in need of a venue to squeeze out some kind of meaningful expression. Like most Venice residents, he burns to take on the median with defying, counter-culture articulation. To do something meaningful, this kid with literally nothing needs magic and, luckily for him, he resides on the streets of a magical enclave.Basketball, and more specifically the sports' necessary skills honed on the streets, has long been a barometer of heart. Many have stepped on asphalt or hardwood with sick talent only to find that their heart shrank to the size of a pea when the crowds unnerved them. Fear pumps through blood streams at half-court and great talents evaporate on this hallowed proving ground when bodies surround it. You see one can't hide from a crowd. Crowds are an exposure of truth: You either got it or you don't. Venice is known for its crowds as much as it is for its magic.Sticky finds magic in the soft touch of worn synthetic leather. Between the fading lines of a rundown court filled with Venice troublemakers, he waves a wand made of magical fingertips and stands out from a crowd of dreaming hoop players. In a world of fast-paced, kinetic movement, Sticky is able to curb a debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder because he sees a playground game in refined slow motion. He thrives on court vision and instinct. And instinct is the main artery of navigation, just like Lincoln Blvd, that runs the width of Venice. A kid with instinct can survive out here. A kid with instinct can throw it all back in the face of the proverbial man. Alva did it on his skateboard, Dennis Hopper did it on his camera, and Sticky will do it with a beat-up basketball stolen from a group home. The question is, as it was with Alva and Hopper, can he simultaneously do it with meaning and go unscathed.de la pe&ntilde;a deconstructs race and class in this book with a hand gentler than Morrison or Wright. Racism and classism can be cruel and there is a sense of the tragically absurd in the cruel life that is Sticky. Humor eases him into questionable mentoring and pushes him into painful rites of passage. That's always been the genius of special works. Hit us with humor and twist the knife in the gut of our protagonist. Denis Johnson does it, Spike Lee does it, and Joe Strummer did it.Sticky is a lonely ship navigating the treacherous Venice canals without supervision or necessary guidance. His advice comes at the bottom of a forty proof guttural throat or from the high-pitched nasal whine of an overbearing liberal do-gooder. But, like all of us in this life, advice is only that, advice, and Sticky must make his own way with just the truthful eloquence of a honed skill set to drive him. In this case, that skill set is on a basketball court.de la pe&ntilde;a has put together a powerful memo that puts the powers-that-be on notice: The voiceless will not sit back without voice any longer. There is something daring to this work. It is tangible and magical. Ball Don't Lie will not leave you apathetic.de la pe&ntilde;a should be considered an innovative auteur. He has exposed the ironies of the daily morality, politics and race in this country with a slight of hand that would make the thief in his lead character proud.Ball Don't Lie is homage to the power of a writer's observation and recollection of environment. It ranks alongside The Bluest Eye as a genuinely groundbreaking first novel. We should all hope that this extraordinary work is the first installation in a powerful chorus of prose to come. It should be a notable book in the New York Times review. It should be mentioned in Sports Illustrated. People are sleeping on this important piece of fiction, but that should be expected. After all, it is about Venice: The land of counter-culture and in-your-face expression. Ball Don't Lie may be overlooked, but it cannot go ignored."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"I can't remember the last time I connected so deeply with a character. I wanted to wrap Sticky in my arms and take care of him. I absolutely love this book. de la Pena's writing is passionate, it's raw, it's real and full of life. We follow Sticky through adolescence and witness his struggles, his loves (mother, basketball, girlfriend...), his pain and hopes and dreams. de la Pena weaves through past and present seamlessly. He has created a novel with great depth and rich characters. I didn't want it to end.Sticky may have started out \\"three stones back\\", but you leave with hope that he's going to be all right."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"I read this book for two reasons. Firstly, the film adaptation is coming out, and I wanted to see what the source material was like. And secondly, because seven years ago, I wrote a screenplay about basketball, about high school basketball, and I was curious as to the comparison.'Ball Don't Lie' is a very well written, engaging, 'authentic-feeling' piece of writing. It's not 'too' poetical, it's not 'too' preachy, and it tells its story nicely. Considering what Mr. de la Pena covers -hoops, teenage life, the travails of the dispossessed, obsessive-compulsive disorders-' it is a tiny marvel.Yes, I was always wondering 'What would this novel have been like had it not been written for the 'Young Adult' market, but for the General Fiction consumer?', but I suspect that the author would have expanded and re-focused with gusto, and it would have ended up another gem. Different from this one...but still as distinct, still as precious.(Oh, and as for the comparison between 'Ball Don't Lie' and my screenplay, that ended up not a feature film, but a tv mini-series? Let's just say it reaffirmed by belief in it...and that one of my primary readers and supporters is right, that 'Five'll Get You Ten' deserves to be reverse-adapted for the printed page. For the Young Adult market, of course.)"},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"I loved the book. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened to the main character, \\"Sticky.\\" It's not the kind of book you have to use a dictionary all the time. It's written in plain simple language.The only draw back was the lines that were repeated. Other than that, it was an excelent story. I even got motivated to dig the old basketball out of the closet. Good show!"},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"This is a great book. Everyone should read this book.

Really. I hardly ever get choked up about anything. I'm also not a big reader. But my girlfriend gave me this book and demanded I read it. So I did. And it was awesome. I couldn't believe how much I identified with Sticky. I'm a little older (I'm in college now), but I didn't have a great family life either. I was pretty much raised by my grandmother and grandfather. Sticky has such a tough life. But he keeps going. He's not a great student, but he learns stuff on the streets. How come that's never talked about? You can learn so much outside of a classroom. Anyway, there were two sections in this book where my eyes got all blurry because I felt so bad for Sticky. I have to say, this book was really great. Yes, a book. If my high school teachers had made us read books like this in school maybe I would have got better grades."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"If you like ball you will love this book. If you know ball, you will be blown away by the poetry. This book will make you think you have gone to hoop heaven. The kind of descriptions that make you put the book down for a minute and just think about it all. Hoops you feel in your bones. Truth. Pure truth. Words that can only come from someone who played the game.Then the story grabs you. Next thing you know - you're just about finished cause you need to know how it ends for Sticky. And you're hoping the ending isn't some afterschool special where everybody goes home with a trophy. And de la Pena does not dissappoint. Simply put, you will tell everyone you know -\\"Read this book!\\". It's that good. What you need to do is be the first in your crew to read this - because pretty soon - everyone is going to be talking about Ball Don't Lie and you can tell them all about Sticky and how you read it back in October when it first dropped. Nuff said."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"This book starts out really slow and boring because you are blinded by all of the basketball details. So you think \\"here's another boring sports book\\" and by chapter 3 it is already unraveling into a book you just can't put down. Sticky is a ghetto and rough-around-the-edges white guy that has grown up on the streets, moving from foster pad to foster pad, eventually making it to an area where he is daily playing ball with the regular crew down at Lincoln Rec. He knows that he has to have something special to get out of this life he doesn't want to be stuck with forever. It really does suck you in and has you going through every trial with Sticky from past to present making you feel as if it were you telling the story of Sticky's crazy and hectic life."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"Beautiful writing.

I couldn't believe how good it was. This dude can really write. And I love the story. It's sad, but in the end you feel like the main character is going to be alright. Speaking of the main character.

You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"I liked his book because it was about basketball and I have played basketball for the last nine years. I felt like I understood the book because I know a lot about basketball. It also told of a story about a boy growing up in the foster carte system.Sticky was the main character of this book. It starts out when he is 16 years old waiting for a chance to play a pick up game at the recreation center. All the guys from the neighborhood like to hang out there. He is the only white player on the court. The other players make fun of his name. It was a nickname his mother gave him so he likes it and gets angry because they wanted him to say his real name or change it.The book flips back and forth from his rough childhood with his single mother, to his multiple foster parents, to current time. It took him through rough and good experiences with friends and foes.He meets a girl from high school who he likes and they start dating. They want to go to the same college so Sticky has to try really hard to get a basketball scholarship.He learned life lessons throughout the book. Most of his lessons were learned on the court at the recreation center. There were lots of fights, laughter, and yelling, homeless people, young and old people.I give this book a 5 star rating and you should for sure buy Ball don't lie if you don't you'll be missing out."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"So many kids try too hard to come off cool. They wear certain clothes, listen to certain music, walk in a certain manner, etc. And, sure, some of them succeed. But it's kind of contrived. And everybody sort of senses it. There's something different about the kid who's cool without trying.Sticky, the main character of this book, is the cool kind of cool. The second kind. He's not trying; he just IS. He's the kind of guy girls fall for without knowing what hit them. Halfway through the book I found myself wondering where I myself could find a guy like Sticky. He has his own thing going on: basketball. He's smooth. He's cute. He's sweet. He needs love. But most of all he's cool. Without trying to be cool.This book made me feel totally happy about life."},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"reading from the start i was confused and i coudnt get hooked on it is relly mind bending i ve read other of matt bookss nd this one is"},{"Title":"Ball Don't Lie","review":"Can't recommend this book enough: brilliant, painful, beautiful.

The book puts you there in the impossible to fathom life of Sticky, the seventeen year old main character. The book puts you there in the rec where he plays basketball with a passion and precision that buys his way into the heart of the gym, the regulars who become family. Sticky battles the right choices in a world with so many wrongs. The end turns furious.

Yates stuns the reader over the head with his expertly crafted prose, and you can't help but keep reading. He doesn't provide any respite from the darkness, even momentarily, so this bleak collection isn't for the faint of heart. Fans of Updike and Cheever will be pleased."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"this collection of short stories has been written by a man who may not have, when he initially began writing, floored his readers with an abundance of talent. but it is obvious that mr. yates has done his homework; his writing is tight and the words tremble with emotion. this is the work of a man who has spent a lot of time reading and revising and reworking until it felt just right. on most of the stories he hits all the right notes. the ones about tuberculosis stick in my mind the most with a particular resonance; he's got a feel for the throb of the misunderstood, the lonely. the problem with these stories is that their focus is on just that. mr. yates' title may've been eleven kinds of loneliness but i wish he hadn't felt as though it were necessary to confine himself to that topic. the last story really shows the flair he has for longer, more broad fiction; and because of this, the reader leaves slightly disappointed because the rest of the stories seem to be the work of a bitter man obsessed with bitterness. this wouldn't be a bad thing if the bitter man weren't capable of so much more."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"i was unable to find richard yates' book of short stories \\"eleven kinds of loneliness\\" in bookstores. the copt i received from the amazon supplier is in very good condition and though decades old still holding up well. the supplier did an excellent job shipping and provided excellent value with this book."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"Richard Yates was a brilliant writer of novels and short stories who was universally admired by his peers including--among others--Tennessee Williams, John Updike, and Phillip Roth. His novel &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; was considered groundbreaking when it was published in 1961. Never commercially successful after that, Yates continued to write and taught on a number of college campuses including the University of Iowa Writing Program. &quot;Eleven Kinds of Loneliness&quot; is delicious."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"To put it simply: you must read this book. It is the most depressing, uplifting, poignant, ironic book I've read. That may seem like a contradiction in terms, but if you've read the book you know what I'm talking about.Richard Yates writes about ordinary men, women and children -- &quot;loners&quot; leading solitary existences. A few stories, such as &quot;Doctor Jack-O'-Lantern&quot; and &quot;Jody Rolled the Bones&quot;, are filled with bittersweet humor; others, such as &quot;Fun With a Stranger&quot; are downright sad. But don't think Yates is some depressed, manic-depressive writer, because he's not. Rather, his words, his characters strike you in a way you never thought possible, making you want to read them over and over again."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"A collection of short stories each portraying a different kind of loneliness. Yates' writing is nothing short of hyponotic. Every character let me into their little part of the world and showed their rawest and deepest emotion. As a writer, Yates honors his craft and I would suggest an aspiring writer to pick this up and learn from his work. Two of his stories had a profound effect me. The first one is about a young boy who starts at a new school and lies about everything. His situation was unique but reminescent of the feelings many of us had during those turbulent middle school years. The other story was about a guy writing stories for a cabbie. Eventually, the writer recognizes their \\"friendship\\" has no real foundation and the cabbie is a friend in name only. This slice from the scence of life is worth the read."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"When you read a lot of books, whether they be good or bad, when something extremely well written comes along it stands out immediately. Whether it be a certain quality of writing, or the ability to connect emotionally, or cutting to the heart of the matter as simply as possible or an amalgamation of these, it is very special when they come along. \`Eleven Kinds of Loneliness' is one of these books and by the time I had read the first short story on offer, I was held enthralled until I had reached the end. This has eleven short stories that are mainly based in and around New York and have a slight melancholy feel to them, the delicious kind that makes you feel nostalgic without the depression that can come after. The theme of loneliness, in all it's forms, runs through this book and many stories are immensely poignant. Yates has the ability to draw you in and to help you connect with the characters in the stories until you feel their sadness', triumphs and notice their positive traits and flaws within yourself. This is perfect to dip into when you need that hit of top class literature, but is just as good to sit and read from cover to cover in one sitting. It is American literature at it's best and highly recommended reading.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"I usually shy away from short story collections because I always feel like I've had a snack instead of a meal but Yates' stories are unexpectedly full and satisfying.

These stories are well worth your reading time."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"These stories will stay with me for the rest of my life, particularly \\"No Pain Whatsoever.\\" Yates was a tremendously underrated writer, but hopefully won't stay that way.

Yates is a no-nonsense, straight-talking, highly skilled story teller with an intelligent voice who knows how to keep the reader genuinely engaged without sacrificing emotional depth or subtlety. Each and every story in this book is a winner: touching, honest, well-told, deeply felt. The collection is also a refreshing change from the morass of badly written contemporary short fiction that has taken the very worst from the minimalist movement (sometimes less IS less...). These are stories with meat on their bones--but no fat. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"I usually shy away from short story collections because I always feel like I've had a snack instead of a meal but Yates' stories are unexpectedly full and satisfying. He's so good at depicting time and place.....late 30's, 40's and 50's. His stories are grim as the title implies but they provide lots of insight into human motivations/feelings/relationships. These stories are well worth your reading time."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"Yates wrote eleven short stories about average people down on their luck or unable to connect with others, while trying desperately to do so. Some stories are better than others, but they all have very well defined characters who are unable to break the patterns that frustrate their lives, who mostly wouldn't know what to do with themselves were it not for booze and cigarettes."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"So you can guess by the title that there will be few happy endings and life-affirming group hugs in this collection. If you want that, well... actually, maybe you should read this anyway. These stories are about people who don't, and can't, fit that formula.Yates was so perceptive and evocative and could draw deep insight from the mundane. That's what a great writer can do. Some readers complained that Revolutionary Road was boring; of course, there are no reanimated dinosaurs or teenaged vampires. Yates writes for adults who enjoy character studies.\\"Jody Rolled The Bones\\" is so excellent, with its lament of the soldier who chants the song named in the title: \\"Jody was your fair-weather friend, the soft civilian who took for granted everything you held dear\\". That's a butchered quote, but you get the idea. This is not just about 1950s alienation, that is a timeless divide between the ones who will die and the ones who will kick back on the sofa and relax.These are some of the best short stories I've read by any author. Ignore the mediocre DiCaprio movie; don't let that deter you from reading Richard Yates if you haven't checked out his work."},{"Title":"Eleven kinds of loneliness;: Short stories","review":"Superlatives are so casually tossed about today that when true greatness comes knocking one is at a loss as to how to greet it. 11 Kinds of Loneliness is simply the best collection of short stories I have ever read. And like the very best collections it is varied in its characterizations and themes. And while set in a very particular time these working class and middle class voices--old and young-- are universally recognizable. Yes, there is much more than just loneliness in these pages--much, much more.9 year olds try to maintain spirits and composure when they get the awful third grade teacher; draft inductees lose a hard-ass drill sergeant just as they were learning his value; a wife betrays and remains loyal to her invalided husband, simultaneously; a life full of disappointment spills into rage and the misfit middle schooler shows a propensity for even more disturbing behavior. All of the couples and individuals in these short stories are much more than lonely. Angry, confused, disappointed, dishonest or just trying to get along. They are ordinary and remarkable at the same time. And beautifully rendered."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"This may be the most speculative of all Hancock's books, but he gives you plenty to think about. I wondered if this book would just be another rehashing of Richard Hoagland's ideas about the artificiality of the \\"monuments\\" of the Cydonia region of Mars, but instead it's pure Graham Hancock. He connects some dots from his previous books, looking again at the significance of the layout of the Giza plateau in Egypt as well as Teotihaucan in Mexico and speculating about whether the ancients have left us a message. It's a dire warning that our planet may be in for a pounding by explosive projectiles from space - the same dangerous objects that may have destroyed the planet Mars.Hancock provides plenty of background on the swarm of comets and asteroids that are on Earth-crossing orbits and how they got there. It seems as our galaxy makes its great circle over millions of years it periodically encounters the galactic arm which is full of debris. Some of this debris remains with our solar system, but on unstable orbits. Comets, it turns out, can begin as huge objects many miles across. They generally break up at some point into smaller more numerous objects and work their way from the far end of our solar system to closer to the sun - and, of course, passing by Earth. And yes, comets CAN hit planets as we learned with the explosive impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on the planet Jupiter in 1994. One of the impact craters it left is larger than Earth!Hancock explores the photos we have of Mars that show it must have had liquid water in its past. He gives us a complete summary of the structures found at Cydonia, including the famous face. Despite NASA's release of a picture that made the face look like a bunch of random scratches, the speculation of artificiality is very much alive. NASA was deceptive in releasing a \\"raw\\" photo, something they normally do not do. It is obvious they wanted to put an end to the public's fascination with the face. Even cleaned up, the photo shows an irregular structure that only looks a bit like a face. But the whole concept of Cydonia as a place with constructed monuments never rested solely on the face. There is the matter of the geometry of the area, which seems to have encoded a lot of the same numbers as the pyramids of Giza and other ancient Earth monuments.In true Hancock fashion, the author provides us with penty of food for thought. He carefully labels his ideas as speculation, not fact, but he conjectures that the damage to Mars could have been recent, not millions of years ago, and it could have coincided with the great flood stories of Earth and an apparent disaster or series of disasters in the time frame of 9000 to 12,000 years ago. These may have involved a scattering of comets and other space objects that are still a danger to Earth; that previous cycles of these swarms from space wiped out the dinosaurs and caused other mass extinctions on Earth.Hancock goes on to speculate that disasters on earth may not be purely geological events, but may have to do with man's treatment of his fellow man and his respect (or lack of it) for his world. He laments that the nations of Earth are doing almost nothing to search the solar system for the danger that may be awaiting our home. Is it just hubris that makes up think we are the culmination of all previous generations of humankind? Or are we dead wrong, and is human civilization destined to experience cycles of destruction? Will our Mother Earth become a dead place like Mars? As always, Graham Hancock provides entertaining reading whether you buy into it or not."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Like so many other Hancock readers, I have read all of his previously written books, but note in other reviews, the absence of any mention about what I consider to be his most profound and factual writing, &quot;Lords of Poverty.&quot;Mr. Hancock continues to intrigue me with all of the &quot;possibilities&quot; of this present work. I am now even more inclined to give credence to his research because of &quot;Lords of Poverty&quot; which, although written ten years ago, has proven to be right on target!I must say that as I read &quot;Mars Mystery...&quot; I found myself surfing the Web trying to access his bibleographies in an attempt to better understand exactly what he was talking about. In every respect, however, the book is an adventure in learning and an expansion of one's intellectual peripheries."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I've read literally 100s of books in my life but this was with ease one of the most fascinating ones I've laid my eyes on.I could start right off by praising Hancock's research and the integrity of his sources, but actually, before any of that, I think special credit should be given to this man's authorship.Indeed that's in my mind the biggest asset of this book: that it's a definitive &quot;cantputdowner&quot;. The only way i could see someone not being thoroughly engulfed in this marvelous work of a book is if he's either brainwashed beyond repair and refuses to hear anything entertaining notions that go against the &quot;programm&quot; in his mind, or, worse still, if someone is basically cerebrally pulseless.Hancock spreads out a super convincing, mm, not so much theory, but argument. At no point in his book, again to his credit, does he dogmatically claim &quot;look, there WAS intelligent life on Mars at some point&quot; but he does claim that the evidence is overwhelming towards such a direction and that the rather bizzare attitude of Nasa about this might be actually confirming this or at the very least fuels suspicion to the max.The premise here is the stunning &quot;monuments&quot; in the area of Cydonia and the implications arising from this. It's not only the well known (???) face on Mars but also the hexagonal eerily symmetrical pyramids and other such phenomena that have tell-tale signs of artificiality about them.Even though i've read quite some, especially on the net, about the &quot;Face&quot; i found that there was actually an ocean of data i was totally unaware of. Hancock goes on a lenghty but very pleasant to read diatribe about those constructions but where it gets immensely interesting is when he tackles the more-than-strange behavior of Nasa about the whole issue. NASA to put it in a nutshell has been basically fronting the theory that not only the winds are particularly talented out on Mars but that they are also selectively talented as they seem to be creating things in Cydonia and only.That might be laughable enough one would think, but their overall attitude to public demand for further and detailed investigation on these anomalies so the matter could (?) be put to rest has been borderline conspiratorial. The world has either had to deal with outright refusals or with grainy photos that Nasa releases in an apparent effort to conceal what really? Questiosn that scream for immediate answers. NASA general politics are also discussed in the process and, well, they dont seem exactly &quot;crystal-clean&quot; stuff to put it extremely mildly.But by then you'd only be half way through the book: the latter half is the one that -incredibly-manages to capture the imagination even more albeit in a macabre and cosmically scary way.If the death of Mars as all evidence overwhelmingly suggests came from a cosmic bombardment of comets or fragments thereof what are the implications to us here? Especially since the spectacular &quot;atatck&quot; of comet Levy-Shoemaker on Jupiter there has been more discussion about such a danger even if the budget we actually have on comet-orbit watching is downright ridiculous.Hancock reveals to the uninitiated, like myself, that comets are not a distant low-probability threat but an ever-present and increasingly threatening reality. Alone in our solar system there are 100s of 1000s of them flying about in anarchic orbits and in mindbending speeds (most between 45.000-60.000klm/hour). Many are so called &quot;earth-crossers&quot; as they regularly (in universal terms) cross our orbit.When one thinks that our current theory holds that the dinos became history indeed because of a comet or that there have been not just that one but several seriously damaging impacts in Earth's past, but also, that contrary to mainstream belief a comet does not have to be &quot;giant size&quot; (i.e planet-size) but a mere few kilometers in diameter to make the &quot;blue planet&quot; another cosmic corpse with a past. But with no present.Hancock does also question the possible connection between a past civilisation on Mars and ourselves and again, the evidence more than confirms his notion that such a connection is not some far-out sci-fi type thought but it is actually supported by our ancient heritage. What i like a lot about Hancock compared to other researchers of the genre is that he's actual very casual and undogmatic even when he suggests (but never insists) such dazzling theories.An absolutely tremendous book on all levels. If you do have a &quot;sucpicion department&quot; in your brain the &quot;Mars Mystery&quot; will confirm your worst fears. All this has nothing to do with &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; by the way. As a journalist once said at the beginning of the 20th century:&quot;...it's not the conspiracy theories that interest me, it's the theories about conspiracies.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"This is among the earlier of Graham Hancock's remarkable series of books on unknown Human History. It concerns a possible connection in the ancient human past between Earth and Mars, which the writer postulates hosted a Human civilisation before it got destroyed in a cataclysm caused by a cometary or asteriod impact. Either there was a sister civilisation on Earth, or the remnants from the Martian one escaped and came here to start afresh, and thus Ancient Egypt was where they \\"unloaded\\" their legacy. He dated Ancient Egypt's legacy as belonging far back in the hidden mists of millenia untold, linking it to this Martian civilisation, instead of its \\"official\\" starting date of circa 3100 BCE. The \\"story\\" therefore is remarkable and astounding. But Hancock, in this book, also deliberately deconstructs his previous, equally remarkable and plausible ice-age theory for the destruction of such an ancient technological global, antediluvian civilisation for which he cites the theories of Charles Hapgood and others, and for which overwhelming evidence otherwise exists, transcending interdisciplinary boundaries. This theory was based on the Earth's cyclical axial precession as well as the related possibility of its crust shifting catastrophically, and was at the core of his \\"debut\\" book, \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\". His new asteroid-impact theory is as equally as forceful as the axis-shift one he replaces, and such abrupt changes of view could cause doubt in the minds of his readers, even those with superior intellects and education who could reconcile both these aspects of view. He does touch upon this disparity of his on P.254 of the book, but cursorily and briefly.He treats the example of the present day scarred and desolate planet Mars as a warning for what could happen to our present \\"high\\" civilisation now populating Earth. Elsewhere, he also speculates on a conspiracy by the powers-that-be to conceal what happened to Mars - and therefore Mankind's actual history - so as to be able to control their societies, which might otherwise become restive and panick stricken in the face of such knowledge and eventualities. After all, the elites are mature and powerful enough to be able to contemplate awful disasters coolly and in the face - which an ordinary Tom, Dick and Harry can't otherwise even think of, let alone bear! In the last chapter of this book titled \\"Dark Star\\", he writes mournfully to the effect that just as humanity seems to be lifting itself to superior levels of cultural, technological and spiritual expression, along comes a global cataclysm forcing them back to square one: to begin as mountain shepherds and hunters all over again, carrying with them the tales of lost Golden Ages of science and culture. This forces him to contemplate mournfully, along Gnostic lines, as to whether God is indeed all-good and love as the \\"classic\\" scriptures would have one believe - or whether \\"He\\" is a Duality: Evil as well as Good. He then supplies the answers, and so do his other excellent books which I recommend to Amazon readers, \\"The Lords of Poverty\\" and \\"Journey Through Pakistan\\". The influence of devilish forces aside, it seems we ourselves become The Devil when our lofty achievements get overtaken and harnessed to base desires and consumeristic greed, leading inevitably to some kind of disaster... That is evident right now, in this most critical time recorded Human history has ever known."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Graham Hancock, if you hadn't already noticed, is a tad off his rocker. He has a bad tendency to leap to conclusions from minimal evidence, and, so, I wouldn't always agree with everything he says.However, he is two things: Entertaining, and sometimes right. This book is no exception. It has a rather broad focus, leaping from Mars to Earth and outer space and back again. His main thesis is that Mars was terrestrial and habitable as recently as 20,000 years ago, with a similar civilization to his version of Atlantis, and that related catastrophes destroyed the Martian civilization, while severely crippling the Terran one.On the whole, his theories are a tad shaky. Yes, Cydonia looks like it's artificial, and that might be the most likely solution, but there's still nothing proving it. Even the mathematical ratios the researchers found are still not beyond the vale of coincidence. Similarly, his evidence for Atlantis isn't decisive, at least to my mind. I'm inclined to believe him, but mostly because the idea's just really cool.The one thing that I don't have any trouble believing is his theory about the Taurid meteor swarm. Noting that the Tunguska and Canterbury events, as well as several other large meteor strikes, happened in the same time, convinces me that we *do* need something to watch for NEOs. (The incredible thing is that he never even comes close to the idea that the Tunguska blast was an alien ship...he's not that kind of lunatic)This is a good book to pick up and read, if you get the chance. He might not be entirely all there, but he's entertaining, and he asks some very interesting questions, which often he has the best answer for."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Graham Hancock's foray into \\"The Mars Mystery\\" suggests a disjointedness that is not in character with his usual form. It is definitely not of the same high quality of \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\"; however it does contain the elements of a good story if told with less speculation and more supporting evidence. There is little question that The Face and the Pyramids of the Cydonian plain on Mars make for an intriguing mystery which will likely only be resolved with extensive exploration of Mars. Is this arrangement a natural fluke or an engineered set of structures put there by an ancient race of intelligent beings, beings which may have had a link to Earth? Hancock only serves to heighten the frustration previously generated by Richard Hoagland in \\"The Monuments of Mars\\". This frustration is not helped in any significant way by a disappointing resolution and lack of clarity in the Mars Global Surveyor and the Malin Space Science Systems Mars Orbital Camera, aided and abetted by the potentially subjective method of computer \\"contrast enhancement\\" and the suggestion of a NASA cover-up complicity. But this Cydonian part of the book does not seem to fit with the rest of it; I tend to agree with T. Peters in his review that the lack of a \\"walloping confirmation\\" from the Mars Global Surveyor forced publication of a book in heavily revised form. But what is the true story told here, what was Hancock really trying to say? That Mars was once rich in atmosphere and water and now stands in stark testimony to the vastly destructive effect of asteroid and comet impact is a reasonable thesis. That the same thing could happen to Earth is also a credible argument and the fact that the Yucatan peninsula Chicxulub crater evidences the Cretaceous -Tertiary extinction of the dinosaurs and 50% of the genera and 90% of the species of the existing life should give us pause for a realistic contemplation. Walter Alvarez in his \\"T. Rex and the Crater of Doom\\" actually tells this story better. But here Hancock launches a speculative work which requires great conjectural talent; the proposition that a single giant asteroid breakup is responsible for nearly all of the entire present topological state of Mars is indeed harrowing. True, this would have had the necessary energy to explain a host of questions. A single impactor which produced the Martian Huygens Crater at 305 degrees West and 17 degrees South would have had the necessary energy to denude the entire Martian surface of its once robust 3 bar atmosphere while thrusting up the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, within about 4 degrees of its exact geometric antipode. Surely multiple hits which created the three largest basins on Mars would boast orders of magnitude larger energy availability for ocean destruction, crustal distortion, and shield volcano excitation, although Hancock does not attempt any actual quantitative exposition, making instead an intriguing qualitative case. It follows that we earthlings should be very attentive to our potential affinity for earth crossing objects. If Hancock has achieved something of merit, it is a call for the continued exploration of Mars and a growing public emphasis upon asteroid and comet research, both compelling topics with a potentially profound impact on our past...and our future."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I have finished reading the book a few weeks ago and now that all the emotions have settled down, the impression that is left is of a highly entertaining and informative book.I might not agree with 100 per cent of all what Mr. Hancock writes, but most of the evidence that he presents can not be ignored.As a person with an open mind I recommend this work of art and science to everyone who is willing to give a chance to the ideas presented in it."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I am a hugh fan of Graham Hancock and have read 3 of his previous books, &quot;The Sign and the Seal&quot;, &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Message of the Sphinx&quot;......this was by far the weakest of them. It seems that Mr. Hancock is treading on ground that he is not as familiar with. Indeed, after reading Hoagland's &quot;Monuments of Mars&quot;, this books seems weak. But none the less, he adds valuable material to the subject of an ancient connection between ancient ruins on Earth and anomilies on Mars. What I found most interesting was the section on asteroids and comets. This was tangential to the basic theme of the book, but it made me think. This needs more scholarly study. Graham Hancock knows that current Archaeology, Anthropology, and Ancient History has &quot;missed the boat&quot; in many areas. He proposes a key to unlock many of these mysteries. This book adds to that key. I hope his next book is better written."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"You could read the title as \\"A warning from history that could save life on earth\\" or you could read the book and justify that it should have read \\"A rambling from conspirators that could ignite paranoia on earth.\\"Joke beside, this was actually very enlightening. I just thought it's be some crackpot ideas about Mars. I was 95% sold on the idea when they got into the mathmatics, which match those of ancient earth monuments. Reading that part alone sent me into shivers with a wide-eyed gaze. The second part which grabbed me was the section on camets and astroids. The truth is straight told and this alone will leave you wide-eyed. Getting into the speculation will just send your eyes drooping from their sockets.So, the mathmatics and the comets were the best parts of the book. The rest was just filler - getting from one point to another."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"All of Hancock's previous books I devoured with fascination and glee--they were stimulating and provocative. This one was a giant dud! It was as if he waited for the latest Mars mission photos to substantiate his connection between Egypt and Mars, then discovered to his horror there was no connection evident from the photos, and had to &quot;wing-it&quot; to complete the remainder of the book. For the best summary of the whole controversy over intelligently constructed edifices on Mars I suggest you read COSMIC TEST TUBE, by an investigative reporter named Fitzgerald who explored this subject and many others in depth!!"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Very good boox exposing the truth behind mars, the pyramids, and the sphinx, but he kind of goes off on a tangent the second half of the book about asteroids"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"This is my first time reading a book by Graham Hancock. I have read some of the reviews other people have written and agree for the most part. This book was like two or three different unrelated books combined into one. There was not a smooth transition from the Mars Structures to the End of the world scenario chapters. The book didn't get interesting until the very end when you could tell the author was getting overly excited about what he was writing. Once you read past the &quot;man has lost its soul and the Gods are angry&quot; stuff it does make you think about how our solar system isn't the isolated place that we think it to be."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I hope Mr Hancock will put his name on future books that truly represent HIS views and not the dollar signs glistening in the eyes of some publisher. I don't want to know how much Hancock received for lending his name to this thing.

The research used to develop his arguments for intelligent design of Martian artifacts is based on the scholarship of many prominent scientists; a sure sign that credible evidence is being sought and applied. Mr. Hancock takes the reader on a journey which fascinates the mind; being careful to point out the facts, at times even offering the contrary opinion so that his audience can reach an objective conclusion. This style is refreshing, given the extremist attitudes that perpetually separate &quot;new science&quot; from &quot;tradtional science&quot;. The only criticism I offer, (and it's constructive!) is that better explanation be given concerning mathematical concepts. For example, how many of us really understand &quot;tetrahedral geometry?&quot; While I realize it is difficult to make math professors out of the layman, I believe that more illustrations, charts, graphs, etc. could have accompanied and clarified the text."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Sometimes it's enjoyable to say &quot;what if.&quot;The aramageddon astaroid section was a little tiresome, while i have to admit the projections made concerning the after-effects of a direct hit by an asteroid or comet scared this reader.This book is outside of the previaling orthodoxy, so in some respects Hancock has appealed to the conspiracy theorist in this reader, but in the end his arguments just sound sensationalistic. Sorry Graham. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I have read Hancock's previous books with interest and Fingerprints is an excellent work. This work is fragmented and loses itself between its multiple authors and multiple threads. This book is not up to the mark and is not a book that I could recommend.Tim Frost"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Mr. Hancock's previous works have been well researched and notably well written. It was therfore a surprise and a disappointment to work my way through The Mars Mystery.This is really a book in two parts. The first chapters are a rather good summary of the debate about the Cydonian features. The notable players are referenced in a fair summation of the controversy to date. If you haven't read Hoagland or DiPietro's work, you'll find this fascinating.Apparently this was written in anticipation of a walloping confirmation from the Mars Global Surveyor. Both time and circumstances then conspired against Gordon. NO BIG NEWS.He must have waited for new photos and confirmation. None came. As the publication date pushed back weeks, then months, the pressure to print must have been serious. It is here that the book diverges.In search of a salable finish, Gordon takes off on the more current(marketable?)issue of comets. They distroyed Mars, they could distroy us. This is the secret connection between Earth and the Red Planet? This is an interesting, but clearly tangential topic from Cydonia. But then the seasonal movies are Deep Impact and Armageddon.Sadly, the chapters authored by Gordon on this topic are the most fragmented in the book. The serial structure is redundent and uneven. He's working on this piecemeal and it shows.In all, the first book(on Cydonia) failed for lack of closure. The second (on THE COMET THREAT) is desperation.Gordon Handcock is too good a writer and researcher to blow up on deadline."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Hancock weaves accepted science, controversial science and speculation into a compelling, entertaining narrative. Even though some readers will find Hancock's case to lack credibility due to his discussion of the Cydonia 'monuments' on Mars, his eventual conclusion rests on sound, accepted science: that human civilization is in grave, imminent danger from a massive comet fragment lurking in the Taurid meteor stream. Thanks to exhaustive footnotes, the validity of Hancock's evidence is easy to verify."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Graham Hancock's newest book, which I had eagerly anticipated since reading (and re-reading) both of his previous books on (supposedly) similar topics (Fingerprints of the Gods, Message of the Sphinx), was somewhat of a disappointment. His two previous works in this area, although heavily &quot;discredited&quot; on the web, here and elsewhere, as reaching too far, I found to be the most well researched and &quot;hmmmm...&quot;-oriented on the subject of a civliization pre-dating currently accepted theories (which is the extent all conventionally accepted &quot;truths&quot; of the history of the human race are, as there is no soild proof, only compelling eveidence, which Hancock presents...) as to the origin of ancient structures on our planet, the time frame of their creation and of the culture of the creators/builders, itself a topic hardly even considered by most &quot;experts&quot; (i.e. professors, archaeologists, historians, etc..this is dealt with in &quot;Fingerprints&quot; extensively). One thing I always liked about Hancock was his un-reliance on &quot;aliens&quot;; he tried to fit in the pieces of the puzzle with a new perspective of the evidence at hand, &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, the same evidence used by the &quot;experts&quot;, interpreted through a new filter. Yet with &quot;his&quot; new book (a look at the authorship in the author's note shows that his research assistant wrote many of the chapters) seems less involved with a connection between Earth and Mars as far as ancient civilizations than you would expect...it deals more with the possibility that Mars had been ravaged by comet or asteriod collisions in its history, and that Earth may have suffered and may soon see a re-occurring threat of this type of disaster. This in itself is an interesting and intruiging possibility, well documented and handled by Hancock et. al., but the &quot;secret&quot; connection doesn't hold up. For those of you who have read his previous works, trust me there is the the slightest, alth! ough interesting, connection between ancient structures and civilizations and Mars in this book, but it is definitely not the book I had expected from Mr. Hancock. A far more interesting work in this area is &quot;The Monuments of Mars&quot; by Richard Hoagland. In fact it seems from postings and websites (for what they are worth) that Mr. Hancock was asked to write this book, and put what he had been working on hold, by his publishers due to the recent interest in the &quot;life on Mars&quot; news stories. At any rate, although still an interesting and informative read (as usual), &quot;Mars Mystery&quot; didn't live up to the standard the author himself set with his previous works, although far beyond most books in this area. Anyone who is new to Hancock should definitely start with &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot;, and those of you familiar with his work, keep a grain of salt nearby...."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Although Hanncock has written some excellent books this one seems to be lacking a total direction,not like his others.Cosmic impacts and their effects are of great interest to me,and that solely made me buy this one.Some of his data in this book I feel has since been totally dispoved by the current Mars global surveyor mission images(namely the face on mars and the pyramids,with high resolution imaging).As some of the other reviewers siad ,skip this,and get 'fingerprints of the Gods',if you haven't already."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Another great book by Hancock that sheds light on the age old architectural mysteries on earth and possible connections to Mars. This book provides great update on Monuments On Mars by Richard Hoagland and may be a link to the Sitchin's 12th planet theory based on the Sumerian tablets translations. Is it possible that the huge decaying astroid talked about in this book is the same Sumerian 12th planet? Scientists believe that this huge astroid's orbit brings it into the inner solar system every serveral thousand years which the bombardment of the planets by its smaller fragments cause catasrophies such as the one that turned Mars into a dead planet with the huge scar known as the line of dichatomy in Mars equatorial region.It is interesting to see that a government organizatin such as NASA funded by taxpayers money goes out of its way not to photograph these regions with high-resolution camera's aboard the Mars Global Surveyor to resolve the controversies surrounding Cydonia. This book is a great book. My only problem was that in the second part it was getting into too much esoteric subjects of astronomy that are hard for laymen to follow."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Some of the readers have described this book as &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;ridiculous.&quot; I can not disagree more with them. I'm not sure I &quot;bought in&quot; to the items mentioned in chapter 17, but the rest of the book was well written, easy to read and full of information nuggets that were well worth my time and the cost of the book. I really find it hard to understand why anyone would call this book &quot;stupid&quot; since it was obviously well researched and filled with matter-of-fact truths. Yes, there were speculations and suppositions made, but these were all well marked and left for the reader to accept or disagree with. Overall, a very well done job, Mr. Hancock. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Although any book dealing with such an enthralling subject has some possibilities of making inroads in a reader's mind this one, like many others of its kind, falls short even of a passable semi-scientific status. Mars Global Surveyor's imaging has shown the world the real truth about the famous Cydonia &quot;monumental complex&quot;, and nonetheless the author sticks to his cherished view that the Face might well be a real monument built by an ancient Mars civilisation meaning to warn us about something relating to our own planet's fate. The content of this admonition is not clear, but as McLuhan would have said, the Medium is the Message: the Face with its unfathomable spell keeps gazing skyward, a simple barren hill for professor Malin's camera and a source of successful Mars fiction for self-appointed interplanetary scientists...&quot;In Medium stat virtus&quot;! Except for this minor weakness represented by an almost total lack of rational filtering the book makes for a pleasant reading in terms of the author's mastery over the rhythm and the overall unfolding of his arguments: but expert presentation can only add one star to a nearly empty sky!"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"The solar system is a shooting gallery, with objects in constant motion, sometimes meeting in space with catastrophic results. We've only recently begun to realize how vulnerable our seemingly stable existence is on this planet. With his journalistic skill of extrapolation, Hancock takes our knowledge of Martian topography and presents a fresh theory of how the planet died, and why that has a profound message for all of us on Earth today. The book does have a rushed feel to it, as if it needed to get into print while Pathfinder was still in the news. But it's still a worthwhile read, especially as our stale scientific paradigms are falling apart on a daily basis. Other reviewers seem to have a problem with informed conjecture, don't let them keep you from forming your own opinion."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"The Mars Mystery is a good book as far as the science is concerned; I confirmed some of the astronomy and most of the Geology with professors of mine. They said that they might not agree with his findings but the idea's are sound. That went a long way with me. The conspiracies that Mr. Hancock alluded to seem based on his feelings instead of facts. Over all a great read."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Graham Hancock talents are his engaging writing style and his detective skills. His previous works are all marked by a truly arduous hunt for clues, a thorough and cautious analysis('onion' theory notwithstanding), and ultimately a very convincing and original case.Unfortunately, Graham's detective skills are largely wasted on a subject that is so many million miles away. In this book, Graham has no more raw data available to him, than any other writer on the subject; while some of his 'reinterpretations' of the evidence are thought-provoking, their just isn't enough of it to sustain the book. I'm not saying it wasn't interesting, Graham's writing talents alone ensure that; but all in all, I would wait to find it at a used book store."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Is it just me or have most of the conclussions this book drags it's way to been holed below the waterline by the recent Mars mapping mission? perhaps I'm inhabiting a parallel universe in which major pieces of Astronomical news are given more coverage. The most recent NASA mars mission took numerous highly detailed mapping photos of the Cydonia region which have revealed the so called &quot;Face&quot; as an artifact of the poor resolution of the few, oblique images that previously existed.(I know,I know, some people will scream &quot;CONSPIRACY! CONSPIRACY!&quot; but there are some people who think the earth is flat too) The recent pictures also show the &quot;Pyramids&quot; to have moved downwind, changed shape and passed over the top of more solid geographical features. Remarkable! The Martians must have been advanced indeed if they could make pyramids that behaved just like sand-dunes. Perhaps now Graham can go back to bothering reputable archeologists with theories about ancient ruins all around the world being based on the remnants of Atlantis, instead of wild speculations about little green men (did you spot the irony there, normally I wouldn't mention it but some people don't seem to be able to recognise it) This book was pedestrian and ridiculous when it was written, now it is outdated, pedestrian and ridiculous."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I enjoyed reading 'Fingerprints of the gods' a lot. this book is very good as well."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Another excellent work by the author. Mr Hancock is an excellent and interesting writer. He writes in great depth so you can understand the who, what , when, where, how and why of his research and opinions. This book is typical to his writing in that regard. If you are knowledgeable on what he has written the books may cover a lot of ground you have trod in previous times. If you however are a novice in his field of research, you will be amazed at the amount of information he conveys. It is definitely another pass around book!"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I have read and enjoyed several of Graham Hancock's books. In general I find his work to be fascinating, thought provoking and potentially of enormous import.This time, though, I think he drops the ball. Unlike his previous work -- especially the magnificent FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS -- this book reads as though it were thrown together in a couple of weeks to make a few bucks.Forget this one and read FINGERPRINTS."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I had waited anxiously for Graham Hancock's newest book, The Mars Mystery, but was disappointed. It certainly contained important information about potential cosmic threats, but I believe it failed to delve into the ancient Earth/Mars connection as thoroughly as I would have expected from this author. I expected a re-analysis of texts and myths based on the concept of an ancient Martian civilization and how that might have impacted our own. The book was almost tentative in its approach in every area it examined. Mr. Hancock has brought forth revolutionary concepts in his previous books without qualifying them at every turn as he seems to in this work. The book will hopefully help to bring attention to the potential of destructive meteors and comets and spark a demand to devote more resources from our governments to examine these further. I hope we can look forward to more books from Mr. Hancock on his ancient civilization theories in the future."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Graham Hancock has written several interesting books. In &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods&quot; he presents a plausible theory of a prior Earth civililaztion that was lost to a world wide catastrophy but somehow managed to pass hints of its knowledge and existence. &quot;The Sign and the Seal&quot; presented an even better case for where the Ark of the Covenant wound up. &quot;The Mars Mystery&quot; is a book that is not quite sure what it is. An attempt to link pyramid like formations on Mars to Ancient Egypt is, at least as presented, stretching it to say the least. Hancock constantly sets up his case then admits he has no solid evidence and then sets up again. NASA is either part of a coverup on one page or just bungling on another page. Added to this is a discussion of possible planetary destruction from objects in space. The Mars &quot;pyramids&quot; are left behind (never to be fully returned to) and a catalogue (that goes on far longer than needed) of asteroids, comets, etc. follows. The point is to warn of possible future catastrophies. The subject is valid but the argument as presented is meandering, repeatative and in need of a good editor. Mr. Hancock was on firmer ground in the two prior books mentioned above. In &quot;The Mars Mystery&quot; his prior abilitity to think out and present his arguments in a clear and logical manner has lost out to a style more fitted for a super market tabloid."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Graham Hancock pulls no punches when Nasa dupes the Americanpublic (NASA is under military charter not civilian like most peoplebelieve)in a deliberate cover up of the Mars face photos. He systematically reveals the precise alignments of structures on Mars (as he did in &quot;Heavens Mirror&quot;), the evidence of a Martian cataclysm, and the NASA expose'. Anyone in doubt (UFO'S &amp; government cover-up's) should read the thoroughly documented/researched books by Timothy Good, Linda Moulton Howe (&quot;High Strangeness&quot;),Stanton Friedman (&quot;Top Secret Majic&quot;), and David M. Jacobs (&quot;The Threat&quot;) if they want to know the &quot;real&quot; truth."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"The book was pieced together very quickly, but I think the connection is there. Some readers thought that the pyramids of Cydonia are natural. HA! There is no known process that creates pyramidal bases for &quot;sand dunes&quot;. Cydonia is artificial- let there be no doubt. The face showed extreme symmetry, if the critics cared to look beyond the &quot;catbox&quot; The only doubt is the connection to Egypt. Hancock can't prove beyond a doubt, and I don't blame reviewers if they didn't believe him, but this book is intriguing. The writing is bad, but for the ideas that he presents, it still gets 3 stars from me. And by the way, you might want a salt shaker by your side for some of the chapters."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Hancock wasted a lot of words which I can't make out the point. Actually some of the chapters are interesting enough, but most of them were described too long, until they lost their ideas."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"This is truly hilarious. Anyone who doubted Mr. Hancock's grip on reality should check this out. Of course his cult following will believe anything he says or writes, but this book is DE BOMB for his ideas. He uses the same claptrap &quot;methods&quot; (basically, pattern recognition as solid evidence) he has used for his other books on the supposed lost civilization of earth and comes to similarly laughable conclusions: Mars had a civilization once. When closer photos of the Cydonia region revealed his monuments to be natural features (some of them actually shifted out of position), he reacts by concocting a NASA conspiratorial mentality founded in Cold War attitudes. For those who place great stock in pattern recognition, isn't this a pattern? When Egyptologists counter his terrestrial claims with hard evidence, he accuses them of conspiracy too!For any thinking reader, this is the last word on Hancock and how far he is prepared to go to justify his increasingly ridiculous claims."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"THIS IS MR HANCOCKS WORST BOOK YET, HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS WRITING ABOUT, ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND PART."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I accidently bought this ridiculous book because the description on the cover was completely misleading and claimed to be about the realistic possibilities of past or present microbial life on Mars, and its possible connection with life on Earth. I took it home to discover that it is a book about Cydonia, the region on Mars that some nuts and idiots for some reason believe is an ancient alien city. I really should have called the bookstore and complained, because this book belongs in the sci-fi or paranormal sections, not the science section where I found it. Graham Hancock is a nut, and even after the Mars Global Surveyor photos of the &quot;Face on Mars&quot; showed clearly that it is just a regular old hill, this lunatic still thinks that it was built by little green men. The so-called &quot;pyramids&quot; in the region near the &quot;face&quot; don't even look like pyramids at all, even in the photos in the book that have been altered by other nuts like Hancock to make them look more like pyramids! When will all these nuts accept that there are no alien civilizations on Mars, and never have been? If there is any life on Mars, it is microbial, and it sure as hell didn't build any face or pyramids."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"&quot;The Mars Mystery&quot; is for the most part typical Graham Hancock. Like &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods,&quot; &quot;Heaven's Mirror,&quot; and his other works, Hancock collects an oddball mixture of the subset of real science that suits his preconceptions with a selection of pseudoscientific speculations made by other writers, all of which he ties together into what is meant to be a coherent whole. In this case, Hancock's major concern (which belies the book's title) is the potential imminence of a cometary impact on the Earth in the near future. As far as a &quot;Mars Mystery&quot; is concerned, the strange surface features located at the Cydonia region on Mars are covered and cited as possible evidence of an ancient, advanced Martian civilization that was wiped out by a major cataclysm, potentially a cometary impact. To this end, Hancock also presents a summary of Martian geology, but with his own signature overspeculation coloring the proceedings throughout; for example, he muses on the possibility that the enormous, nearly planet-wrecking impact that resulted in the formation of the Hellas plain on Mars could conceivably have occurred as recently as 10,000 years ago, at the same time as smaller impacts on Earth may have contributed to the end of the last Ice Age. Regardless, those looking for an exhaustive discussion of ancient Martian civilization, and its &quot;message&quot; to modern humanity, will find nothing here not summarized by Hoagland, Carlotto, McDaniel or others.Hancock's rather considerable defects as a putative writer of &quot;nonfiction&quot; are more obvious here than in any of his other works; in fact, reading this book can be instructive in revealing the more skillful deceptions he has practiced elsewhere, such as in &quot;Fingerprints of the Gods.&quot; In order to arrive at his thesis--that Mars (and, less violently, Earth) was subject to a horrendous bombardment by cometary debris, perhaps as recently as 10,000 years ago, which resulted in its odd Janus-faced appearance and distinctive plantary geology, and incidentally may have destroyed a teeming ecosystem and even an advanced civilization on the planet in the bargain--Hancock piles speculation upon speculation to the point of absurdity. I honestly can't see how anyone could fail to perceive the fundamental flaws in the narrative he constructs; certainly, the man is guilty of inconsistency--if the same long odds apply to the coincidence of so many odd features at Cydonia in order to rule out a natural explanation, how can they not also rule out Hancock's reconstruction of Mars' history?Beyond shaky logic, however, &quot;The Mars Mystery&quot; is an aptly Janus-faced book as well. The juxtaposition of the sections on Martian geology and cometary impacts with the pseudoscience surrounding the spectacular over-analysis of the few existing photographs of the Cydonia region never seems appropriate. [I should note here, as Hancock does in a preface to the American edition of this book, that the former sections were written by Hancock, while the latter sections were written by an assistant of his named John Grigsby. Why Mr. Grigsby is not a co-author on the jacket is beyond me.] The two or three chapters concerning a &quot;link&quot; between Cydonia and monuments on Earth (such as Stonehenge, Giza, Teotihuacan, etc.) are ridiculous, consisting as they do entirely of worthless number games (finding pi, phi and other mathematical constants in certain measurements of these sites) that are more likely a reflection of the expectations of the &quot;researchers&quot; than of the characteristics of the sites themselves.The threat to Earth, and more importantly to modern civilization, presented by the possibility of cometary impact is a real one, with a basis in real observations. One cannot help but agree with those portions of Hancock's thesis in which he laments the lack of a coherent international approach to the problem of Earth-crossing asteroids and comets. One simply wishes that in this case such an argument was not also lumped together with Martian &quot;monuments&quot; and advanced civilizations in antiquity that weaken it by association."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"This book doesn't give any real answer to the Mars mystery, but still an ok book to read."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"This is hilarious. All the devotees of Hancock's ideas about the ancient history of humankind must surely have gulped when they read this. The book says so much about his complete gullibility and imbecilic approach to argument and evidence. There is no face on Mars, no pyramids, no life. There is no Earth-Mars connection. To bolster his non-case, he resorts to predictable accusations against the establishment (NASA this time, not Egyptologists). But if you're a follower of Hancock, you've probably given up on facts long ago. Easier to believe what he says and just claim to have an &quot;open mind.&quot; Fair enough. But let bookstores stock his books under &quot;fiction&quot; and not &quot;history.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"This book doesn't give any real answer to the Mars mystery, but still on ok book to read."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Looking at the title of this book and then reading it leaves one in total confusion. Is it about a Martian civilization that may have come to Earth? Is it about the need to be worried about killer objects in space? Is it about Mars being destroyed by such? Its hard to tell with the muddle Hancock creates. Sometimes yes, sometimes no and sometimes I'm not sure on the same theory would characterize his thinking. He spends pages building up and passionately defending a pet theory and then just tosses it away. This book is sorely in need of a good editor. Hancock has written several interesting books about the Ark of the Covenant and a possible pre history of earth that was destroyed. Both were well written and presented. That is not the case here."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"Although i am only sixteen, which often seems the main excuse to discount my opinions and feelings as incessant babble, i have pretty well fortified stockpile of scientific and mathematical knowledge. I have tested all of Mr. Grahams theories refering to mathematical constants that occur in Egypt and in Cydonia ( pi, phi, the e/pi and e/phi ratios,and the tetrahedral constant) and found the connections uncanny to the last. Also with my previously acquired information and observed analysis of the area using fractal analysis, the features in that reagon do appear to be artificial. Human kind has a tendency to discount ideas they cannot comprehend only to find their truth when its too late, and this ignorance itself is quite disheartening. It is odd to me how some can sit and mock these theories and then go and read their Bible and beleive in a God that by no means shows proof of its exsistance. This also applies to those who beleive in the ever growing popularity of the theory of evolution, to which there is no difinitive proof.

As much as the public craves proof of little green men, the focus of the scientific search has been to uncover evidence of the conditions necessary for life. NASA researchers described their approach as &quot;follow the water&quot;. Water is critical for the development of life and if the presence of liquid water - at or near the surface of Mars - can be confirmed, scientists will be steps closer to piecing the life-on-Mars puzzle.Mars is the fourth major planet from the Sun, named after the Roman god of war because of its reddish colour. Mars has an elliptical orbit, and so its distance from the Earth varies considerably. Its mean distance from the Sun is 228 million km, about half as far again as is the Earth. A Martian day, or sol, is 24.6 Earth hours, and the Martian year is approximately 687 Earth days. The planet has two small satellites, Phobos and Deimos. Like the Earth, Mars has seasons because of an oblique axis of rotation and the presence of an atmosphere. It is, however, much colder: the mean surface atmospheric temperature is only -23o C. Mars is a small planet, having a mean diameter of 6,790 km, approximately half that of the Earth. Also, its density, 3.933 grams per cubic centimetre, is lower than that of Earth. Mars' thin atmosphere is composed predominantly of carbon dioxide, with some nitrogen and argon. Traces of water vapour have also been detected. The perennial part of the ice caps consists of water ice and the seasonal parts of frozen carbon dioxide.Water is a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. Water is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. It is vital to life, participating in virtually every process that occurs in plants and animals. Water is a colourless, tasteless, and odourless liquid at room temperature. It's able to dissolve many other substances. The versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms.In this book, Hancock states that there's an intriguing possibility that ancient Martian has been communicating with our ancestors and points out that there maybe a connection bewteen the remarkable structures of Egypt, say for example, sphinxs and those of Mars. And if we prove that there once has been water on Mars, will Earth have the same fate, or else we can protect the Earth from extinction? The book is written in a precise and neat way. Very interesting and exiciting."},{"Title":"The Mars Mystery","review":"I have just finished reading this superb book and I find myself stunned by his discoveries which are absolutely brilliant.

Six weeks later, a disgruntled father hires Wolfe to find out who killed his daughter, Joan Wellman. He isn't pleased with the police's progress in finding the young lady's murderer. He knows his daughter rejected a manuscript - \\"Put Not Your Trust\\" by a man named Baird Archer. Wolfe immediately recognizes the name. It was on the list of men's names that Cramer found in a book in Dykes's apartment. The two cases are connected. Wolfe doesn't immediately contact the Inspector. He likes to stay one step a head of the coppers.Archie begins looking for the missing manuscript and finally tracks down the stenographer who typed the manuscript. But Goodwin is two minutes late. Rachel Abrahms has taken a header out of her building's window. Sure enough, the name Baird Archer appears in her receipt book. There is now no doubt that Rachel committed suicide. Another murder attributed to the missing manuscript. But who is the killer? Could it be one of the partners or associates at Corrigan, Phelps, Custen, and Briggs? If so, why? What is in \\"Put Not Your Trust\\" that is to die for?As always, Archie, Saul, and Wolfe's other guys, do the leg work while Nero is home working on crossword puzzles and in his Iris room.

Since the other reviewers have discussed the plot, I won't delve into it much. Basically, a man, Leonard Dykes, has written a story and everyone who reads it (he, the woman at the publishing house, and the typist) is killed. The father of the woman from the publishing house, Joan Wellman, hires Wolfe because he is not satisfied with the police's efforts. The rest of the story is fairly formulaic for the Stout series: Wolfe is arrogant, sticks to his schedule, and never leaves the Brownstone. Archie is sarcastic, lures the women, and is a 1940s man-about-town.There are two differnt things about this story: one good, one bad. First, the bad: Stout doesn't explain the alibi of the murderer. The killer says there is one, and Wolfe starts to dispute it, but Cramer stops him. Therefore, we never find out how the killer contrived the alibi. This may not bother some, but for me, it's frustrating. As for the good, Archie's (perhaps) ultimate love interest is found in this book, in the form of a plump, older, married woman. Don't worry: Archie does nothing wrong, but he sure does think about it...Bottom line: Well up to Stout's usual standards, with extra interest. The flaw, though, keeps it from being five stars."},{"Title":"Murder By The Book (Nero Wolfe)","review":"Written with such a mastery over words and phrases, that it's really hard not to like it. I've read almost every Nero Wolfe novel and while this one is not my absolute favorite, it has several scenarios that I find among the most memorable. The first being the 'scam' that Wolfe and Goodwin contrive to attempt to lure the murderer to the sister of one of the people who've read the book - this is expertly handled and quite thorough. The second is (I'm obviously not going in order :P) the 'group interrogation' with the dozen or so secretaries. But there's alot of little nuances throughout the novel that are professional touches that make it seem almost as if the characters are real and that you're reading a piece of history. Stout's almost tedious attention to detail is more fuller appreciated the more you read it, or better yet listen to the audiobook (read by Michael Prichard)."},{"Title":"Murder By The Book (Nero Wolfe)","review":"(If you're interested in an audio edition, Michael Pritchard's unabridged narration is pretty good.)We begin with the murder of a man who had no life: Leonard Dykes, fished out of the river on New Year's Day, a confidential clerk in the law firm of Corrigan, Phelps, Custen, and Briggs. No family (other than a married sister in California), no lovers, no unsavoury habits, no money problems (neither debts nor a large net worth), no problems with his job. Somebody somewhere, though, hit him on the head before leaving him to drown, and ransacked Dykes' apartment, but the only thing the Manhattan homicide squad could find was a single sheet of paper in a book, with a list of men's names, none of whom could be found in New York City.Stuck, Cramer pays a call at the brownstone, but Wolfe can only suggest that Dykes or someone he knew had tried to come up with an alias for someone, but never used it. Cramer, frustrated (and embarrassed at having sunk so low as to ask for help without getting anywhere), leaves it at that.Six weeks later, John R. Wellman hires Wolfe to find the man who killed his daughter Joan; he's not satisfied with the Bronx's handling of the case. From a letter, he knows that after Joan rejected a manuscript - \\"Put Not Your Trust\\", by Baird Archer - for her publishing firm, Archer had made an appointment to see her privately and get feedback on how to improve it, and the appointment coincided with her death. But nobody can find either the man or the manuscript. Wolfe has no information that the police don't have - collectively, between Manhattan and the Bronx - but he remembers that \\"Baird Archer\\" was one of the names on Dykes' list. So begins the hunt for \\"Put Not Your Trust\\", beginning with a search of all the typing services in the city - and soon another murder is added to the tally, that of typist Rachel Abrahms, only minutes before Archie could speak to her.Stout has given us a real story here - where the lives of the survivors have been torn up with the loss of their daughters, with a man who's going against the advice of his pastor and his wife in hiring Wolfe. Not that it's a tale *only* of human suffering; Archie's telling it, after all. As balance, Wellman's a bit disturbed by Wolfe's tactics at times, particularly when Wolfe decides to have Archie go to work on extracting information from the female clerical staff of Dykes' law firm. Fritz nobly offers to help with the ladies, since there are so many. :)"},{"Title":"Murder By The Book (Nero Wolfe)","review":"This doesn't seem to be a well known Wolfe story, but I think it's one of the best three. It's outstanding for the cleverness of the plot, which is not always a Stout strength. For once, Wolfe really has to unravel complex cause and effect like a Poirot, and there's no cheating of the reader."},{"Title":"Murder By The Book (Nero Wolfe)","review":"Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe / Archie Goodwin books comprise one of the best mystery series of all time, and *Murder by the Book* is one of the best of the series. Sparkling with Stout's sharp wit, brilliant in detail and characterization, rich in period ambiance, the book is a total pleasure from start to finish. Even from the viewpoint of formal detection, usually not one of Stout's stronger points, this one is a flawless gem. The fact that it is out out print is little short of appalling, but the fact that used copies (as well as &quot;audios&quot;) are readily available save the day. Still, the book deserves to be reissued and to be kept in print for posterity."},{"Title":"Murder By The Book (Nero Wolfe)","review":"I loved just about everything about this book. A wistful, infatuated Archie, an exasperated/exasperating Wolfe, police who are (as Wolfe himself would say) good enough at what they do but always a step or two behind, and an action-packed yet heartbreaking mystery. So often books of this genre use murder merely as a catalyst for action. By introducing the victims' families and giving them voice, Rex Stout makes us view the murders in terms of the very real pain they cause those who are left behind. But don't get me wrong -- this book is not a downer. It's bright and clever and, as always, the Wolfe/Goodwin exchanges brought me many a smile."},{"Title":"Murder By The Book (Nero Wolfe)","review":"If you are a Nero Wolfe fan--and few mystery lovers who have ever read a Nero Wolfe novel are not--you are sure to enjoy &quot;Murder by the Book.&quot; I have read a couple score of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe novels and novellas, and this is one of the best. Stout has a unique voice, and he is at the top of his form here. The banter between Wolfe and wiseacre sidekick Archie Goodwin races effortlessly along. &quot;Dissed&quot; by Wolfe on the telephone, Archie hangs up and says sarcastically: &quot;I got the impression that I had interrupted him at something important like a crossword puzzle.&quot; And the mystery in &quot;Murder by the Book&quot; is well done, too.

He covers all the major domestic markets: U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and includes background on other European markets. The major point of this work is the role of economics and political power in shaping markets. Most conjecture is that domestic market regulation was driven by technology and politics. However, Davies makes the case that economic imperatives determined the different paths of restructuring of domestic network telecommunication monopolies. The nationally based monopoly providers and an alliance of multi-nationals competed and the outcome of their struggle determined how restructuring of domestic telecommunications markets occurred. How it played out differently in each domestic market depended to a great extent on that nation's markets and the influence of either monopoly providers or multi-national alliances.

Satire is not my favorite form of humor, so it took me a few essays to get &quot;into the swing&quot; of the book, but I can say that once I came around to the appropriate frame of reference, I quite enjoyed the book. When reading this book, you must also remember that it was originally published in 1910; the humorous themes of the essays have aged well, but some of the settings have not.As I read the essays, I kept having the nagging thought that the author's style reminded me of a contemporary author. Once I reached the &quot;How to Make a Million Dollars&quot; essay, it hit me: I would not hesitate to call Stephen Leacock the Dave Barry (Miami columnist and author) of the early 1900s. They both have the same sort of perverse logic to their points of view. Thus, if you can picture Dave Barry writing in the early 1900s, you can get some idea of what reading this book of essays would be like."},{"Title":"Literary lapses","review":"This is for those who love that dry English humor. I love this book! It mocks so beautifuly stupidities, naivete, and human anxietes. If you like slap stick humor, please look somewhere else."},{"Title":"Literary lapses","review":"Stephen Leacock was a Canadian author who wrote his works with an optimistic yet realistic view of life. His light-hearted, bubbly diction impressed me all the way through the novel. Each short story was unique and had true-to-life situations and entertaining characters to whom readers of all ages can relate. His stories are full of good advice for everyone from the socially elite, eager-to-please teenager to the hard-working businessman to the overprotective father. Leacock exaggerates in many of his sketches, but that aspect of each story fits in perfectly with the separate ideas he presents. I recommend this novel to anyone who agrees that life should be lived to the absolute fullest, taking all chances and having a good time. As Stephen Leacock says, &quot;Eat what you want. Eat lots of it. Yes, eat too much of it. Eat till you can just stagger across the room with it and prop it up against the sofa.&quot; (Leacock Literary 31)"},{"Title":"Literary lapses","review":"A truly wonderful collection of pieces, ranging from silly to savage, by the Canadian equivalent of Robert Benchley. I say Robert Benchley because, like Benchley, Leacock has a wide range of interests that include poking fun at himself (the first essay, where he makes a fool of himself opening a bank account, is a classic for a reason), poking fun at social trends (the then-new fitness craze, the then-new obsession with doctors and medicine), and--at his best--sheer lunacy. (Like Benchley, he will launch into storytelling mode in order to mock entire types of stories--such as one about a nobleman's secret, which builds up the suspense and then ends with no one caring about the secret after all.) While some of his obsessions have dated, these pieces are almost perfectly constructed: they are all very short and efficient so as not to wear out their welcome. And from a construction point of view, not a line is out of place, not a single joke feels less than perfectly aimed. It's truly impressive and wonderful; humor collections this strong are rare. If you like the writers of the Algonquin Round Table, his Canadian equivalent is also their equal.

Too big because it is unduly wide -- going on eight inches (20 cm) when even today's hefty nondenominational hymnals like WORSHIP AND REJOICE or THE CELEBRATING GRACE HYMNAL don't dare go beyond about 6.5. This unusual width made the new hymnal difficult to fit into existing pew racks. Yet it is too small, too, because it is a rather thin volume, offering only 313 hymns not counting Service Music like the Kyrie, multipart \\"Amen's,\\" and such. Basically the hymns are laid out like those in most other denominational hymnals and show tune names, meter, and common names. Some accoutrements baffle me, like the asterisk preceding the names of some hymns that supposedly identify them as \\"Ecumenical.\\" What standards were used, I don't know; nor do I know the usefulness of the asterisk if *\\"O Holy City, Seen of John\\" is flagged as ecumenical but \\"We Shall Overcome\\" is not. Of course, there are admirable features too, like F. Samuel Janzow's 1970 translation of \\"A Mighty Fortress,\\" which is much more true to Martin Luther's words than the usual wording that leans heavily on poet Thomas Carlyle. The embossed red cover of the pew hymnal is particularly handsome, binding adequate, paper quality good. Used copies are easy to find and still fairly cheap. But all in all, more bang for the buck is to be found with a modern nondenominational hymnal which will have at least twice the hymn content of this one, and replicate most of them. The HYMNAL OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST was relieved of duty in 1995 when the UCC brought out its NEW CENTURY HYMNAL, but that's a whole 'nother controversy (q.v.)."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"&quot;President James Buchanan&quot; remains the definitive biography of our 15th President. Instead of simply rehashing the tired and often unfair criticism of Buchanan as &quot;the worst President of the United States&quot;, Klein relies upon a wealth of primary source material to present a complex and fascinating man. Instead of being charactered as an inept failure, Buchanan comes across as an accomplished statesman who was dedicated to the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law who was caught in a &quot;no win&quot; situation as President. In seeking a compromise solution to avoid the impending holocaust of the Civil War when a compromise solution was probably no longer possible, Buchanan appear as a tragic figure more thasn as an abysmal failure. Klein's book is extremely well researched and insightful and is highly recommended to all those seeking to gain a greater understanding of our 15th President and the turbulent years before the Civil War."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"Philip Klein's biography finally places the presidency of James Buchanan in the favorable light it deserves. Buchanan was discredited and vilified by politicians who put their party ahead of the nation. Power was more important to them than preserving the Union. First they obstructed his peace efforts and then scapegoated him for the Civil War when it began. &quot;Buchanan assumed leadership of the United States when an unprecedented wave of angry passion was sweeping the nation. That he held the hostile sections in check during these revolutionary times was in itself a remarkable achievment. His weaknesses in the stormy years of his presidency were magnified by enraged partisans of the North and the South. His many talents, which in a quieter era might have gained for him a place among the great presidents of his country, were quickly overshadowed by the cataclysmic events of civil war and by the towering personality of Abraham Lincoln. Of Buchanan it might be said, as it was of another, 'He staked his reputation on the supremacy of reason, and lost.' &quot;"},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"Over the last several years I've read more than 30 presidential biographies using Amazon reviewers as my guide to picking out the best book. Klein's biography of Buchanan is one of the better biographies of one of our most unsuccessful presidents (Francis Russell's biography of Warren G. Harding definitely takes the prize in this category).Politics were the major American sport of 19th century, and Pennsylvania was one of the most grueling states to play the political game. James Buchanan (or Martin Van Buren) was the quintessential 19th century politician, and the Civil War was the culmination of 50 years of America playing politics, rather than seriously attempting to address national issues.Buchanan is an interesting subject because of the longevity of his career and his ability to master the game of politics. He managed to finesse every issue in a way that helped him rise in the national consciousness and avoid being tarnished with actually standing for or against much of anything. He spent 35 years in elective and appointed offices constantly battling to build his power. For at least 20 years he worked towards the goal of becoming president. While this political savvy helped him gain the presidency, it certainly did not prepare him (or seemingly any politician in the 1850's) to work constructively in a way that might have prevented the Civil War from occurring.Klein's book is well written, nicely organized, and for the most part a balanced portrayal of a political animal. He does a good job of blending Buchanan's public and private lives. Klein tends to defend Buchanan's efforts in politics while having some fun with Buchanan's increasingly crusty personality . Klein definitely underplays Buchanan's insubordination while he served as Secretary of State during the Polk administration and the Mexican War. He makes a persuasive argument that both the highly factionalized Democrats and the radical Republicans were more interested in gaining power and control than they were in addressing the issue of slavery in anything resembling a constructive fashion. In this sense Buchanan appears to be a president doomed to failure as much as one who just was not up to the job."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"Writing a biography of man who was a very public failure cannot be an easy task--after spending so much time researching the man, you have to admire him, yet he may be deserving of little admiration. This is the trap into which Klein falls in this book.The book provides a detailed and fairly interesting look at Buchanan's early and mid-career in Pennsylvania politics. Klein sketches the state political battles that took Buchanan to Washington as a congressman and eventually to the presidency and has clearly read the correspondence by and about Buchanan well. This strength prevented me from giving the book only a single star.Yet Klein has a vendetta against the \\"Black\\" Republicans, as he calls them; abolitionists; and Abraham Lincoln. He defends Buchanan's every action in Bleeding Kansas, although he exacerbated a situation that Franklin Pierce had helped to create. Every Pennsylvania politician who opposed Buchanan comes across as deceitful, while Buchanan is a paragon of honesty and principle. But worst of all, Klein accepts Buchanan's every excuse for inaction during the four months after Lincoln's election and blames Lincoln, Seward, and others for the whole debacle instead of admitting that Buchanan was simply a weak and vacillating man in a situation that demanded decisive action and courage.Buchanan has probably gotten a bum rap for causing the Civil War, but he also was not the wonderful politician and president Klein makes him out to be. However, the portrayal is so transparent that you can see the flaws in Buchanan despite the author's intentions."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"I am currently reading a biography of every President in order. Philip Klein's biography was the clear cut choice for a full treatment of James Buchanan, with the only other alternative being the short bio from the American Presidents series.Luckily Klein's biography is a great choice, not because it is the only one available, but because it is a great biography in it's own right. Klein's treatment is extensive enough to be a full academic level presentation but not so much as to deter the more casual reader. The writing style and organization are both excellent and the research is extensive. Klein makes a strong case that James Buchanan was not as bad of a President as history has presented him, and certainly changed my understanding of his role in the start of the Civil War.It's easy to see why Klein's biography has remained the only full treatment of James Buchanan for nearly half a century. It is such a quality biography of our fifteenth President that it leaves no room or need for another."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"A well done and comprehensive biography of one of the U.S.' lesser known and more maligned presidents. Not only does Klein do a very good job of allowing the reader to acquire some familiarity with Buchanan's personality, he does so with a view to showing how those traits influenced how he dealt with the sectional crisis which came to a head during his presidency. While Klien does an admirable job of disproving the various calumnies spread about Buchanan (that did nothing or actively abetted Southern secessionists) he is so focused on rehabilitating Buchanan's reputation that he somewhat overlooks how Buchanan constrained himself from doing all that he could do. Note also that the author assumes a moderate familiarity with U.S political history in the first half of the 19th Century (for example, while mentioning the various sectional Compromises, he does not discuss them in detail beyond the impact on Buchannan's actions of the moment).(Without 'spoiling' the book, one does come to the conclusion that Lincoln's observation that \\"The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.\\" would have never occured to Buchanan. It would have been nice to see the author share that observation.)"},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"Before I picked up this book, I viewed James Buchanan as a southern sympathizer, a person with homosexual tendencies, and a failure as a President. I held this view because of the rather limited amount of information out there regarding the 15th President. In fact, the History Channel paints Buchanan with a broad southern brush and brings up the rumors of homosexuality.These opinions and reviews are unfounded and unfair. Philip Klein does a great job in telling the true story of Buchanan in this outstanding biography.Buchanan just happened to be President during leadup to the most difficult crisis in the history of the country and was handcuffed greatly by radicals on the Republican side and by the slavery at all costs folks on the other side. He did his best to navigate the middle of these extremes according to his interpretation of the law as laid out in the constitution.Some might say that Klein is to easy on Buchanan and that he isn't completely fair when looking at his public or personal life. That is hogwash in my opinion. In fact, Klein goes to great lengths to tell the true story of Buchanan's life and provides supporting documentation that is pretty convincing... I was convinced.One interesting thing to note is toward the end of the biography, Klein writes the following: \\"(17th President Andrew) Johnson wavered and at last failed to enact the program laid out by the Radicals... for that they impeached him.\\" This is making reference to Andrew Johnson's Presidency that is considered a failure as well due to his inaffective leadership in carrying out the beginnings of reconstruction. The tone of this paragraph suggests to me that Klein thinks Johnson is viewed in an unfair life and thus Buchanan is viewed in the same light.I totally agree with both notions that Buchanan and Johnson are viewed unfairly. In nearly every respect, Buchanan's Presidency should not be viewed as a failure but rather unfortunate timing. He was, in fact, a scapegoat and not dealt with fairly by his party, Stephen Douglas, Lincoln (not to bad mouth Lincoln though), and the public and media following his Presidency. Not to say he was a great President... he wasn't and neither was Johnson. But Buchanan in particular got no help from his cabinet and congress to handle any of the complicated issues of the time. On those issues where he could make a difference he did.I would rate this Presidency as effective and unspectacular. Klein is a fair evaluator and a concise and interesting writer in his account of the man and his public life.The one issue I'm still left wondering about however is Buchanan's sexuality. He never married and never had children. He sounds like he was a bit of a fancy lad. Was he gay? Perhaps. Klein doesn't go into this and in fact talks at length about Buchanan's supposed relationship(s) with women. But, this book was written many years ago when perhaps a biographer might sweep something like Presidential homosexuality under the rug.Homosexuals routinetly now make the case that Lincoln was gay because of his tendency to share a bed with men. That is complete BS. Buchanan lived with a man much of the time he was in Washington and is considered by the gay community to be the first gay President. Not that there is anything wrong with that... Seinfeld... but I was left wondering if Klein looked into it and found no grounds or again swept it under the rug out of respect for the office and the fact that this book was researched and written in the early 1960s.This is the book to read on Buchanan though I would just say there were some unanswered questions and your opinion of the President may not mesh with Klein's which could lead to disappointment."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"Of all the Presidents only Grant and Harding rank lower in the estimation of historians than James Buchanan. His biggest fault was lacking the moral courage to act upon an evil that was destroying the country; this was compounded by his willingness to defend his inaction by pleading through the Constitution the weakness of his office and of the federal government to impose their will upon the states. A festering wound was therefore allowed to infect the whole country.Buchanan was born near Mercersburg, PA; while at Dickinson College, he got into some kind of trouble (unspecified) and was almost expelled. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1812, and served in the PA state legislature for two years before being elected to Congress in 1821. A Federalist at first, when the party disbanded he became a Jacksonian Democrat. He was the Secretary of State under Polk from 1845-49, and became minister to Great Britain under Pierce in 1853. He became the 15th President in 1856 and in his Inaugural Address set his ship upon the course that would eventually lead to ruin: \\"...under the Constitution slavery in the States is beyond the reach of any human power except that of the respective States themselves.\\" Bloody Kansas soon followed while Buchanan lost his soundness of judgment behind the Constitution. So did the Panic of 1857, which plunged the country into a depression, about which he maintained a hands-off policy. With Lincoln's election in 1860, the southern states threatened secession. Buchanan declared that a state had no legal right to secede, but at the same time the federal government did not have the authority to prevent it. Civil war became inevitable.After leaving the White House, Buchanan retired to his estate at Lancaster, PA. He never married, though he was engaged to Ann Coleman (other sources spell her name Anne) as a young man; she apparently broke it off and died shortly afterwards in Philadelphia - the rumor of it being from suicide circulated a long time (Klein doesn't speculate here, but also doesn't waver from the word \\"rumor\\"). Some time ago I had read that Buchanan, always an avid reader, had stopped reading books altogether during his final years, but Klein makes no mention of this. Buchanan died in 1868.Klein's biography is written with great authority and remains definitive. It is obvious he is fond of his subject and is sympathetic towards Buchanan's dilemma, but he is not a blind panegyrist. Under different circumstances Buchanan might have been a worthy President; even as things were he was perhaps the most honest leader the country ever had. Klein's account of the man is informative and interesting, and written with great style and elan. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"There have been more books written about Abraham Lincoln that any other Chief Executive.

Phillip Klein brings the times and Presidency of James Buchanan to life, and opens some bona fide questions and discussions of his Presidency in a historical context.Generally acknowledged by current historians as the worst President in United States history, it is doubtful anyone would read this fine biography and believe that Buchanan belongs even in the top half of the administrations that have led our country. Yet, Klein paints Buchanan as a man of measured principle, strong leadership, and able experience.Buchanan wrestled with the Constitutional principles prior to the secession of South Carolina, and struggled with the decision guided by the writing of same while weighing waging war. Along with this, he was hamstrung by an unsupportive Congress, and a Cabinet that was unreliable. Klein points out that some of the blame for inflaming the passions leading to the Civil War lands on Lincoln for not communicating and reaching out to a distrustful South.He also points out that history is created in sometimes unfair ways, and was unjust toward Buchanan. Buchanan was scapegoated after leaving office by both the press and the Republican Party, and was blamed for the onset of the Civil War.History conspired against Buchanan, in much the way it also did later againt Herbert Hoover. He was a patriot, a public servant, and a decent man. Given another era, and another circumstance, he may have acquitted himself very well, and led the Country ably.This is a well written biography. It paints the times which Buchanan grew up in, his long career, and his presidency. It raises questions to ponder about his legacy, and the historical perspective which he has always been judged. On top of this, it is interesting, illustrating the pace and excitement of the times.A highly worthwhile historical biography."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"Bad points- 1) The first half is boring. Buchanan versus the Anti-Masons. We are treated to every detail of their fight but I couldn't tell you what one stood for versus the other except that they both wanted to be in office...2)Little detail into Buchanan's personal Life. What made him tick? Aside from \\"If it isn't in the Constitution, it's wrong\\", we get nothing.3)Little about Ann Coleman considering the size of the book.4)Nothing about what endeared him to Queen Victoria despite this being his greatest accomplishment?!Good points- 1)meticulous detail2) gets very exciting as the secession crisis develops."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"It was hard to find a good biography of President Buchanan, most books just cover his presidency.

The actual text is blurry and whole letters can only be recognized in context. I wanted a bio that was published before the current reevaluation of President Buchanan which is why I got this one. But this must be a first generation scan and nothing was ever done to clean up the scan. Please buy a readable copy of this book."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"Being the best biography of James Buchanan is like being the best NFL team in Illinois--there's really not any competition. But that doesn't mean that this is not a really good book (or that the Bears are not a good team, for that matter).This book was well-written and mostly very interesting (I agree with some reviewers that some of the portions on his early political career probably went into more detail than I needed). I think it gave a fair defense of James Buchanan and his presidency. It didn't hold him out to be a heroic figure, nor as the incompetent and spineless jellyfish as he has been characterized by many. The basic premise is that Buchanan was generally a good and honest man (albeit ambitious and maybe a bit devious at times) who drew an unfortunate and unlucky spot in history. Klein basically says that, despite his long and distinguished career in public service, Buchanan was too cautious and conservative in nature to deal with the impending sectional crises of his day. They swallowed him up alive, as they did Pierce before him.Buchanan committed the unforgivable sin of supporting a compromise on slavery in order to preserve the Union. Never mind that nearly every politician since George Washington had done the same thing (why was the Civil War not fought earlier? Why was slavery permitted by the Constitution to begin with?) or that Abraham Lincoln would have gladly done the same thing prior to 1863, but Buchanan had the misfortune of being the last one to do so before the herioc figure of Lincoln (who arguably had the good fortune of being killed right after his greatest victory and before he had to deal with the mess of Reconstruction--thus securing for himself a hallowed place in history as a martyr for the Union) righted this great wrong.Even Klein does not argue that Buchanan was a great or even effective President. He just argues that the deck was stacked against him, that no one else in his shoes would have likely been much more successful and that he was otherwise a good man and an effective politician and statesman. Buchanan was probably more than due for a somewhat sympathetic treatment, as he received from Klien. This is a well-written, well-researched book that will give you a new appreciation for the difficulties that Buchanan faced. This book has stood up well to the passage of time."},{"Title":"President James Buchanan","review":"This biography does many things well. It portrays Buchanan's political strengths and weakensses, and how these lead him to the White House, and importantly WHEN it lead him to the White House. Buchanan's style and method of gaining the White House (to be called by the people, much like Washington was his goal) made him have to wait until 1856 to get elected. By this point, the nation was heading to a split and Buchanan was not equiped to deal with it. This book gives evidance, than lets the reader decide...Would Buchanan have been poor/good/great had he been elected in any of the elections between 1840 and 1856?In my opinion, Buck was a better choice for President than Taylor, Fillmore and Pierce before him. Had he been in the White House instead of any of these 3, his legacy would have been altered for the better."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s","review":"Norman Naimark, famous author of Fires of hatred (trad. also in Italy), with other expert scholars (Vucinich, Emmert, Fine, etc)fill with that book a historiographic vacuum about a complex and unexplored question.

Also, the book gives details about the customs of German Jews at specific centuries, but rarely mentions customs of, say, Jews from Islamic countries.So if you're looking for an introduction, this is the book for you.

It seems that this book has gone into public domain and Forgotten Books is one of several companies that is making this work available to the general public. I know this because I accidentally misplaced my first copy and found it around the time I received this edition from Amazon. The \\"other\\" edition, published by The University of Pennsylvania Press has a purple cover with a medieval art-inscription underneath the title and inside is a reproduction of \\"Popular Medieval Amulet to Protect the Mother and Child Against an Attack by Lilith\\". And, unlike the Forgotten Press ed., the pages are a light cream color as opposed to white. The fonts, text, annotations and bibliography are identical. Either copy is priceless to own.About the text. It is a comprehensive and explicit look at some of the practices believed to have been a part of the Jewish experience in the periods just before, during and right after in medieval Western Europe. This is not a text that covers an exhaustive look at all Jewish superstitious beliefs nor for all periods of Jewish existence. That would be impossible for even 10 volumes. For a look at Jewish beliefs of Eastern Europe, I highly recommend, The Book of Legends: Sefer Ha Aggadah.Some of the topics, Rabbi Joshua Trachtenberg (of blessed memory) used as a part of his doctoral dissertation, \\"The Powers of Evil\\"-- thoughts concerning the makeup, work and influence of evil. \\"Man and The Demons,\\" \\"In the Name of...\\"-- using incantations of Biblical phrases and divine names. \\"Amulets,\\" \\"Dreams,\\" \\"Astrology\\" are also covered thoroughly.One reviewer erroneously stated that this book \\"only scratches the surface...[lacks] the breath and flesh.\\" What book was he reading? Again, this book is not supposed to address all Jewish beliefs for every given period or every locale. Our own experiences are influenced by the environment by which we inhabit, that's true for all people at all times. He should not be expected to answer all questions for all Jews at all times. This is for a specific period and for a specific location. Period. By the way, the bibliography is well-research at 90+ pages to support his conclusions.This book, I would say, reveals the basis of Modern (not Classical) Christian Anti-Semitic beliefs. To see how medieval Christian attitudes were demonstrated I would suggest Dr. Trachenberg's follow-up (and part two of his doctoral dissertation) The Devil and The Jews, and Shakespeare and The Jews by James Shapiro."},{"Title":"Jewish magic and superstition;: A study in folk religion","review":"This book is the author's doctoral thesis from Hebrew Union College and was first published in 1939. Yet it is accessible to the general reader. It is fascinating to see the probable origins of so many traditional Jewish practices. The need for what is described as magical interventions was so strong the the Rabbis of old could not always disallow them. The question of the divide between what constitutes faith versus what is magic and superstition will likely arise in the reader but it is not the intention of this book to speak to this. There are a few frustration with this book. The author makes many assertions without being referenced, despite the plethora of other scholarly citations. Also there are frequent quotations in German, a language that scholarly readers of that day would know, but they are left untranslated in this edition. Finally, there is no index, though there is a glossary and othre supporting material."},{"Title":"Jewish magic and superstition;: A study in folk religion","review":"The style is a little old-fashioned, but the book is a surprisingly sophisticated, knowledgeable and even-handed account of Jewish traditions of magic in northern European communities in the late middle ages.

It is, however, a very good introduction, because you get to read texts by nearly twenty people who wrote on narratology (and they include nearly everyone who is anyone in narratology), and if you find what they have to say interesting, you can read up on that. You also get a very good summary of the ideas and the history of narratology which helps you see and understand similarities to and differences from other literary theories you may know.If you are interested in a more linguistic approach to narrative, you might want to read Michael J.

Having been a fan of Ms. Rice's for years I knew her storytelling abilities were phenomenal whether in the contemporary or historical genres.

Ninian Malcolm Siddons is a witch with the art of healing those in the village of Wystan beneath the Castle belonging to Earl Drogo Ives, newely returned to the area. Lord Ives doesn't realize all the local folklore about the Malcolm witches and Ives devils. All the Ives' are dark, handsome and extremely virile and always sire males. The Malcolm witches are all women, fair of face with golden locks and they always birth females. They have a bad history that Drogo knows nothing about between the families. It's rumored if the two families intermarry the town will be destroyed. Guess what happens? You'll love the chaos!There is so much love, magic, and crazy family situations to sort out that I know you are going to love being a part of this magical novel of two extraordinary people who through the magic of love and working together make this an unforgettable story to cherish.

This one, Merely Magic, is the first and does a splendid job of setting up Rice's remarkable magical world and the two families that gird the series.The magic of the Malcolm women is unusual, and each one has her own special talent and unique way of looking at the world. Each Ives man is stubborn, arrogant, and scientifically-minded -- what could they possibly have in common? The two families are consistently intriguing and their individual antics, much less the inevitable combustion when they meet, are vastly entertaining. Add an excellent romance, and there is much to enjoy in this delightful book.There are occasions when Drogo's arrogance is irritating and Ninian's submission is annoying, but these character flaws make them more realistic, and one can appreciate the difficulty in making a realtionship between opposites work. The superstition of the villagers and their resulting snubbing plays honestly.

Instead she's an outsider as the people will never forget that she's a Malcolm - a witch. After generations of neglect, Lord Drogo Ives, the earl who owned the land, shows up out of the blue to stay at the castle.

When her grandmother had been alive she hadn't been quite so lonely. Ninian didn't mind so much the feeling of being kept at a distance, especially where it was a well-known fact that she was a witch -a witch whose healing talents were gladly accepted, even if she was not. As a healer, she had the ability to \`read' or \`empathize' with a person's innermost feelings, so it was disconcerting, to say the least when the newly arrived Drago, Earl of Ives could completely block both his feelings and presence from her. Dark, mysterious, and totally logical, Drago did not accept the unexplainable- nor was he about to believe in witches or anything that reeked of the supernatural.Meeting this \`moonchild' on the feast of Beltane, would forever change both their lives as they were both inexplicitly drawn together into an attraction that according to legend should end in disaster, should the Ives and Malcolms mate. With the interference of Drago's cousin Sarah, who dabbled in matchmaking and aphrodisiacs the die would be cast and whether it was Sarah's interference, or pure unadulterated lust -- the passionate mating of these two polar opposites would forever change the course of their lives into one fantastic and \`merely magical' event.I truly loved this story. The historical significance of the Malcolm/Ives mating, Drago and Ninian's contrasting personalities and especially their totally mesmerizing families consisting of Ninian's witchy aunts, and cousins, and Drago's assortment of brothers, both legitimate and not - what a circus! This was such a distinctive and unusual read - even if Drago's stubbornness made me want to slap him along the side of his head to wake him up to other possibilities! Whew! Unfortunately, I have rated this a trifle lower based on the historical aspect, only because of the references made to helium which was not discovered until 1895 and seemed out of place in the 1750 setting of the book. Nonetheless, I am very much looking forward to reading more from this author on how this odd assortment of relatives (Dunstan, Adonis, Ewan, etc.) get on with the sequels in this planned series. --- Marilyn Rondeau, Official Reviewer for www.historicromancewriters.com ---"},{"Title":"Merely Magic","review":"I bought this on kindle after having read the original in paperback.

Ninian is a gifted herbalist and healer in a small village. She is always on the outside of the crowd as the people are a bit afraid of the rumors of the Malcolm witches. Ninian doesn't expect to ever have a family of her own because of her solitary life.The large manor home near the village, is owned by Lord Ives but it has been vacant for many years. The Ives men only have sons and seemed doomed to have unhappy marriages. There is a history of an old Malcolm and Ives marriage that brought disaster to the house and village. Lord Drogo is a man of logic, math and science. Drogo is the head of the family and since he was a young teen he has been responsible for the family finances and the corralling of the rambunctious boys, legitimate and otherwise. He was never coddled as a boy and is not prone to express, or even allow himself to feel, much emotion. He thought he had escaped to the manor house to study stars and to get a break from the family duties.When Ninian and Drogo meet it is like trying to put the earth and stars together but the draw between them is instant and overpowering. Drogo is used to controlling everyone in his family. Ninian is self sufficient and doesn't need someone to control her. She needs someone to accept and love her. But Drogo doesn't believe in love or witches or magic.

She had a brain. She just didn't use it as he did.\\" p 267.This book flows smoothly and beautifully.

You have a young, naive yet strong, heroine. Then there is the moody, brooding, mysterious love interest. Of course these two completely butt heads on everything, yet something pulls them together. They each learn things from each other and grow as a result. I did rather enjoy Ninian's strong attitude. She did what she wanted, and really didn't let anyone boss her around.The thing that was lacking for me was the action and adventure. I know it is a historical romance, but I just wanted to read about something other than the new carpet and draperies, or the new plant Ninian was nurturing in the garden.This story, as the title suggests, does have a light paranormal element to it, and would be perfect for someone who wants to try some paranormal for the first time.

Even the setting is magical - a village in the woods, secluded. Everything sounded lush and green, until they discovered that something was poisoning the water. Ninian discovers this just as she meets Drogo - because the stream is on his property that she collects her plants from for her cures. She is the local healer - it is what she was born to do and all that she knows. Even the villagers steer clear of her unless they have need of her potions.Drogo on the other hand is city bred and lives by logic. He does not trust anything mystical or magical - or let's just say he doesn't believe in it. He is the oldest Ives brother and has spent his entire life making sure that the rest of his family is provided for. This leaves him alone with just his ledgers and his books most of the time.Somehow these two lonely people are thrown together - well, they have help from Drogo's half sister Sarah, who seems to think that Ninian is the only one who can have Drogo's child. I love the way that they fight each other through out the whole book - both wanting what they think they can't have. It is almost like they can't see what is standing right in front of them.This is a reprint as this book was first published about 10 years ago. It is the first in a series and I am looking forward to learning more about these two families - the Ives and the Malcolms. They have a rich history and much legend in the village is built around what would happen if two of them ever got together. If you like the current batch of paranormal/historical romances that are out, I would recommend giving this one a shot!"},{"Title":"Merely Magic","review":"Logic and emotion collide in Patricia Rice's rich Georgian paranormal MERELY MAGIC, a story of the importance of being true to oneself and of letting people live their own lives.Malcolm women and Ives men do not mix. Sequestered in her isolated little village, healer and empath Ninian, one of the long line of Malcolm witches, has never met an Ives. And then Drogo, the long-absent Earl of Ives, arrives at his castle. The uber-responsible slave to logic Drogo is taking a break from picking up the pieces after his maddeningly flighty family's antics. Never did either Ninian or Drogo expect the immediate and overpowering attraction that blasts them when they meet. But passion has its own logic, and these two supposedly mismatched people wed. Ninian is terrified she might lose herself under the onslaught of Drogo's potent masculinity. Drogo fears becoming like all the other male Iveses, who destroyed their marriages while siring numerous bastards. And he doesn't believe in witches.MERELY MAGIC takes you on a wild emotional ride in this complex, riveting tale of the mind-numbing fear and towering passion involved when opposites attract. Written in Ms. Rice's signature style that seamlessly combines emotion and action, the story sweeps you along with a varied cast of characters who are true to their time, and yet timeless. I especially like Ninian's and Drogo's wedding ceremony, where Drogo must vow equality with his wife. Equality with a woman in Georgian England? What a cork-brained idea.First in Ms. Rice's \\"Magic\\" series, MERELY MAGIC sets the scene for the continuing saga of the Malcolm witches. I can't wait for the next story.ARC provided by Sourcebooks."},{"Title":"Merely Magic","review":"This was a pretty good book. I've liked her comtemporary romance better I think. I was a little disgusted with Ninian thru out most of the book; She just let everyone lead her around by the nose. I did like the fact that Drogo was not willing to give up his marriage even before he came to believe in her. I also enjoyed the antics of both families - that part got really cute. I didn't like the fact that the mystery of Adonis was not cleared up, although I do realize that he will probably have a book of his own."},{"Title":"Merely Magic","review":"This story is so well written...It takes you away and makes your imagination soar...Its complexity makes you think and want to find out more making it hard to put down....Patricia Rice is an extraordinary story teller....Her stories make you laugh and cry...and make your adrenaline flow....There is always many surprises along the way...and things to leave you wondering and assuming....I have only read her historical novels and am amazed at her knowledge to every detail of the time and place she writes about....I can say so many more positive things about Patricia Rice's writing talents...I believe that there are story readers that find her novels too complex to follow and are not keen on the historical times she writes about....But not I!!!.....I myself can relate to her depiction of love, desire, fear, and age old anamosity between men and women through my own life's experiences and those I've observed in others....and her masterful ability to tell a story of how a relationship develops in such wonderful detail...She has an emmense understanding of human nature and emotions and can express it in a way like no other writer can....touching a reader's heart and soul so deeply..."},{"Title":"Merely Magic","review":"This being my first Patricia Rice novel, I have mixed feelings about her talents as a Romance novelist. Very interesting take on the game of love with some original ideas on relationships. The Malcom/Ives mythology is ingenious! However, I feel that the hero, Drogo was still too unaccepting and blind to Ninian's &quot;gift&quot; for comfort...that does not bode for a happily ever after...Other than the continued reinforcement of Drogo's inability to &quot;listen&quot; as Ninian put it, the book was a unique read, that has me waiting for a development of the different members of Drogo's family. Such as the mysterious Adonis, Dunstan and even meddlesome, manipulative Sarah."},{"Title":"Merely Magic","review":"I didn't start off reading this first book in the series. I kind of went backwards through it and I finally was able to find Merely Magic at an affordable price (since apparently it's no longer on bookstore shelves). I absolutely loved the other books in the series, but to me, Merely Magic was just kind of dull. I imagine if you begin with this book and then make your way through the series, it will be fine. However, I wouldn't suggest this book to those of you who have already read the other books in the series...unless you just want to know the actual story of Ninian and Drogo."},{"Title":"The Origins of Christianity","review":"Dr. Oliver was the antithesis of the previous reviewer. He was a scholar of great depth who could explain his position without name calling. In the academic world, it is the convention that no matter how bizarre others may consider a given position, if it can be logically defended by a consistent and coherent argument, then it deserves to be heard. Dr. Oliver was the epitome of the academic who possessed this ability, his defence of his political opinions being masterly, intelligent, compelling and concise. This is the case whether one agrees or disagrees. Racist ? Some might take this view, but he was a man with a deeply felt conviction which he wished to express, and in any nation which aspires to free speech and democracy that right must be honoured. If you disagree with what is said, make an intelligent rebuttal which is the honourable position to take. As to the content of \\"The Origins of Christianity\\", few would deny that Dr. Oliver has grasped the crux of the problem that Christianity has for Western man. It is an alien faith which, if looked at dispassionately, is nothing more than a sect of Judaism. It began in the Middle East, spread to Europe and transformed itself into the overarchingly dominant faith it is today. This process Dr. Oliver has researched meticulously and analysed in his book. For those who are able to read religiously oriented works without feeling threatened by the truth, this book is something which should not be missed, as it will increase understanding of the origins and development of Christianity into the faith we see today. If, however, you are of the school which does not care to get involved in new ideas or intelligent debate, leave this book alone, as it will not be good for your blood pressure. Fundamentalist Christians beware."},{"Title":"The Origins of Christianity","review":"Anti-semitic?From what my Jewish friends tell me, could it be that racial-driven 'semitism,' which labels all non-Jews as 'goys' and on a level with cattle, according to the Torah, and 'zionism,' which puts its own interests above U.S. interests in the Middle East and everywhere, cause a perfectly natural counter-reacction, as a defense of other tribes (non-Jew), that is popularly called 'anti-semitism'?Professor Oliver and even the non-profit group called EURO may be on to something.Read it, and think for yourself. That's called freedom of speech."},{"Title":"The Origins of Christianity","review":"This is an atheist take on the origins of Christianity. He goes into the influence that other religions, in particular Zoroastrianism, had on Christian theology. The stuff pointing out the influence and ideas that those that propagated Christianity stole was good but the highlight for me was the little zingers that Oliver sneaks in here and there about the idiocy of Christians and also the differences in the worldviews of Aryans and Jews and the corrosive effects that Jewish ideas have had on Aryan society.Oliver was an interesting guy. He helped Robert Welch found the John Birch Society but eventually left because of the JBS policy of not allowing members to mention the \\"J\\" word. He also later claimed that Welch admitted to him that the JBS was covertly funded by Rockefeller money. Oliver wrote a lot of good stuff over the years. His later writings and speeches took on a very anti-Christian slant which showed he was a true free thinker when you consider that he evolved out of a very right wing, anti-communist ideology and the time period he came out of.This is good but overall I wasn't blown away by it the way I thought I would be so I'd probably only recomend it to people who are interested in Oliver or someone who is researching Christianity from a practical viewpoint."},{"Title":"The Origins of Christianity","review":"RACIST. This word summarizes the book. It's thoroughly anti-semitic. The author believes in the superiority of the \\"Aryan Race\\", and tries promote it throughout the book.

It's a book that's worth having in your home library because it has so much to offer schoolastically and personally."},{"Title":"Long-term Care: Managing Across the Continuum","review":"This was assigned as a text book and it was a good one. This text is packed with information on the various ways long-term care is delivered in the US today. After one reads this book they will understand the complexities of the long-term care health care system. Pratt discusses, funding, organizational structures, regulation, accreditation, and how the different types of long-term care fit into the whole system.Each chapter builds to provide a complete picture of long-term care and understanding how all the parts fit together to make a whole system. This book is strongest is in its discussion of funding structures and how funding impacts service delivery. The strongest chapters were on quality and the various ways that quality is currently measured. Pratt points out that measuring process and systems as is currently and most commonly done does not always guarantee quality outcomes.Chapter 2 which discusses the \\"ideal\\" long-term care health system and Appendix A: Criteria for Designing or Evaluating a Long-Term Care System are worth the price of this book because the information contained in these pages can assist long-term care administrators strengthen their facilities and service delivery and policy makers in understanding the complexities of long-term care systems."},{"Title":"Conscious Divorce: Finding freedom through forgiveness","review":"I thought Ms. Dunn was able to capture some of the true moments that some divorced couples experience...And some of the true desires......"},{"Title":"Conscious Divorce: Finding freedom through forgiveness","review":"I was turned on to conscious divorce by a friend who had given it rave reviews.

This book has challenged the way I do gardening.This past season I was able to implement many of Ruth Stouts methods and I was surprised how carefree my garden was. If your tired of weeding, watering, cultivating, and the results being at the mercy of the weather than read this book! I'm anxious to try more of her off beat ideas next year. She writes in a casual conversational way and gives more than enough reasons for everything she recommends. This book is truely about less work and better results in the garden. I like to recommend this book to my gardening friends because her methods are usually the answer to their garden problems."},{"Title":"Gardening without work: For the aging, the busy and the indolent","review":"Great fun.

This isn't literature and Ruth is, at times, a bit too folksy but given that my method of gardening isn't much different, I would probably write a lot like her. It turns out I've been a Ruth devotee for a while without even knowing it.If you are not using mulch in your garden/landscape and are tired of weeding and looking at hard, baked dirt, you owe it to yourself to give Ruth a shot. Though written in 1960, the book is still relevant and useful (except the parts about parsnips and turnips :-)."},{"Title":"Gardening without work: For the aging, the busy and the indolent","review":"This book is an old fashioned book written in a rambling conversational kind of way. I often found myself wondering how the different subjects related to one another but Ruth Stout would bring them back to the central point of the chapter. The basic premise of her whole theory is 'mulch, mulch and mulch more'. While this is a valuable tool in gardening this book is not written by an expert (and she never claims to be an expert). If you are looking for a fun read you might find this book interesting, however if you are looking for up to date gardening advice you would be better looking at more modern books with up to date information on mulches currently available. I did enjoy this book though and when written it would have challenged a lot of the expert thinking of the time and challenged a lot of the 'shoulds' gardeners do."},{"Title":"Gardening without work: For the aging, the busy and the indolent","review":"I've seen some of the Ruth Stout videos on YouTube and I ADORE her (R.I.P. Ruth). The writing style is very much like her videos would suggest, you can hear her voice in every word.However, on the practical side, the primary thing you will learn from the book is PUT STRAW OR HAY MULCH ON EVERYTHING IN YOUR GARDEN AND YOU WILL HAVE VERY LITTLE WORK TO DO WHILE ENRICHING YOUR SOIL. There, I just saved you some money.It's still rather sweet, I'm just not sure that beyond the primary tip I just revealed, you'll gain much else here that you can't gain from any other source on gardening. Ruth still rocks though!"},{"Title":"Gardening without work: For the aging, the busy and the indolent","review":"Ruth Stout knows what she is doing but I sensed a tone of irritation in her book with people who need information on what to do. Most of the book is relating her experiences without any real information. She talks about a fence her brother built to keep out raccoons but yet no details about what this fence was or how it was constructed. This isn't a book for beginning gardeners. I was dissapointed with the books lack of real information. If you want information on how to garden this is not the book to read.

It turned out to be so much more than I ever expected. Not just in the reading, but in the doing. For the first time in a long time, I know that I will be able to garden for many years to come, and for those who are young, it will not wear you down like old gardening does. Trust me, I know both, and THIS METHOD IS OUTSTANDING! I intend to grow all of my produce myself, and this is the ONLY way I will be able to do that for so many in my family.

Lossing was an American historian who went from battle site to battle site throughout Canada and the United States writing the accounts of those who fought in this war and/or witnessed it first hand. He was also an artist and did many sketches of each site. Together they make this book a national treasure not to be overlooked. The story goes that on the day he finished his research down in New Orleans in 1860, the American Civil War broke out. Upon hearing the news, Mr. Lossing rushed off to document the activities.

I don't know how many times in the beginning of the book The hero complained out loud and in his head about how upset he was about his wife's dowry and how he doesn't want a wife. The heroine went on endlessly about how attractive the hero is, what he looks like, how much she wants to \\"save\\" him...all an internal diatribe. Snooze!!! I've barely begun this book, am at around chapter 5 or 6 and already I'm feeling suicidal! The author needs to include more dialogue or action in between the inner monologues.

It was like a dream come true, even if it was to be a proxy wedding - the groom was none other than Magnus MacKinnon, the boy she'd fell in love with when she was only a child of twelve. At the time they'd met, they'd each been from rival clans, but Amicia held fast and kept the love she had for him alive in her heart for all the intervening years. Now, with Magnus finally coming home a returning hero, the rivalry has been put aside and Amicia was overjoyed.Magnus MacKinnon had been away for many years competing in tourneys in an attempt to win enough to reinstate the MacKinnon's keep back to some semblance of it's former glory and to be able to win the hand of the Amicia MacLean, the young raven haired girl who'd stolen his heart years ago. Magnus MacKinnon, bone weary both in body and mind, was coming home, but penniless now that his hard earned winnings had been stolen while he battled the English at the battle of Dupplin Moor. The last thing he needed was discovering that he now had a \`bride' waiting for him whose generous dowry was already being used, Magnus' pride and honor had just taken another hit! Oh, he wanted her alright but he wanted to be the one to rebuild the clan's fortune, not from the coin received from his bride.Discovering that Magnus was ready to have the marriage annulled and have Amicia sent back, she dug in her heels - Amica was not about to give up after coming so close to having her dreams realized. She'd do whatever was necessary to tempt the stubborn Highlander into consummating their union. With time running out, and an evil force lurking in the shadows wanting to wipe all traces of the once mighty MacKinnon clan off the face of the earth, would Amicia ever see the happily ever after she'd been waiting all her life for?Sue-Ellen Welfonder, whose love of Medieval Scotland is so great one wonders if she isn't a reincarnation of one of the loving souls she creates in her stories. She maintains the magic and mystery that devoted fans have come to expect from her meticulously researched and highly entertaining Highland reads. In WEDDING FOR A KNIGHT she has injected originality, excitement, and a glimmer of the mystical along with a deeply satisfying love match. Amicia is a superb heroine - one who knows her own mind and was not about to be cast aside. The other truly enjoyable thing about both protagonists was that she was not the perfectly svelte glorious looking typical heroine, rather one with a \`real' body - flaws and all - and that our hero thought of her as perfection!

As she begins to heal him, she works her way into his heart. However, an unknown assailant does not want this marriage to work as that individual wants the two clans at war, which would leave this miscreant as the only winner.This engaging fourteenth century Scottish romance stars a fascinating lead male protagonist who simply has given up on living due to feeling guilt from the surviving carnage of his countrymen. Amica is a fine patient person who believes she can nurture her beloved back to health. Though the serpent in Eden subplot adds intrigue, the strength of this tale is the coupling of a feisty female curing through love her hammered hunk.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wedding for a Knight (Warner Forever S.)","review":"Ms. Welfonder has once again transported this reader on a marvelous historical journey where romance in the Scottish medieval period makes the heart beat faster. Vivid bits of history combine with a strong story that makes Wedding For A Knight a true page-turner. If I could rate this book a perfect 10, I would do so! Thank you, Ms. Welfonder, for another fabulous read!!"},{"Title":"Wedding for a Knight (Warner Forever S.)","review":"Oh my Goodness! This book was horrible. I have had this book since it first came out in 2004 but never read the darn thing. I hate that I wasted three days of my life on it. The hero was brooding, gorgeous and completely boring. The heroinne was way more interesting but this book was not the right setting for her feistiness. The speech pattern was slow reading and cumbersome. And, the mystery who-done-it was not there. I didn't not give a darn who was doing whatever. I skimmed the last 100 pages just to get through this mess. I am done with this author."},{"Title":"Wedding for a Knight (Warner Forever S.)","review":"Well, this was one the most boring books I've ever read! From all the glowing reviews, I was expecting to read a truly great romance novel. Unfortunately, this was not the case.From the moment I started this book I knew it would be a snoozer. First off, the pacing was sooooooo slow! Moreover, I hated the prolix paragraphs--not to mention the tedious details about the internal conflicts of the protagonists. (Most of these \\"internal conflicts\\" went on for two or more pages!). Ultimately, I was yawning so much that I was literally teary-eyed throughout the entire story!Despite my boredom, I thought that the story had its good moments. The very titillating and vividly described sexual descriptions piqued my interests from time to time. These scenes were very well-written, and there was great sexual tension. However, the final act never resonated with the same sexual intensity. (It felt like a good tease left unfulfilled!). The romance, on the other hand, felt passionless and uninspired.All in all, this book was a hit-and-miss--and an utter yawn fest! The protagonists were uninteresting--I couldn't relate to Magnus or Amicia and ended up not caring one whit about them or their story. Contrary to another reviewer's opinion, I don't think Welfonder has an \\"incomparable\\" knack for dialogue. (Short and stilted sentences--interrupted by LONG, boring paragraphs--doesn't make for good dialogue--period!).As one of the greatest living writers once said: \\"Brevity is the soul of wit.\\" Shakespeare is darn right! Sorry Welfonder fans, but this book doesn't live up."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"We were given this book as a gift when my husband and I first got engaged. Unfortunately, this devotional is better suited for couples who have been married a while. Also, there are many references to \\"your children\\" throughout the book, so there are some days where nothing pertinent can be gleaned for newlyweds without children. For couples who have been married a while though, or couples with children, this book has some pretty good things to offer."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"My husband and I are truly enjoying this book.

This book provides a tool to get you and your spouse united together with God. In my opinion this is one of the best investments a couple can make.

My wife and I had never had a set devotional time together, although we both were quite disciplined in our own quiet time. I must say that this book helped bring us closer to God and each other! Be prepared, because a lot of the material probes at the very root of marriage issues. Each section had very specific questions that had to be discussed. We found we did pretty well in some respects and not so good on others. We moved on from this book to a couple of other devotionals and have found the others to be either lightweight or too cerebral to be as helpful on Patrick Morely's."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"My husband and i have tried so many couples devotion books. We will do a few days or a few weeks and then get bored with it. BUT THIS BOOK finally was everything we were looking for and more. It has some humor and Patrick mixes in so many personal stories that really help us relate. They are not too long, just right for us to do in the morning before we start the day. It stimulates conversation about the topic, and sometimes, if it is a touchy subject, we will have to come back to it later and discuss it more. The topics are very good, and sometimes not what we expect when we read the title of the day's topic.For example, one title is \\"The Making of a Mistress\\"...hmmm. But it's not what you might be thinging. Sometimes i feel like Patrick has been inside my head knowing just how I, as a woman, feel about certain things. And of course he also knows how a man feels about things and conveys that as well. Anyway, the book has been great for my husband and me and i hope others find it as enlightening and beneficial as we do. I know it's not for everybody, but I would recommend trying it if you have been looking for a couples devotional."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"We have enjoyed this book over the last eight years of our marriage (ours is called &quot;Two Part Harmony&quot;) and we give to every newly wed couple we know! **Caution: read it from the front and work your way through each chapter. The principles in each section build upon each other. We've found that skipping to another section or just openning the book and reading the one it falls to isn't nearly as effective as reading the devotions in sequence."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"This is a &quot;non-preachy&quot; devotional that addresses all the common, everyday issues all couples face. Loving your spouse unconditionally (even if she's fat), doing household chores (the impact on a family if the husband doesn't complete them as promised), and praying for each other are just a few of the topics covered. After each short (two pages maximum) devotional, there is a discussion question for the couple to share, how to apply the devotion to daily life, then a prayer. &quot;Devotions for Couples&quot; is a simple, practical devotional book for any couple wanting to share time together!"},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"My wife and I have really enjoyed this book.

It's been very helpful for us!"},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"Men - Are you the type that enjoys deep meaningful talks with your wife? If you are you will love this book. However, if you are like most men and find comfort in quietly withdrawing from difficult situations, this book will make you uncomfortable. My wife loves this book, yet, many times it has made me uncomfortable.Why do I still rate it five stars? Simple, it is, hands-down, the best devotional I have ever read for couples. It is not wishy-washy or touchy-feely in any way. It deals with real issues and real marital situations. Even though I have been uncomfortable with the book many times, our marriage is stronger becasue of this book!If you are searching for a devotional for a married couple that gets right to the heart of a marriage, then this is for you. If, however, you still wish to avoid those difficult conversations, then avoid this book like the plague.

My husband has been faithful in taking the initiative every night (which is a huge blessing to me) to bring out the devotional, and we take turns reading a chapter each night. We actually completed the whole book about a month ago, but we missed it so much we recently started from the beginning again! Going through it a 2nd time is surprisingly refreshing and not stale. Some of the devotionals confirm things we are doing and make us feel good about being on the right track for us, and others challenge us to do things we hadn't considered or hadn't taken the time to do before. There are a few that either don't apply to us or we don't necessarily agree with, but they still spark good conversation and bring us closer. We've done a few other couples devotionals, we teach marriage and pre-marital classes, and my husband is a marriage and family therapist, and we believe this is the best couples devotional we've ever been exposed to."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"As a minister and counselor, I give this devotional to all couples that I do premarital counseling with as a wedding gift and to all couples I counsel as a tool to get them praying together.

My wife and I have gone through it three times together and have loved it each time."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"My husband was leery at first about reading this type of book together. While we were faithful churchgoers I thought our faith life needed a boost and this seemed like a good way to start. The devotionals touch on just about every aspect of married life and they focus on situations from a man's perspective as well as a woman's. Morley doesn't preach or condescend. The devotionals are easy to read and my husband and I have definitely come back to things we've read about when we've had arguments. Doing this certainly does not solve all of our problems in one evening, but it definitely allows us to ask each other questions and explore our differences and opinions in a safe, loving way. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"It was hard for me to choose which books would be best for my husband and I, but this is by far the best book I bought. There are so many good points about what a couple experiences within a marriage, and there are even discussions about parenting. The questions require us to think about our responses, and how we can improve our marriage by applying these Christian strategies in our lives. There are great Christian applications for our marriage, and the prayers in the book are relevant. The only negative comment I have is that there are not dates for each devotional, but I found the information in the book so inspiring that I read several pages at one time. I would highly recommend this book for my friends. In fact, I plan on buying this book for my family! Love it."},{"Title":"Devotions for Couples- Man in the Mirror Edition: For Busy Couples Who Want More Intimacy in Their Relationships","review":"We were given this book by our church for Valentine's day. It took until early September to finish it. We are empty nesters, so we were able to do a chapter after dinner most days.

Some words and slang you may not use in a hospital may not be listed.

The Complete Idiot's Guide to Hebrew Scripture is also helpful because the topics are well organized and clearly stated. In addition, the book provides interesting commentaries that help enhance the subject matter (bring the history alive).

Other reviews made it sound like the ideal cookbook. I'm no expert in the kitchen (far from it) and couldn't find any recipes in this book that sounded easy or like anything my children would eat. There was even a recipe for mayonaise which made me wonder why anyone would make their own. This might be a great cookbook for those with time and the desire to create gormet meals, but it's not very useful for the remedial cook like me and it made me even less likely to ever take the food processor out of the box.

I enjoy cooking for my family, but I am more apt to use recipes with ingredients I will use for other recipes. In addition, a lot of the recipes are very complex, which is okay, but cooking doesn't have to be complex to be either gourmet, or tastey. There are a couple of recipes I will try: Mushroom caviar, Oh-my-God Cheesecake and Stuffed Artichokes. Other recipes I will probably never do are: Sweet Potato Soup w/ coconut milk, lemongrass &amp; cilantro, Terrine of Pork &amp; Ham w/ Calvados &amp; Juniper Berries, Leek &amp; Sweet Red Pepper flan, Chicken Liver &amp; Red Onion Jam.

But if you're looking to surprise your guests and yourself, from the back porch party to a funky soir&eacute;e, this book will do it. It's not a mammoth like the Joy of Cooking is or other &quot;anthology&quot; type collections. Process This! is more of an art show, the few carefully chosen pieces displayed for effect. In other words, don't expect the plethora of basic things. These are highly polished, wonderfully eclectic (from French countryside to American south), thoughtfully researched interpretations of beloved foods. A lot of the recipes are quite old but modernized for the our kitchens.In some way, the book is technical: it presumes that cooks follow its logic on ways of measurement, treatment of ingredients, etc. The introduction is devoted exclusively to technique. But the basic premise is intuitive and accessible to even the most basic of cooks. And while there are no pictures, a staple in American cook book publishing nowadays, Process This! provides foolproof guidance with many tips and personal commentaries. As a result, there is a sort of respectful intimacy that arises. I know I can always count on it to plan my party menu. I also know that it's not for everyday use. There is something romantic about its collection that just begs a special show off occasion. Except for deserts.

With company coming for Thanksgiving, I decided to try a new vegetable dish and chose Red Cabbage Braised the Bavarian Way. By following Jean's excellent directions and tips, I did it! and it was a big hit with my guests!

It gives advice on how to prep and process various items."},{"Title":"Process This! : New Recipes for the New Generation of Food Processors plus Dozens of Time-Saving Tips","review":"Jean Anderson is a member of \`old school' cookbook authors and culinary educators such as Barbara Kafka, Marion Cunningham, Sheila Lukins, and Sara Moulton many of whom are prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of James Beard or Julia Child. Among them, Anderson and Cunningham have been responsible for editing two of the better \`how to do everything' cookbooks in America. These are the \`American Century Cookbook' and the \`Fanny Farmer Cookbook' respectively. Except for Moulton, who is a staple of the Food Network programming, these authors typically do not get as much attention as their more internationally oriented colleagues such as Patricia Wells and Paula Wolfert; TV educators such as Ina Garten, Rachael Ray, and Nigella Lawson; or magazine magnate Martha Stewart.In spite of this, these authors are probably the ones who write some of the most commonly picked titles among non-foodies who never watch the Food Network and simply want a reliable source of menus.On the face of it, this book, \`Process This!' is very similar to Barbara Kafka's highly rated \`Microwave Gourmet' to which I gave five stars. Both books are about new kitchen appliances that became popular in the early nineteen-seventies and both of which tend to be misused, overused, or underused.I am probably like many people who use both appliances for a relatively small range of tasks and wonder why they persist in taking up so much space on my countertop. I do, however, sense some differences in the two appliances. The biggest I believe is the fact that while the microwave is at its best doing small, quick jobs which often arise in small households or households with lots of different schedules, the food processor is best when it is used to tackle a big job.The reasons for this are simple. A microwave can make popcorn, heat up a cup of coffee, cook bacon, and defrost frozen food quickly, with less electricity than a range or oven, and require little or no cleanup when you are done. And, there are few alternatives to doing these tasks as quickly or as easily. A standard size food processor can mix a pie dough, dice onions, finely chop zest, mix a mayonnaise, shred cabbage for slaw, chop garlic, and slice carrots or a hundred other vegetables in a thrice. But, after each operation, a rather sizable cleanup job is left and with most slicing and dicing, the results leave a fair amount of unevenly sized pieces. And, there are good alternatives to doing each and every one of these tasks, generally with less mess. A pastry cutter will do pie dough very nicely. A sharp chef's knife will give you evenly sized chopped onions very quickly with no slime, a microplane will give fine zest in a thrice, a blender will do an equally good job with Mayonnaises, a knife will do garlic much better than a standard food processor, and a knife can do veggies to a much greater range of sizes and much tighter consistency than can a food processor.The things for which I always go to a food processor are when I wish to shred large vegetables such as cabbage to make slaw and when I wish to powder or crumb a large portion of hard, dry material, as when I want to make bread crumbs. I have gone to a fair amount of trouble to cultivate pretty good knife skills and to buy very sharp knives. I also need to cook for only two people. Therefore, my bias tends against using the large task food processor. This is not to say this tool has no good user base. It is probably at its best in preparing vegetables for salads when the vegetables are not to be cooked, but eaten raw. It is also excellent for shredding hard, awkwardly shaped vegetables such as carrots for a cooked carrot filling, not to mention an ingredient for carrot cake. Lastly, it will very commonly do an acceptable job subbing for a blender if you do not have one. Just don't try crushing ice with it!So how does this book help this audience? First, I thing the introductory material on general suggestions on food processor use is very good. But, I think it would have been a lot better with a few pictures. It is not entirely obvious how the chopping blade compared to the slicing blade. The dictionary of foods and how to process them was quite good, if only to show what foods and results it is wise to prepare with some other tool. The author very wisely advises against using the processor to shred meat or to grind spices. I was also happy to see that the author did not paint a rosy picture of your making peanut butter with a food processor.My first sense that there was something amiss in the book is when I saw the recipes for stock making. The instructions for the meat and the cooking times were all kosher, but I believe the instructions for chopping the vegetables is all wrong. For years, until I started making stocks for myself, I never understood why recipe writers of every stripe tell you to simply toss the peeled vegetables into the stockpot with no more than a quick cut in half, if that. Well, they were right. Simmer whole carrots and onions and celery for four hours and there will simply be no flavor left behind, and there will be no unnecessary cloudiness in your stock from vigorously chopped veg flesh.My reaction to most other recipes is that I already have an ample number of recipes for all these dishes. Why do I need another that uses a tool I would not normally use?This book will be helpful if you make three or four meals a week for four or more people, and, you already have a full size (11 cup bowl) food processor. Otherwise, you may find it gathering dust on your shelf."},{"Title":"Process This! : New Recipes for the New Generation of Food Processors plus Dozens of Time-Saving Tips","review":"I got this book to supplement the skimpy cook book that came with my ll cup KitchenAid food processor (which I LOVE). The book is written in a chatty rather than business only format--OK if you aren't in a hurry. Anderson's tips and techniques are very helpful for a new food processor user. Most of the recipes themselves aren't practical for families with small chilren (lots of onion, garlic, peppers, sophisticated flavors); for people on a budget; or for those who need to watch calories or fat--unless you know how to make substitutions for butter, egg yolks, heavy cream. The recipes are more appropriate for gourmet cooks or special occasions. I used the beef, chicken, and vegetabe stock recipes; the Potage Crecy (French Carrot Soup); and Cornell Bread.

It can be turned into a bread machine, an ice cream maker, a blender, even an electric mixer, meaning that it's a multi-purpose machine that can do the work of four or five different kitchen appliances. And as such, it deserves the 8 to 10 inches of counter space it occupies. I spent many months turning recipes upside-down and inside-out developing quick and easy processor techniques so that you can now make feathery butter cakes, flaky pastries, crunchy cookies (including chocolate chip), nut-studded quick breads, and chewy European-style yeast breads entirely by food processor. You might call this one-bowl mixing at its best. In addition, the processor is a whiz at making salsas, all manner of mayonnaises and sauces not to mention a huge repertoire of party dips, dunks, and spreads. Best of all, it buzzes up FAT-FREE ice creams in two minutes flat! Whenever I give a program in a bookstore or kitchen shop, I always bring samples for people to taste-- Lemon Chess Tarts, for example, Toasted Hazelnut Tarts, Lemon-Poppy Seed Cupcakes, Blonde Gingerbread with Fresh Blueberries, Two-Pepper Parmesan Wafers, Chicken Liver and Red Onion Jam Pate, Guacamole, Tapenade, and they all just fly off the plate. My favorite demo recipe is the Soft Raspberry-LimeIce Cream, which invariably blows people away.

Her first processor book, Jean Anderson\`s Processor Cooking, was published in 1979, and a slightly revised editon in 1983.This is even better than those two good books.Some material, particularly in the very useful front section, where she talks about foods and how the processor affects them, and how many slices, or how many cups you may get from an item has been retained, but there are enough new and wonderful recipes to make purchasing this book a good decision.I like her comments, and her notes on a recipe\`s background.The recipes may seem to run long, but they are easy and complete. If something is supposed to happen, she says it will. There are NO traps in a Jean Anderson recipe. The only surprise is in how delicious the food is. By that, I mean, no matter how good you think a Jean Anderson dish will taste, it always tastes better! Another reviewer commented about garlic and seasonings. Well, garlic can always be reduced, and so can seasonings in cooking. Unlike baking, which is more like easy science, seasoning in cooking is flexible. However, DO try these dishes the way Ms. Anderson writes them.Someone, perhaps the same reviewer, said that most of the recipes were too adventurous. The world is shrinking! An easy way to begin to understand another country, another people is to explore their foods and foodways. A friend with school aged children has used some recipes in this (and other Jean Anderson books) to enrich her children's experiences--there are dishes in \\"Process This\\" from Europe, South America, and Asia...In closing, this is another excellent book by one of our best cookbook writers."},{"Title":"Process This! : New Recipes for the New Generation of Food Processors plus Dozens of Time-Saving Tips","review":"The food processor is back...and Jean Anderson's cookbook tells us why and how.

Let me start with the pros. The book is directed to those with new model processors that allow more precise chopping, can handle heavier loads and often have multiple bowls and accessories. That expands the capability of a processor and allows it to handle more of each job. For example, I use my processor as a mixer for cake batters as well as the more expected functions. This book takes the modern capabilities into account and includes many more recipes than are usually found in such a book.The introduction describes the history of food processors, which I found quite interesting. That is followed by a couple of pages of instructions on how to use the book. This was a red flag to me, which I'll describe below with the cons.There is also a dictionary of commonly processed foods at the beginning with info about prep, techniques and tips, followed by a description of what food processors don't do well and then a table of equivalents which some might find helpful. There are over a hundred recipes divided into sections, which include Basic Recipes, Starters and Snacks, Main Dishes, Sides and Salads, Breads and lastly Desserts, then a good index. Each section begins with some interesting information about how a food processor is useful for the recipes in that section and some of the included tips are quite helpful. One that really struck me wasn't even food processor related but solved a problem I've been having with my bread not rising as well as it used to--I've been adding too much salt. Who knew? I was impressed with all this extra info.But. . . while I found this cookbook interesting reading, I probably won't use it much for cooking. First of all, I found the directions too verbose and fussy to suit me. The whole point of having a food processor is to speed up various kitchen tasks, but following the directions for these recipes would slow me down to where I got little advantage from using the machine. It was interesting to read the extra info while sitting on the couch, but not while standing in the kitchen actually doing the work. Under those conditions, I want clear, brief instructions, not a lot of text to wade through. I'm not saying some of the text isn't useful, but the narrative style made it hard for me to pick out the critical points quickly.I love my food processor and use it a lot, but don't expect it to do everything. Some functions are better done another way depending on the result I want. For example, I far prefer the neat regular dice I get from my Alligator Dicer when making a vegetable soup. Likewise, when I'm making a small quantity of salad dressing or mayonnaise, my stick blender does a great job quickly and efficiently, and if I'm only slicing enough cucumbers for a salad for one or two, I'll use my handheld Adjustable Mircoplane slicer. As a result, all the recipes for those sorts of things in this book weren't useful to me, since each goes into significant detail about the food processor use for each step, the prep, the blade or disk, the run time, etc--all info that would just slow me down if I was using a different tool.The steps about using a food processor at the beginning of the book alerted me that perhaps this wasn't the right book for me. I'm a reasonably experienced cook, so when I'm told right off the bat not to substitute ingredients or pan type, and to always use freshly ground black pepper and freshly squeezed juice among other things, I immediately start asking questions. Would the recipe really fail if I didn't have fresh oranges on hand in mid-summer (when they are not in season) and is Penzey's Ground Black Pepper really not good enough? Are those bullet points disclaimers or what? They have nothing to do with the food processor, only with the recipes and I found those overly exacting as it was.Bottom line: I wanted to get more value from my food processor, but not by making a Terrine of Pork and Ham with Calvados and Juniper Berries that has 18 ingredients (barding fat?) and two pages of instructions. It sounded like it would take all day. I have a world-class food processor because I'm always in a hurry, so the recipes with extended prep didn't resonate with me any more than the simple ones, e.g., I don't use a food processor to make chicken stock.For a less experienced cook, however, or one who doesn't have other kitchen tools for various tasks and expects to use their new food processor for practically everything--or simply for someone who wants to feel like the chef is right there with them every step of the way, this book might suit them well, particularly if they're interested in tackling some unusual dishes as there are many. Some may really like the writing style too, but I found the amount of detail too tedious."},{"Title":"Process This! : New Recipes for the New Generation of Food Processors plus Dozens of Time-Saving Tips","review":"what a great book, everything i needed to know about food processing, but didn't know to ask. a &quot;must&quot; for the kitchen."},{"Title":"Guide to Operating Systems, Second Edition","review":"Save yourself $... and read the operations manual that came with your PC.

Because of its size and its economic imoprtance, it has the power to influence strongly many of its South American neighbours. The fact is that Cardoso is the man responsible for the consolidation of democracy and democratic institutions in BRazil. A sociologist, university professor, because of many interesting twists and turns, he became the president of Brazil during 8 years. In this period he not only stabilised Brazil from an economic perspective (before Cardoso inflation reached 80% a month) but also from an institutional point of view. He was able to catalize an important group of political forces in the country, under a modern social democratic ideological frame and to rebuild BRazil after 20+ years of military dictatorship and a series of weird presidents that were elected after the end of this period. He diminished the role of the state in Brazlian economy, opening space for the free enterprise, and through a clear pro-business approach broughtcompetitiveness for Brazilian economy, that was casted in decades of protectionism. He is a role modern, a president that is very rare to find in a region like Latin America; a sophisticated intellectual with strong democratic values. His life should be studied by everyone interested in this region from a geopolitical point of view."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"First the disclosure. I am a longtime admirer of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Brian Winter is a former student of mine. Neither consideration, however, accounts for my high regard for this engaging and informative book. For this is a book that not only recounts the memoirs of one of the greatest Latin American leaders of recent times but also serves as an excellent introduction to over a century of Brazilian history.Grandson and son of military men, Cardoso grew up on politics. Yet, he chose to become a university professor whose groundbreaking research on race and poverty brought him international prominence as a sociologist. Exiled by the military governments that took power in 1964, Cardoso eventually returned to Brazil. He gradually, or \\"accidentally\\" as he says, became enmeshed in politics. After the country returned to democracy, he accepted several cabinet posts and decisively affected Brazilian history as finance minister in the early 1990s by heading the team that created the \\"Plano Real.\\" Brilliantly conceived, the Plano Real gave Brazil a solid and predictable currency for the first time since the 1940s and helped catapult Cardoso to the presidency in 1994. Walking a fine line between liberal reforms and an abiding concern for the economic injustice that has besieged Brazil since colonial times, Cardoso brought enlightened reforms to virtually every area of Brazilian public life, leaving a legacy of improved education, better health care, and significant improvements in infrastructure. Perhaps his most lasting accomplishment, however, was giving strength and permanence to institutional government in Brazil as symbolized by the exemplary transition of power from Cardoso to Lula in a country that for decades had reeled between chaos and autocracy.The book also tells a great deal about global politics and Brazil's increasing importance in the world order-including trenchant comments about world leaders like Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Cardoso, however, never ceases being an intellectual. Indeed, a particularly appealing aspect of the book is his mix of intelligence with compassion, analytical distance with hands-on experience. According to reports in Brazil, Brian Winters was chosen to assist in this project not only because of his accomplishments as a Reuters reporter in both Argentina and Mexico, but also because of his ability to ask Cardoso the right questions and thereby ensure that the book speak to US readers. This collaboration produced an excellent book, especially for American readers. I recommend it to you as I will surely recommend it to my students and colleagues.Nicolas Shumway, DirectorTeresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American StudiesUnivesity of Texas at Austin"},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise, well written, rich and amazingly fantastic!

Considered one of the 100 greatest living intellectuals, Mr. Cardoso is a well-known academic who has lectured at some of the world's foremost academic institutions. He seamlessly and entertainingly weaves in the history of Brazil through stories from his own life and that of his family. The creator of the real (Brazilian currency) and the man widely credited for Brazil's economic turnaround and growing prosperity, he is truly an authority on the subject of his country. Also telling is the fact that the foreword was penned by none other than former American President Bill Clinton.I can't recommend this book enough.

This book gives a glimpse of the history of this large nation, and also a personal insight into the author's thinking.I say that he is a little self serving because he demeans both his predesscor and his successor. He also had bad things to say about Emperor Dom Pedro II, who was mainly overthrown because of his decree ending slavery. Since Cardoso's grandfather was one of those who overthrew him, he just says that they overthrew the Emperor because of his lack of skill in old age.This is a good book to read on Brazil.

In President Cordoso's case, he was a intellect, scholar from a powerful family.despite coming from a powerful family, the President is an extremely humble person as one can read throughout the book. due to this, i developed a tremendous respect for the President. i also admired the President for admitting that Brasil has big racial problem and that while Brasil presents itself to the world as a \\"white' country, in reality, it is more a \\"black\\" country (as 45% of Brasilians are of african descent). this is great honesty. my disappointment is, the President only achieved half of the success he set for himself in addressing racial inequality during his 8-year tenure. by the President's own admission, even the prestigeous USP refused to establish an affirmative action program to accept African Brasilian students. finally, i also like the easy going presentation of the President who discussed contemporary brasilian history in the most story telling way. as a non brasilian who did not know anything about brasil's history, the President's descriptive of Brasil's transformation from a colony to Republic is distinctively clear, easy to understand and most of all, extremely interesting. this is the best highlight of this book.now the lowlight. the President did not discuss much about the Cold War. he downplayed Ronald Reagan's Evil Empire and Freedom principle. in fact, the President never mentioned Reagan's contribution to the Cold War but attributed the downfall of the Soviet Empire as if this was a chinese Yin/Yan turning of the tide during a mystical cycle. the President has his own ideology ground to cover, i can appreciate that but also disagree with him. however, the great disappointment to me was the President did not discuss some critical element about the military era of Brasil. we know he went into exile and his family suffered, he also lost some of his best friends as the military regime created disappearance of these folks. however, the President never wrote about the big elephant in the room, i.e. who were the military elements? names of the players? what did the military do to brasil (other than imprisoning or murdering the intellectual class and other opposition elements, putting brasil out of democracy). i am interested to know the President's personal view of those military Generals? he did expressed his view (disapproval) of US under Nixon's support of the military regime. OK, so Nixon as in US, but who are these military, who is xyz to the military regime? where are they now? what are they doing now? on behalf of the nation, the President apologized and paid indemnity to the victims but were the culprits brought to justice or were they applied the \\"forgivenss brasilian style\\"? we don't know after reading this book. does the President still consider them a threat to Brasil's democracy? the book never addressed this. this is the most disappointing part of the book. finally, the book gave me a distinctive impression that in Brasil, the common folks are DOWN THERE and the intellectuals are UP THERE, playing the role of the savior attemtping to save those DOWN THERE. may be this style works in Brasil to attract the vote. i remember my mid level brasilian colleague who told me he has fresh OJ squeezed for him every morning by his maid..... the UP THERE/DOWN THERE thing?so, all in all. a very interesting book although i wish the book can go a little furthermore."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Cardoso tells the story of his rise to power in a very humorous manner and fills the gaps with Brazilian political history. Cardoso comes off as a very likable man and treats opponents with a fair hand. Cardoso was obviously the right man at the right time for Brazil. He beat Lula twice and Brazilians can be happy for that. Cardoso introduced the real, redistributed farm lands to poor families, brought free HIV medicine to Brazil, fought against corruption, and privatized the phone company - allowing hundred of thousands of Brazilians to get connected. By the time Lula was finally elected, he had no choice but to accept Cardoso's policies because they work for Brazil. Cardoso brought Brazil into the modern age.

As a true sign of modesty, his work is constantly footnoted with what he seems to claim are better biographies of him at certain points in his life and political career. This is a great book for anyone who would like an amazingly smooth memoir by one of the most modest people to ever write about himself (I am sure Saint Augustine has him beat with the self-deprecation)."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"The review title says it all. Fernando Henrique Cardoso was the best president of Brazil bay far."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"In planning a trip to Brazil, I was looking for a readable history of Brazil's past 100 years to give me an understanding of the nation, its history, and its challenges. Fernando Henrique Cardoso's book appeared to be a perfect choice: it combines history, and social and economic analysis with a personal biography of one of Brazil's finest presidents.Like most autobiographies, The Accidental President of Brazil is not an objective work. Cardoso does defend his policies and programs, especially his work in developing Brazil's modern currency--the Real. Cardoso, to his credit, did prove to be an effective inflation fighter who instilled some discipline into the samba economy of Brazil. He also strengthened the country as a democracy and won kudos from foreign leaders, the IMF, and the World Bank.However, Brazil's problems are far from over. Parts of its major cities--the notorious favelas--are ungovernable, and are giving the country a terrible reputation abroad. Poverty and unemployment, which go hand in hand with urban slums, also plague the country. Cardoso draws an interesting analogy between the favelas and the Bronx and Harlem, New York, in the 1970s. Harlem, he argues, looked ungovernable in 1975, but now it is a center of urban renewal and culture. President Clinton even has an office there. In short, if we take a long term view of the favela problem, he explains, positive change is a true possibility. After all, property within a stone's throw of Copacabana beach cannot be slum for ever.The inevitability of progress sounds like the positivist philosophy of Brazil's founders, and in fact, Mr. Cardoso's grandfather was one of a group of military officers who overthrew Emperor Dom Pedro II and founded the modern state. Cardoso, though, is far too complex to fall into a positivist trap. As an academic, he's often more concerned about explaining Brazil's problems and possibilities than establishing his place in history with a laudatory biography. He employs self-deprecating humor throughout the book and is as quick to point out his failures as his successes. The more I read the book, the more I came to admire the man. I also now know much more about the world fifth largest country, and the biggest economy in Latin America than I did before reading the book. Will Brazil be the next India? Read this book and judge for yourself. Do Brazil!"},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"This memoir of former Brazilian President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, reeks of legacy-cementing, but is nonetheless an interesting and brief fly-by of Brazilian history and the country's emergence onto the global economic and political stage.The book, translated with the help of Brian Winter, is quite skinny on details. Only 280 pages, the book deals little with the realities that Cardoso inevitably faced in his stint as the leader of modern democracy: legislative battles, ideological compromises, political in-fighting, administrative setbacks.In Cardoso's recount of his Presidency, we are not afforded a look into the former President's heart as he waged these political battles. We are made unaware of any ideological compromises he may have had to make. We are only encouraged to believe that \\"if nothing else, Brazil's stability is an overwhelming sign that the ideas of [Cardoso's] government should endure.\\" This may indeed be true, but it would be nice if the reader were allowed to draw this conclusion on their own based upon a fair presentation of the facts, rather than having Cardoso tell us this much.If you are looking for a detailed play-by-play of Cardoso's eight years in power, this book will prove disappointing (you will have to look to Cardoso's more extensive memoir written in Portuguese for that). Much more of the book is focused on the \\"Accidental\\" rather than the \\"President\\" part of the book's title.Cardoso provides a hearty background and detail of his family history, and how he went from child in a privileged Brazilian family to a Sociology Professor at the University of Sao Paulo to ultimately the President of Brazil. Cardoso ultimately reduces his rise to power to little more than \\"luck and circumstance\\".Cardoso takes great pains to frame himself as a wonkish Sociology professor, in love with policy and indifferent to power, who happens to rise through the political ranks (after a period of exile) in a happenstance way.Although, what also becomes clear in Cardoso's memoir is his gentile nature, administrative acumen, and his genuine desire to make Brazil a better and more prosperous country. TheThe Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoirgives the impression that Cardoso's desire to cement the legacy of his presidency is less for personal reasons, and more to legitimize Brazil as a stable and worthy country- one whose presidents write memoirs and build Presidential Libraries, and one that will ultimately gain admittance into the G7.Cardoso also provides some interesting insights into his impressions of United States political leaders, as well as of others around the world. Of Clinton (who wrote the preface of this book), Cardoso writes, \\"His eye for detail, his passion for policy, and his extraordinary personal skills, made Clinton, without a doubt, the most impressive all-around politician I have ever seen.\\"Of Bush, Cardoso recounts how Bush asked Cardoso, \\"Do you have blacks in Brazil?\\" (Brazil has one of the world's largest population of blacks). Cardoso also portrays Bush as a leader who, during his administration, was obsessed- rightly or wrongly- with only his own nation's response to the attacks of September 11th, and who reduced the diplomatic demands of Latin America to only a question of energy. \\"All he wanted to discuss was energy in Venezuela, and especially who was friends with the Venezuelan government and who was not.\\"This stark contrast between Cardoso's impressions of Clinton and Bush present an important truth about United States-Latin American diplomatic relations: Latin America, and particularly Brazil, is interested, as is any nation, of achieving an equal footing in international and diplomatic talks with the United States and other world powers.Any leader of the United States who makes Brazil feel as if they are merely a pawn, or place of untapped economic resources to be utilized, is likely to estrange a country- that if it can maintain stable leadership (like that of Cardoso's administration)- will only rise to evermore prominence on the world stage."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"This entertaining and insightful memoir brings together the best of Cardoso's insights as sociologist, politician, president and elder statesman. It is must reading for everyone interested in Brazil's past or concerned about its future.Fernando Henrique Cardoso began his career as a struggling Marxist sociologist ruminating on stuffy topics such as \\"the objective possibility of the negation of the situation.\\" After two terms as President of Brazil, he understandably finds academic sociology dull and dogmatic. With a little help from journalist Brian Winter, he has written a fascinating book about his own experiences with the people who run Brazil. He is uniquely qualified because he has known most of the personalities who have shaped Brazil's destiny for half a century, and even longer if we include those he met around the dinner table as a child.See my full review on www.infobrazil.com"},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"This is an intriguing and informative political memoir, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in recent Brazilian history and politics. First of all, let me share the observation that there really don't seem to be many good books on contemporary Brazil. I am a non-specialist when it comes to Brazil and so I've been searching for some journalistic accounts, travelogues, etc. I was kind of led to this book because it was about the only thing I could find on recent Brazilian politics, but it ended up being a very rewarding read.There are two primary reasons that Mr. Cardoso's memoir succeeds so well. First, the subject matter, modern Brazilian political history, is intrinsically interesting. Second, and most importantly, however, Mr. Cardoso is a truly engaging and oftentimes humorous writer. This is somewhat of a surprise given his academic background. Mr. Cardoso was a fairly successful sociologist before entering politics, and I half expected that dry academic language to show up now and then in his memoirs, but that is certainly not the case. In fact, Cardoso has a very good sense of humor regarding his academic disposition, and how it has both helped and hindered him in political life.One point that might be of relevance to those considering whether to read this book: you might be somewhat disappointed if you are only interested in very recent Brazilian history. Practically the first two-thirds of the book detail Mr. Cardoso's life BEFORE he assumed the presidency. Cardoso brings a very interesting perspective to Brazil's turbulent political history, as he was born into a very powerful military family. His grandfather was a leader of the revolt that brought down the monarchy, while his father was an influential figure under the Vargas regime. Cardoso expertly explains the various elite conflicts that kept Brazil in a state of perpetual political instability for much of the 20th century. As a result of a military coup after WWII, Cardoso was forced into exile, as were many other intellectuals. He spent some of this time in Chile, and one episode recalls a party he attended at Pablo Neruda's house, where he met not only the host but future Chilean president Salvador Allende. He was eventually allowed to return, but his dissatisfaction with the military regime that refused to relinquish control induced him to enter the political fray as an opposition figure.Roughly the last third of the book covers Cardoso's time as president. Cardoso here describes the challenges he faced reforming Brazil's inflation-addled economy (and protecting Brazil from the global financial crises of the late 1990's), fighting corruption, and fixing some of the country's endemic social problems. The latter include the HIV crisis, in which one can reasonably say that Cardoso's administration was successful, and agrarian reform, a problem which still persists to this day. There are also several sections in which he details his troubled and fluctuating relationship with Lula, Brazil's current president. Finally, some of the more interesting episodes recounted in the book are Cardoso's encounters with and impressions of various other world leaders. He had a very close relationship with President Clinton (who, incidentally, writes the preface to this book), and while his praise for the ex-American leader is undoubted sincere, it might to some seem a bit excessive. His impression of George W. Bush is evidently less favorable, and Cardoso even recounts one conversation in which our president asked in surprise, \\"Do you have blacks down there in Brazil, too?\\"In sum, pick this book up if you are interested in Brazil, Latin American politics, or political memoirs more generally."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"Fernando Henrique Cardoso was Brazil's penultimate President. Brazil is the 2nd largest country in the Western Hemisphere, one of the world's 10 largest economies, a major exporter, and yet, as Cardoso rightly points out, many Americans, Europeans, and other foreigners associate Brazil with little more than, \\"soccer, carneval, and the girl from Ipanema.\\" Additionally, there are still associations of Brazil as a \\"banana republic\\" and with the military dictatorship. Cardoso shows very personal sides of Brazilian history, from his ancestors' role in the founding of the modern Republic of Brazil, to his career as an academic, his exile, his persecution under the military dictatorship, to politics, to the Presidency. He gives us many \\"behind the scenes\\" views of his life as a politician and President in Brazil. His views on the economy and foreign relations are very pragmatic and seem rational. Overall, very well-written and I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to better understand this important country, as well as to those already interested in Brazilian/Latin-American studies."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"This excellent book is part personal history, part history of Brazil. As the Financial Times blurb on the paperback cover says, \\"It reads like a thriller.\\"President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's life intersects with the major personalities and events of the country over almost a half a century. He and co-writer Brian Winter cover those with great skill. Kudos to the two of them for not turning in a typical ex-presidential 900-page bloated opus (I'm looking at you, Big Dog). This book clocks in at less than 300 pages...each one compelling. These two know how to tell a story.There's a reason FHC is ranked as his country's top president ever by his countrymen. His inclusive, consultative style, together with his decisiveness and communication skills gave Brazil its first great leader. I'll give credit to Lula for not messing up what FHC started, but it was President Cardoso who kick-started Brazil's transition from \\"the country of the future\\" (a future always just a little out of its grasp) to the powerhouse of today.If you like this book, I strongly recommendA Death in Brazil: A Book of Omissionsby the incomparable Peter Robb. FHC touches lightly in his book on the scandal-plagued Fernando Color de Mello administration. Robb does an impressive deep-dive into that period. It's fantastic in every way."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"Hello Amazon.com customers,If you've been trying to understand Brazil, read this book. Fernando Henrique was THE BEST president Brazil ever had. His accomplishments as president is a landmark in Brazil's development. I can say that I thought I knew History of Brazil but after reading this book I tell you that I didn't.Wonderful book to everyone. It makes a Great Gift (I got this one to my father-in-law and he loved) and it is for sure an item in everybody's personal library. BTW, Fernando Henrique personal library has 15,000 books. The guy really likes to read.Best to all."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"Cardoso rightly calls this book a memoir rather than an autobiography because it emphasizes only the author's political career. But Cardoso's political remembrance also serves as a fine introduction to the history of Brazil, stretching back through his privileged family to the nineteenth century. Although obviously intended for the educated North American reader, the work wisely assumes little specific knowledge of a country as large as the United States but one still struggling to outgrow its top-to-bottom heritage of economic and political irresponsibility.Cardoso remains a left-of-center sociologist--one has the feeling that his earlier radicalism has been softened in the telling--but his current political stance is \\"Clintonesque\\" and pragmatic. (Cardoso's personal admiration for Bill Clinton is open and fervent, and Clinton contributed the preface.)The book's idiomatic English makes the book eminently readable, and credit for this readability should be given to Cardoso's co-author, the young journalist Brian Winter. Indeed, Winter presumably wrote the first draft of the book after interviewing Cardoso and reading the Portuguese manuscript history of his presidency, thus leaving Cardoso (as the former president modestly admits in the acknowledgments) more of an editor than an author.Though all political memoirs tend to be studies in reputation burnishing, one leaves the book with a sense that Cardoso was truly a self-effacing public servant, regardless of what one thinks of the specific political and economic policies he promoted while in office."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"In The Accidental President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso provides an entertaining look at his unusual career, from his privileged childhood by the beach in Rio, to his sociology research in the shantytowns, to his exile during the military dictatorship, to his entry into politics and taming of Brazil's runaway inflation. An engaging and personable narrator, Cardoso provides fascinating contextual details of Brazilian history as well as the colorful personalities who have shaped it, like Emperor Dom Pedro II, Getulio Vargas, Janio Quadros, and Lula Da Silva. Throughout the book, Cardoso's love for his country and commitment to the poor are apparent, as is his conviction that sensible leaders, guided by good will and tempered by serious policy debate, actually can solve large problems in large countries."},{"Title":"The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir","review":"I picked up this book to begin a lesson in the history of Brazil, of which my boyfriend is a citizen. This is by far the best history book I have ever read. Fernando Henrique does a wonderful job of telling the story of his country intertwined with the story of his family, giving the reader a better understanding of his unique perspective of his country. It is informative and entertaining at the same time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Rancher and the Redhead (Back to the Ranch) (Harlequin Romance, No 3280)","review":"Zachery Quinn Nevada's hottest bachelor who is burned by love before falls in love with Alex a red head who he thinks is trying to run a scam through his nephew.

The author seemed to make a point that Dr. Frieda was not the saint she apeared to be in the famous book from Greenburg. In every sentence, it was reaking with some pessimistic streak, even in the depictions of the many photos I found fascinated by. I love Greenburg's book dearly, and to just know such a person as Dr. Fried existed was enough to give light to this world. I think the author of this book should have mentioned more of the fact that Friada did accomplish an enourmous amount... It was awful how the author refrained Frieda's untimely death over and over and over again, as if her life had a sad fate, despite all that she strived for. Even her work with the real Johanna Greenburg is underminded, immediately followed by a whole chapter about a patient she was unsuccessful to reach out.Not recommended, although it is the only existing book I know about her, and I rushed to the library to get it as soon as I knew it was out. Too bad."},{"Title":"Tarnsman of Gor: Volume 1 in the Chronicles of Counter-Earth","review":"John Norman's Gor series was recommended to me by someone for its sexuality. It has female slaves. Great! Who could ask for more?I'd like a female slave myself. One who didn't argue and was sexy as can be and always did everything you want. Hey, check out the John Norman series of books about Gor.This is book 1 in the series. It introduces Tarl Cabot, the red haired guy on the cover. It also introduces his transportation, that bird that is behind him on the cover. Vicious giant hawklike thing.There are also a few pretty girls in the book. I love how submissive they sometimes get. One of them reminds me a lot of the Italian movie Swept Away. She is so bossy at first, unbelievably bossy, just like the female lead in Swept Away, but she doesn't stay that way.This is an adventure story, not an X rated story. Lots of fighting and danger and so on. I read most of the book in one day, sitting at a racetrack watching my wife and her girlfriend win race after race, after I gave up on the whole damn thing because I kept losing. I stopped betting and just read this book at the track, sunny day with a nice breeze, it was a fun afternoon."},{"Title":"Tarnsman of Gor: Volume 1 in the Chronicles of Counter-Earth","review":"Tarnsman of GorAs a stand alone novel in the genre of Lost Land Adventures this book was a \\"just fair\\" read. As a multi volume series it's an example of how modest popularity breeds mediocrity.Let me just say that \\"Gor\\" is just an awful name although it does not take up much room on the book cover and it is easy to spell.Gor, we are informed, is the counter Earth - on the other side of the sun - therefore we never see it or for that matter know it exist - a blessing perhaps. Gor is a land of medieval feudalism except for two things - Tarns - large half wild birds that, if willing, will support a rider and a hidden religious sect that exerts enormous control over Gor's society. One area where the Priesthood power has a direct effect over the warriors of Gor [of which, it seems, most men are on this planet] is their restriction of certain technology that would result in the development superior weapons. So what you say...well read the book.My opinion was that the story was dull and the characters duller. I was also put off by the similarity with other, better books, dealing with the same subject matter. I am not inclined to read any other books in the series. I seems that by the number of volumes published my opinions are in the minority."},{"Title":"Tarnsman of Gor: Volume 1 in the Chronicles of Counter-Earth","review":"Tarzan this is not. Tarzan spoke multiple languages, and was a very Victorian kind of fellow. There was never anything improper about his conduct. This is the world of teenage male fantasy, a world where they have power, and can follow their hormones, you might say. I read this in high school. I think a movie was actually made of this. I did go on to research the history of cultures, to find out what Norman used in his pastiche, and the book is useful for that. Parents who want to keep their teenaged boys sheltered may not like this book. I have a cousin who kept his sons sheltered, even home schooled them. One of them went into the Army last year. I suspect he is in an unpleasant situation, which his life experience did not prepare him for. High school is painful for teenaged boys, escapist stuff like this is one way to escape the pain, without using addictive substances. The Dept of Justice estimates that 80% of American high school students regularly use drugs, alcohol, or both. My daughter agreed with this, for her high school. Now that is just not healthy. If you need addictions, the printed word at least doesn't cause physical damage. One outgrows this sort of thing, eventually. One moves to books likeThe Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy;The Way of Energy: Mastering the Chinese Art of Internal Strength with Chi Kung Exercise (A Gaia Original),Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),Redneck Shaman,The Tracker, andUltimate Guide to Wilderness Living: Surviving with Nothing But Your Bare Hands and What You Find in the Woods. Still, books like this made high school bearable. The basic story is our hero goes to a counter-earth, which has a culture any high school male would enjoy. It is swords, action, women, rather better than the Forgotten Worlds series my nephew enjoys, to my mind."},{"Title":"Engineering the World: Stories from the First 75 Years of Texas Instruments","review":"This handsome volume, lavishly illustrated with photos from Texas Instruments archives, is the culmination of a TI-history project that proceeded spasmodically over many years and which reportedly produced an earlier manuscript that was vetoed by the company's then president. What has finally come forth as \\"Engineering the World\\" will surely grace the public spaces of all TI facilities, providing visitors waiting to see TI engineers or interview for jobs an excellent overview of the company's considerable innovations and achievements during its first 75 years (e.g., the transistor radio and the integrated circuit). But the book is not a definitive examination of the interpersonal dynamics among the extremely bright, ambitious, and hardworking men involved. A chronicle such as Gay Talese's saga of the evolution of the New York Times (\\"The Kingdom and the Power,\\" London, Calder & Boyars, 1971) was not the model for this endeavor. And at this point, with TI's founders and many principal participants gone, such a work is probably not possible. Since, as far as I know, none of those folks was inclined to publish a memoir elaborating on his part in the company's creation and evolution, I assume that journals or diaries may not be available.For more detailed TI nuts and bolts, you might enjoy the story of Cecil Green, a founder of TI and its parent company, Geophysical Service Inc (\\"Cecil and Ida Green: philanthropists extraordinary,\\" by Robert Shrock, MIT Press, c1989), or the humorous memoir of 37 years at TI by engineer/inventor Ed Millis (\\"TI, the Transistor, and Me, \\" Dallas, Ed Millis Books, 2000).

Christopher Hitchens called Lucky Jim theFunniest Book of the Twentieth Century. Maybe not, but what beats it?"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis' first novel is arguably his best and probably his funniest. While Lucky Jim is an amusing send-up of academia, it is also a wicked examination of sexual dynamics as they were evolving in the post-war world of the early 1950s. Amis generates laughs by dishing out example after example of the perennial inability of men to understand women. He is particularly adept at exposing the transparent shallowness of men -- but the likable man who is the novel's protagonist is never a total cad, and Amis pokes fun at men with such good humor that male readers can recognize a bit of themselves in his characters and laugh. (Female readers, I assume, will nod their heads knowingly.)James Dixon is in his first (and possibly last) year of employment as a lecturer in the history department of a provincial college. Despite his position, Dixon is disinclined to do any work that might be considered academic. As he avoids preparing the \\"special subject\\" he is supposed to teach in his second year, his only concern is the number of pretty girls who will sign up for the class. Whether Dixon will be invited to return for his second probationary year depends upon his ability to keep Professor Ned Welch happy. Welch is the prototypical absent-minded professor, a model of the pretentious and dull academic, the kind of scholar to whom Dixon is incapable of sucking up, no matter how hard he tries.Dixon begins the novel in a spotty relationship with Margaret Peel, a lecturer who is taking a paid leave after her unsuccessful suicide attempt (triggered by the news that, in her words, Catchpole was leaving her for his \\"popsy\\"). Despite Margaret's prim and earnest nature (quite the opposite of Dixon's), Dixon enjoys spending time with her as long as \\"the emotional business of the evening\\" can be \\"transacted without involving him directly.\\" More to Dixon's liking is Christine Callaghan, the current girlfriend of Welch's son Bertrand, an untalented painter. But Bertrand is also having a go with Carol Goldsmith (behind the back of Carol's husband Cecil, another history department colleague of Dixon's). Bertrand is interested in Christine largely because Christine's uncle is Julius Gore-Urquhart, a wealthy arts patron who is searching for a private secretary, a position Bertrand covets.Invited to spend a weekend with the Welches, Dixon makes a mess of it in an impressive variety of ways. He does the same at a dance and, finally, at a public lecture he has been invited to give on a subject (\\"Merrie England\\") dear to Welch's heart. Dixon spends the most of the novel mildly misbehaving while trying to sort out the relationships between the various characters as well as his own (mostly superficial) feelings about them. Should he stay with Margaret? Should he try to win Christine's affections? Should he punch Bertrand in the ear?Amis was a master of understated humor enlivened by slapstick moments. He packed more wit into a single sentence that most comedy writers manage in entire chapters. Take this description of an incipient fistfight between Dixon and Bertram: \\"They faced each other on the floral rug, feet apart and elbows crooked in uncertain attitudes, as if about to begin some ritual of which neither had learnt the clues.\\" Of course, the brief fight causes more damage to a china figurine than to either of the combatants. Among the many jokes Amis tells in Lucky Jim, my favorite is the formula for love: ignorance of the other person plus unsatisfied sexual desire equals love.As obnoxious as Dixon can be -- he schemes and manipulates, he drinks too much, he hides the evidence when he burns his host's blanket, he's lazy, he hates everything -- Amis manages the astonishing trick of making the reader identify with him and root for his success. Unlike Welch and Bertram and many of the novel's other characters, Dixon is genuine. He isn't a snob, he's incapable of disguising his faults, and he's cheerily self-deprecating.The New York Review of Books edition of Lucky Jim includes an entertaining and informative introduction penned by Keith Gessen, notable for its frequent quotations from correspondence between Amis and Philip Larkin. It's interesting to note the parallels in experiences and attitudes between the lives of Amis and Larkin and the fictional life of Jim Dixon. The introduction also provides context to the novel in its discussion of post-war England."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"When I last read this novel in the 1960's I found it absolutely hilarious. This time, 50 years later, I merely found it sad and at times rather cruel. However, Kingsley Amis is a talented writer and cannot be ignored simply for being out of date in a social sense. I don't know if there are still such sad people involved in the academic world where Jim tries to make \\"a go of it\\". We must assume there are simply because the job description of an academic at that time, and maybe today as well, was to interest the young in things which hardly ever satisfied their creative inclinations! Jim is indeed lucky to find alternatives but, unlike my reading in the 1960's where I cheered him on, these days I cannot help feeling that he deserved none of it!"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis's \\"Lucky Jim\\" is a marvelously readable and hilarious book. It is my first Amis and I highly recommend it. It is very modern in feel, though written in the mid-1950's, and its humor, perhaps I should say humour, is priceless and ageless."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This book received rave reviews from every source I consulted before deciding to read it. I was enjoying earlier English fiction and had just finished good bits of Wodehouse, Benson and Mitford. So I was expecting to like this every bit as much. First, and I usually love British humor, I did not think it was the funniest book I'd ever read as it was touted to be. Jim's lecture speech which he performs drunk is not as half as funny as Gussie Finknottle's in Wodehouse's \\"Jeeves & Wooster\\" series. Second, the romance aspect I could have done without entirely. It seemed to interfere with the comedic thrust.What does work is his farce of a college life with the professor in charge of him a real idiot of the first water. Perhaps in the 1950s you could only meet Professor Welch and his artist son Bertrand in England but personally I feel as if I've met their American counterparts many times. The way Jim has to do daily jousting with his fellow lecturers, his students, Welch and others is very good. Even his relations with his students are on the edge.However, I think on the whole that this book is a bit dated if you read it for the first time in 2010."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I enjoyed this immensely. Lucky Jim and his manipulations just made me laugh. While it is an old story, it feels timely. ANd I am trying to decide whether I like Kingsley or Martin the most. So far, I like the son better. But this is an enjoyable, not terribly demanding read."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"this one. This type of humor doesn't tickle my funny rib. And as for his making faces.....I just got a little annoyed at Dixon whenever he turned to this coping mechanism. He did grow on me by the end of the story.

Required reading for anyone struggling with an academic career. Whenever a friend or family member hits grad school I mail a copy to get them through it with the note, \\"It could be worse.

All in control of his destiny in one way or another. If you can read it without laughing aloud you're dead inside."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This is an excellent dramatic comedy--one of the top 100 novels of all time.

Very smart, but I just didn't feel the connection with the story personally."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This book brings to mind the joke about academics being so cut-throat because the stakes are so low. Anyone who has viewed the unsavory and mediocre underbelly of an institution of higher learning will appreciate Dixon's inability either to succeed or to care. Plus, a strangely uplifting ending. Go figure."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This is without doubt the funniest book written in the English language. You would expect a book written in 1954 by an author who became known as one of the &quot;Angry Young Men&quot; rebelling against the establishment to have dated badly by 1999. As a comedy of manners and social mores it shows its age, but as an example of exactly how to make English usage and style funny it still has no peers anywhere. Biting, savage wit. Read this, and then read Tom Sharpe's best (&quot;Riotous Assembly&quot; for instance) to see where Amis' influence is felt. He succeeds where Wodehouse and Waugh either failed or didn't attempt. YOUR BOOKSHELF ISN'T COMPLETE WITHOUT IT."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"While Martin Amis is indulging in egomania, he must know in his heart of hearts, his talent (even though it is formidable) will ever come close to his father's (Kingsley Amis) as is displayed in Kingsley's LUCKY JIM. LUCKY JIM is light and humorous, but has profundity in it, too, and is a brilliant novel. The language is poetic and highly literary, but at the service of the story. A lot of &quot;literary&quot; writing buries the story, (Well, like in Martin Amis's stuff, for instance), but LUCKY JIM has wonderfully poetic sentences, that, even if you did not notice their poetry, serve a reader who would only need the sentences for their furthering of the narrative. There is not a single word wrong in this novel. It's perfect down to the last syllable. And I know I'll read it again sometime, and parts of it numerous times. It's not called a &quot;classic&quot; for nothing."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Lucky Jim is an outstanding academic novel, which I have read several times since it appeared and copies of which I have often given as a present to friends.David Lodge, who wrote the Preface for the Penguin edition now being sold by Amazon, is equally a great writer of academic farces (e.g., \\"Changing Places\\", \\"Small World\\").However, Lodge's Preface is entirely out of place in this edition of Lucky Jim. Admittedly. it is an insightful, but nonetheless academic piece of writing, by a former professor of English literature. For another, I believe it has, in whole or part previously appeared elsewhere in a collection of Lodge's essays (of which no mention is made; if I happen to come across it, I'write another blurb about Penguin's deceit in the matter). Third, and most important, it gives away one of the key points upon which the plot hinges, one that in the book only comes to a head close to the end and suddently makes things fall into place. The editor who thought the book could be enhanced by joining Lodge's name with Amis', failed to realize the Preface sabotages the development of Amis' narrative.It is further evidence for my suspicion that all decent editors were taken out some years ago and secretly shot. The alternate possibility is that Penguin wanted to add Lodge's name (now better know than Amis')on the cover as a cheap gimmick for advertising purposes.It would be a much better idea to buy a second-hand copy (thousands are floating around) than to put out good money for this edition."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"You will be hooting with laughter, disturbing your seatmates, and causing consternation among the flight attendants. This book is amazingly funny. But you will need some working knowledge of British academia to 'get it'. Which means, if you know the difference between a 'grammar school' and a 'comprehensive', you can feel sort of snobby while you chortle hysterically. Plus, if you like the work of Martin Amis (Kingsley's son, for those of you who don't know your 'grammars' from 'comps'), you can now have one of those real 'aha' moments: as in 'I see! THIS is where he gets it!'."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Those who come to LUCKY JIM by Kingsley Amis usually do so because thay have heard that it is a funny book. And so it is. But when one finishes and tries to analyze the source of the humor, one finds, somewhat surprisingly, that the hero Jim Dixon, drifts in and out of situations that construct backgrounds that are patently phony, mostly to the reader and only partly to Dixon himself. It is his reaction to all this encrusted phoniness that serves as the ideology that led to the existence of the Angry Young Men dogma that was then afflicting a post-war England. For Amis, humor was the means by which this frustration at not being able to do anything about it caused him and his readers to laugh at a society whose only saving grace was that what you saw was definitely not what you got.Jim Dixon is a young college instructor, trying hard to fit in when he quickly realizes that he should not fit in but plows ahead anyway. Since he is non-tenured, his continuing employment depends on the good will of his department chair, Professor Welch, a man who argues that life ought to be unhampered by the restraints of a confining culture, but whose deeds shout out the contrary. Dixon is dating a younger colleague, Margaret Peel, a rather plain-jane type who inexplicably sees in Dixon the salvation to her own need to have free love without the responsibility to maintain it. At a party, he meets Welch's equally pontificating son, Bertrand and his date Christine, to whom Dixon is attracted. The humor of the novel resides in some slapstick scenes, a leading example of which occurs when Dixon falls asleep while smoking with predictable results--he very nearly burns down the guest room of the Welches in which he was staying.Amis hints early on that his true reason to write LUCKY JIM was his dissatisfaction with the compacency that he saw as ossifying England. He deduced that far too much of England was an empty facade full of empty people performing empty functions. Jim Dixon himself lectures on topics of which he is ignorant but hopes that no one can see his lack. Professor Welch is much like himself, only on a higher level of incompetence. Both Dixon and Welch are involved in an equally spurious revival of folk art. When at the novel's end and Dixon is seen as \\"lucky\\" in the sense that he has a new job and a new girlfriend, the reader is puzzled what Dixon has done to deserve his luck. And that is the point. He has done nothing to be lucky, but he has had the sense to avoid the excesses that afflict the Welches. Jim Dixon is simply not ossified enough to avoid his luck. For him, coming in third in a four man race is good enough to win the top prize. For Amis, that was not good enough. LUCKY JIM tells the world that."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Jim Dixon is a man painfully aware of his loathesome existence which he in turn sparks up with booze and constant inappropriate wisecracks. He is best when he gives way to his impulses- saying aloud the insults that his innermind is shouting to another, drinking far too much before giving a speech in front of a jam-packed lecture hall where his job rests on the outcome, and being unable to stop making phoney phonecalls to his boss' wife and 'braying' artist son. He finishes writing his speech and then hops around like an ape only to be observed on the bed by his enemy. He is constantly at war with one of his housemates and plays childish pranks to get his goat. Though the setting is post-WWII British University, the character has much in common with Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm. He's the part of us that never stops being a class clown. He is a 'bore monitor' like a canary in a cage who suggests he be hired to go in and assess the bore level of every party or gathering. He is constantly falsifying his abilities and interests and inevitably getting called to task in humiliating but hilarious scenes. While it takes a chapter or so to get into, the book quickly becomes contemporary- he takes rolling of the eyes to a new level. I loved it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"A pleasant and refreshing read. Sir Kingsley's mastery over the English language combined with a hilarious 'common man' story makes LUCKY JIM undoubtedly one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. Follow the misadventures of Jim Dixon, the novice college professor who can't seem to find happiness or luck anywhere, until his life turns around for the better, ironically because of his own irreverance and ineptitude at the climax of this outrageously funny novel.

Set in the 1950's, Jim proves that today's young professionals are not the first to be &quot;slackers&quot;.

It's rare for me to find humor in drunkenness, but Lucky Jim is so lucky you have the feeling he will probably stop drinking one day."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Jim Dixon, the \\"hero\\" of this novel, is a young man with some serious problems. He teaches a subject he doesn't much care about at a second-tier British university; nevertheless, he doesn't know what else to do and he is constantly afraid of being found unworthy and losing his position. He is romantically involved with an unattractive colleague against his will, held by pity and a sense of duty. He despises the pretentiousness of his Head of Department but must hide it at all costs. He has fallen for the girlfriend of the Head's equally pretentious son and that will never do, of course. He has been scheduled to give a general lecture on \\"Merrie England\\" and has no original ideas on the subject whatsoever.What's a young man to do? Jim responds to his problems by playing practical jokes, making outrageous faces when he thinks no one is looking, and drinking too much at just the wrong times. Sounds like a recipe for disaster, but, in the end, he turns out to be \\"lucky Jim\\" after all.This is a very, very funny book, in a very British way. Some of the humor is pure laugh-out-loud slapstick in the Monty Python vein. Some is more subtle, through understatement and unexpected observations. I think it would be even more humorous to people familiar with the English class system, which this novel seems to be lampooning. It reminds me very much of some of the British comedies I watch on PBS.Lucky Jim is included on the Time's Top 100 Best Novels list."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This is a well set up situation comedy, almost as if Jane Austen and Monty Python had a child, I hope to see the BBC movie made for it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This is an old favorite, reread for at least the 4 th time, and still leaves me laughing aloud.

I did not laugh out loud while reading this book but it made my mind very light. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing style, the plot, characters...everything was very well neat together."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"The 1950s saw the birth of a new genre in English literature, the campus novel. There had been earlier novels about university life, but these generally concentrated on the students more than the lecturers, and often, as in Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", the hero's university career only formed part of the book, being dealt with as a part of his overall life story. C. P. Snow's \\"The Masters\\" from 1951, set in a fictitious Cambridge college and dealing with the lives of the college's academic staff, is sometimes regarded as the first British \\"campus novel\\" and \\"Lucky Jim\\" from three years later as the second.Jim Dixon is a junior lecturer at an unnamed provincial university, possibly based upon the University of Leicester where Kingsley Amis's close friend Philip Larkin had once worked. (The hero's surname may have been suggested by the fact that Larkin's address in Leicester was in Dixon Drive). Amis took his title from an old song- \\"Oh, lucky Jim, How I envy him...\\"- but as the novel opens Jim does not seem to be particularly lucky or enviable. Indeed, his life can be summed up in the words of the theme-song from \\"Friends\\":-\\"Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.\\"He hates his job, his subject (mediaeval history) and his boss, Professor Welch. He is perpetually short of cash and forced to live in a seedy lodging-house. His relationship with his girlfriend Margaret appears to be going nowhere and, while he has set his cap at an attractive blonde named Christine, that relationship also appears to be doomed as she is the girlfriend of Welch's artist son Bertrand.Jim is in many ways a flawed character. For one who hops to make a living by teaching history, he displays a surprising lack of enthusiasm for his subject. He drinks too much, often treats Margaret badly and can be rude and tactless. He devotes a lot of energy to pursuing feuds against those who annoy him and can be oddly childish, as when he scribbles on a magazine belonging to a colleague. And yet he is the novel's hero. Although this is a third-person narrative, everything is seen through Jim's eyes and Amis clearly intended us to sympathise with him. Remarkably, Amis largely succeeds in this aim.One could say that Jim is lucky in his enemies. If he is flawed, those surrounding him are often much more deeply so. Welch is absent-minded, evasive, pedantic and a pretentious culture-vulture who finds it difficult to get on with people. Margaret is neurotic, hysterical and manipulative. Evan Johns (he of the defaced magazine) is treacherous and back-stabbing. Worst of all is Bertrand, portrayed as dishonest, pompous, self-important, snobbish, a bully and a womaniser who cheats on Christine with a married woman. Bertrand's ideological attitudes are an odd combination, probably very rare in real life, of the values of the Bloomsbury Group with those of the Monday Club, but Amis was using him to satirise an omnium gatherum of opinions, including pacifism, artistic bohemianism and right-wing Toryism, which he regarded as objectionable or ridiculous. (At the time of writing \\"Lucky Jim\\", Amis was still politically on the left, although in later years he would move to the right).Amis was often grouped with the likes of John Osborne, John Braine and Alan Sillitoe as an \\"Angry Young Man\\", one of a group of young writers who emerged in the 1950s. Although the \\"Angries\\" never identified themselves as a movement, and certainly never had anything like a formal membership or a manifesto, they did share certain characteristics, notably a dissatisfaction with the existing social order, particularly the class structure of fifties Britain. Their heroes were often rebellious young working-class men, and this is true of \\"Lucky Jim\\". Jim is from a working-class background in Northern England, something which sets him apart from the more bourgeois Welch family and may explain their mutual antipathy.Some one of the \\"Angry Young Men\\" railed against virtually all aspects of their society, but from Amis's point of view the early fifties were not such a bad period in which to be alive- certainly not when compared to earlier periods in history. One of the targets of his satire is the tendency to retreat into nostalgia for some idealised past, something of which Professor Welch, with his romantic fantasies of some pre-modern pre-industrial England, is particularly guilty. He pushes Jim, much against his wishes, into giving a public lecture on the subject of \\"Merrie England\\" and is not amused when Jim, under the influence of alcohol, uses the opportunity to subvert everything Welch believes in. Amis was himself a university lecturer (teaching English at the University of Swansea) and another of his target is the academic life itself. To an outsider, universities and colleges may seem like tranquil seats of learning, but Amis, shows them to be as riven with feuds and jealousies as any other institution and suffused with a hypocrisy and pretentiousness which Jim instinctively finds unacceptable. (These themes were to be taken up by later campus novelists, such as Malcolm Bradbury in \\"The History Man\\").Some of the criticisms of the novel expressed on these pages seem rather wide of the mark, such as the allegation that it is too socially narrow in its scope. It was never Amis's intention to imitate the likes of Dickens or George Eliot by writing a sweeping \\"condition of England\\" novel taking in all social classes. One might expect the characters in a novel set on a university campus to be drawn from a fairly narrow social range, although as I point out above the politics of social class do play a part in \\"Lucky Jim\\".Amis has also been criticised for a \\"lack of ambition\\", for failing to tackle all the great questions of the Meaning of Life. This criticism ignores the fact that one can illuminate the human condition just as effectively though the medium of a comic novel set in an English provincial university as through a grand panoramic novel about life, the Universe and everything. And \\"Lucky Jim\\" is a brilliantly comic novel with some wonderfully humorous passages. I particularly enjoyed Amis's satirical barbs aimed at some of his characters, especially the insufferable Bertrand, and the accounts of Jim's drunken lecture and of Professor Welch disastrous musical weekend, in the course of which Jim manages to set fire to his bed. It well deserves the reputation it has won as one the best English comic novels of the 20th century. Although it was Amis's first novel, and although he was to write many others over the next forty years, it probably remains his best-known work."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This isn't exactly the book that I thought that it would be, which may be a result of the time between when it was first published in the early 1950s and when I read it. When I hear the words \\"campus novel genre,\\" I think academic politics, the intertwining personal lives of wry, well-educated professors, and perhaps some insight into them as people - usually with a good dash of humor thrown in for good measure. \\"Lucky Jim\\" has many of these elements, but there's much more of \\"sordid private life\\" angle here than I was expecting. While in high school, I read a few of the English literary critic and author David Lodge's novels, which could also appropriately be called campus novels (\\"Small World,\\" \\"Nice Work,\\" and \\"Thinks...\\"), and they managed to contain more of a balance of the above elements. Maybe it's because my first experience with the campus novel was with Lodge's work that I compare all subsequent ones to his, which I found to be truly wonderful. Even though Lodge doesn't seem to have garnered much appreciation in the United States, I would recommend him to anyone interested in this type of fiction.Jim, who isn't really all that lucky for much of the novel, is a lecturer in medieval history trying desperately to be taken on permanently; because of this, he feels the need to impress and comply with the wants and needs of Professor Welch, the head of the history department. Jim has started seeing Margaret, still another member of the history department, who has recently tried to take her own life after a failed relationship. Welch, on the other hand, is a tremendously affected, pedantic boor who throws parties where he inflicts attendees with musical ensembles and readings from plays. On the first of these excursions, Jim meets Welch's son Bertrand, an equally bloated artist manqu&eacute; and his girlfriend Christie. Christine's uncle, however, is an influential Maecenas through him he seems himself furthering his own career.In addition to being a terrific drunk, the private lives of many of these people are in utter shambles. This may be some more of the intended social-political commentary that Amis was aiming at (see below). Margaret is a neurotic, Christine is seeing Bertrand but begins to see Jim while he's still seeing Margaret, and Bertrand begins to see one of his father's colleagues while he's still seeing Christine. More of the novel than I would have liked consisted of Jim trying to decide between the merits of Margaret and Christine. Only at the end of the novel does Jim really become \\"Lucky Jim,\\" getting the girl, a job (though not the one he was anticipating at the university), and moving to London. I'll leave the details for the \\"lucky reader.\\"This was written before Kingsley Amis became more conservative in his politics, and therefore has a lot of tension between Jim, who comes from what Americans would call a working-class background and the Welches and their friends, who are solid Tories. Amis goes to tremendous lengths to show the shallowness, fascination with wealth, and political reactionism that permeates the Welches' world. Only a family like this could have two sons, one (Bertrand) a painter, and the other who is several times throughout the novel described as \\"effeminate.\\" As I like to say, you get the children that you deserve.I'm glad that I finally read this, since its reputation does precede it. The humor, such as it is, often consists of jabs at class structure in England sixty years ago, which is at several removes from what most contemporary Americans are going to associate with \\"being funny.\\" I found myself wishing that the characters were more likeable (as much as that word sends me into fits of bruxism, especially when applied to literary characters) and that their private lives less resembled the private lives of their teenaged students. It wouldn't make my top one hundred list of novels of the twentieth century, though it seems to have made many others. And I can't deny it its few moments that are laugh-out-loud funny."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Hilarious. An almost meaningless word redeemed... every character still so easy to imagine . After all these years K Amis's gem remains a writer's benchmark for humour with style."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"In the introduction to the Penguin edition of Kingsley Amis's 1954 novel \\"Lucky Jim,\\" David Lodge puts forth several possible influences Amis relied upon when writing the novel. Probably the most significant theory advanced by Lodge is that Amis wrote his book with one eye on Graham Greene's novel, \\"The Heart of the Matter.\\" Lodge convincingly argues that \\"Lucky Jim\\" is actually a comic inversion of Greene's story. Of course, if one has not read Greene's novel, this point may not register on the radar. But what is important is that Lodge proves to us that \\"Lucky Jim\\" is much more than a collection of funny scenes. Most will read this book because they have heard that it is uproariously funny, which it certainly is, as the book does contain enough humor to cheer up the most heartless people among us. However, don't get hung up on the humor and forget to look deeper.\\"Lucky Jim\\" is set in the seemingly unfunny world of academia, specifically British academia. The hero of the story, James \\"Jim\\" Dixon, is a young man on the make, fresh out of school and dutifully working at his first real job; a position in the history department at an obscure provincial university. Jim really hates his job. This hatred stems from the cast of assorted characters Jim must put up with on a daily basis. Jim's biggest problem is Professor Welch, the head of the history department. Welch is a forgetful fool who holds Jim's future job in the palm of his hand. Then there is Margaret, a neurotic fellow lecturer who latches on to Jim and won't let him go. Welch's son Bertrand, an arrogant \\"artist\\" who torments Jim while flaunting his girlfriend Christine (who Jim quickly becomes enraptured with, creating a tension that leads to several hilarious confrontations between the Welch family and Jim) also makes an appearance. Rounding out the cast of quirky characters is an annoying student who knows more about medieval history than Jim.Of course, Jim causes problems for himself with frightening regularity. He sets his bed on fire during a weekend retreat at the Welch's, delivers a lecture on \\"Merrie England\\" after imbibing way too much alcohol, and makes phony phone calls to the Welch house in an attempt to discredit Bertrand. The humor is classic British wit: slow and masterfully written in the way only the British can achieve. Jim's description of a hangover will bring a knowing chuckle from anyone who has ever downed too many at the bar. These scenes are extremely funny and help to drive the book to its happy conclusion.Amis spends an enormous amount of time poking fun at the British upper class. Welch and his family are endlessly skewered as Jim constantly shows them up. That Jim ultimately conquers his enemies must be Amis's way of showing the ultimate triumph of the \\"commoner\\" over the entrenched British aristocracy. This tension reached an acme after World War II, when the British educational system expanded its programs to include the British lower classes (it is no mistake that Jim mentions his stint as a lowly soldier in the R.A.F. during the war, thus qualifying him as a sort of everyman hero).What didn't work as well in \\"Lucky Jim\\" is the interaction between Jim and Christine. These encounters tend to be wordy and too steeped in emotional minutiae. Even some of the dialogue between Jim and Margaret ends up becoming rather tedious compared to the rest of the book. This is probably due to the comedic scenes in the book; they are so funny that everything else pales by comparison. But the dialogues do serve an important purpose in the story: they reveal the concerns of people trying to make their way in a world that places them at the bottom of the ladder.\\"Lucky Jim\\" would make an excellent gift for anyone who needs a good cheering up. It also might help someone who is nervous about speaking in public for the first time (the embarrassment Jim suffers because of his drunken speech will show anyone that their attempt at oration cannot possibly approach the disastrous level Jim reaches). Any people submerged in the agonies of their pre-tenure years should also read this book. \\"Lucky Jim\\" is funny, eloquent, insightful, and should be read in conjunction with Jerome K. Jerome's \\"Three Men in a Boat\\" for the ultimate experience in British humor."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Obviously it's unanimous here...this is one of the most hilarious, moving, irreverent and wise books ever. Jim Dixon is a joy. I named my son after him in hopes that he would embody some of his kindly, mischievous, unpretentious &amp; good-humored qualities.Amis' writing is so fine, so perfectly crafted. It's an effortless read, but has so many layers of wisdom to it. I became a big fan after reading &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; and have since read and enjoyed many of his other books, but this remains far and away the all-time favorite. Sadly, his first book is also the last one to have an upbeat, humane, let-the-good-guy-win mindset.Funniest description of a hangover I've ever read at the beginning of Chapter 6...An unending pleasure of a book."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"When it was first published in 1954, it turned the author, Kingsley Amis (the father of Martin, also a fine author), into a celebrated writer and a spokesman for his generation, a position that he didn't seem to want or care about. The novel was &quot;Lucky Jim,&quot; and it tells the story of a young academic, Jim Dixon, at work in one of England's provincial universities. The book is hilarious, from the first page (where Jim describes the physical sensation of hangover) to the last, when he leaves the shady groves of academia for a job with better pay in London. Along the way, Jim learns a lot about academic life--he hates recorder concerts, musical evenings, and academic pretentions--and he learns a lot of girls; his main preoccupation.I keep thinking this book is ripe for a movie version, with someone like Daniel Day-Lewis as the title character; it was made into a film in the 1950s, but I've never seen it and the reviews are not great. The book remains a delight to read, however, and, like all good satires, has some serious points to make, about things that Amis detected, like pretentiousness. &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is also noteworthy because it launched Amis's career, and he wrote novels, short stories, poems, and journalism for the rest of his life, which ended just last year. He's a very different writer from his son Martin (rumor has it he didn't like Martin's work all that much), but they both share a real gift for comic writing. It is a work that achieves that rare combination of being interesting in a literary sense, but also humorous and a real pleasure to read. I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Though the sexual mores of Kingsley Amis's 1950's feels decidely quaint,Lucky Jim does not seem dated. The book is a riotous comedy that is satire at its greatest. Evelyn Waugh's reputation soars above that of Kinglsey Amis, but in most of Waugh's satires, like most satire in general, we care little about the characters. We care about Jim Dixon--Amis's greatest creation. Amis never wrote a better book than this, his first; he grew increasingly bitter and, while the later books are often more complex, none bring the pure satisfaction of this perfect gem."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis is one of my favorite writers, and Lucky Jim (1954) of course is probably his most famous novel. It's also his first novel, which makes him one of those writers who spent their entire career trying to live up to early success. Despite Lucky Jim's preeminent reputation, several later novels are at least as good: I'd mention as my personal favorites The Anti-Death League, The Green Man, Ending Up, The Alteration, and The Old Devils.I think this is my third reading of Lucky Jim. It remains a very enjoyable book. It's the story of Jim Dixon, a history lecturer at a provincial English university shortly after the second world war. Jim is involved in an unsatisfactory relationship with a drippy fellow lecturer called Margaret Peel, who uses emotional blackmail such as implicit suicide attempts (she took sleeping pills after breaking with her previous boyfriend) to keep him on the string. He hates his job, and he hates his boss (Professor Welch) if anything even more, while worrying that he won't be retained for the next school year. He hates phoniness in general, particularly that represented by Professor Welch, who is into recreations of old English music (recorders and all).The plot revolves mainly around Dixon's growing attraction to Christine Callaghan, a beautiful girl who is nominally Professor Welch's son Bertrand's girlfriend -- but Bertrand is also fooling around with a married woman, and he's a crummy artist to boot. Also, Dixon is working on a lecture about Merrie Olde Englande, which he hopes will impress Professor Welch enough that he can keep his job, but every sentence of which he hates. The resolution is predictable, if rather convenient for Dixon (involving a rich uncle of Christine's), but it satisfies. The book itself is really very funny: such set-pieces as Dixon's hangover-ridden lecture, and his disastrous drunken night at the Welch's, remain screams after multiple rereadings.I should say that some things bother me a bit. Some of Dixon's stunts (such as stealing a colleague's insurance policies and burning them) seem, well, felonious. And of course Margaret Peel really is someone he's better off breaking up with, but the way Christine is presented as naturally good because she is beautiful does seem rather sexist. Still, all this can be laid to accurate description of a certain character -- and if we root for Jim (as we more or less naturally do), it should be with some uneasiness.All this said, Lucky Jim is deservedly a classic of 20th Century fiction, and an enormously entertaining book. This edition includes an introduction by David Lodge, who is both an first rate writer of comic novels in the same mode as Lucky Jim, and a first rate critic as well."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Some people--a few who have written reviews here--don't seem to find Lucky Jim very funny. It's their loss. The rest of us think this book is hilarious. Read the opening paragraph of chapter 6: if you don't think it's the best description of a hangover, pass this book by. But I think you'll be hooked.And it isn't really a satire: for those of us who teach, it's hard to find one thing that is out of place in Lucky Jim. Senior professors are still, often, bores and pedants; many women professors still like to dress like peasants; and most of us find that our classes attract the Michie's of this world rather than the three pretty girls.It's so funny that it's easy to overlook how well constructed, and how well written, this novel is.The only thing wrong with Lucky Jim is the horrible cover on the most recent Penguin edition. (But horrible covers are themselves a venerable academic tradition.)"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Lucky Jim remains one of the funniest books I have ever read, and Jim Dixon one of the most engaging anti-heroes. Sure, the book is a little dated in terms of the society it satirizes, but so what? Jim is still hilarious, Neddy Welch is still a pompous old fool who gets what he deserves, Margaret is the attention-seeking neurotic we've all met, and Tristram is still odious and still instantly recognizable in any self-consciously &quot;arty&quot; group. I love Jim's story--he is lucky, but he deserves his luck more than most. Amis wrote a very funny book that has held its ground, despite the vast social and economic changes that have taken place since Lucky Jim was written, because he targets human foibles and pretensions that men (and women) will always be prey to."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This early masterpiece of Kingsley Amis inspires such peals of laughter and raves of admiration that it will put you in a good mood for a week after finishing it.Jim Dixon is a World War II vet who has somehow become a medieval history lecturer at a provincial English university. He worries about keeping his job and meanwhile loathes the self-absorbed pedant who will decide whether to keep him or not: \\"No other professor in Great Britain, [Dixon] thought, set such store in being called Professor.\\" With the axe hanging over his head Dixon falls for the girlfriend of his boss's son, Bertrand. A ruthless social-climbing artist, Bertrand is one of the most intolerable snobs I have come across in literature. You will be impressed by Dixon's campaign for the lady Christine-- sometimes carried on as much to prick Bertrand as to win her affection. Dixon is a remarkably funny character, and part of Amis's genius is that we like him far more than we should. He starts off rather childish, spitefully penciling moustache and glasses on a face in someone else's new magazine. As the plot moves along at an increasingly rapid pace, we see the necessary defense mechanisms in his many contorted facial expressions and pseudo-polite manner. So often does fear or calculation lead him to think one thing and say the opposite that the moment when he first does say exactly what he is thinking will move you to stand up and cheer.LUCKY JIM had me putting it down often--not in boredom or disapproval, oh my, no!--I just had to pause time and time again to laugh and recover, to let Amis's brilliance sink in--his deceptively calm tone, his nimble use of the language. Occasionally Amis will turn a giggle-inducing phrase in the style of P.G. Wodehouse, but most of his humor is the unavoidable belly-aching kind. Funnier than and just as sharp as Evelyn Waugh, Amis's influence can be seen--albeit in much wackier fashion--in the 1990s novels of Stephen Fry.Not just a comic novel, this, but a work of true and timeless literary merit. We shouldn't forget that Amis has Dixon wrestle with a few demons that are not put down easily by anyone. But I guarantee it won't be chance that will have you rolling on the floor if you pick up LUCKY JIM."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Without a doubt the funniest book I have ever read. The added bonus: &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; surveys the dread one used to feel when hearing professors prattle on interminably; it gets to the nut of the ire one experiences when being confronted by self-important bores; it crystallizes the sense one has that all the really pretty girls are out of reach, and being snapped up by self-important bores and prattling professors. Though the phrase &quot;life-affirming&quot; is overused, trite and, frankly, almost always misused, in the case of &quot;Lucky Jim,&quot; it is incredibly apt. This is the book I read when I just feel like nothing is working right, and that I'm a total impostor. Sorry to get all &quot;Stuart Smalley,&quot; but there it is: &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is side-splitting and whatever the opposite of &quot;buzzkill&quot; is."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Was there ever a novelist as consistently funny as Kingsley Amis? And was there ever a novel as funny as Lucky Jim? Read this book and you'll know why critic William H. Pritchard named it one of the five funniest books written this century (along with Evelyn Waugh's Decline and Fall and Anthony Powell's From a View to a Death). No one was better than Amis at mercilessly skewering phonies and mocking the affected, and here his targets not only include academics and academic life, but the artistically pretentious, the enforced boredom of dinner parties, &quot;Art with a capital 'A',&quot; any male over the age of thirty with facial hair, the tendency of academic women to dress like peasants, &quot;filthy Mozart,&quot; and--in case he missed anyone--Modernism in general. With targets like these, how could one not enjoy the book"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"There's nothing more to say. It's simply the funniest book ever written in the English language."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Sometimes humor ages. Not this. Lucky Jim is as hysterical as anything currently in print, on film or tv.Please if anybody's ever read a funnier book tell us."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"When I was in high school I was in an advanced literary course that had selected many great books to read in its syllabus. This book was one we did NOT read in class, I picked this up the summer after, and have read it 4 times since. Absolutely delightfull! This book made me an dedicated Kingsley Amis fan."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Some of the reviews below point out how funny this book is. And it is funny. But it is also a tremendously sophisticated novel (in the best sense of that word), and so I hope some readers will not be turned off by the &quot;funny&quot; tag, thinking LUCKY JIM is nothing more than a Dave Barry type of book full of yucks. Yes, it is a funny novel, but it is also a wonderful LITERARY experience as well."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I picked up this book in the library while looking for Martin Amis' most recent book. It was a lucky day for me. I can't remember the last book that made me laugh out loud like this. Or the last time my husband (who reads very few novels) tore through a book I recommended. A book that has lost neither its wit nor its shrewd commentary since its publication 44 years ago."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"As I read about Jim Dixon's quirks and funny points, from his face-making to the elaborate ruse to hide the cigarette-burned bed coverings, Mr. Bean came to mind. When I discovered, after I finished the book, that Lucky Jim was written in the 1950s, I realized that Mr. Bean is not an anomaly in British humor, but an institution. Actually, Lucky Jim is better than any Mr. Bean episode."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"It took me 4 or 5 pages to get into this book. Once that happened I couldn't put it down.

It's sad the time people waste going to the movies or watching television when they could pick up a gem like this and get so much more out of it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Lucky Jim takes an amazingly cynical, yet hilarious view at academic culture! This book shows how funny it can be when people take themselves too seriously. You can't help but laugh out loud while reading it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I bought this book as a nostalgia trip, having read it in my teens almost fifty years ago.It seems very dated now. Junior academics obsessed with sex and beer. Professors supporting their Victorian pretensions on the income of a wife of independent means. An improbable plot seems very puerile.Don't go there unless your nostalgic memories are more accurate than mine."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"LUCKY JIM is generally regarded to be a classic of English 20th-Century humor (the British branch). My recent re-reading of the novel, about 35 years after the first time I read it, confirms that reputation.Not until the end of the novel does the reader understand why the protagonist, Jim Dixon, deserves the tag \\"Lucky Jim.\\" For most of the novel he is a colossally inept and virtually spineless academic wannabe, who lets his life be manipulated and his psyche buffeted about by a gaggle of thoroughly unpleasant people. Near the end of the novel, shortly after the sentence quoted as the title for this review, Jim's fortunes improve immeasurably, not so much because of anything he does or any transformation in his character, but rather due to a couple fortuitous instances of deus ex machina. (LUCKY JIM is a comedy, and thus such improbabilities are acceptable.)In his introduction to this edition, David Lodge states that LUCKY JIM was the first \\"British campus novel,\\" and, indeed, much of it revolves around the shallow pretentiousness of academia. But the real target of Amis's wit -- when it is directed outwards, away from Jim Dixon -- is the British upper-middle-class in all its pomposity and hide-bound conventionality. The funniest passages, however, all deal with Jim Dixon and his foibles and insecurities and, especially, his drinking. (The description of Jim's hangover may be the best, and the funniest, such description I have ever encountered.)More on David Lodge's introduction: It unfortunately is an example of a problem that afflicts many introductions to \\"classic\\" novels. Some of Lodge's introduction, just shy of the first eight pages, would be quite helpful if read before beginning the novel itself. But the rest of this \\"introduction\\" contains much that will spoil the plot, and thus much of the fun, for a first-time reader. (So if you are a first-time reader, be forewarned.) As with so many introductions, it should have been divided in two: a true \\"introduction\\" that helps orient the prospective reader but does not give away too much, reserving commentary on the plot and especially the ending for an \\"afterword\\" at the conclusion of the novel.Whether you are a first-time or a returning reader, you can look forward to a very funny book, despite the fact that the passage of time has, I fear, dimmed its comedic luster a little. To my mind LUCKY JIM does not really qualify as \\"literature\\", but it is a highly entertaining, and literate, comedy."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"kingsley Amis' established himself as a literary celebrity in England with the publication with this short work of comedy, which would continue to occupy a comfortable niche in the academic-farce 'genre' for the duration of the trend. Yet I found Lucky Jim terribly stiff and antiquated; it lacks any of the satirical wit that it must have possessed during time of its publication. We are asked to follow a fairly inept junior professor through a series of contrived situations at a major university amidst a cast of comic-book-esque academic types. I suspect that this brief whimsy will be an object of sociological curiosity rather than a highly regarded work of literature. Kingsley has the ability to reveal the absurdity of a given culture. He does not however, have the ability to make it pulsate with life and mystery the way his son can."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"What to make of 'Lucky Jim' (and its title, whose ironic status is in doubt until the end)? As a frothy, comic satire of post-war British academia, it fares quite well. Amis' depictions of Old Man Welch as a staggering boob and a loathsome bore are spot-on. He gets the details just right here. Same goes for Welch's infuriatingly pretentious family (foppish painter son and overbearing wife). As for the title character, Mr. Dixon's interior dialogues are hilarious, when contrasted with the lines he actually says aloud. He lives quite an entertaining and vitriolic Walter-Mitty-style inner life. Some of the punishments he fantasizes about cooking up for Welch are delightful in their venom.The problem I have with the book is that none of it made a lick of difference. Sure, it is nearly forty years since its first publication, but I just can't help feeling that this terrain has been done with more relevance by someone like Robertson Davies (see his 'Cornish Trilogy'). His pretentious academics actually manage to be fully formed characters, instead of the crudely drawn sketches Amis depicts here.That being said, the prose is magnificent. What else could you expect from an Amis?"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I tried very much to like this book. Despite the winning, you'd think, combination of a delightful setting - stuffy academia, lampooned - and a bumbling, cursed protagonist in Jim Dixon, this is a horrible, disappointing book. True, there are several worthwhile, really very funny bits, though far too few; these are buried in unending, unrewarding, often plainly aggravating prose. Thank heaven for the dialogue's expert rescue of the sluggish pace. I admire what Amis Sr. was after, and did come to care somewhat for certain of his characters. But I just didn't find Dixon sympathetic, despite wanting and expecting to. Writer Kate Christensen filed this title under &quot;Loser Lit&quot;, guaranteed to make you feel better about your own situation, whatever it may be. How surprising, then, that it should wreak havoc with my disposition, leaving me sour from start to finish.Not at all the book I wanted it to be, sadly, and I really was rooting for it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Jim is lucky, primarily because everything comes together so well for him by the end of the book. And that's part of the problem with this classic. There's an unnecessarily implausible happy ending that didn't need to occur. Jim Dixon is the quintessential anti-hero. Gliding through life at the campus, trying to succeed by not truly trying. Skating through life; chasing the beautiful woman, Christine, partially due to the fact that it will annoy Christine's boyfriend, Bertrand; drinking too much at inappropriate occasions; being disrespectful to the department head, Mr. Welch, for no apparent reason other than he is Dixon's superior. All of these ingredients make for a very funny book, but do not reasonably add up to the book's conclusion, which in my mind was the book's only flaw. Amis's writing is terrific, however, allowing the reader to get deeper into the mind of Dixon than most other books' primary characters."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Years ago, when I had the first oportunity to read this book, it seemed to be real fun, while today it is just description of general problems of academic enviroment, it looks that nothing have realy change or will change. The stagnation of academiais a pemanent dilema: today teachings are the absolite truths, defended by the old guards."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"It is perplexing that so many reviewers laud this book for its hilarity, when the farce isn't outrageous and the sarcasm isn't sharp. The thrust of the book--character portraits that paint British instructors as befuddled and dysfunctional--is so dead-on as to be more reporterly and nostalgic than funny.Essentially there are no more than four running gags: a character accidentally burns a hole in a rug, someone continuously avoids writng a lecture, and so on. If you can chew on those jokes for 60 pages each, then you can safely coast along to Lucky Jim's flat ending.Some may argue historical context, but in fact classic humor dosen't devolve completely. For example, the situational humor of Robert Benchley and S.J. Perleman is a little dated, but still worth chuckles. And others have created more successful characters--Amis' predecessors Thurber and E.B.White are two writers who demonstrated through absurd dialog and great plots that an everyman character could make you laugh out loud then and now.I can only speculate that reviewers have extended credit for other much-loved Amis novels while reading and reviewing this one. Taken on its own, there is not much to recommend Lucky Jim.For funnier academic sendups, I like Straight Man by Richard Russo, Wonder Boys by Michael Chabon and Small World by David Lodge."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"A remarkably overrated book. The humor, such as it is, is dated, something that Trollope and Dickens, for ex, escape. Suggest you read David Lodge instead; he really is witty: Small World and Nice Work. Hynes A Lecturer's Tale is also brilliant."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I have not read this book in years.I am going to try and remember what I thought of it when I read it many years ago in college.First, I remember that it was supposed to be tremendously funny.Secondly, I can remember wondering how people could possibly be the way these people were. It just did not make any sense to me.Thirdly, I can remember wondering whether or not I was supposed to like the main character or not.Fourthly, I was a young person in college, who was very serious about learning, and about ' being in college'. The sense the book gives that the whole world of higher learning is ' ridiculous' threatened me. It suggested that what I was doing in being in college was somehow ' meaningless'.What I have written of course is about myself, and not about the book.It is not a review, and certainly not a fair one.But I think it does show something about the way we read books with our own interests, stage of life.

The book was interesting enough for me to buy it from Borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. Even though I didn't laugh, I believed I just had to read it from beginning to end. So I took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. I don't care for all these praises of \\"masterpiece\\" or \\"this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations\\". I want an interesting read; I'm not calling for an action-packed Ian Fleming, James Bond novel, I'm asking for something engrossing. I didn't get what I asked for.The visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. Amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for Bertrand, Christine, and Margaret to some degree); as a result I have no idea what Welch, Dixon, Beesley, etc. look like. They all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all I know.All in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor.P.S.

Whether you snicker, giggle or laugh through your nose, Amis' satiric romp through late 50's British academic life will leave you with a belly ache.This book is as fresh and funny as the day it was written because we are all Jim at one time or another. Stuffed into a box that doesn't fit because we took the easy road and going along to get along until we can escape.He suffers the boss' kid, tedious work, pompous superiors and a flypaper relationship with a slightly crazed female collegue.Sound familiar?So will his small revenges and &quot;lottery&quot; like escape plan.

It was so good that I wish I had saved it an extra year until I was going through the inevitable torment of the job hunt, and the various disgusting tangles academic life involves. I highly recommend this novel for some perspective on ivory tower ambitions and all the failed attempts."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Jim Dixon is in his first year as a college lecturer and he's been in trouble nearly from the second he arrived...unfortunately, since he's also on probation, he's panicking a great deal that he'll lose his job. He despises his boss - an elderly, absent minded and rather self important gentleman called Professor Welch - and doesn't even like his subject, Medieval History. (He only ever studied it himself because he'd seen it as the easy option when he was a student). He's had a few unfortunate encounters with his fellow academics since he started - he'd barely arrived at the college when he accidentally caught the Prof of English with a stone on the knee, and then knocked over the Registrar's Chair at his first Faculty Meeting. (If only the Registrar himself hadn't been on the verge of sitting down...) There had also been the essay submitted by one of Dixon's pupils had submitted an essay heavily criticising a book written by one of Welch's ex-pupils. What made this difficult to sweep under the carpet was the level of Welch's involvement - the book was written at his suggestion and under his guidance - while the essay was based heavily on Dixon's lecture notes.Jim, however, does have a few allies - including Alfred Beesley, (who works in the college's English Department), Bill Atkinson (someone always happy to provide Jim with a cover story) and Carol Goldsmith (the wife of a colleague at the history department). However, Jim spends most of his time with Margaret - another member of staff at the university. It's not that he particularly wants to - rather, he more or less feels morally obliged to. The problem is things have now got to the point where they're widely seen as a couple. Margaret is now \\"recovering well\\" at Welch's house after a recent (apparent) suicide attempt. (Prior to Jim, she'd been spending some time with an utter cad called Catchpole...who, rather understandably, ran off with his new girlfriend to North Wales for a couple of weeks). Jim had been supposed to meet her for a pot of tea that evening , but had backed out to write the following day's lecture...it's something he feels rather guilty about that, bearing in mind what had happened. (This guilt is something Margaret shamelessly trades on throughout the book).Since Margaret is staying at the Prof's house, Jim can't avoid visiting once in a while. One of the most significant - not to mention disastrous - visits is for a weekend long artistic gathering. Jim manages to set fire to his bedclothes, destroy his bedside table, and make an enemy of Bertrand - one of the professor's sons. Bertrand, a pretentious artist with an awful beard and a significant superiority complex, arrives from London for the proceedings with a very pretty guest called Christine Callaghan. Jim naturally is smitten - but is afraid to make any move...partly for fear of what it will do to Margaret, and partly because he knows stealing Betrand's girlfriend will lower his standing in the Professor's eyes even further. Still, at least he's interested in Christine herself...unlike Bertrand, who's only interested in her uncle - the noted art critic, Julius Gore-Urquhart.An amusing and easily read book. Jim proves a likeable character - although the laughter comes mostly at his expense, as he lurches from one disaster to another."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"What a treat to pick up this book whilst I was taking a break from cramming for finals. It totally put my academic career into perspective. The book is witty, charming and chucklesome on almost every page. I could read it again."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I'm so glad I picked this book up. It is delightfully funny in a rather understated way. The characters become real enough to care about during the course of the story. The more improbable the situations, the more believable they are. This is a book you'll want to read again!"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This book was a brilliant satire on so many things. He captured the politics of life in a university, for sure, but there was so much more. The characters were great, and the relationships were really hilarious. I think this was one of the best battle of the sexes yet, because Jim was definitely in battle."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I am 16 years old. I was required to read a book off of a list for my Honors English class. This looked like the best book to read. It has aged a bit, and I found some of the situations difficult to relate to (because I'm 16) but I absolutely loved this book. Make sure you get it!"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This is a first-rate satire written by an Englishman about Englishmen as only an educated, talented Englishman could write one."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Uneven, at times riotously funny, at times bitter and sad, \\"Lucky Jim\\" is nevertheless a rare specimen of a truly hilarious book. The perpetually unfinished sentences of the tweedy professor Welch, the impotent rage of his airy son Bertrand, the ridiculous situations in which Jim keeps finding himself, his arsenal of secret facial expressions that help him deal with vicissitudes of life, the acts of corporal punishment that he fantasized inflicting on the most irritating members of his social circle - all of it is sure to provoke a reader's chuckle (or two or three).By the end of the book, its unrelenting comical bent grows a bit thinner and wears off completely in the parts describing Jim's relationship with Margaret, which are neurotic and tortured.Overall, it is one of those rare books that I will always remember with a smile."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"The protagonist is all us -- anyone, that is, who is somewhat browbeaten by the people in our lives (bosses, girl/boyfriends, etc.). Amis' ear is perfect, the situations are comical yet plausible, the characterizations perfect. I re-read Lucky Jim every couple of years and have foisted it happily on many others, and the book has never failed to win another convert. Absolutely the funniest book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This novel almost cost me my job. Many years ago I taught a seminar in satire, and one of the books on my reading list was \\"Lucky Jim.\\" When a senior faculty member heard about this, he tried to rally others in my department to deny me tenure, proving, of course, that the novel's searing attack on academic snootiness was right on. I got tenure anyway, and the novel still makes me smile."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I think you simply have to be an academic to fully enjoy the comedy of Lucky Jim. Not that the jokes lost any of their flair over last half a century, Jim's misfortunes have a slapstick quality to them which can be funny even in Elizabethan comedies. Their full quality, however, is visible only to people who have had some experience with the world of academy. Yet there is a lot for every reader even living in safety far away from the world lead by the watchword \\"publish or perish\\".I always tell my students who explain to me how good it is to be a university professor to read this book. So why shouldn't you try?"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Lucky Jim holds up awfully well for a comic novel about British academics circa 1947. Tweed jackets and glasses of sherry, medieval musical's and lectures so dull, one must drink a bottle of good scotch to get through the muddle.Jim Dixon is hanging on by his academic fingernails. Professor Welsh could hire him on for another year, but first Jim must be Welsh's scholastic slave. Margaret is the dowdy love interest and she has a way of locking a bloke up with hysterical outburst and suicidal pill popping. The effete Bertrand, Welsh's son has the lovely Christine and a penchant for snobbery and married women. Christine is a London girl and out of Jim's league. Somehow Jim and Christine come together because they both disdain the heavy-handed collegiate snobbery.Kingsley Amis made his career with this novel. It is a classic and I think will hold up for all time."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I must be on some kind of roll in my mainstream reading. First was the exciting revelation that Robertson Davies wrote the types of books that appeal to me in the same way that Jonathan Carroll's do, then came the surprise that Vladimir Nabokov was as clever as Borges, yet wrote at longer lengths. If Lucky Jim is any indication, now I've just discovered an author who combines the plotting skill of P.G. Wodehouse with the detail of Davies. My lord, three great new authors in one year--I'm not sure if I can handle it.Lucky Jim doubles as a book of high humor and as an attack on the staid British university system of its time (and maybe beyond--I'm no expert in its complexities). For me, it succeeds best in its first role, but that may be because if has lost some of its bite in the intervening years since its first publication. Jim Dixon, the title character, is a new lecturer in history at a mid-sized college. He finds the work almost stultifyingly boring, but the real horror is trying to achieve tenure when faced with Welch as his immediate superior. And then there's Margaret, his girlfriend, although he can't quite remember how she came by that designation, who, although pleasing enough to look upon, seems destined to be always upset with him, which is dangerous, since she tried to commit suicide when her last beau left her suddenly.Imagine Wodehouse writing a Wooster/Jeeves novel in which Jeeves becomes pure blind luck, Aunt Agatha is split into component irritations, and Bertie is a young teacher with a taste for drink and a bit of a chip on his shoulder. Then exchange the fantasy 1920s setting with a realistic early 60s one. The result is as fabulous, funny and appealing as a well-written Mad TV or Monty Python skit.On the strength of this novel, Amis became a spokesman for a generation of \\"angry young men.\\" I'm not qualified to comment further on that, which means I need to do some self-education on the British novel in the 1960s. Amis seems to have been the Vonnegut equivalent for Britain, that is, a novelist whose social commentary was stronger than the genre in which their books were based, which landed them with a mainstream audience. Just looking at some of his other titles reveals that Amis had an affinity for popular literature, even though his was never ghetto-ized. I'm hoping that some of his other books, like The Anti-Death League, will be as rewarding as this."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"No wonder this book is deemed a &quot;Classic.&quot; James Dixon is a 20th Century everyman. Poor beleaguered James Dixon. With his academic career hanging on a thread, not-so-lucky Jim has to kowtow to his witless superior and his witless superior's hugely annoying wife and equally obnoxious son during a weekend get together. From there, everything goes downhill fast for Dixon. But out of Dixon's dilemma comes wonderfully comic moments as he attempts to extracate himself from a bad situation. Amis creates wonderful, quirky but believeable central characters (and secondary) and Dixon's hilarious internal dialogue kept me laughing out loud -- I should think we can all relate to Dixon's thoughts (rude, catty, cynical, nasty, incisive, mocking, witty and insecure by turns) as we routinely censor what we will say aloud. There are so many terrific moments in this book that I immediately re-read it so as to savor them all over again."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"In contrast to most of the reviews below, I did not find this novel to be all that funny.

I don't know that I have ever laughed as hard while reading a book as I did in this one. The wit is both sharp and precise--you sam. But it isn't only funny, it has a tremendous warmth to it. If you aren't smiling from humor, you're smiling because of the connection with the characters.Not only did I read this book with delight, I've actually given two copies to friends (this is not something i've ever done with secular books other than this one).

A particularly cynical fellow, his journey is marked by his mischievous (and quite frankly absurd) behaviour, which regularly arises for no other reason than an the latest attack in an old score or an invented, new one. Toss into the storyline a couple of flawed female characters (Margaret a great character who is very much the horror pursuit - seemingly the easy romance option but inevitably manipulative and frigid), including the boss's son's girlfriend (Christine) and he finds himself into a nightmare of his own doing. Can Lucky Jim keep his job and have his way too?Society has changed a lot since Lucky Jim was first published in that it has become much less bound to such restrained conversation, making the characters seem quite dated and the wit perhaps a little less than razor sharp. This is not a heavy criticism, old movies often elicit a similar feeling. A prerequisite of satire is that one must have an understanding of the subject being satired. Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable book to read and a classic piece of writing. There are many laughs throughout and what would have to be one of the best descriptions of trying to wrestle one's drunk, spinning head to rest, and the consequences on the next morning.As a general observation, many Kingsley Amis novels bear male characters with traits remarkably similar to those of the author, or the author's friend Philip Larkin. In particular, the main men in his books almost always seem to have a special relationship to alcohol and view women as more than chattel, but generally less than equals. The irony of this is that the booze usually brings about calamitous situations and the women often have a certain power over the men.I've noticed some other reviewers have complained that the introduction by David Lodge spoils some of the narrative by giving the game away. I believe a good story needs no introduction, so I skipped it and by the end felt no need to revisit it. For a greater understanding of the novel (strictly to be read after you have finished Lucky Jim), consider reading Christopher Hitchens review published in the magazine The Atlantic in May 2002 and again in his book Love, Poverty and War: Journeys and essays."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I think you simply have to be an academic to fully enjoy the comedy of Lucky Jim.

The writing is strong, but the characters and story are weak which makes this a \\"good read\\" or \\"light fiction\\" or \\"popular press\\" rather than literature. I offer this distinction at the outset since many reviews of this novel praise it so highly and it can lead one to expect something more than you get. When you read to pass time, this is good pasttime reading.I was particularly struck by Kingsley Amis's strong observation and artful writing. He seems to observe the world closely and accurately, then comments upon it with strong writing. For example, he describes a character as disliking another couple so much the character wonders why the couple doesn't hate each other, too. A fabulous observation and conceit, too.As other reviewers have noted the situation of the novel is highly specific - post World War II England with academics at a second rate college. The story revolves around a small set of characters most of whom are employed by a college. As someone who spent a lot of time at American universities, I can affirm that the stereotypes of academics appear on both sides of the ocean and it was painful at times to see myself and other colleagues in the characters in this novel. However, you can enjoy the book even if you know nothing about post World War II, England, or universities."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Okay, so saying it's a little outdated sounds a bit harsh. After all, classics like Lucky Jim never lose their appeal. But 1954 humour is different to today's humour, though passages of Lucky Jim will certainly cause more that a few guffaws. Also, the humour and style is dated English (and I don't mean Monty Python). You need to understand the English culture to understand some of the 'jokes'.Having said that, Lucky Jim remains a delight to read as it satirises the pretentious lives of the university professors and their pathetic wives. Amis's use of internal dialogue is truly remarkable, keeping us handsomely amused with the thoughts of the principle character, James Dixon, as he moves in turn through cynical, rude, crude, catty, nasty, incisive, indecisive, mocking, and always insecure. It is a work that achieves a rare combination of being a literary treasure and also a humorous novel. I can happily recommend it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I bought this book because of the rave reviews. I thought it was funny, but not a side-splitter- I didn't laugh out loud once. Don't buy this if you are looking for a slapstick laugh-riot kind of book, but do buy it if you like a good relationship based story and you can relate to the inanity of academia.It's a good story. You care about the characters by the end, and it's well done. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"The story is told from the point of view of a university professor (Dixon) who really doesn't fit into the world of academe. That in itself is very funny. A university prof who hates teaching classes, is bothered by overachieving students, writes journal articles on topics he doesn't like, and ridicules the chair of his dept.... I'm sure there are many academics out there with similar inclinations."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis's &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is a novel in the tradition of Wodehousian humoristic writing. But whereas Wodehouse wrote about silly characters worming their way out of silly situations with silly dialogue and behavior, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; presents a scenario in which humor is developed more subtly through natural irony, cynical sarcasm, and things that are implied rather than said.The protagonist, Jim Dixon, is a lecturer in the history department of a not-so-highly acclaimed British university. He is lazy, immature, and hates his job and his boss, Professor Welch, the head of the department. Jim feels obligated to attend Welch's boring weekend parties, singing corny madrigals with insufferable members of the university faculty. At one of these parties, Jim runs afoul of Welch's son Bertrand, a pompous, self-important painter and self-declared pacifist who threatens Jim with bodily harm when piqued.Jim falls in love with Bertrand's voluptuous girlfriend Christine, but he is stuck in a contentious relationship with Margaret, another lecturer in his department. He dislikes Margaret intensely, considering her neurotic and unattractive, but he can't help but feel a little guilty over her recent suicide attempt.This background is used for further comic developments in which Jim must extricate himself from various quagmires, such as his attempt to conceal the damage to the Welches' bedsheets caused by his burning cigarette, his ploy to get Bertrand to bring Christine to a dance to present him with an opportunity for a rendezvous, and his attempt to deliver a scholarly lecture on &quot;Merrie England&quot; while quite inebriated.Amis is masterful in the way he sets up these predicaments for his protagonist and allows him to conquer them one by one, capitalizing on each scene's full comic potential, finally emerging with something like a twisted fairy-tale happy ending. Overall, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is a novel that deflates intellectual and artistic pretentiousness in a smart (as opposed to vulgar) manner."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"It was OK. Worth the price. Good for a mindless relaxing read. It reminded me very much of Bertie and Wooster."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"The novel is in great condition and will be a nice edition to my library."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I originally bought this book because I had to read it for my English Literature class, but after I actually sat down to read it, I couldn't put it down.It had it's ups and downs, but for the most part it was just a great British academic comedy. I would recommend for anyone that would like a good laugh with a feel good ending."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis struck gold on this one. I was quickly enthralled in the characters and the wit he displays is amazing. I laughed my head off throughout the book. Buy this book ASAP, you'll read it several times and love every minute of it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"When I first read this twentieth century classic, I said to myself: \\"Am I missing something here? This is the work of one of England's angry young men? Now I'm one of the angry ones.\\" It took a BBC series to bring the characters to life in a way not immediately clear to me on the written page. Putting the words on video greatly increased my sympathy for Jim.Nonetheless, I think son Martin Amis did a funnier job with a similarly self-absorbed, self-centered slob in \\"Money: A suicide note\\". While I can see where son Martin found and derived his inspiration, I found less humor and little insight from the father.Lucky Jim Dixon is often more loathesome than likeable. His own sense of humor -- childish practical jokes of revenge on his enemies -- is more petty and mean than inspired. He doesn't much care for his students (except perhaps the pretty girls), his colleagues, or (for better reasons) his \\"superiors\\". Reading \\"Lucky Jim\\", I pictured a young Peter O'Toole or perhaps Hugh Grant drinking and stumbling his way through a good job, more concerned about his cigarette and beer budget than anything intellectual, romantic, noble, or heroic.Other than his contrast to the even more boorish son (Betrand) of Dixon's superior, it is still hard to understand the basis for the lucky outcome that concludes the book. Lucky for Jim, not just his students that, Dixon found another career."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I never laugh out loud while reading, but this book had me in stitches.

The guide to revolution for the man who always feels he is inadequete. It is redemption for the child that never became a man. Most of all it is incredibly funny. A slow read at the start, but a read well worth it. Lucky jim is one of the most beautifull characters of all time."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"It's a good story for those sick of overdramatization without intelligenge. Some things get a little bit out of hand, but only the wittiest survive."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This is a book that is more likely to change your life. Although Amis lived another few decades, he never quite recreated the magic of Jim Dixon's luckily unlucky world. This is the book that should replace &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; as required reading for all adolescent and post-adolescent boys, and while it may not romanticize the irregularities of whatever the way Salinger's questionable classic does, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; should find its way onto the book shelves of all growing girls, too. Of course this is not to say that this is a kid's book. Far from it: by reading &quot;Lucky Jim,&quot; &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being,&quot; and &quot;The Crying of Lot 49,&quot; it is entirely possible to form a worldview to compete easily with the bilge spewed by all the New Age garbage around today. (And, I must admit, I've never gotten past page 60 in the Kundera.) In addition, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; contains perhaps the finest paragraph, comic or otherwise, ever written, nay, ever printed, in the English language. You'll know it when you read (double entendre intended)"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Lucky Jim is a comic masterpiece - for the 1950s. It fits its time perfectly. However the style is so British middle class, reserved, mandarin, that it fails to last as a great novel. Bumbling academics, timid and accident prone, every event so gentile, bedded down with thick helpings of classic farce. It is in the manner of Evelyn Waugh, another writer so hidebound by class that he was unable to produce powerful sounding literature and resorted to documenting the foibles of a certain strand of British society.Not to say Lucky Kim is a bad novel. It is a good read for those in bed with flu days when you want something nice and restful to entertain you. There are glimpses of great humour on every page - rising to a climax when Jim delivers his make or break 'Merrie England' lecture: 'Listen and I'll tell you. The point about Merrie England is that it was about the most un-Merrie period in our history It's only the home-made pottery crouw, the organic husbandry crowd, the recorder-playing crowd,the Esperanto...' then collapses inebriated. You get the picture. Warm, fuzzy stuff."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"This is the kind of book you'll either love or feel so-so about - like British TV comedies (Monty Python)or other British novels. IT'S A BRITISH THING STUPID. I enjoyed this book a great deal."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"&quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is self-indulgence on Amis's part masquerading as 'satire'. His portrayals of certain characters -- namely, the selfish, incompetent Welch family -- are implausible to the point of distraction. The character of Jim Dixon would be likeable enough, if not for the unfortunate fact that Amis develops his protagonist's personality through Jim's constant mockery of his professor's family. At the book's end, the only really good thing we can say about the guy is (as 'Gore-Itchbag' puts it), &quot;It's not that you've got the qualifications .... You haven't got the disqualifications, though, and that's much rarer.&quot; Jim is a bloke with a good head on his shoulders, but has no desire to do anything beyond drink a pint of bitter at the nearest pub and chat up the lovely Christine. Not a bad guy, really -- just not interesting enough to balance out his nasty distaste for and sophomoric pranks aimed at the Welch family.But that's not to say the book lacks any merit. There are incidents as exciting and/or comic as in any other novel ruled by middle-class convention (one reviewer above noted the hangover scene in chapter 6; see also Jim's coup at the ball and his drunken debacle of a speech). In terms of writing, you will not find prose more clear or brisk than Mr. Amis's -- and Jim's overwhelming feelings of ill-will are somewhat excused by the sheer originality, fluidity, and wit of his turns of phrase. The simple punchline metaphors always stand out (&quot;like Genghis Khan meditating a purge of his captains&quot;; &quot;Welch's nose itself, a large, open-pored tetrahedron&quot;), but the best moments show off the author's flexibility with language, like the running gag of Jim's &quot;Welch tune&quot;: &quot;This tune featured in the rondo of some boring piano concerto Welch had once insisted on playing [Jim] on his complicated exponential-horned gramophone ...and Dixon had fitted words to it ... 'You ignorant clod, you stupid old sod, you havering get...' Here intervened a string of unmentionables, corresponding with an oom-pah sort of effect in the orchestra. 'You wordy old turdy old scum, you griping old piping old bum...'&quot; and so on.In short -- if any character were half as rich and friendly as Amis's pen, this book would be engaging. As it is, one closes it wondering why they bothered to spend 200 pp. with such middling, dull people."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Excellent condition, a Very fair price that I'm delighted with, excellent communication, excellent packaging and fast shipping! High recommend; a perfect transaction! Thank you so much!"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis's \\"Lucky Jim\\" must have been quite a shock to its readers when it came out, with its comedic situtations and its anti-culture, anti-academia message, but yet...it seems so dated looking at it today. You can see a youthful rebellion in the book, as Dixon is a utterly disinterested professor of history. He absolutely loathes his field, and anything considered \\"haute couture\\". He quotes books, but of course won't tell us where it's from. But Dixon isn't particularly likable, nor a great character, and the rest are two-dimensionional stereotypes(Bertram is the oaf, Christine the desirable girl, Margaret the witch, Dixon's boss a know-nothing stuffed shirt). Although, the thought of Amis having Dixon say \\"Flithy Mozart\\" is a work of genius, but that is the lone high point of the novel. Only merits 3 stars."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Lucky Jim is John Dixon, a university lecturer trying to find a path through the first of 2 probationary years for his job. A particularly cynical fellow, his journey is marked by his mischievous (and quite frankly absurd) behaviour, which regularly arises for no other reason than an the latest attack in an old score or an invented, new one. Toss into the storyline a couple of flawed female characters (Margaret a great character who is very much the horror pursuit - seemingly the easy romance option but intolerably manipulative and frigid), including the boss's son's girlfriend (Christine) and he finds himself into a nightmare of his own doing. Can Lucky Jim keep his job and have his way too?Society has changed a lot since Lucky Jim was first published in that it has become much less bound to such restrained conversation, making the characters seem quite dated and the wit perhaps a little less than razor sharp. This is not a heavy criticism, old movies often elicit a similar feeling. A prerequisite of satire is that one must have an understanding of the subject being satired, something that seems to be diminished over time. Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable book to read and a classic piece of writing. There are many laughs throughout and what would have to be one of the best descriptions of trying to wrestle one's drunk, spinning head to rest, and the consequences on the next morning.As a general observation, many Kingsley Amis novels bear male characters with traits remarkably similar to those of the author, or the author's friend Philip Larkin. In particular, the main men in his books almost always seem to have a special relationship to alcohol and view women as more than chattel, but generally less than equals. The irony of this is that the booze usually brings about calamitous situations and the women often have a certain power over the men.I've noticed some other reviewers have complained that the introduction by David Lodge spoils some of the narrative by giving the game away. I believe a good story needs no introduction, so I skipped it and by the end felt no need to revisit it. For a greater understanding of the novel (strictly to be read after you have finished Lucky Jim), consider reading Christopher Hitchens review published in the magazine The Atlantic in May 2002 and again in his book Love, Poverty and War: Journeys and essays."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I don't know how I missed this one all these years. I hadn't even heard about it until a couple of weeks ago. I read it through in a couple of days. Luck Jim is a great book, funny, and skillfully written. Like other reviewers, I too laughed out loud. It can be a liitle bit dense, and some of the vocabulary will have you reaching for the dictionary, but overall it's engaging, and it flows. The characters are well portrayed and the story is suspenseful. I'm now looking for my next Amis book."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I think I read this as a teenager, over forty years ago. At the time I don't think I was all that impressed.Much later I read one or two other Amis novels and quite enjoyed them and recently I have read about ten, finding them mostly absolutely hilarious, especially \`Take a Girl Like You', \`One Fat Englishman' and \`Girl, 20'.Lucky Jim is quite different from these middle period novels in that the main character suffers from severe anxiety nearly all the way through about his career and his love life. As David Nicholls says in the introduction to my copy, most of the passion in it is Dixon talking to himself about his hatred of certain other characters.Later Amis novels also feature such hatred, but in these it is more likely to be expressed rather than an inner monologue, and in later books the protagonists are much more confident individuals, though their behaviour is not necessarily any more socially acceptable.Nevertheless Lucky Jim is reminiscent to me of several other novels written in the fifties and sixties about young people and their uncertainties. I am thinking of \`Billy Liar', \`The L-Shaped Room' etc.One reviewer refers to Dixon's extraordinary attitude to women. I don't find it extraordinary, he is actually extraordinarily respectful of them, without denying lustful feelings, which seems quite healthy to me."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"It's rare for a comic novel to have the kind of influence LUCKY JIM did, but it's pretty much the key novel produced in the United Kingdom in the 1950s--it's been imitated endlessly, but there are few novels quite so funny or that do such a superb job of capturing a certain time, place, and attitude. Jim Dixon is a junior lecturer in medieval history at a \\"red brick\\" university where he suffers very much from being under the thumb of the vague and ineffective Professor Welch and his monstrously pretentious and bullying family; he also feels weighed down by another lecturer, Margaret, whose attentions he has courted because she is sympathetic rather than because he is attracted to her. Jim's biggest problem, however, is most likely himself: lazy, misanthropic, and prone to drink and smoke far too much, he constantly gets himself into horrible situations where only his luck can pull him out.Very, very funny, the book has some comic set-pieces that are unforgettable after the first time you read them (such as the famous hangover scene at Professor Welsh's house) or that never fail to pall (the early madrigals scene). The book has continued to receive attention largely for its portrait of the UK after the Second World War. Amis is very critical of the university educational system and its approach to passing almost every student regardless of their performances, and the attack on Professor Welch's ridiculously pompous family seems like a backlash against British high-brow culture; Jim's lecture on \\"Merrie England\\" is clearly a direct critique of British notions of both its past and present during the mid 50s. With his raging temper and disgust at everything around him Jim is very much akin to the Angry Young Men in the plays and novels of Osborne, Sillitoe and Cooper, although the mood here is very comic rather than dark. Contemporary readers with any sort of feminist sensibility might be troubled by Jim's attitude towards women, which is also much in keeping to the Angry Young Man literature of the time. (Jim comes to see the friendly and helpful Margaret to be as much of a menace to him as the nasty Welches, mostly because of her emotional neediness and her lack of physical attractiveness.) The writing is terrific, and the set-pieces are very funny, but the book is even more important for what it reveals about a certain kind of mindset in England at mid-century."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"\\"Lucky Jim\\" is one of those books that has gotten less politically correct in the fifty or so years since it was written. Somehow it has avoided becoming too dated. However, reading Kingsley Amis's debut novel, there is the feeling that Amis himself would be delighted to hear that his book is considered sexist.James \\"Jim\\" Dixon, the story's central character, is a quirky sort of anti-hero: well-meaning but selfish, he is conniving, spineless, and works just enough to keep his job. Despite it all, Dixon is quite is likeable. A junior lecturer at one of the new universities being built all over Britain in the 1950 and 60's, Dixon has an over-bearing boss, one Professor Welch, and a pathetic but psychotically manipulative girlfriend, Margot. To make matters worse, Margot lives with the Welches as part of her emotional blackmail of Dixon.When Dixon is invited to a medieval \\"artsy\\" weekend at the Welch's country home, he is put in contact with Professor Welch's pretentiously artistic family. This includes his obnoxious son, Bertrand, an artist more interested in acting a part than actually painting. Dixon also meets Bertrand's non-committal girlfriend, who is not nearly so objectionable.While it's a little formulaic, zaniness ensues. The thing with \\"Lucky Jim\\" is that it doesn't matter if the story is formulaic. The book is a good read. It's not just the laugh-out-loud parts, but that the whole story is funny. It's so well told that you can't wait to see how all this foolishness gets tied up.Silly British campus foolishness it is though. This isn't for fans of in-your-face, shock comedy. This is England of the 1950's; everyone is very polite, but this desire not to be rude that is part of the fun. No one is able to come right out and speak plainly, so the comic action keeps spinning further and further from its center through country weekends, school dances, and what must be every pub in a college town.\\"Lucky Jim\\" is a good debut from one of the more influential comic writers of the last century. Read it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"My oh my, this book is honest to goodness, hands down, one of the funniest books ever. Well - in my opinion. It's one of the few books that lives up to that awful cliche, 'laugh-out-loud funny'.The Lucky Jim in question, Jim Dixon, is so human, and yet also so eccentric, irrational, and unintentionally hilarious - even the most absurd situation (and there are several) is understandable. The description of a hangover is so spot-on it's spooky, though I guess given Amis' reputation as a drinker, we shouldn't be surprised! The first review here gives a rather good plot summary, so I won't go into this. Highlights for me were the above-mentioned hangover, the sheets/blanket debacle, the various telephone impersonations, Dixon's habit of pulling extraordinarily odd faces for no particular reason, and of course the epic, drunken rant that is his lecture on 'Merrie Old England'.I do think that the kind of humour Amis employs here is, as with all comedy, a matter of taste - it's a dry, absurdist kind of humour, quite English, and would appeal to those who enjoy Monty Python and/or Bridget Jones. And that, to me, is the best kind there is. Hilarious, wonderful fun."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Sometimes a book is about undertones, imagery, hidden or hard-to-find symbolism, or dreadful cynical askance of another's work. This is not such a book.This is a great tale - full of laughs about the boyish personality of an overachieving academic named James - who we get to know as Lucky Jim.He doesn't know exactly what or how he got into the university life, and soon learns he is really out of his element. He is not stuffy enough, he is not arrogant enough, he is not . . . enough.Within a few months, a few hundred pages, he manages to burn his boss's bed and table - and opts not to confess to the embarrassing act, lusts and seeks the love of his boss's son, makes not one - but two - prank calls to the home of his boss, makes numerous false statements face-to-face to his boss, and plunders a speech his boss requests him to give. Best yet, the plundering involves mimicking his superiors while practically belching his words from his inebriated state.At the end, you almost hear him say, \\"Take that you lout, and \`yer whole family too.\\" But, this occurs in the 1950's, in educated England, where and when people acted and spoke civilly to one another, even when the topic of discussion was anything but civil. So, there is no \\"out loud\\" in-your-face confrontation like that.As someone who probably grew up reading Waugh, Shaw and Forster, Amis's dialogue richly resembles their great works as it depicts the unique and invariably different method of speech than what we entertain daily in 21st century America.This was a lot of fun to read and \\"full of good laughs, old boy. Good show.\\""},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I was assigned to read this book for a class I'm taking, so it seems fitting that a book about a young professor out of his depth at one of England's lesser (or \\"red-brick\\") universities should be forced upon university students to the modern day. \\"Lucky Jim\\", for all its faults, is a great look at the madness on the other side of the teacher's desk.Jim Dixon is a young man whose education was delayed by service in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, and his position as a lecturar on \\"Merrie England\\" and other topics related to the Middle Ages is both tenuous and unpromising even if he can manage to hold onto it (whether or not he can survive the department head, Welch, or his hideous family, and the temptations of Christine, who happens to be dating Welch's horrid son Bertrand). Over the course of the novel, Jim proves to be anything but \\"lucky\\" in a series of comic misadventures that other reviewers have covered and which I think should be left to the reader to discover for themselves, as they make up some of the best-written comedic scenes I've run across in novel-writing anywhere.The main arguement anyone might have against the book is that it is \\"distinctly British\\" and also of its time to the point where it loses relevance. I have no problem with the former, as the novel indeed would be more appreciated if you came to it with a basic understanding of the English class system and the upheavals of the postwar era (one that began with \\"The Angry Young Men\\" and the Goon Show, led to the Beatles and Monty Python, and finally the punk era). But you don't need a doctorate in medieval literature to understand Dixon's comic plight or the crisis he faces on a regular basis.As far as relevance, there can be an arguement made for Amis' sexism (Jim is torn between the beautiful Christine and the more plain Margaret, who also turns out to be a drama queen). In the way that it portrays the fairer sex, \\"Lucky Jim\\" is certainly un-PC. But great literature can often transcend the prejudices that color it, and while not making excuses for the manner in which women are viewed, I think it's safe to say that the novel still has some measure of worth as a genuinely comic story of its time, that also helped define a movement.Jim is the first legitimate \\"anti-hero\\" of British literature (or at least the first commoner to hold that distinction), and he was followed by Alex DeLarge and a slew of others into the present day. \\"Lucky Jim\\" has something to say about the preposterousness of university life, the idiocy of the very teachers that we're supposed to learn from, the plight of ordinary men in extraordinary (at least to them) circumstances, and finally the triumph over adversity with a certain amount of dignity and hard-earned self-respect.And did I mention how good it is?"},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis is not, in my opinion, one of the greatest comic writers - that distinction is split between P.G.Wodehouse and Evelyn Waugh - but in &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; he matches anything written by these two masters. It is laugh out loud funny, and precisely written to wring the utmost humour out of a mannered economy of words - it is no coincidence that Amis went on to write a guide to English usage, &quot;The King's English&quot;. This is a lesson in how to turn a simple plot into greatness."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"I have a tendency to allow my imagination to wander.
