Plus, many of the photos are tiny and the book is poorly designed.I found Brenda Tharp's Creative Nature and Outdoor Photography much more helpful, with larger photos and a better designed layout."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"Fantastic book. Title says it all - very cerebral and quality focused. Takes time to read and process."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"This is a disappointing read for anyone that is looking for a book about photography. A good immediate clue that this book might not be what you expect is the sheer size of the book. This is by far the most text-dense 'photography' book I have ever read.The title suggests that the text will contain insights into the more subtle aspects of photography--perhaps giving you insight into the thought process behind how some of Rowell's spectacular images were made. While there are some aspects of that covered in this book, it is a small fraction of the content.As with his earlier book, \\"Mountain Light\\", there are, of course, excellent photographs in this book. In \\"Mountain Light\\", Rowell sprinkled useful/interesting pieces of information about natural lighting phenomenon and tips on capturing these events on film amidst a backdrop of travel stories. While it was a bit frustrating that the density of photographic information was low, I found the stories that complemented this information to usually be intriguing.In this book, however, the majority of the text is not about photography at all. Most stories are simply travel diaries or thoughts on environmentalism, climbing, or other topics. I found myself wondering on many occasions whether I was reading a photography book at all.The best part of this book (aside from the lovely images) is the collection of essays at the beginning that discuss various aspects of perception and the creative process. These were the kind of essays I thought would dominate the book. There are some really interesting abstract insights in what makes a great photograph. Things got a bit over the top when Rowell gets into his theory on colour casts, but overall, this section of the book was quite enjoyable.The next part of the book still loosely feels like a photography book, but the technical information is dated and very film-specific. The last two sections are basically just travel logs. There are chapters that are essentially void of anything photography-related. This dominated well over half the book, and by the time you get to the end, you almost forget that the book had photographic topics at the beginning.I think this book would have been more successful as two shorter books rather than one long one. The first two sections put together are less than 130 (of the nearly 300) pages, but would contain more or less what I would have expected from this book from its title. I might give that 3.5 stars for the content and brilliant photos. The second book about Rowell's journeys I would have skipped completely. Put together as one book, where the last two parts dominant the majority of the text really diminishes the overall value for someone looking for a book on photography."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"It is quite sad and unfortunet that Galen Rowell and his wife were killed in a plane crash recently. The world has lost a truly visionary photographer. The results that Rowell achieved with 35mm film are truly breathtaking.I paid full price for this book, which is something I don' t do very often. In it, Rowell proves himself a very generous and inspiring person. He shows an uncanny ability to not only make amazing photographs, but to also talk saliently and make cogent statements about them too. He shares with us all his thoughts, stories and techniques for his photography. I'm not sure many other other photographers would be so willing to do so.As a photographer myself, I found it interesting to learn and understand what went through Galen Rowell's mind while making photographs. Oftentimes one sees a photographer's results (his images) yet knows nothing about the journey of work it took to achieve the results. This book fills that gap beautifully. You don't have to be a landscape photographer to enjoy this book. You only have to be interested in photography in general to get something from it.The book is easy to read and the size of it is just about right (ie. not too big and bulky)."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"The advanced photographer is searching for something in a photography book different from the novice's search. The advanced photographer understands exposure, focus perspective and the fundamentals and can tie them together to create a sharp, properly exposed image. What he or she wants to know is how to form a vision of the world that he sees and translate it into what Galen Rowell call's a visionary image.\\"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography\\" is not a how-to book. There is no progressive review of the fundamentals. Instead it is a collection of Rowell's essays that have appeared in Outdoor Photographer magazine over the years, revised for the book and placed in a sort of order that ties subjects and ideas together, rather then in the random fashion that they appeared in the magazine. The book is divided into four parts. The first discusses photographic visualization; the second a few advanced techniques that the photographer can use; the third Rowell's own travels and the way he transformed his visions into photos;and the last, a collection of miscellaneous thoughts related to photography ranging from digital manipulation to what's really wrong in the Galapagos.It may be that we cannot be taught how to make the leap from snapshot to visionary image. But perhaps the teacher can open up those recesses in our own mind where our creativity lurks. I know that after reading these essays and thinking about them, I've found my own approach to photography has changed for the better.Even though the book swept me away, I have to confess to one complaint. At the top of each essay is a reference to relevant photographs contained elsewhere in the book. Several photos are referenced by more than one article. In their original magazine format, the photos conveniently appeared at the start of the essay. Here you will have to keep flipping back and forth. There probably is no economical way to provide these links, but it does break up the continuity a bit.Although I'm pretty closely aligned with Rowell's political philosopy, which creeps in throughout the essays, especially in the final section, there's still enough appropriately provocative material here from which a photographer with a different philosophy can benefit.Although you may feel driven to devour this volume as quickly as possible once you get a hint of its goals, I think you will keep it on hand, to occasionally dip into an essay or two to stir up your own photographic creativity."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"I loved this book. Great photographs and very inspiring. There are a few pointers on the technical aspect of photography, but the book stays true to its title by focusing on the emotional part (the important part) of creating an image. I gave it only four stars because the last chapter had little meaning to me as a photographer. It basically talks about photography as a large scale way to influence politics to save the environment. Noble, but doesn't really apply to my situation."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"This book is a collection of essays Rowell has written for &quot;Outdoor Photographer&quot; over the years. The book, however, is more than a mere collection of articles -- it brings to the fore Rowell's vision and philosophy as an artist. Topics range from very practical, e.g. suggestions on what equipment to bring, to esoteric, e.g. physical and ppyshological aspect of light. I highly recommend this book both to photographers and to readers interested in the arts and adventure travel!"},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"This book is heavy going,ok for professionals,or for those with a degree in psychology.I know this guy was good,but I only got halfway thru this book before I said ''enough''.Not a book for amateurs."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"Inner Game is right. Rowell immediately jumps into the mental and psychological aspects of what makes a good photograph. Great exapmples in his essays and pictures of how it is that a photograph \\"speaks\\" to the viewer.Even if you have limited technical expertise, the essays and pictures will certainly be enough to motivate you to get your *expletive* together and develop said expertise, get out there, and take breathtaking photographs.He could have always used more pictures and of those he did include not all included technical info on how they were made. Minus one star for that. But all in all, a great book!"},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"I would have given it 5 stars if it had more pictures. I have enjoyed the book, the insights Galen gives are thought provoking. I wish the pictures were bigger and part of the descriptive pages - you have to refer to the pictures located elsewhere in the book while reading the commentary. I usually grab this while having lunch and read a few sections, easy read, not a novel or How To book, just a great read by a photographer I wished I had been able to meet."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"This is one of the greatest US nature photographers who is no longer with us. We're fortunate to have these memories of the great places he recorded with his energetic excursions. Good book for learning, too."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"This book ignites the passion of outdoor photography. The way Galen writes makes you think you are next to him on that mountain creating the perfect shot. While he doesn't tell you how to become him, which he shouldn't, he does offer great experince to all those who wish to seek it."},{"Title":"Blake: Poems (Everyman's Library Pocket Poets)","review":"Blake is both a great mystic and a great poet. If you enjoy either poetry or mysticism or both you will like his poems. He tends to work on a large scale. For example all of the poems in Songs of Innocence fit a scheme and have a counterpart in Songs of Experience. I like this edition because it is very handsome with nice binding, and includes the major works of Blake. Now all you need is a book of his engravings and paintings."},{"Title":"Blake: Poems (Everyman's Library Pocket Poets)","review":"This work contains 'The Songs of Innocence' 'The Songs of Experience' a selection from Blake's manuscripts, and from the longer Prophetic Books.For the complicated Blake so loved by Northrop Frye and other literary critics this small edition of his work will of course, not do. But for the common reader, the one who loves the memorable short lines, the striking rhymes this edition is fine.Great Blake seems so simple and makes myths in short lines and stanzas.This is a very good collection for those who love the most popular Blake of all."},{"Title":"When Mothers Pray: Bringing God's Power and Blessing to Your Children's Lives","review":"Cheri Fuller leads her reader through many different aspects and levels of praying for ones child/ren. Her book brings into focus the special relationship between God and Mothers and how we must allow God to do his part without our holding him back.By stepping back and letting God do His will, we not only set our children free, we set ourselves free from the constant pressure to control situations that were God's to control to begin with!Cheri's statement (&quot;Effectual prayer means being completely committed to God's will. The prayer that brings results--that is great in its power--is one where we don't give God the answers...&quot;) couldn't be more true!I highly recommend this book to Mothers of ALL ages!!!"},{"Title":"When Mothers Pray: Bringing God's Power and Blessing to Your Children's Lives","review":"This book is an EXCELLENT source of strength, insights, guidance, and most importantly HOPE for any parent. While the book covers all stages of a child's life, each section contains ideas and hope, regardless of the section's overall relevance to the stage you are at. While the book definitely has a Christain focus, it is not overbearing. The difference in my 21 year old daughter is nothing short of MIRACULOUS, especially in the last couple of months. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough for parents who are worried about their children. One of the few resources for parents of late-teen, early-twenty year olds."},{"Title":"When Mothers Pray: Bringing God's Power and Blessing to Your Children's Lives","review":"This book is such a great book!

I truly encourage this book to all mothers!"},{"Title":"When Mothers Pray: Bringing God's Power and Blessing to Your Children's Lives","review":"I expected this book to be more for moms of younger children, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of the book was very applicable to moms like me who have older children.Cheri tells of other mothers throughout history who prayed about situations their children encountered which are so similar to the problems of the youth today - and these women were the mothers of Augustine and Hudson Taylor!I thought Cheri's suggested schedule of what to pray for on which days of the week was very helpful. She has many ideas which will give you ideas of your own.She includes many scriptures to look up and use in your own prayers for your children. Her chapter on waiting was especially good, I thought!There is a chapter on praying for prodigals and another about praying for grandchildren, so if you are a mom, this book is for you!Thanks Cheri, for another great book on prayer.My only suggestion would be for the author to include her email address so those of us who would like email her to tell her how much we enjoyed her book could do so!"},{"Title":"When Mothers Pray: Bringing God's Power and Blessing to Your Children's Lives","review":"Mothers long to have a positive influence in their children's lives.

There is also special encouragement for moms of prodigals. The author goes beyond praying for children and encourages readers to pray for their schools, neighborhoods, and worldwide revival. The final chapter reveals that as we pray, the one most changed is us."},{"Title":"When Mothers Pray: Bringing God's Power and Blessing to Your Children's Lives","review":"One of the best things we can do for our children is to pray consistently and specifically for them.

The book relates how cultural and religious leaders from the West, including familiar names, visited the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and other communist countries, and told the most appalling lies to flatter their hosts and express their contempt for Western society. It is quite an education, as another reviewer put it. Marx's revolutionary myth dominated history for the better part of the 20th Century, and if we are serious about not repeating the errors of that period, this book should be a part of our education. The short story Buddha's Smile in Solzhenitsyn's masterpiece, The First Circle, brilliantly tells the same story, from the point of view of Soviet prisoners. Lewis Feuer's Marx and the Intellectuals compares Marx and Engels themselves with the kind of people Hollander is describing. I also recommend the writings of the Rumanian philosopher, pastor, and former prisoner, Richard Wurmbrand.Hollander retells George Keenan's story of a Norwegian radical who, when asked what country he most admired, said, \\"Albania.\\" Keenan noted that the student obviously knew nothing of Albania, but chose that country \\"simply because it seems to be a club with a particularly sharp nail at the end of it with which to beat one's own society.\\"The same reactionary psychology has, it seems to me, been transferred in our day to an uncritical and naive attraction towards what is (simplistically) called \\"eastern religion.\\" One could write an even longer book about how Westerners project their fantasies on monist ideologies: people like Joseph Campbell and Karen Armstrong \\"explaining\\" human sacrifice, the Theosophical Society standing up for caste, Arthur C. Clarke (Did he know much more of Asian history than the Albanian radical knew of Albania?) describing Buddhism as \\"the only faith that never became stained with blood.\\" Even Hollander allowed that, \\"While the suspension of disbelief has its place in human life, it belongs more to the religious (or asthetic) than the political realm.\\" But his book should be read, in my opinion, as a warning against all forms of ideological naivite. A love of truth, and a determination to tell it no matter how out of fashion it may seem, is essential to integrity in all walks of life. Political Pilgrims vividly illustrates, in the political realm, the evil that can be done when honesty plays second fiddle to fashion....."},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"I read this book on a suggestion from an Economics professor at George Masoh University. I was doing some research about some American views of the Soviet Union while Stalin was murdering his people and my professor enlightened me towards this incredible read. It was indeed a hard book to come across, mine was the only school in the entire Metropolitan DC area to hold this. So, I considered myself lucky. And after reading with passion every single word, I now consider myself educated. For those who are fans of George Bernard Shaw, read this at your own peril. While Mr. Shaw was bordering a train heading into the Soviet Union, he threw all his food on the roadside in Poland, in belief that food in the USSR was readily available. Indeed, it was for him and the other Americans the Russians wanted to use to spread their Communist propaganda, but little did these utopian-minded citizens know, millions upon millions were being murdered right under their noses in this great utopia. Of course murder didn't stop these peaceful leftists from looking at the grim realities of life under socialism. They still found ways in which to exalt the virtues of government planned society. After the guilt overcame them in regards to the murders of Stalin, they took to Cuba. Unfortunately for them, same game plan under Castro, same result, millions of innocents dead. Realizing Cuba was not the great utopia, these American leftists took to China and Mao. AHHHH? If only these people would live the &quot;true&quot; socialist way. If only socialism was allowed to flourish in its true nature, with peace and love for everyone. A few peiple get murdered along the way? Its too bad but the good of the nation is more important. Hollander outlines this perfectly. Three cheers for him and for the people who have the guts to read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"In this fascinating book, Paul Hollander exposes the self deception of 19th and 20th century intellectuals. In their search for the perfect society, they wander from Revolutionary Russia to modern-day Cuba.In spite of massive evidence of human rights abuse, including genocide, false imprisonments, and confiscation of private property, the political pilgrims never waver in their loyalty to failed, left-wing ideals. They journey onward after each &quot;socialist&quot; failure, with the fervor of religious converts.This book is meticulously documented and easy to read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"Paul Hollander is one of our best critics of the kind of foolishness that motivates intellectuals today and has done so for centuries. This book is well worth reading. It demonstrates most amply Hollander's contention that intellectuals are not characterized solely by their critical abilities and habits. Rather, as Hollander points out time and again, they are also characterized by their opportunistic use of these abilities, and by their incredible credulity. Sartre is only one case in point: his fabulous skepticism is employed to prevent himself from coming face to face with the fact that Stalin was a monster and that Marxism could neither save a nation nor prevent mass murder. Our hyper-politicized faculty on Kampus today employ the same kinds of denial and opportunistic critique to save thier silly beliefs in the beneficence of multiculturalism, in the existence of patriarchy and in the explanatory power of cultural critique. Hollander's book is a must read for anyone who needs distance from the nonsense of our postmodernists, deconstructionists and other allegedly radical dogmas of the aging flower children. All of them practice selective attention to their critical principles, scepticism for their enemies, and utter credultiy for their pals."},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"Hollander hits an important nail on its head. Many members of the intellectual left have a horrible track record of either excusing or turning a blind eye to the brutality of socialist dictators. As such, many twentieth century leftists served as apologists for evil socialist dictators. Of course, these same people have no difficulty finding fault with the US and UK. No problem in the West is too small to warrant condemnation in their eyes.The sad truth is that the vision of an egalitarian society has been romanticized and popularized. Even today there are some who defend and even promote the USSR. Hollander counters this nonsense with evidence. Unfortunately, there are still some ideologues to whom evidence means nothing. We need more scholars like Hollander."},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"Hollander puts the selective moral outrage and selective acceptance of evidence of the Left on parade as he follows these blinkered one's through the various Potemkin Villages of the Totalitarians, from the October revolution forward into most of the 20th century. Smug arrogance knows no political party or religious faith, no gender, race or sexual preference, it seems to be evenly spread among us. In this instance the highly developed capacity for self-deception of the Left is on trial and an amusing trial at that. Their tortured explanations of the intellectually unexplainable are a fictive of mankind's marvelous ability &quot;to transform things to the liking of his desires&quot;.Like all those who are &quot;blowin' in the wind&quot;, these intellectual hard heads do not seek truth, but instead to validate their worldview. This book is a study of intellectuals, estrangement and its consequences."},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"This is an awesome book which helps the reader understand why intellectuals always seem to be on the wrong side of history. They loved Communism even when it was obvious that Lenin & Stalin were exterminating hoards of people! They are defective in their thinking and they stick to it. The author has a quote at the beginning of the book. \\"A GREAT DEAL OF INTELLEGENCE CAN BE INVESTED IN IGNORANCE WHEN THE NEED FOR ILLUSION IS DEEP.\\" (Saul Bellows) . This book walks you through the 'needs' that these intellectuals seem to have which continually seems to cause them to deny the stark realities around them & cling to their 'ideologies'. I am so glad I read this book as I just laugh now when I hear so much of what is on the news. I GET IT!"},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"25 years ago, \\"Political Pilgrims\\" documented beyond any doubt the willing self-deception of intellectuals in love with the totalitarian regimes in Cuba, China, the Soviet Union and East Germany. The debate no longer rages over whether these countries were \\"freer\\" than their counterparts in the West. They aren't. What hasn't changed, however, is the continued willingness of intellectuals to find paradise anywhere but in the US.Paul Hollander brings his trademark meticulousness to the study of Intellectuals who travel to what used to be referred to as Worker's Paradises. Using mountains of evidence, one cannot help but be persuaded that Western Intellectuals experience such a depth of alienation from their cultural birthplace, that they become morally blind to the abuses of its antagonists.What's truly remarkable, is that none of this has changed. One merely needs to point to Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and it's grotesque representation of Hussein's Iraq as an innocently peaceful place of playful children and mothers. At no point in that execrable movie does he mention the mass graves or torture chambers.Michael, post your wish list on Amazon and I'll send you this book. Promise."},{"Title":"Political Pilgrims: Travels of Western Intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China and Cuba","review":"Hollander's background is that of a Hungarian exile and as any exile of Communism, he explored the exasperating mindset of many Westerners. This study is undertaken in far more detail due to Hollander's academic interests and yet, the ideas are not new but the depth of coverage is slightly better than previous works.David Caute explored the phenomenon somewhat in The Fellow Travelers but it is only Hollander who attempted an entire study of not just specific fellow travelers but to explore a generalized psychology of such people. Some basic ideas are given but sadly, the actual scope of the information is limited by a failure to connect to research carried out then and since on Narcissism. The two are closely linked and the connection must await another book.Hollander nonetheless presents a convincing argument for what he has managed to put forward but this still rests on far too few primary sources for me to feel entirely comfortable with the basis for his arguments as stated. Later study would seem to support him but the connections that could have been made in the later editions did not take advantage of new research regarding psychology or ameliorate the coverage of Communist hospitality.This is a fine academic or popular resource but it suffers from a lack of detailed sources (personal experience may be true but hardly citeable), repetition at points, and some excessive verbosity. Several anecdotes serve to illustrate well where his explanations are not as easy to digest. This is well worth purchasing but a certain cynicism will likely arise when dealing with idealists if the book is well read."},{"Title":"Vietnamese for Beginners","review":"I have studied Vietnamese for several months now, and have tried several different materials.

The bio on her life interested me in her writing. The salient points are (1) she underwent psychiatric treatment for suicide, (2) changed her name to that of a character in one of her novels, and (3) was an heroin addict for half her life. What kind of fiction, I wondered, would such a person write?*Ice* answers the question nicely. The entry on Kavan describes it as &quot;an impressive foray into the world of science fiction&quot;. The novel depicts a man's quest for an enigmatic woman in an apocalyptic world. Civilization is being reduced to basic elements by the encroachment of a new ice age. The heat of human emotions takes place against this looming backdrop.It is the last novel in the second half of Kavan's literary career and is generally considered the best of that period. Although classified as science fiction, the book does not incorporate the usual futuristic gadgetry or extra-terrestrials encountered in that genre. The classification is a loose one. Just as Orwell's *1984* is more than a dystopian story and Jame's &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot; is more than a ghost story, so is *Ice* more than science fiction. The prose is lean, vivid; Kafkaesque in its elastic shift from realism to the bizarre.The only flaw I find in the book lies with the publisher, not the author. Peter Dutton did not include an introduction which would have rounded out the reader's perception of the author's humanity. A finished piece of art - say, the Parthenon, van Gogh's &quot;Sun Flowers&quot;, Kavan's *Ice* - comes to the viewer in seamless, silent perfection. Nothing of the labor and torment which begets art is revealed. To an extent, appreciation of Anna Kavan's unique artistry is stifled by the lack of a profile.Several sites exist on the internet that provide information on the novel's author. One has several photographs of Kavan. The novel, of course, is the best introduction to this fascina! ting writer. If you like *Ice* Amazon.com advertises other works of hers. I have another on special order. For me she is an author worth reading."},{"Title":"Ice (Doubleday science fiction)","review":"How can one not discuss Anna Kavan first when discussing her work?Ice was last published novel in her lifetime, and also her masterpiece.The plot is quite simply, two men pursue a women who they constantly victimise, against a background of universal annihilation and destruction.However the book defies description, so surrealistic is the prose and so profound is the metaphor.Anna Kavan was a heroin addict for over thirty years, and had suffered two mental breakdowns which resulted in her being institutionalized. However she was a consummate artist who re-invented herself successfully as a avant garde writer (now sadly neglected). Ice is her crowning achievemnt,read it."},{"Title":"Ice (Doubleday science fiction)","review":"When I first read 'Ice' (from Brian Aldiss' published recommendation) I enjoyed it but didn't think it was great. It seemed to me to be about Kavan's struggle with drugs - a struggle she couldn't win. But this was a bit remote for me since I have never taken drugs. Some years later I read another Kavan novel - 'The Eagle's Nest'. This is a hot novel in comparison to the coldness of 'Ice' and, perhaps, more akin to my own personality. Anyway, it encouraged me to read 'Ice' again and now I saw it as so much stronger because it's (to me anyway) not about a futile struggle against drug addiction but something much more cosmic - the futile struggle that we all embark on against death.I have read more Kavan since then - 'A Scarcity of Love' is great. 'Let Me Alone' is something else again. Will I ever dare reread it?"},{"Title":"Ice (Doubleday science fiction)","review":"Anna Kavan's parable is nearly word and tone perfect. The economy of her writing strips the reader of one's hopes and preconceptions and deposits us in her frozen and impenetrable world. Her novel is as cold as anything Samuel Beckett wrote; cold in the sense of distance, and a hopelessness beyond despair and without frisson. Kavan has taken the perennial complaint about the human condition and refused to stoop to anything so simian. The eponymous Mr. Frost asked if the world would end in fire or ice, and then, by way of an answer, poked fun at the eschatology behind the question. Anna Kavan penned a book of doom that transcends eschatology. She writes with control, restraint and a terrible authority, a consequence of the immobilizing power that comprises the center of this classic work.Copyright 2010"},{"Title":"Ice (Doubleday science fiction)","review":"I read Ice several years ago, and I recall it as a very intense experience, perhaps beacuse Kavan had altered her mind considerably through drugs by the time she wrote it and her own perception of reality and emotions was equally intense and she had to reduce it to the bare minimum before she could deal with it.The story takes place in a future ice-age, and the text is as cold as the title. An incessant, obsessive search for a woman is what I remember best of the story, and that would not in itself make it very special. I think it is the treatment of an ardent passion with ice-coldness what makes Kavan a winner."},{"Title":"You Can Be Free: An Easy-to-Read Handbook for Abused Women","review":"I read this and it saved my life.

This book is not the place to start. It's only the fact that you've (in theory) have been reading about these people that make you care about them. Except for humans (who have, in this universe, no un-noble drives), most every alien race is bound by some set of arcane biochemistry that renders them completely unable to solve their own problems, and prone to either betrayal or misdirected fury.Once again, the solution to the galaxy's problems are \\"kick all the aliens down until no one's kicking back anymore.\\" You'd think that civilizations with cyborgs and space travel would have gotten more civilized, not less.However, this is a stirring tale of the honest, rugged and true soldiers of the no-longer-misfit Legion. Your favorite characters are back to kick ass and take names through all the events that a hostile universe throws at them. Will they all survive to stoically defend a Conferacy run by (gasp) Liberals?So for fans of military sci-fi, this book rocks. For people interested in anything else? Skip it."},{"Title":"For Those Who Fell (Legion)","review":"The Confederacy of Sentient Beings has a new home on Algernon, the only planet that welcomed them after the insectoid Ramanthians destroyed the battleship that housed their infrastructure. Meanwhile the Ramanthian queen on planet Hive is laying billions of eggs that need transporting to other orbs so the species can survive and ultimately expand to rule the galaxy. Counter strategies forged on Algernon are implemented by the legion to protect the galaxy from the insectoid horde.Hive is heavily protected so that an armada could not successfully attack, but a lone spaceship disguised as a comet and piloted by a cyborg might succeed. The mission works forcing the enemy to pull back forces to protect the Hive. However, the enemy has cut a deal with the Thrakis to retrofit three thousand vessels; a loyal governmental circumvents official channels to insure the information reaches the right people because the biggest battle in the galaxy seems imminent on the planet Savas with the legion determined to get the Ramanthians new communication system.William C. Dietz raises the bar of excellent for military science fiction with every book he writes. FOR THOSE WHO FALL is a superb action packed thriller starring countless number of ordinary people forced into Herculean efforts to prevent the enemy from victory. Pivotal heroes like First Lieutenant Antonio Santana and Charlotte Vanderveer, who have appeared in previous books add much to this terrific tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"For Those Who Fell (Legion)","review":"Having injected fresh new life into his Legion of the Damned series with For More Than Glory, William C. Dietz provides readers with another exciting military science fiction adventure with For Those Who Fell, the sixth novel in the series. Much has changed since we first encountered the Legion of the Damned several years (and two futuristic wars) ago. While the human cyborg legionnaires remain the foundation of the epic story, intergalactic intrigue, deception, diplomacy, and good old-fashioned warfare have long ago become the trademarks of the series. A narrower design in this and the previous novel has also allowed for tighter focus and better characterization of both new and familiar individuals.While the Confederation of Sentient Beings has defeated the mighty Hudathans twice in battle and managed to subdue a powerful, mysterious new alien race called the Sheen, it still finds its very survival very much in danger - as was made clear when its spacebound headquarters was totally destroyed via an act of betrayal from within. While no one ever trusted the bug-like Ramanthians completely, few suspected that they would quickly change from ally to insidiously dangerous foe - that's mainly because the Ramanthians chose not to share the news that they were secretly preparing for the hatching of five billion new citizens. Unable to support this impending population explosion on their home planet, the Ramanthians need access to a lot of ships and the ability to seize control of additional planets to serve as homes for large numbers of the new hatchlings - all things that their treachery allows them to lay claim to.Ramanthians seem to hold the upper hand, as evidenced by the location of the new Confederation seat of government on the ice world of Naa, home of the legionnaires - no other planet wanted to offer the unified government even a temporary home, for fear that the Ramanthians would once again target it for destruction. This kind of concern for the future grows all the more graver when Confederation spies discover that the Ramanthians have managed to build a hypercom; once implemented, this faster-than-ship communications technology would almost surely seal the Confederation's doom. A special ops force is quickly dispatched to the planet Savas to seize the hypercom before the Ramanthians can implement it among all of their forces. Leading the way is the series' newest hero, Lieutenant Antonio Santana, whose dangerous job is made all the more difficult when the overmatched allied force crash lands on the planet in two separate locations separated by a vast desert. Not only must the Confederate forces be brought together before the intended mission can take place, Santana must also deal with a murderous Hudathan traitor running amuck in the wilderness and fight a proxy war against his enemies using the planet's two indigenous populations. And time is short because there's a Ramanthian fleet on the way, as well.Dietz is truly a master at this kind of futuristic hard science fiction, nimbly handling large numbers of familiar characters across multiple worlds; a variety of subplots really infuse this ongoing saga with a richness most military science fiction can only dream of. Just because Santana has his hands full on Savas while the Naa renew their controversial call for equal representation in the Confederation and diplomat Christine Vanderveen risks her career to expose the secret collaboration of the Thrakies with the enemy Ramanthians doesn't mean the Confederacy doesn't have a surprise or two up its sleeve for the Queen laying all those billions of eggs back in the Ramanthian Hive. To fully appreciate this story, though, you really need to have enough of a background of the series to put everything in context. You should definitely read the previous novel, For More Than Glory, before picking this new installment up, but I would strongly recommend reading the entire series in order, for Dietz takes his readers on a wild and addictive ride that just keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"For Those Who Fell (Legion)","review":"Dramatic war SF. Will continue to read Dietz and will look for more SF in the same sub-genre in the future."},{"Title":"For Those Who Fell (Legion)","review":"Even though it's strength is fading, Dietz's books are some of the best written military fantasy/science fiction out there.I did like the fact that the first novels continually changed the heroes, but even straying from this line Dietz still managed to produce a strong book.I certainly recommend reading this entire series."},{"Title":"For Those Who Fell (Legion)","review":"One of the best books of this series!

This helps to cover the logic inconsistencies that pop-up from time to time. His character development leans too heavily on sterotypes, but that doesn't get in the way of the story line. One petty observation, my First Edition had far too many typos, errors and word ommissions, which I hope will be corrected in future editions. I make enough of these myself..."},{"Title":"For Those Who Fell (Legion)","review":"William Dietz has taken the quiet, solid honor of the Legion and made them legendary in his books.

I love how the author encourages the reader to tell their own story. He writes \\"Each of us have a compelling story to tell so I encourage you to write your story if you have that desire. You might notice from my lack of complex sentence structures and possibly the lack of a tight subject focus that if I can write a book so can you!

Tell your story and leave the critics to their own misery.\\"Now how can you not like a guy who humbles himself right up front.I was hooked when I read the first page from the first chapter...\\"Although bright and sunny, the day of the Space Shuttle Challenger launch was an unusually cold morning for central Florida. The combination of the cold and the moist salt air made it a very unpleasant day. The few times it gets cold in the Sunshine State, my body feels it down to the bone. No one had to tell me that January 28, 1986, was the coldest day that NASA had ever launched a manned rocket. For those who witnessed the event that day, it became an overwhelming personal experience for them. For three of my coworkers and I it was even more eventful because we were one of the closest people to the explosion, and Judy Resnik, Ph.D., the Challenger Mission Specialist Astronaut, was a coworker and friend of mine.A sharp and quick to the point engineer, Judy became an astronaut in 1979 after having been a biomedical engineer and staff fellow in the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. She was a classical pianist and pilot who didn't tolerate incompetent people in the space program. The Challenger mission would be her second time in space; she first flew as a mission specialist on STS 41-D, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1984. This was the maiden flight of the orbiter Discovery. Judy loved to fly and encouraged me to obtain my pilot's license.My office was in the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility or DSIF, (pronounced \\"dee siff\\" by the locals) located on the east coast of central Florida, on the Cape Canaveral side of the Kennedy Space Center, only a quarter mile west of the Atlantic Ocean. In existence since the beginning of the space program back in the 1960's, DSIF had served as a central data house for all incoming radio signals. It was the building that received the first orbital communication signals from John Glenn and Alan Shepard. The d&eacute;cor was typical government gray with metal desk and matching swivel chairs, rotary dial phones and broken tile floors. NASA employees and their contractors worked in facilities and with equipment which looked like something out of an antique military museum. Only the space shuttle and its spotless clean rooms were new, high tech and state of the art. The majority of the 20,000-person work force worked in a musty, dull gray atmosphere, while a select few, like my group, worked in both the old facilities and the high-tech new. Working in a large government organization can be very compartmentalized although I was fortunate to be part of a group who worked across most boundaries. NASA, thank goodness, was in the process of converting our facility into a more advanced facility, and my colleagues and I were part of the team doing the upgrades. Our facility and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) were a special place to work, guarded by military personnel who wore M16 rifles.Every morning seagulls hanging out in the parking lot greeted me as I drove up to work. There was a constant light ocean breeze, and a comfortable summer environment. If the wind blew from the east, you could hear the ocean and smell the salt air.Oftentimes when I arrived at work, I felt like I was going to the beach for a day of fun and strolling down space history lane. Just over the trees I could see the original launch pads used for the Mercury program. The Mercury program began in 1961 when, only four weeks after the Russian astronaut Yuri Gagarin made the first orbital flight, the U.S. followed with a flight by Alan B. Shepard on May 5th. Shepard's launch took place only a few football fields away from our office.As soon as I arrived to work the morning of the Challenger mission, I began to listen over the local secured audio loop to the astronaut communications as they began their third attempt at a launch. The previous two launches had been scrubbed for various reasons and the media was starting to point fingers and cause what we referred to as \\"launch fever\\" - an emotion that overrides logic and entices people to take more risk than normal. NASA, being a federally funded political football, demanded we keep everyone happy, especially the media. The press wanted a launch, while we wanted safety and quality.Kennedy Space Center was hectic as usual preparing the launch of the 25th space shuttle. It was Mission 51-L, the 10th flight of Orbiter Challenger, and the first launch from the new launch pad 39B. Because it was the first time a civilian, a schoolteacher, was going into space, the launch was highly publicized. Millions of people watched the historical event on TV because it represented an average person going into space for the first time.As I continued to monitor the launch countdown process, I noticed some frustration on the part of the astronaut crew due to the cold temperatures. They were having a hard time with their gloves and equipment, and the entire process sounded more unorganized than with previous missions.A consistent, timely and methodical program was followed for each launch. Organization was key because it reduces the chance for error and emotions. The customary routine for an astronaut on launch day involves steak and eggs for \\"breakfast\\" even if wake up time is at noon or midnight. Steak and eggs are served because they reduce body waste. The last thing an astronaut needs to eat before liftoff is something that will upset his/her stomach and make for large bowel movements. The astronaut's goal is to reduce the number of bathroom breaks in space hoping to reduce debris, smell and privacy issues. A birthday party type of celebration follows the breakfast, which includes birthday cake and several top prelaunch workers. Then the astronauts walk fifty feet to an ultra clean white room to suit up in their orange pressurized suits. The astronauts exit the large Operations and Control building and enter the van, which takes them on the seven mile drive out to the launch pad. From wake up call to liftoff is about four to five hours. On the day of a shuttle mission, instead of sitting horizontal like you would in a car, the shuttle is pointed straight up towards the sky so that the astronauts lie on their backs with their feet above them. The time lying feet first in the space shuttle restrained to a giant hydrogen/oxygen bomb is about one hour.As time drew closer to what is called T-Zero...Read this book and do it on a weekend when you need a boost and a day full of enjoyment."},{"Title":"Launch Fever: An entrepreneur's journey into the secrets of launching rockets, a new business and living a happier life.","review":"I am the CEO of a publically traded healthcare company and I just finished the book.

A great book to read if you are looking for some inspiration to live a passionate a life. I cant wait to read your next book, Tim!"},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"A true \\"Sailor's Classic.\\" Reading this book it is impossible not to feel compassion for Donald Crowhurst who set out to win the Golden Globe challenge as the first man to nonstop circumnavigate the world alone in a sailboat.Crowhurst's early years are well-documented and give us a picture of a driven and compulsive man with some serious character flaws and an aversion to failure. Yet failure was a condition which dogged him throughout his life.Crowhurst's decision to undertake the circumnavigation was both dramatic and ill-considered. With relatively little sailing experience and a lot of bluff he convinced his sponsors to fund the building of a revolutionary trimaran, the \\"Teignmouth Electron\\" equipped with all manner of electronic wizardry (Crowhurst had invented a sort of early GPS, the Navicator, in the mid-60's).Unfortunately, the \\"Teignmouth Electron\\" was never properly completed, the race deadline having intervened, and Crowhurst sailed in a boat that was unfinished, poorly provisioned, and untested, having done miserably in what passed for sea trials.Setting out on the latest possible day, Crowhurst found himself limping along at a ridiculously slow pace three weeks later. Plagued by equipment failures, the \\"Teignmouth Electron\\" was taking water due to design flaws, and had no real chance of completing the race. Having staked all on a successful outcome, the tension and isolation of his predicament attacked Crowhurst's mind.In a fit of brilliant madness, Donald Crowhurst spent hours working out and logging false positions, sun sights, weather reports, and sailing notations to make it seem he was circling the earth while in fact he meandered pointlessly through the South Atlantic for months. He even secretly put in to port for repairs, a fact which was not discovered until after the race, when his \\"real\\" logs were reviewed by investigators.Crowhurst's position reports and daily runs were diligently reported onshore; he was (falsely) credited with a record run of 243 miles in one day, a record he actually matched in reality once he decided to begin sailing in earnest again.In the meantime, for all the world knew, Crowhurst was going to be the winner of the Golden Globe. As he turned toward home, the media hoopla grew wilder, and so did his delusions. His log entries degenerated into irrational philosophic and religious ramblings in which he began to believe himself God. In the end, tortured by his demons and consumed by guilt, Donald Crowhurst jumped into the sea, leaving his boat to sail on without him.Brilliantly and sensitively written, without tendering excuses the authors Tomalin and Hall never lose sight of the essential humanity and frailty of their subject, as well as his consuming but undirected brilliance. Relying heavily on Crowhurst's logs, it is devastating to watch the man's mind unravel in the face of his aloneness.Crowhurst's singlemindedness got him far, but it ultimately proved his undoing as he was unable to see any but the options he had limited himself to, the ultimate one being his own destruction. As Camus wrote, \\"In the end there is but one serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.\\" Crowhurst's answer is his legacy."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"If you're interested in the complexities of the human heart and mind, this book is for you. It's superbly written, well paced and detailed without ever being tedious, and it gets extraordinarily close to Donald Crowhurst the man--an unusual and intelligent person who took a few wrong turns and kept going. There was so much at stake in his journey, and thinking it all through sensibly and accepting the consequences of poor preparation proved to be too difficult for him. In the end he became so distressed and confused that he lost sight of himself... He was never able to see that the truth about human life can't be computed or worked out like an equation--it is not susceptible to logical proofs, because the variables are manifold and not easily understood, and people are both more and less than logical... His need, clearly, was to go home and start again, but the penalty for doing so seemed too high to him. So, in refusing to accept a lesser defeat he suffered a far greater one. You can't help rooting for Donald, and you can't help feeling sorry for him."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"Donald Crowhurst left England on October 31, 1968 to participate in a around-the-world, non-stop, solo sailing race. He was the next to last competitor to leave, just before the deadline. His boat, the Teignmouth Electron, was a trimaran.He sailed at a disappointingly slow speed for a while and then reported a few amazingly fast days. Radio communications halted as he approached the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, and nothing was heard from him for 111 days.Then radio communications resumed as he re-entered the South Atlantic, around Cape Horn, at the southern tip of South America. He was leading the race, and seemed assured of the trophy and the cash prize of 5,000. Then, on July 10, 1969, his boat was found drifting in the Atlantic, with no sign of Crowhurst on board.This book is the sad detective story of this voyage. Crowhurst never left the Atlantic Ocean, let alone sail around the world. He left massive documentation which showed that he had cheated. Presumably, rather than complete his fraudulent voyage, he stepped into the ocean and left the evidence for people to examine.Although these facts are known prior to even picking up the book, the author still comes to a very surprising conclusion. This is a book about what was going on in the mind of this sad man who seems to have gone mad. It is a fascinating and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"To echo an earlier reviewer, this is also my favourite book of all time. I tracked down a dog-eared and stained copy from the early 1970's, read it in just over a day then started back at the beginning.The fascination of the book lies with Crowhurst. Here is a man who made a couple of wrong turns in life and just kept on going. A man who may, like many of us, have lived a long life had he not taken to the sea in a white elephant on a goose chase.Tomalin and Hall had access to Crowhurst's logs and, through them, his thinking - however fuzzy that may be. From this, they constructed a well-written and gripping true-life novel.FYI, The Teignmouth Electron now lies on a beach near a liquor store on the island of Cayman Brac."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This is an amazing book, carefully and wonderfully crafted by its authors. Crowhurst was an amazingly complicated man, driven by his intellect and confined by his shortcomings. The sea was the ultimate challenge for him to face his personal demons. Setting out on a voyage inspires a whole range of emotions and feelings for those who choose to embark on such a journey. It is a study in contrasts: hope & fear; order & chaos; skill & luck; triumph & defeat. Crowhurst experienced each of these at such a deep level. He was on the world stage, yet confined by his own machinations. He set out to conquer the last great solo feat and relied on his own abilities. This is the story of how that played out. Along with this text, I would also recommend reading Peter Nichol's \\"A Voyage For Madmen.\\" It provides an excellent overview of the men involved in the first solo-around-the-world-race and each of their fates. I was unable to put either of these books down."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This is a wonderful book about a truly remarkable, moving and literally tragic misadventure. I first stumbled across Donald Crowhurst's story through a terrific Channel 4 feature film,Deep Water, and was so captivated by it that I bought this and another account of the race (fellow competitor Bernard Moitessier'sThe Long Way(which, for the record, doesn't really touch on the Crowhurst story)).The Bard himself could not have scripted a tragedy better than this. Crowhurst, a mercurial but fundamentally unremarkable director of a struggling electronics business, hits upon a means of saving his business and assuring his family's future: entering (and winning) the 1968 Sunday Times single-handed non-stop round-the-world yacht race.Yes; quite.Not only, he rationalises, will his entry publicise his firm's own brand of navigational equipment, but the 5000 prize will satisfy an ever more anxious major creditor. His plan to win, cobbled together from a standing start in six months, is to use an (at the time) almost unheard-of design: the trimaran, substantially of his own specification.No matter that, a weekend yachtsman, Crowhurst has never been out of the Solent and has no realistic chance of beating the hoary old sea-dogs, renowned explorers and ex-navy officers already signed up for the race. No matter that preparing the boat involves raising further finance from the same major creditor who was already breathing down Crowhurst's neck (you do have to wonder what *he* was thinking, don't you). No matter that there is no time to have the boat properly finished, let alone thoroughly ocean-trialled.And thereafter a perfect, inevitable, tragedy unfolds. Crowhurst is carried by events, some of his own making, to prosecute a plan it is plain, even to him, is madness. But events and circumstances spur him on. A BBC film crew is following him. A rather over-excited publicist inflates expectations. Before he knows it, Crowhurst is off the coast of Portugal in a slow, leaking, malfunctioning, poorly provisioned boat, fearing for his life if he should go on, and for his solvency and marriage should he not. He realises there his no hope of success, but is compellingly obliged to soldier on, stiff upper lip, and makes the hasty and fatal decision to exaggerate his progress. From that point on, fortune's wheel is set.The ironies and twists of fate which thereafter play out and force events to their sorry conclusion are so cruel that one can hardly blame Crowhurst for reneging on a lifetime's atheism and laying his plight at the hands of a malicious (and game-playing) God. The saddest irony of all was the last: Crowhurst, never intending to do anything but come in a respectable but uninteresting last, announces (to add some drama!), that he is closing on the last remaining competitor who, in panic, redoubles his efforts to coax his own damaged, worn out and jury-rigged boat faster, causing it to break up entirely and sink - leaving Crowhurst to win (if he arrives home at all) by default - the one thing he simply cannot afford to do.Tomalin and Hall's book, which came out within a year of the original event, is an expertly pieced-together and beautifully written forensic study of the whole awful saga, and charts sympathetically and extensively Crowhurst's descent into what they assume (plausibly enough to me) to have been a form of paranoid schizophrenia by the end of his life. The relation of Crowhurst's final plunge into the abyss, and his final burst of energy in recording his cosmic revelation is by turns dreadful and somehow uplifting: here is a hero going out in trueNietzscheanstyle with the psychology of the tragic poet: \\"Not so as to get rid of pity and terror ... but beyond pity and terror, to realise in oneself the eternal joy of becoming - that joy which also encompasses the joy in destruction\\"Olly Buxton"},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"In 1968, a London newspaper, inspired by recent feats of daring in the world of sailing, sponsored a contest that offered a trophy and large cash prize to the first person to successfully complete a solo, non-stop and unaided circumnavigation of the globe in a sailboat. This book is the morbidly fascinating story of one of the participants, Donald Crowhurst, a talented amateur sailor and electronics entrepreneur, who announced that he would build the world's most technologically advanced boat, including a first-of-its-kind on-board computer of his own design, and take the prize.While sailing buffs will like this book, the real meat of it is in the look at human nature that it provides. Like many entrepeneurs, Crowhurst was a bit of a blowhard who ended up departing just hours before the deadline in a boat that had never been tested and with which he was totally unfamiliar. Busy with race preparations, he never built, much less installed, the much-publicized computer. Feeling certain he could make up time as he became more familar with the craft, Crowhurst began to tell \\"little white lies\\" in his sporadic radio communications (remember, there was no GPS back then -- the yachtsmen were truly on their own).As his problems with the boat mounted, Crowhurst conceived an elaborate hoax to make the world believe he was on track to complete the race, maybe even win it all. For months he sailed around the South Atlantic, alone and increasingly desperate, monitoring radio communications about weather and constructing a fake ship's log and fake documentation that showed his supposed progress day-by-day. In the spring of 1969, when Crowhurst reestablished radio contact with his agent and family back in Britain, he learned a shocking truth. He was the only yachtsman still in the race. With all the others out of it, he had become a national celebrity, and a huge welcome was planned.At this point, the audacious hoax turned tragic. It appears from his journals that Crowhurst suffered a complete mental breakdown in the week that followed. It was too late to confess or backtrack on his claims without complete humiliation; yet as the winner and only man still in the race, he was sure to be exposed as a cheat. A few days after his last journal entry, Crowhurst's boat was found abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic by another ship. He had left all the evidence of his hoax neatly arranged for the world to find.Crowhurst is an unsympathetic character to read about, but by the end it was hard not to feel compassion in spite of everything he did. This book is much more than a reconstruction of his mysterious death. The authors invite the reader to think about the deficiencies in the heart and soul that lead human beings to lie and scheme, in spite of the inevitable disastrous results. Why is it so hard for people to be honest? And why is it these very people who lie and scheme who often attempt great things, while the honest people sit on the sidelines?Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \\"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark\\""},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"Towards the end, reading Crowhurst's last log entries, I worried that I myself might come unhinged.This is not a sailing book -- it is a detective story about what pressure and isolation can do to the human mind. The authors do a wonderful job of assembling and presenting the evidence.It doesn't matter at all that you know the complete story before you start (but if you don't want to know, simply skip the rest of this paragraph): A guy's marriage and business ventures are in shambles; he hoodwinks a town into building him a bad plywood trimaran for an around-the-world race; he gets scared and fakes everything by staying in the Atlantic and sailing in circles; he goes nuts and walks overboard.An amazing study of the human mind under pressure -- I commend the authors.This book will shake you up. The necessary antidote is \\"The Long Way\\" by Bernard Moitessier, a lyrical story about the same race by the man who was winning it, but was so raptured by the Deep that he forfeited the prize and just kept on sailing..."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This is my all-time favorite sailing book. The story is gripping, the writing is extraordinary and the reader really comes to care about the characters. Although we know how the story ends, we feel the tension as Crowhurst is swept away by the forces he himself set into motion, a prisoner of pride and publicity. I am thrilled to see this book re-issued."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"With the stubbornness of Ahab and reckless disregard for family and friends Donald Crowhurst signs his death warrant the moment he sets sail around the world. This well researched and superbly presented true story serves as a lesson for all of us: Only in the company of others can there be comfort, solace and truth. This is an unforgettable tale of how one man's failure to accomplish his dream led to insanity and self destruction. Yes, there is a hero , Mrs. Crowhurst. This is a very thoughtful, insightful book that leaves the reader wondering how he himself would have behaved under similar circumstances. Deserves highest rating."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"Throughly enjoyed this book.- mainly because it was written so soon after the event without the benefit of hindsight or the mind numbing span of past years. This certainly was a very strange voyage and the book gives insight into the man that took it and why he did what he did. While no one will ever know what really happened in the last few weeks, I feel that this book gives the most likely scenerio."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"I read this book many years ago and just re-read it last year. It is a chillingly mysterious story of a man driven by circumstance into a plan of deception that ended in an empty sailboat found floating in the Atlantic. It is almost like a story of morals. Mr. Crowhurst sets out to circumnavigate the globe in a sailboat race. Finding himself not up to the task he decides to \\"fake\\" his voyage and does a remarkable job of it - until, apparently, the strain of it all drives him insane.I found it a fascinating book, well done, well documented, and as thrilling as any fiction novel. In fact, I suspect that because it really did happen makes it a more compelling story. I am a fan of all sailing adventure books and this one has all the elements of a global sailboat race, plus the mystery of Mr. Crowhurst's last days of life."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"First review (which will be plainly obvious).Watch the documentary: [...]Then read the book. Then become obsessed with this story as I have been for several years. The greatest stories are often the saddest, and Mr. Crowhurst, an unknown anti-hero outside the UK, defines and possesses that intangible drive in all of us. What separates him from us is blind faith.Would you risk everything? Your family's security? Your life? Your sanity? He did.Read this book.I did thrice."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This is a fascinating true story. Stories about a lone man fighting against the odds...man against man, man against nature...or, in this case, against his own failures, can make one think about one's own weak grasp on reality. This story ranks right up there with \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" I seriously think the story of Donald Crowhurst should be made into a movie."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"A page turner. Well written story about a rather unusual fellow who created a fantastic ruse."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"After Sir. Frances Chickister's one stop around the world solo voyage the next logical step was to go around the world solo without stoping.Donald Crowhust was one man who risked everything is a poorly designed boat to be the first to acomplish this goal. The choices he makes once he realizes he is not going to be able to make it are though provoking. First, you wonder why he has made the choices he has, then you wonder what you would do in the same situation.It is the effects of these desisions and the effect they have on Donald as well as his fellow competitors that keep the reader tied up in the story. It also makes you ask &quot;Could he have pulled it off?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"The story was interesting but in too much detail. I would have liked to seen more followup on what happened after his boat was found."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"Hmm...I was on the fence about this book to begin with. I got it thinking it was the story of some heroic maritime feat, only to find it was about a colossal HOAX. However, I followed each small decision until Crowhurst had maneuvered himself into a situation from which there was no way out: suicide...ruin...or death? A documentary has been made about the same subject, called Deep Water. It's not much good as a stand-alone DVD, but is a good addition to the book. I ended up being pretty fascinated by the whole affair."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"The other reviews said it all. Great book. I like the true-life adventure genre, and this one is near the top of the list. Crowhurst really lost it at the end. Wow.If you liked this book, you might try Adrift, by Steve Calahan."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"I made it half way through this book, hoping it was an exciting or at least intriguing mystery. Unfortunately, the first half of the book was mostly about the building of the boat. Although for sailors this may be interesting and definitely needed to be told as it led up to events, I would have preferred to jump right into the mystery/disappearance and then worked back though events that led to the ending.It did not keep my interest enough to finish the book, so I gave the copy to my brother who IS a sailor."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"A superb read! I couldn't put it down. A tragic and fascinating examination of Donald Crowhurst's downward spiral into madness. It may be helpful to read A Voyage for Madmen first as it documents the complete race and details the other sailors competing as well. This has become one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This is a classic study of a psychologically broken man drawn into fraud by his emotional needs. It's also a sea story and a detective story in one. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates yachting, human weakness, and mysterious happenings."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"Through the authors Donald Crowhurst has left a tragic legacy for his family and a powerful gift for us the readers. Through his logs Donald documented his fallibilities and revealed his decision path. We are able to armchair quarterback, speculate how we might have done things differently and learn.The illusion of our own grandeur is revealed through this book. We can be smug about our own approaches and look at the trials and misadventures of others with superiority. However, lurking in the corner is the bit of Donald that seeks our moment of glory. Donald identified and removed the constraints to his validation and too late he realized it was a one way ticket.This was/is tragic for his family and their bubble was burst very early on. They had no illusions left.Kudos for Sir Robin Knox for donating his prize to the family.Deep Water, the video is a must see companion to this book."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This is a must-read classic for any armchair sailor or adventurer. It tells the story of one of nine entrants in the first around-the-world sailing race, Donald Crowhurst, who perpetuated one of the great hoaxes of the 20th century before mysteriouly disappearing. Jonathan Raban, Fellow of the Royal Social of Literature (among his many accolades)writes in the introduction, \\"I've been reading the Strange Last Voyage every year for more than twenty years, and with each further reading, the Crowhurst story deepends and darkens, gaining in power as the world it records slides further into the past.\\" Written by two journalists just a couple of years after the 1968 events, it is meticulously researched and brilliantly written. The result is a singulary moving, amazing, and haunting story. It transcends genre to become a genuine human tragedy. I envy those reading it for the first time."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"I was led to this book through \\"A Voyage for Madmen\\". This book looks at the same Golden Globe race but focuses practically solely on Donald's trip. It gives you actual pages from his log and takes you all the way up to his last minutes. This book kept me really interested. It shows you Donalds trip from sanity to insanity and all in bewteen. It goes in depth on how he faked his progress and what he actually did. If you like sailing or psychology or you want to read some of the philosophy of a man on the brink on insanity, this is a great read. It kept me up all night and it has changed the way I think of solo circumnavigations."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This race and Donald's actions are the reason that solo nonstop sailing around the world has been changed to point to point racing. Isolation from one's human companions can lead to maddness. If only Donald's racing competators had been able to hold their boats together we might never have heard of Donald himself and pieced together what he did.This book while horrible in its result is a great read. Its an interesting change from Sir Francis Chichester's &quot;Gypy Moth Circles the world&quot; and J. Solcums book, where men are tough and survive the ocean through forsight and careful sailing."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"I saw the movie \\"Deep Water\\" and watched it repeatedly as I became fascinated with the story. I then read \\"A Voyage for Madmen\\" which gives an excellent account of the race as a whole. Wanting to know still more I purchased this book and I liked the fact that it answered many of the questions I had that the movie could not. I recommend watching the movie first as it portrays Donald Crowhurst as some sort of victim of circumstances. After reading the book I was convinced that he just an incredibly self-centered and irresponsible person who could not keep any of the good jobs he had because he only wanted to do what he wanted and not take orders from anyone else. The same goes for his attempt at sailing around the world. He is presented in the movie as being someone who was just trying to make a better life for his family, but after reading the book, the reader sees it was all about him being the center of attention. Being a father myself, I do not know how a man could leave his wife to care for four children with no money coming in while he sails around for several months.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in this story or sailing in general."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"It is difficult to imagine the impetus to sponsor a race for a one man solo voyage around the world in a sailboat. It captures the imagination much as a Stephen King novel would. The darkness, loneliness, and monotony would seem to be too much for any rational person to navigate through. The real question is not \\"why did Donald Crowhurst decend into madness, but why didn't the other contestants, as well.Although Crowhurst's youth is sketchily depicted, the author does an excellent job of recreating his voyage and route. As the end comes, he provides incisive analysis of the insane rantings of his journal.In a time when extreme sports have become the norm, this sport may be the most extreme ever. To sail for months at a time, alone, with no human contact, it is almost unimaginable to surmise anyone could maintain a semblence of sanity.Crowhurst is a somewhat sympathetic protagonist. A man of massive drive and focus, who seemingly could succeeed in almost any endeavor, huge questions resound. Why would he leave his four young children and a wife he deeply loved to leave on a dangerous journey in a small boat for several months? If he knew the dangers of a craft that was not thoroughly created for quality control, why did he embark?The author seems to grasp the complexity of Crowhurst's cheating, and ultimately his guilt that helped drive him to madness. He seems to understand much of Crowhurst' character.It is, indeed, a strange voyage, into the seas, and into madness. It is a unique story, and one begging to be told well. In this, the author mostly succeeds."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"This book pieces together one of the most fascinating hoaxes in modern history. The authors not only use their own knowledge of sailing and that of Donald Crowhurst. But they delve into his past and deduce the turn of events that led to the ultimate conclusion of the hoax. The inciteful writing and use of original log books are instrumental in weaving this fast and engrossing story."},{"Title":"The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst","review":"Being a sailor, I love these books, and I can pretty much tell if everything they say is fact or fiction.

I hope they continue to update with even more info from the current season."},{"Title":"Friends: The One about the #1 Sitcom","review":"I checked this book out at a local store before plunking out my cash for it... and decided it was completely not worth it. It's nothing but a lot of trivia questions that are a) insulting to a true fan or b) too obscure for a casual viewer to know. I expected behind-the-scenes stories and trivia, not this thrown-together mishmash.The only thing halfway worth getting the book for is the essay written by the man who plays Gunther (can't think of his name right now).So unless you're a huge Gunther fan (or an obsessed 'gotta have all merchandise' Friends fan), don't bother."},{"Title":"After Prohibition: An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century","review":"Politicians (especially of the conservative stripe) have long sought to frame the drug war debate as between those who condemn drug use (Drug Czars like William Bennett) and those who advocate drug use (counterculture gurus like the late Timothy Leary). This book reframes the debate and makes the sensible point that drug use may be unhealthy and unwise, but it does not follow that a person who uses drugs should be branded a \\"criminal\\" and sent to Leaveworth.This book is better than some of the posted reviews would suggest. Constitutional experts explain in layman's terms how the drug war undermines the Bill of Rights, federalism, and civil liberties. Governor Gary Johnson, Republican of New Mexico, has the guts to not only admit to his own past drug use, but to speak candidly about how the drug war makes everything worse, not better. Almost all other politicians engage in endless blather about how \\"we need to protect kids\\" (as if anyone opposed to the war wants harm to come to the children). Best of all, police officers step forward to attest that their experience confirms that the drug war should be ended.If you are looking for a scientific book on how marijuana and cocaine affect the brain, yes, you need to look elsewhere. But if you want a readable critique of current policy, this is a good primer."},{"Title":"After Prohibition: An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century","review":"\\"After Prohibition\\" is based on a Cato Institute conference of the same title and contains twelve essays by Cato employees, academics, drug-policy experts, and government officials, as well as a foreword by Milton Friedman. The central figure of the conference and the book is the Republican governor of New Mexico, Gary Johnson, who has been a vocal critic of current drug policy......The book presents a critique of drug policy that is accessible to a wide audience. The essays are informative and emotive, peppered with references to the popular press and to law reviews. They tell a variety of horror stories about the drug war. I found the section on the Constitution-containing articles by Roger Pilon, Steven Duke, and David Kopel-to be the strongest. Readers with a sense of justice and reverence for the Constitution will be disgusted by the convincing evidence of the existence of a Nazi-like police state in America, complete with tactics borrowed from Senator McCarthy and FBI Director Hoover......\\"After Prohibition\\" is a disappointing book on at least two accounts. First, because it contains nothing new in terms of research and science, it will probably not inform drug-policy specialists, and even the nonspecialist will not be enlightened to a significant degree. The book reports that the war on drugs has failed, that the Constitution is dead, and that a military-style police state is taking over the country, and it trots out convincing evidence in support of those claims......Second, the book's title is misleading. Very little of the book deals with what happens after prohibition. The various authors bring up the issue of what happens to the quantity of drugs consumed, but only in a superficial way, and they reach no conclusions. The book focuses not on the future, but on issues related to the escalation of the U.S. government's war on drugs over the last twenty-five years......The subtitle, \\"An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century,\\" is likewise misleading. Although some new approaches to prohibition are introduced, nowhere in the book is an approach to future drug policies developed in any detail. The \\"adult approach\\" might refer to the necessity of maintaining prohibition for minors, a position held throughout the book. This position gives the reader the mistaken impression that although drug prohibition for adults has been a massive and tragic failure, drug prohibition for minors would be perfectly acceptable and successful..."},{"Title":"After Prohibition: An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century","review":"&quot;After Prohibition&quot; contains several papers given at a conference on &quot;Beyond Prohibition: An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century&quot;, held at the Cato Institute in 1999. Most of the papers purport the libertarian viewpoint that the War on Drugs should be stopped. The papers follows a threefold argumentation against drug prohibition: the War on Drugs raises multiple constitutional and civil rights issues, the War on Drugs is a failure and can not be won, the War on Drugs has negative political and social effects.I found the papers on the &quot;Constitution and the Drug War&quot; convincing and very readable, especially David Kopel's article on the militarization of law enforcement and Steven Duke's arguments against asset forfeiture laws (who said law is dry matter?). The papers on &quot;Political and Social Effects of the Drug War&quot; are the weakest; there is a plea against mandatory minimums for drug offenses and an article about collateral damage of the drug war, that mostly rehashes arguments against the drug war in previous chapters. I would like to have read more about the impact of the War on Drugs on life in inner city neighborhoods (gangs) and racial relationships (racial profiling) and on the impact of mass incarceration on the society.This book is also long on criticism and short on remedy. It is more a political pamphlet than a well-balanced scientific policy analysis. It is one thing to say that the War on Drugs should end, it is something enterily different to devise an alternative drug policy that works for the society and does not have huge negative side effects. This book does not really address how alternative drug policies should look like and what the impact of these policies might be on the society. Can we legalize drugs and still keep demand for drugs under control and limit dangers to public health? It also does not analyse alternative drug policies as used in foreign countries as the Netherlands and Switzerland (it only shortly mentions them). Because it does not present well worked out alternatives this book will not convince drug war proponents and people who fear that decriminalization or legalization of drugs will lead to a massive increase in drug addiction. So I am afraid that this book will only convince the already converted."},{"Title":"After Prohibition: An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century","review":"After Prohibition makes the excellent argument against the U.S Government's Un-Constitutional War on Drugs. Experts like former Governor of New Mexico Gary E. Johnson(A strong contender for the 2012 Republican Presidential Nomination) make the economic and moral case for ending a War that currently imprisons well over 1.5 million members of the U.S Population, most of whom are minorities.This book clearly illustrates that we can end this war against personal consumption choices, and still teach our children how to stay away from destructive substances such as Heroin and Methamphetamine."},{"Title":"After Prohibition: An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century","review":"My wife and I both read this book over 6 years ago and feel it is a great place to start if you want to educate yourself on the actual issues that govern \\"the drug problem;\\" if you are already well-versed on the subject, you will not find much here that will excite you.Personally, I felt that this book is balanced and does a good job of intimating the complexity of the topic to the reader and brings to light subtleties that get lost in the shouting matches that are typically indicative of the disucussion at hand.Rarely are issues simple; reading this book will help the uninitiated realize that this is one of the most complicated issues of our time."},{"Title":"After Prohibition: An Adult Approach to Drug Policies in the 21st Century","review":"After Prohibition provides an analysis and probe of drug policies in the 21st century, considering the national war on drugs and the current failure of drug prohibition policies.

I would have liked to have learned a bit more about the Plymouth colony, but I had the impression that Ms. Williams considered Plymouth to be somewhat of a backwater to the real action in Boston. This book did definitely fill in my knowledge about the 50-odd years after Plymouth. We tend to just think of the initial landings and exploration, but several times Ms. Williams points out that boatloads of people were arriving constantly at Boston, so that the population of Massachussetts by the 1640's was about 15,000. It's also interesting that once the Civil War started in England, and Charles was no longer making life unbearable for Puritans, the emmigration to the new world dropped rapidly. Her treatment of the build-up to the Civil War is useful, but seemed to hit the highlights, rather than going a little deeper. Some contemporaneous quotes, akin to Ken Burns documentary on the American Civil War, would have added much. It was also interesting that some of the first graduates of Harvard returned to England to fight with Parliament in the Civil War. George Downing of Downing Street in London was in Harvards first graduating class (p. 168-169)."},{"Title":"Wag the Dog: A Novel","review":"In its first iteration, Larry Beinhart's satirical novel based on the underlying events that led up to the first Gulf War was titled American Hero. The popular movie, loosely based on the book, was titled Wag the Dog. Now, ten years after its first release, the book has been re-published by Nations Books using the title from the film.Wag the Dog opens with Jim Baker, advisor to the first President Bush, visiting the dying Lee Atwater, the architect of the Bush victory over Michael Dukakis and a brilliant campaign strategist who was never constrained by ethical considerations. Atwater gives Baker a letter that contains a strategy to save the sagging Bush presidency before the next election. Baker shares the letter and the strategy with the President: a made for television war. Top Hollywood director John Lincoln Beagle is recruited to direct this extravaganza that will be poured into American homes in glorious red, white, blue.Of course, Beagle's involvement in this project is one of the most carefully guarded secrets in America. His agent puts out the story that he is ill and unavailable. Movie star Meggie Krebs, expecting to be featured in Beagle's next film, suddenly finds that she has been dumped. In an effort to build a breach of contract case, Maggie entices Joe Broz, a security firm consultant, away from his firm to help her gather information. When a former Beagle assistant is murdered, Maggie and Broz realize more is going on than just the avoidance of litigation. Enter the usual suspects: the CIA, the FBI, the military, and assorted contractors and their employees who are directed by high administration officials.Wag the Dog is an intelligently conceived and skillfully written book. It is a very humorous, engaging read. And although a decade has passed since its first publication, it has as much relevancy and bite as it did when it first appeared. It is an important work of political satire that should be ranked with Animal Farm, Brave New World, and 1984. You will be entertained by the story and disquieted by the fact that our political \\"reality\\" has gone beyond the fictive world that some of our most imaginative writers can create."},{"Title":"Wag the Dog: A Novel","review":"I was disappointed reading this after watching the movie.

It is sometimes eloquent, but seems to just describe the human experience of falling in love, without drawing any interesting conclusions or making any hypotheses. I kept waiting for something to make me think or go &quot;aha!&quot;. But after a few chapters I found myself wondering what the point of the book was, and getting bored as it drags on describing.Its style is also not my style, launching into a lot of description without enough examples. Those examples that are used are from literature and bible stories, which to me seem to further separate the book from reality. I would have been much more intrigued by stories or examples of real people.Maybe I missed something, but I just didn't see where it was going, and got too bored to continue."},{"Title":"Dreams of Love and Fateful Encounters: The Power of Romantic Passion","review":"Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this book, but I found it so boring I could not get into it.

I have been unable to put it down -- it's like a life-changing gift to my mind -- because of its highly intelligent, thourough writing, and the depth with which the author approaches the subject of love, and humanity in general.This engaging book validates the importance of romantic love, whether lasting or fleeting, and discusses the fascinating intricacies involved in feelings that accompany love as it begins, evolves and ends -- and it does it with a mixture of warmth and wisdom, like no other book I have ever read (and I read a lot on this subject).The writing is clear and well organized -- you know immediately that the author is a brilliant, highly cultured person -- not some shallow pop icon/TV personality, or a mediocre therpaist who has no knowledge of other disciplines. I would've loved to be Person's student.She shares her vast knowledge with us in a way that leaves us much richer than before. Her examples of various love stories are not boring at all (as one of the reviewers stated) -- they are drawn from high class literature and films, and from the history of human civilization -- they are timeless.With all due respect, I think that the readers who did not appreciate this book must have very short attention spans and could not lift themselves to the level of this book."},{"Title":"Dreams of Love and Fateful Encounters: The Power of Romantic Passion","review":"What are the TWO [yes, there are ONLY 2] things that kill love?Ethel Person tells you --1. loss of idealization [you stop making what is good about \\"The Other\\" GREAT...and you start making what is bad about the other HORRIBLE]2. failures of empathy...

Love is an emotion, an experience, a human need, a concept...easily accessible and easily shared, intellectually and/or experientially/emotionally...for some. For so many though, questions and confusion remain, and this book I think at least touches on the majority of the types of questions my patients ask me, and does so adeptly--puts human fears, passions, desires...for intimate connection, acceptance and knowing...into words beautifully, clearly. Covers a range of topics, including why is it that we \\"feel\\" love, or insist that we \\"know\\" love, when it develops; what exactly IS love; different love relationships, including an interesting section on triangular love. Intellectually and philosophically stimulating. Written by an esteemed east coast psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, this book does excellent justice to the profession.

Francis Parkman is considered by many scholars to be the greatest American historian ever. &quot;Montcalm and Wolfe&quot; is his masterpiece, written in 1884 as the final volume of his multi-volume work &quot;France and England in North America.&quot; It tells the story of the French and Indian War, which is probably the most historically decisive war ever fought on the North American continent. Parkman writes with precision, eloquence, and objectivity. With his vivid and fast paced narrative, he demonstrates a wonderful flair dramatizing history. At the same time, his tremendous knowledge about this vast and complex subject is evident on every page. For me, the most fascinating parts of this book were the chapters which described the conflict for Acadia, and the ultimate forced evacuation of the Acadians by the British; Braddock's defeat; and the battles of Louisbourg and Quebec. Parkman's descriptions of these key events, and the personalities behind them, make them seem to come alive.Parkman writes in the romantic style popular in the late nineteenth century; yet, his prose is of such high quality that it never seems dated. In fact, as I was reading, I found it difficult to remember that &quot;Montcalm and Wolfe&quot; was written 116 years ago! I highly recommend this book, which is already a timeless classic, as essential reading for those interested in learning more about the French and Indian War."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Francis Parkman (1823-1893) was the first great American historian and today the most prestigious award in the field bears his name. \\"Montcalm and Wolfe\\" represents volumes six and seven of his celebrated study on the Anglo-French conflict in North America. This book is more than an excellent history of a seminal but largely forgotten conflict; it is nothing less than a work of literary art and very much a piece of American history itself.Even if you have little interest in the Seven Years' War or the colonial-era in general, Parkman's writing alone is reason enough to put \\"Montcalm and Wolfe\\" on your reading list. Here is one notable, but by no means unusual, example of Parkman's narrative abilities, which describes the journey of colonial troops through the marshes around Lake Oneida in upstate New York in 1755:\\"Thither the bateaux were dragged on sledges and launched on the dark and tortuous stream, which, fed by a decoction of forest leaves that oozed from the marshy shores, crept in shadow through depths of foliage, with only a belt of illumined sky gleaming between the jagged tree-tops. Tall and lean with straining towards the light, their rough, gaunt stems trickling with perpetual damps, stood on either hand the silent hosts of the forest. The skeletons of their dead, barkless, blanched and shattered, strewed the mudbanks and shallows; others lay submerged, like bones of drowned mammoths, thrusting lank, white limbs above the sullen water; and great trees, entire as yet, were flung by age or storms athwart the current - a bristling barricade of matted boughs.\\"Parkman's descriptions of Braddock's defeat on the Monongahela, the eviction of the Acadians, the siege of Louisbourg and the Battle of Quebec, to name just a few, are so vivid and intense that the images are seared into the reader's mind. I had read about these events several times before, often by skilled historians, but reading Parkman is like being there.Parkman's work is built on exhaustive primary research and his extensive quotes from the personal letters of the leading figures on both sides of the conflict are fascinating and illuminating. That said, his history is hardly objective. To begin with, he is unabashedly Anti-Catholic. With the exception of the nurse-nuns at Quebec, everyone associated with the Church in Canada is described as completely venal and manipulative. In fact, he attributes much of the war - especially the barbarity of the French-Indian allies - to the actions of local priests, who in turn received tacit support from Versailles. He also wears his anglophilia on his sleeve. He spends much time and effort defending the British actions in displacing the entire Catholic population of Acadia in 1755: it was the priests that fostered opposition to allegiance to King George II; the British actions in Acadia went above-and-beyond to ensure the protection of religious freedom among the Acadians; all the British asked was neutrality; the Acadians themselves are described as simpletons easily manipulated by the French and priests; English settlers didn't appear in Acadia for five years \\"proving\\" that the British weren't motivated by a land grab; etc.One of the more interesting aspects of this non-PC approach is the portrayal of the Native-Americans on both sides. Nearly all contemporary histories go out of their way, it seems, to take the rough edges off of Indian warfare and the result of raids on the frontier. Parkman describes the tribes and their acts in graphic detail: scalping, torture, cannibalism, slavery, etc. The reader gets a palpable sense of the fear an Indian war whoop must have instilled in colonists who no doubt had heard the stories of what happened to those sorry souls that fell into Indian hands.Finally, there are two basic types of characters in Parkman's writing: good guys and bad guys. The former includes, above all, Montcalm and Wolfe, but also Lord Howe, Roger and his \\"Rangers,\\" and one other French general, Levi. The latter group is led by the French Governor-General Vaudreiul and the knaves that supplied New France (especially Bigot and Pean) and represented by General Abercromby on the British side (he actually defends Braddock).In short, \\"Montcalm and Wolfe\\" is like reading history written by Saul Bellow. It is one of the most important history books ever written in the English language and easily a classic of American military history."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Parkman's Montcalm and Wolfe is more than history, it's American Literature. His prose flows elegantly and distinguishly across each page. The reader can definitely tell that Parkman was most passionate about this work, he spent most of his life researching and writing it. The care and attention he gave to the work shows. Granted this is probably not the best book for a high school student on the French and Indian war, but for someone who has read and enjoys to read history this is definitely worth a go."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"This is one of the earliest books on the French and Indian War, and it still is a great read. While excellent in its own right, it forms the final and arguably the best volume in a series on the French in North America by Parkman. A lot of work and analysis has taken place since this was written, so something like Fred Anderson's &quot;Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America&quot;, (also a great book) is very useful for bring the facts up to date. However Parkman provides a great window into the 18th century from the 19th, he provides detail without being boring, and makes it accessible and real."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Francis Parkman was a master storyteller. The French and Indian War is often seen simply as a precursor to the American Revolution. Simply put, Parkman illuminates this conflict between England, France, Prussia, Russia, etc. and more specifically between England and France for control of North America as the pivotal conflict of the 18th century. It truly was the first global conflict, the consequences of which are masterfully explained.Parkman deftly describes the political manuevering of the English and French in order to win Native American allies. With respect to Native Americans, Parkman is not often kind. They are often described as 'savages' or 'barbarians' in reference to atrocities committed during the course of the war. Parkman often does not give as much attention to atrocities committed by the European powers, especially the English. However, Parkman did not have the lens of modern political correctness through which to view such behavior. It was a different time and Parkman should not be condemned for the prejudices of his time.The descriptions of the natural beauty of the wilderness in which this conflict raged are timeless. One almost feels as if they are on the scene when Howe's army set off down Lake George to attack Montcalm at Ticonderoga. The mental picture one gets from Parkman's descriptions is absolutely vivid! Battle descriptions are just as exciting with detailed descriptions of troop movements and fighting techniques of the Europeans, Native Americans, and New England and Canadian militias.The book is well annotated and meticulously documents all sources used during its preparation. The appendices contain many curious stories of individual soldiers and politicians.In all, this was a great read. Anyone interested in learning about this momentous conflict that eventually resulted in the destruction of French and English colonialism in North America and the birth of the United States should start with Montcalm and Wolfe."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"The French and Indian War was a theatre of conflict that was part of the true FIRST WORLD WAR, it is a shame the historians seem to forget that. Francis Parkman does not. He is a classic author that gives a brilliant detailed account of the French and Indian War. The battles, politics both in Europe and North America and major players in the war are brought to life in this classic work. A must read for anyone interested in colonial North America."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Parkman &quot;wrote the book&quot; on the French and Indian War and created a benchmark for historians that has stood on its merits since published in 1884. Moreover, Parkman creates a primer on making history real and exciting for the reader. His writing style bridges the century since he wrote it. This book is one of seven in Parkman's series &quot;The French and English in North America&quot;. Each volume was intended to stand alone. This, the final and most popular volume, covers the fall of Quebec and events leading up to it. The first chapter alone, &quot;The Combatents&quot; does an extraordinary job of setting the scene in Europe that led to this savage wilderness war in North America. Also of interest will be the foreword which paints a vivid picture of the unusual Mr. Parkman. &quot;Montcalm and Wolfe&quot; reads well, provides a sense of &quot;being there&quot; and must be one of the great histories not only of the battle for North America, but of European history as well."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"As has been said, Montcalm and Wolfe is Parkman's masterpiece. It was the first thourough account of the French and Indian War and contains some of the most detailed descriptions of the people, places, and events that shaped the North American theater of the first truly global conflict. Here we encounter the dramatic events which lead toward the final confrontation for dominion over the continent. We see a young Virginia Colonel named George Washington leading troops into battle for the first time at Fort Necessity, Braddock's fateful campiagn along the Monogahela, the massacres at Fort Oswego and William Henry by the Indians under Montcalm, the fall of Fort Dusquene, and finally, the culmination of many long and bloody battles, the capture of Quebec and the almost romanticized deaths of Montcalm and Wolfe at the Plains of Abraham. What is truly interesting is that we see the war through the eyes of someone still living in a time when the Indian wars of the west were still being fought and when the country was in the grip of Manifest Destiny and, as a result, Parkman is often very harsh in his views of the Indians and their &quot;savage&quot; ways. Yet, even so, he often gives them more credit than most of his contemporaries.It is unforunate that today so little is taught or learned about this important event in American history. Today, it seems that the French and Indian War is all but ignored save for being mentioned as a prelude to the American Revolution which it helped spawn rather than as the major turning point in the history of North America and the world. For it is this bloody conflict, fought in the unending wilderness of America, where French regulars and courer de bois crept through the dark woods alongside painted Huron and Ottawa warriors to attack the English settlements, and young redcoated soliders marched shoulder to shoulder to their horrific deaths by rifle ball and tomahawk, that gave birth to what would become the Untied States and changed the course of world history. But even more than that, it is a fascinating period of history more powerful than any piece of fiction. This is history of the highest order. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"I was impressed by the work and analysis that Francis Parkman gave to the French-Indian War and the background of the war between England and France that spilled over to the North American continent. The background of the conflict was very interesting and I learned some points about it that I hadn't known before. Not only does Parkman give detail about the struggle in the present day United States, but also the struggle for Canada. The jealousy and rivalry between England and France was enourmous and in its path alot of victims were made such as the Native Americans and English and French Colonists. Two cultures that were very similiar, yet could not exist peacefully with each other, even across the Atlantic. The British may have won this war but their troubles were only beginning in America. This book was written over a century ago, yet it's language by the author and text make it a very interesting read and is considered a classic. Very Highly Recommended to all who want to know more about the history of Colonial North America."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"A wonderful history of the French and Indian War. Every once in a while Parkman seems to slant his story telling in a manner of his beliefs, but then, what author doesn't? Also, after reading many, many books on this time period, I have found that not all books agree on all points. Whether the others or Parkman is inaccurate, I do not know. In any case, for the price of this book, you are getting a bargain. For that matter, at any price it would be worth reading. For anyone interested in this time period, this is a book they will want to read. Even people who don't enjoy history could read this book as a novel and find it worth the reading. This is a book I am glad I didn't miss."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"this is one of the best histories that i have ever read. i own the hardback and wanted to have the kindle version for easy travel reading. he brought life to this most important conflict on the plains of abraham. i particularly enjoyed it as we were on a cruise that brought us to quebec city and to the plains of abraham. the events seem more immediate as america was a young country still. his english is elegant without the pomposity that often afflicts professional historians."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"This is my favorite historical nonfiction book, a work of genius in my estimation. After two readings, I can recommend it to anyone interested in the story of North America, including the prelude to the establishment of the USA."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"\\"Montcalm and Wolfe\\" is the preeminent history of the French & Indian War to be written in the 1800s. Recent research has added to our knowledge, but for the most part Parkman's work remains trustworthy. It is especially valuable for those who want to see if he might be the source for the opinions of others.One criticism of this book, which is a matter of opinion more than of fact, is that Parkman takes the side of the English too much to be considered objective. In my view, he is clear enough when it is that he is stating facts and when he is expressing his own prejudices, that this is not a defect in the work as a whole. Simply put, care must be taken to distinguish the two.The format and typography are unfortunate. The text is clear enough, but it betrays its origins as a transcription (by typewriter) rather than a photoreprint. Nevertheless, this book is a \\"must\\" for the serious student of the French & Indian War; and this transcribed edition makes it affordable."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Although a bit tedious at times, Francis Parkman gathers all facts leading up to the climax at the Plains of Abraham."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"beautifully written and about a fascinating time in American history when the French were vying with the English to build alliances with the native Americans to scalp--and, yes, even eat--their opponents in the wilds of Lake Champlain and Fort Duquesne, today's Pittsburg"},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"While this book is a classic in American history it does not compare to modern histories. While Parkman selectively uses his evidence and omits key details the prose is very good. Overall though this book should not be used due to the inaccuracies. He also omits the contributions of the Indians which was a decisive factor in the war. See either Crucible of War, Empires at war or The Scratch of a Pen."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"As literature, its as good as historical writing gets. As history, its racist to the bone."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Montcalm and Wolfe ought to be read (at least parts of it) by every American citizen. The chapter on the political game of propaganda played over the territory of Acadia is extremely relevant to alert people to listen for the actual intentions behind today's political declarations. The book also instructs us about the mindset behind some of the later tragic injustices the Anglo-Americans did to the American Indians. Beyond these, Parkman recreates a time and people usually lost to us in America today. He does this with understanding gained through immaculate research in a prose that is precise and, in its cumulative effect, sublime. Anyone who loves Tolkien's ability to create a world will enjoy Parkman's ability to recreate what once existed. With history books like this, who needs fiction?"},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Parkman gave us a glimpse into both sides of the conflict known as the French and Indian war. The action centers on the two main opponents, Montcalm (France) and Wolfe (Great Britan). He writes about the problems faced by each of the generals both on and off the battlefields of North America. If you have an interest in the French and Indian war thi would be an excellent book to add to your list."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"This is the definitive book on the French and Indian War although there has been much scholarship and field work since the book was written over 100 years ago. The Da Capo paperback edition is probably the best one available because of the maps and illustrations included. It is notable since it is the only book in print which bears an image of Lord Howe, killed at the Battle of Trout Brook, the prelude to the Battle of Ticonderoga in July 1758. But in reading Parkman's work one is sickened by the accounting of savage brutalities on all sides. The Massacre of Ft. William Henry on Lake George, N.Y. is a gripping and sad account. One understands why the term &quot;savages&quot; was applied to the Indians. It should have also been applied to the Euros. Not an age I would care to live in. Today's re-enactors glorify the romance of what was largely a brutal era. Neat and clean toy soldiers. None of these modern anachronists would survive a moment in the Adirondack forest and swamp lands of the 1750s. Ah, but a Wellsian time machine would be a wonderful tool for venturing back and visit for a day. Be alongside Howe, before his death, and imagine what could have been at Fort Ti had he lived. Wonder if these young men, now dead, had any idea of what nation would spring from the bloody soil. But just a day..."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"This is history as it was meant to be written: romantic prose without glibness, attention to detail without scholarly pendantry. Unfortunately Parkman's 19th cent. perspective makes him untouchable by today's politically correct educational establishment. They might indeed be horrified to find his writing balanced and relatively free from bias.This is the last of 7 books Parkman wrote on the struggle for N.America between the French, English and First Nations. As such it is the climax and culmination of an epic adventure. Parkman writes history the way renaissance craftsmen moulded sculpture; often incurring great agony to deliver a masterpiece. Parkman battled with many mental ailments including severe depression. That he completed these works is a testament to tenacity, that they are enduring works of superior, first hand research and prose is a testament to his genius.Of course, there are shortcomings. Parkman is least sympathetic with the French, who as a descendent of Puritanism abhors their catholicism. This may seem abundantly clear in his assessment of the expulsion of acadians. But whatever opprobrium the British deserve the duplicity and corruption the Quebec authorities is equally as culpable for their fate.Parkman's strengths far outweigh his weaknesses and I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone as a jumping point for learning about the early history of N. America."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"History as it should be written. Francis Parkman recounts exactly what happened during the Seven Years War in America, or the French and Indian War, as most of us refer to it. He does not wallow in the whiny, hand wringing, pseudo-scholarship of today's politically correct crowd. His prose sings with a lyricism so utterly lacking in the leaden efforts of today's academic historians. If you want to learn about the French and Indian War, look no further than this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Despite having been first published in 1884, Montcalm and Wolfe is still among the most informative books on the subject of the French and Indian war and by and far the most entertaining and least boring available unlike some works recently published.Highly informative. A joy to read. Pleasant reading for those interested in the subject or just plain interested in reading a good book."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"Parkman portrays a very well researched and detailed account of one least known wars of history of the American colonies. The colonial policies of both the French and English in the new world are analyzed in detail and and correlated with subsequent events during the period of the war. The French absolutist and centralized style of rule vs. the more decentralized and democratic (not quite as democratic as after the Revolution) system of combining royal govonerships with elected assmeblies in the British colonies. He explains the inherent strengths and weakness' of both systems and where and when they were manifested during the war. The battle acounts are typical of 19th century historiography which relies mostly on individual accounts. This does not indicate a weakness in relaibity of the facts, but one has to keep in mind that a certain amount of exaggerations and colorfulness might exist. The best example is the portrayal of the Native Americans which are constantly referred to as savages and accused of excessive acts of violance, cannabalism and uncivility. The social and religious prejudice toward the indians of the colonist of the 18th century in relating these accounts as well as some remants of same kind attitude in the late 19th century (Parkman's time) might not be very palatable for one living in more PC and tolerant times. However, right or wrong it was dominant attitude the period. Also, the portrayal of individual combatants on each side of their opposites (both white and indian) does give a unique view into the savagry of colonial warfare compare to European warfare of the times. Parkman does an absolute great job in setting up scenary of untamed wilderness and how it effected the fighting and logistic conditions of both sides. One feels the plight of troops on the march on miles upon miles of broken ground and dense vegetation coverage which made every mile feel like 10 on the open fields of Europe. The uncertainty and fear felt by men fighting in the dense underbrush which one could not even see ones foe properly. The clash of European battlefield tactics and colonial forest fighting is felt the most in Braddock's defeat near Fort Duquesne. Here the martial might of old world meets the new, and it gives birth to a whole new style: a mixture which will be utilized throughout the rest of conflict and make it stand apart of the rest of fighting of the Seven Years War that encompassed the entire globe. In global matters, Parkman stresses the importance of control of the American colonies for next dominant naval power of the 19th century. He indicates that by alloting more resources to fight Fredrick on the continent, the French lost thier chance to rule the oceans and and empire comaprable to the British version in 19th century. He also belives that the ejection of the French from Canada created a ripe situation for the American War of Independence. As long as the French were a threat the British colonies needed the protection of the mother country. Also fighting the French brought the 13 British colonies closer than they had been before the war which helped to set stage for thier next united effort. In all, Parkman does good job portaying the diferent aspects of the French and Indian War. One complaint I had was lack of a good map for Wolfe's seige of Quebec, especially his route from Wolfe's Cove to the Fields of Abraham. Another was the lack of good map of French forts and settlemnts on the Great Lakes which were the key to thier holdings in the interior of continent."},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America)","review":"This edition is only the first volume of a two-part work.

I think that Parkman, with his book, has exposed in a precise, charming and, sometimes, amusing style one of the better period, in my opinion just of the American history. Every details is deeply puntualized, and some episodes, up to now just alluded into the books that I have red on the argument (very few here in Italy) are described in a detailed, almost pedantic way ; the traits related to all the personages are well delineated (into my mind I have really present who were MONTCALM and WOLFE, only reading as Parkman speaks about them).

He's the only one who seems to know how to get Photoshop running on all 8 cylinders at once. This is a good Q&amp;A book about what to do in all types of real life situations with Photoshop, often very simple concepts that seem revolutionary compared to the twirl-filter mentality of say, Deke McClelland (whose my 2nd favorite PS authority.

Artistically it is beautiful, mixing expressive and energetic line drawings with the occasional full-color painting quite effectively. The story mixes very comic elements (like the girls all fighting over who will have the dog sleep on their bed, while their harried nurse keeps getting up in the night as always) and elements of true poignancy, like when the dog is lost. We see Madeline in her window looking at the empty streets, sighing &quot;Oh Genevieve, where can you be? Genevieve, please come back to me.&quot; The direct, sad, but unsentimental tone of this moment is really moving. Overall, a most satisfying tale indeed, both in story and in art, with a happy ending that is sure to please."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"My sisters and I loved this book when we were small and I'm having fun reading this book to my little one. Poor Madeline, always ornery, never learning, falls into a river and a dog rescues her. It's very sweet to see how the girls fight over the dog but, when she gets out one night and returns, there was enough \\"hound to go around,\\" as the book says when dear Genevieve has a litter of puppies, one for each girl. This is a darling classic and quite worthy of the Caldecott Award it received."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"Madeline's Rescue is about a little girl named Madeline who lives in a shelter with 12 other girls. She was not afraid of anything until one day she fell in the water, and a dog jumped in and saved her. They decided to keep the dog and name it Genevieve. And the struggles in this story teach kids to stand up for what they believe in even if other people think that you are wrong. Its for kids about 3-7 because its just one of the many wonderful children's books that is a great bedtime story because it never gets old!"},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"If you were to walk up to the first person you met on the street and asked, \\"Are you familiar with the works of Mr. Ludwig Bemelmans?\\", you would probably get a funny stare. If, however, you were to walk up to another person on the street and said, \\"In an old house that was covered with vines lived twelve little girls in two straight lines\\", you might still get a funny stare but at least they might be familiar with darling \\"Madeline\\". Though its author hasn't received much interest over the years, the Madeline books have garnered a great deal of love from many members of the literary world. And of these, the only Caldecott winner was \\"Madeline's Rescue\\".Just as they do every day, the little girls attending a French boarding school (run by the pleasant nun Miss Clavel) take a walk across the Seine. On one day in particular, however, the feisty Madeline (who beyond her near drowning gets short shift in this book) falls into the river and nearly drowns. Thanks to a plucky mongrel nearby, Madeline lives and the dog is adopted by the school. To the dismay of the students, however, several trustees coming for an annual inspection are chagrined that such a dog (a mixed-breed undoubtedly) would be allowed to live in one of their schools. Genevieve (for such is the dog's name) is cruelly turned out into the streets and it's up to the girls to rescue their faithful pup.The book is ostensibly for children, but I suspect it is far more loved by Paris-adoring adults. As the little girls search for their doggy they walk about a variety of well known Parisien sights. Here they search amongst the patrons of the trendy Deux Magots. Yonder you can see them in a breathtaking search across Le Pere-Lachaise. I ask you, in what other picture book are you likely to see a full quote on Oscar Wilde's tomb (not to mention nods to Chopin, Moliere, Balzac, and more)? Bemelmans has a lovely lilting ear for his own prose as well. Just consider the line...\\"Miss Genevieve, noblest dog in France,You shall have your VEN-GE-ANCE!\\"You just can't beat it. On top of that are some wonderful illustrations. Though most of the book is black on white with yellow, there is always the occasional full page spread that is deftly colored in deep greens and dark blues. On the whole, there is much to love in this book. Beloved for more than fifty years now, it shall continue to be just as loved for centuries to come."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"By this third book in the series, readers know that Madeline is the smallest one of the twelve little girls in two straight lines who live in an old house in Paris that was covered with vines. They know that she is not afraid of mice and that \\"nobody knew so well, How to frighten Miss Clavel.\\" In fact, Ludwig Bemelmans accompanies those familiar words with a simplified version of the same scene accompanying the same words from the original story of \\"Madeline.\\" That is because things happen differently this time, as Madeline slips and falls into the river. \\"Poor Madeline would now be dead, But for a god, That kept its head.\\"\\"Madeline's Rescue\\" is actually more about Madeline's rescuer, the aforementioned dog that \\"dragged her safe from a watery grave.\\" Miss Clavel and the other girls take Madeline and the dog home, and when she turns out the light for the night, there is a fight among the girls as to where the dog should sleep. The dog proves to be clever and helpful and is named Genevieve (rhymes with \\"beef\\"). Things are happy for six months and then comes the day of the annual inspection by the trustees, and these wretched people declare that \\"DOGS AREN'T ALLOWED IN SCHOOL\\" and order Miss Clavel to get rid of \\"it.\\" They are also bigots (Genevieve is \\"of uncertain race\\") and they send Genevieve out into the world.This is where we learn that we were wrong about the title, because it is not about the rescue OF Madeline but the rescue BY Madeline, Miss Clavel, and the other girls. For it is Madeline who jumps on a chair and declares: \\"Miss Genevieve, noblest dog in France, You shall have your VEN-GE-ANCE!\\" This is the best part of the book, because this is where Bemelmans shows his characters searching high and low for their beloved dog in some of the landmark sites in Paris (including Le Pere Lachaise, the celebrated cemetery, where Bemelmans has worked in the final resting places of Oscar Wilde, Rossini, Bizet, Chopin, Sarah Bernardt, Honore Balzac, Hugo, Moliere, Heloise et Abelard, and many more).But we also love the way Bemelmans plays with his familiar storyline, because in the middle of the night when Miss Clavel turns on her light and says, \\"Something is not right,\\" she does it not once and not twice but three times this time around. So there is a happy ending and a happier ending. Actually a perfect ending given all of the fighting and the cutest drawing of the twelve little girls in two straight lines. As always, Bemelmans' childlike illustrations are captivating (and I see a touch of Thurber in his drawings of Genevieve). Any kid can draw a face with dot eyes and U-shaped mouths, and they have to appreciate that Bemelmans does not always color within the lines. But for me it is the full color illustrations of the sights of Paris that I like to look at and catch all of the details. I would love to have a pitcher book that just collects Bemelmans' Paris scenes, even without the rhyming text that is another part of what makes these stories enjoyable and classics of children's literature."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"Madeline's poetic style story continues the life of the charges of Miss Clavel, and especially Madeline, in the old house with vines in Paris. Miss Clavel, who is always so self-possessed has her one moment of total loss and confusion when Madeline falls into the river Seine. While Madeline struggles, a brave, homeless dog boldly rescues her. What follows are the &quot;true to life&quot; jealousies of the other little girls when Madeline adopts the dog and names her Genevive. The girls experiences with Genevive are always a hit with children and the adult who is a child at heart. This beautiful book is a past Caldecott winner!"},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"This is a wonderful story, with wonderful pictures. There are many reviews recapping the story, so I won't do so now. I will tell you that my daughter LOVES this story, and at the age of 2 had memorized every word on every page, and would \\"read\\" it to herself in her crib at night, imitating the voices that I had used when I read it to her. This story, along with all of the other original Madeline stories, should be a permanent addition to any little girl's book collection. It seems like a story that little boys would love as well, as does \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat\\". I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"I think that this book was a really great book for little kids, It tells how people can be scared of things that can happen. This book was a book that had a really nice lesson in it, and I think that it would most likley be a book that mothers, fathers, ect. can read together with their kids, and enjoy it at the same time. Madeline learned her lesson not to walk on the ledge of the bridge when she fell into the water and almost drowned. If it wasn't for the dog that saved her, she would of not lived! That is why I think that you should read this great book, and you will love it. This is an adventurous book, with lots of picture's and details. The dog who's name is Genevieve was a stray dog, and he was also the one who saved her. He soon after became her bestfriend. All the girls in the school all try to keep the dog from getting taken away from Madeline, even the nun that watched Madeline and the other girls sticked up for the dog. The inspectors came in and tried to take the dog away from the girls, and they were so upset. At the end, they got to keep the dog, and it was a very happy ending. When the author wrote this book, I think that he was thinking about the friendship that someone can have for an animal of any kind, or a person. This book shows alot of that. The kids will also love the surprise ending to the story, because I knoqw that I did. When I read the story, I could not put down the book, not even for one second. This was a great book, and I know that you will love it, and that is why you should get it."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"My 3-year-old-son LOVES Madeline books. This is one is definitely one of his favorites (and, I'll admit it, mine too).Of course Madeline is making Miss Clavel crazy by walking on the rail of the bridge (Since \\"no one knew so well, how to frighten Miss Clavel\\"). When she slips and falls into the river, a brave dog saves her. The girls name her Genevieve and she becomes part of their school. More antics follow, with adorable pictures and clever rhymes. I read the voices of the board of trustees in a fake French, Maurice Chevalier-like accent just for kicks."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"The Madeline series has fascinated children, especially little girls, for decades. Having watched my own children enjoy the books, Madeline's Rescue became my favorite to read to children and to enjoy myself. The book has a marvelous balance of story and outstanding illustrations that make it more complete than almost any other illustrated children's book.My wife and daughters love to quote the beginning of the Madeline books:&quot;In an old house in ParisThat was covered with vinesLived twelve little girlsIn two straight lines.. . .the smallest one was Madeline.&quot;What an engrossing beginning! Why an old house? Why two straight lines? What are the little girls doing there? Why are we focusing on the smallest? Your mind is filled with questions that cause you to want to race forward and learn more.This is a boarding school where the parents do not make an appearance in the story. So you are looking at the independent life of young girls.Madeline's Rescue is the second book in the series. You will probably enjoy the book more if you read Madeline first.One day while walking with the school, Madeline falls into the fast-moving Seine. If you have ever seen the river, you know it would be hard to rescue anyone from it without a boat. In this case, a brave dog saves Madeline. The girls take the dog home and name her Genevieve. They fight over who will sleep with her.All's well until the school's trustees come for their annual inspection. The trustees point out the rule, &quot;DOGS AREN'T ALLOWED IN SCHOOL.&quot; So Genevieve is put out. After the trustees leave, the girls are naturally upset and search all over Paris for her.But Genevieve returns on her own. Miss Clavel awakens in the middle of the night to find her outside. Then Miss Clavel is awakened again when the girls fight over Genevieve. Then, she is awakened a third time for a very nice surprise! You'll have to read the book to find out what it is.Most illustrated books don't hold up well in small paperback form. Madeline's Rescue is the exception. I recommend that you buy a large, library binding edition for home, and the paperback for travel.The illustrations won this book the 1954 Caldecott award for best illustrated children's book in that year. I am sure you will enjoy the bright splashes of color and inked outlines for the happy scenes, and the somber, cold tones for the sad times. If you've ever been in Paris during the wintry weather, the dull looking pages will remind you of those overcast, dull days.After you finish reading this book with your child, I suggest that you think about where else our connection with animals brings rewards in both directions. Obviously, this is true with other pets. But what about humble animals like the earthworm that make our gardens grow and look more beautiful? When we loosen the soil for the plants, we help prepare it for the earthworms too.Discover our natural heritage and obligations!"},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"Over ten years separate Ludwing Bemelmans's fabled children's book, \\"Madeline\\" (1939), from the second of what would be six Madeline tales, \\"Madeline's Rescue.\\" Initially published in a magazine in 1951, \\"Madeline's Rescue\\" was published in book form in 1953 and won the Caldecott Medal for the best American picture book for children in 1954. In addition to the bold and mischevous Madeline, this book features two other Bemelmans characters, the dog Genevieve and Lord Cucuface, the president of the board of trustees responsible for the \\"old house in Paris covered with vines.\\"As with so many little girls, Madeline has her own mind and only reluctantly listens and follows directions. On a walk with Miss Clavel and her 11 classmates, Madeline falls of a rail into the Seine River and is \\"dragged safe from a watery grave\\" by the heroics of Genevieve. The dog is adopted by the girls and becomes an adored pet. But during the annual inspection, Lord Cucuface shoos the dog away: \\"Go away and don't come back!\\"; to which the undaunted Madeline responds:\\"Lord Cucuface beware!/ Miss Genevieve, noblest dog in France,/You shall have your VEN-GE-ANCE!\\"After a search hither and yon through Paris, Genevieve reappears and the twelve little girls fight over her. Three times, Miss Clavel rises from her bed, exclaiming \\"Something is not Right!\\" But the story works out in the end.The illustrations in the book, in the spontaneous, sketchy yellow, black and white that became a \\"Madeline\\" trademark richly deserved the Caldecott medal, with portrayals of the pompous Cucuface, Madeline's solemn declaration, standing on a chair, of VEN-GE-ANCE, the panicked flights of Miss Clavel,and Genevieve and her relationship with the little girls.The original \\"Madline\\" and this first follow-up story remain for me the best of the Madeline tales. I have been having a lovely time with my four year old granddaughter reading these stories. Madeline, with her mischief and eclat, is among the characters in children's literature that can be enjoyed by youngsters and adults alike.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"Madeline's Rescue, with stories and pictures by Ludwig Bemelmans, is just one of the many adored Madeline books published before. The book having darling characters such as Ms.Clavel, Madeline, and Lord Cucuface is wonderful to read to children having their full-out attention with humorous situations that Madeline usually leaps herself into.As always, in the beginning, Madeline and her fellow orphans leave the house in Paris, \\"in two straight lines, in rain or shine.\\" The day takes a twist as Madeline falls into the Seine. But before Madeline met her fate, a dog came and saved her. The girls beg to keep the dog, and Ms.Clavel says its ok. They name it Genevieve. It acted almost as one of the girls. \\"She could sing and almost talk, and enjoyed their daily walk.\\" Although frowns come upon the little girls faces as the collection of trustees came for the annual inspection. They were not pleased with the dogs and shooed him away quickly. With bravery Madeline declares a search for the dog.The book keeps children's emotions high as Madeline is saved, but then the dog gets taken away. Its cute and I think even parents enjoy reading various Madeline books."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"There are several reviews of this book which explain the storyline.

The smallest one, was Madeline.\\" Madeline is a series that my sisters and I used to love reading. She was our hero. She was never afraid of anything and was willing to fight for everything she believed in. In Madeline's Rescue, she fell into a river and was saved by a dog they named Genevieve. The adventures that Madeline, the 11 other girls, and Miss Clavel faced with Genevieve is entertaining for children to discover.

Those books are now considered classics in children's literature, having collected many awards.In this Madeline adventure, Madeline's fearlessness lands her in trouble, when she falls into the river. But, when she is rescued by a courageous little dog, it is the start of an adventure for all of the girls!This is another great Madeline story. I liked the gentle rhyming of the story, and my little reader liked the girls and their interacting with the dog. So, let's just say that this book is a classic of children's literature for a reason! My little one and I both highly recommend this great book."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"As a child I had always been a big fan of the adventures of Madeline. I especially enjoyed this story because I love dogs and this particular story touched me at a very small age. Madeline is a very adventurous little girl who doesn't let anything get in the way of what she believes is the right thing to do. It is an innocent book that can help a young child to become more outgoing and take risk in order to achieve what they would like out of life. It is a fun and silly book to read to a child. Even reading it as an adult I found myself laughing out loud at the little things the characters do and say in the story. I would definitely recommend reading this book to any child whether they are or aren't already animal lovers."},{"Title":"MADELINE'S RESCUE","review":"Can someone please post and let me know if this includes the book?

Madeline's Rescue. New York: Viking Press, 1953. One day, Madeline, the smallest and most daring girl in a French boarding school, falls in the river and a dog, Miss Genevieve, comes to her rescue. Each girl in the school adores Miss Genevieve when she comes to live with the girls. The headmasters unfortunately find the dog in the girls' room during an inspection and Miss Genevieve must leave. After a long search for the dog with no results, the girls return home disappointed, and to their surprise, Genevieve shows up with a new litter of puppies for the girls to share. The whole book intrigues and keeps attention because of the way Bemelmans has designed the images and pictures. The book itself relies on the illustrations that accompany the text. Starting with the title page, the title shown in large letters at the top of the page. The author and illustrator's names appear smaller at the bottom of the page. The first and last pages of the book show a picture of the girls' school in a frame, as if we were looking in from the outside. The frame around the outside focuses attention on the center of the page. Bemelmans uses yellow backgrounds with people and objects drawn in black outlines for of the book. Yellow contrasts well with the black used in the outlines, and this makes yellow a good bright background color. A couple of the pages have other brighter colors. These pages have darker, deep blues and reds. They are used for the sad times in the story, like when Madeline falls in the river and is sick and when the girls are looking for the lost dog. One full-page picture in the book centers on a part of the story when Madeline jokingly, falls in the river, and the dog first comes to her rescue. The whole story actually begins at this exciting event. The words and their placement in the book also have an important position in the story. All the words run along the bottoms of the page, where the eyes naturally read. The sentences all flow together because of their placement. The story does not become choppy, as if the words jumped all over the pages. Also, the words rhyme, which makes the story more fun and natural to read. At one point in the story, the words do not rhyme: at the introduction of Miss Genevieve. Maybe the author is trying to point out the introduction of another main character. The reader should realize that special attention should be brought to this detail. All together, the words and illustrations in the book work together to make a natural, flowing, fun story.

Of course, Miss Clavel allows the girls to keep the dog, and when Lord Cucuface inspects their house, it's goodbye dog, yet the girls search Paris until they find the dog. Unfortunately, an all-out war with pillows and brooms between the girls erupt: they each want the dog for their own.

Short is the book that I remember beginning the long string of books look at popular culture artifacts for their spiritual value. You can find similar volumes on everything from Harry Potter and the Simpson to Tony Soprano and ESPN, so it is not surprising that a volume has come out looking at &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&quot; Jana Reiss has a masters of divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary to go with a Ph.D. in religion from Columbia University and is the religion book review editor at &quot;Publisher's Weekly.&quot; She is also a fan of Buffy, although she also likes Giles and Spike, so it is not surprising that she would decide to pursue the spiritual, religious, and mythological ideas of the television series.For me the pivotal episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; in terms of the religious implications was &quot;Amends,&quot; the third season episode written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon in which Angel is tormented by apparitions of three of his victims, including Jenny Calendar, which are really manifestations of the First. Just before dawn Buffy finds Angel on a bluff overlooking Sunnydale, waiting for sunrise so that he can die and have peace. Buffy pleads and then lashes out in anger at Angel, but before the sun can rise it starts to snow. The sun will not shine in Sunnydale that day because of the freak snowstorm. Before this episode was over I was pointing out that Whedon had just worked God into the Buffyverse. After all, who else could make it snow besides God?Well, now we know the answer would be the Powers That Be, which are certainly god-like beings, but not the Judeo-Christian creator. Yet given that Buffy usually wears a cross that burns vampires when it comes into contact with them (e.g., &quot;Angel&quot;) and that holy water burns vampires too (e.g., &quot;Helpless&quot;), it seems strange to ignore the implications of Christianity for &quot;BtVS.&quot; After all, Willow Rosenberg often talks about the fact that she is Jewish, which at least gets you in the theological ballpark.But where Riess wants to make the connection between Buffy and Christianity are the show's elements of apocalypse and sacrifice as well as those of redemption and resurrection. After all, Buffy, the &quot;Savior in a Micro-Mini,&quot; has been resurrected twice, in &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot; and &quot;Bargaining, Part I,&quot; and that is a hard parallel to ignore. Besides, Riess is also interested in exploring the need for humor in fighting spiritual battles, so this is not a book that is focused on scriptural analysis. Yes, there are Bible verses in this book, but Giles the Watcher is quoted a lot more than the apostle Paul, and you will also get great thoughts from the Buddha, Sophocles, William Shakespeare, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson as well.&quot;What Would Buffy Do?&quot; has three main sections. The first deals with issues of Personal Spirituality and the reader's own spiritual journey: (1) Be a Hero Even When You'd Rather Go to the Mall: The Power of Self-Sacrifice; (2) Changes Make Us Human: Embracing the River of Change; (3) Death is Our Gift: What Death Can Teach Us About Living; (4) &quot;The Anger Gives You Fire&quot;: Can Negative Emotions Be Constructive?; and (5) The &quot;Monster Sarcasm Rally&quot;: Humor as Power. The lessons here have to do with embracing change as a spiritual teacher and balancing emotions.The second section, Companions on the Journey, expands to look at relationships with families, friends, and mentors: (6) &quot;What Can't We Face If We're Together?&quot;: The Power of Friendship; (7) Obey Your Teacher, Except When He's Wrong: Spiritual Mentors on the Path to Maturity&quot;; and (8) The Higher Way: Choosing Forgiveness over Revenge.&quot; The final section, Saving the World, looks at the biggest issue of a social engaged spirituality: (9) What Goes Around Comes Around: Consequences; (10) The Monster Inside: Taming the Darkness Within Ourselves; and (11) &quot;Redemption Is Hard&quot;: Personal Deliverance in the Buffyverse,&quot; which focuses on the fates of Angel, Faith, and Spike.What I like about this book is that it is grounded in analysis of the episodes of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; to a lesser extent. When Whedon created Buffy the idea was to flip the stereotype of the blonde girl falling victim to the monster when she walks down the ally, but the subtext of the television version of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was the simple reality that &quot;high school is hell.&quot; That idea was expanded to include college in particular and life in general, but that fundamental idea becomes the best foundation Riess has for making the case for Buffy's spirituality. In the end her point is that the message of &quot;BtVS&quot; is that although it is great for us to have our own quests and spiritual journeys such things are meaningless unless they are in the service of others.I am not troubled by how Riess tries to speak to the Buffy faithful as well as the neophytes who come late to the party. The back of this volume includes A Guide to Buffy's Seven Seasons, which looks at each season thematically as well as chronologically, and a Buffy Character Guide arranged season by season, which explains the characters rather than just describing them. There is also an interview with Eliza Dushku (Riess interviewed the actresses' mother, Judy Dushku, for her undergraduate thesis many years ago).There have been several academic looks at &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; in the last couple of years, from a look at &quot;Slayer Slang&quot; to approaching the series from a philosophical perspective. &quot;What Would Buffy Do?&quot; has the virtue of being one of the more accessible books attempting to find great meaning in the series. The appeal here will be for fans who always knew that Buffy mattered to their lives and can now understanding how its ethics and morality come into play even if you are not out there saving the world (a lot)."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"It can be a little embarrassing to admit just how many books and articles you have read about the television show, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\\" If you try to put your enthusiasm into words, people look at you funny. Unless they are one of the lucky ones who have actually seen the show, and then their eyes light up with glee, just like yours. I have read quite a bit about Buffy (but not as much as Jana Riess.) I've certainly read the big three collections of academic essays about the show. \\"What Would Buffy Do?\\" is easily the best volume I've come across. It's an instant classic, a small gem of popular culture criticism.Riess's approach is eclectic, like that of Joseph Campbell. She draws her analysis from all sorts of places: scripture, novels, drama, philosophy, are various religious traditions. Although she depends mostly on Christianity and Buddhism. Anyone who is skeptical that a \\"mere\\" TV show can sustain this kind of scrutiny will soon be convinced otherwise by Riess's intelligent, crystal-clear prose and thinking. (This book is a lot of fun to read, unlike some of the other post-modernist essays in the previously mentioned academic collections. They made my little head hurt.) There's an original interview with actress Eliza Dushku, who plays the dirty-girl slayer, Faith. She talks candidly about her experiences working on the show, and her Mormon background.As one critic put it, \\"Buffy\\" is the most religious show on TV, a \\"secular universe saturated with grace.\\" This book moves from a description of the slayer's personal spirituality, to a consideration of the spirituality of the \\"Scooby Gang\\", to an examination of what could be called the show's prophetic themes: saving the world and deliverance from evil. This is a book about pop culture, but it's not \\"pop\\" religion. Riess writes seriously and responsibly about eternal subjects. There are chapter length examinations of Buffy as a self-sacrificing savior; death as a gift (a catchphrase all too familiar to Buffyphiles); the power of friendship; and the necessity of going through negative emotions.It is in the last three chapters that Riess treats Buffy's \\"prophetic calling.\\" She writes:\\"Buffy is a Christ figure, but only insofar as she is constantly averting the apocalypse through self-sacrifice. On Buffy, people atone for their own sins. Redemption is hard work and it us up to us. Redemption is a process requiring action; words are no enough. There's no salvation by grace in the Buffyverse. Angel and other characters find salvation only in work, self-sacrifice, and courageous choices.\\" (pages 119-121, ellipses removed.)Although a little later Riess does point out that an \\"unthinkable act of grace\\" does occur on Christmas Day, in the episode \\"Amends.\\"Riess is also very good on \\"the Monster inside\\"; that is, the dark part of ourselves we need to acknowledge, and own. (Yes, Jung gets mentioned here a lot.) The very dark and controversial Season Six (which Riess loved, and so do I) was about the Scoobies facing up to their own evil.\\"Buffy is all about confronting our dark sides and learning to live comfortably--or at least co-exist nonviolently--with our monster selves. Many people would rather deny their dark shadow, pretend it isn't there. But ignoring it entirely, according to the show, is a dangerous as allowing it to rule our lives. As Willow learns she doesn't have to be a bigger, badder badass than the source of all badness. She needs to control the darkness so it does not control her. In the end she discovers that it's enough just to be Willow, with all of her complexiities, all of her darkness, and her much stonger goodness.\\" (pages 117-118)This is as workable and humane a defintion of \\"repentance\\" as I've ever encountered.Well, I could go on and on about this wonderful book about a wonderful show, but I won't. All I can say is that Riess in this book sorts through all sorts of spiritual odds and ends and finds what is good and beautiful."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"I picked this up in good humor, being a Buffy fan. But once I started reading it, I discovered all the philosophies and psychologies it draws on, and how these characters, plotlines, stories, and conflicts really do reflect our own lives. I was literally crying at some chapters that hit home -- about self-sacrifice, about love and friendship, about humor being a valuable weapon. I loved the show from thw beginning. This book makes me appreciate its power all the more.The book details trials, tribulations, and metaphors that the characters of the show go through every day. The ability to distinguish true good from evil, to stand by your friends, to know when to back down and when to keep going ... these are all incredibly powerful and important life lessons. It doesn't matter that the subjects of the book are a bunch of characters from a fictional television show. This is what philosophy is about. And I couldn't be happier to see that the wonderful creations of Joss Whedon are being used as examples. I'm a writer myself, so I can understand how fictional characters can teach such powerful lessons about who we are. After all, we created them."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"Riess has written a book that has not only the humor of the television series she studies, but its concern for moral complexity and refusal to be doctrinaire as well. Riess's goal is not to demonstrate how Buffy adheres to any single spiritual tradition, but to examine how the show explores universal spiritual and moral truths and concerns. Riess manages to respect both the show and the wisdom of the traditions she draws on (including Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and classical Greek philosophy), in chapters such as &quot;Be a Hero, Even When You'd Rather Go to the Mall: The Power of Self-Sacrifice,&quot; &quot;Obey Your Teacher, Except When He's Wrong: Spritual Mentors on the Path to Maturity,&quot; and &quot;The Higher Way: Choosing Forgiveness over Revenge.&quot;The book also contains a thoughtful guide to the characters, organized by the season in which they are introduced. I found this valuable both for the insightful analysis of the characters and for Riess's genuine and obvious affection for them. Rather than saying that Oz is &quot;Willow's deadpan boyfriend&quot; (a description I once read, and certainly accurate enough), Riess draws attention to his nobler qualities by calling him &quot;taciturn, wise, and kind.&quot; Anya is, according to Riess, &quot;full of contradictions: she is a jaded veteran of the demon world who exhibits childlike innocence and curiosity regarding her newly acquired humanity&quot;--an analysis that gave me a new way to look at a character who annoyed me endlessly. Although throughtout the book's main chapters, Riess assumes (justifiably, I think) that her audience is familiar with the show, the character guide at the end could help new fans understand and keep track of the show's many characters.My only complaint about the book is that it lacks an index. Perhaps the majority of readers would not mind this omission, but Riess's excellent examination will no doubt be of use to the many scholars and academics who research and write about Buffy--and it would be even more useful with at least a basic index to the topics she discusses."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"***** Although Buffy Summers has taken an almost equal amount of flack as Harry Potter from the most conservative Christians, others have picked up on the ironically religious truths to be found in both her series and the spin off, Angel. Among those enlightened beings is Jana Riess, and she has shared her findings in this snappy, easy to read book. Divided into logical sections that expand outward from the individual, to community, to world, the author uses Buffy to make spiritual truths clear. Many of the lessons could be applied to other fictional settings, such as Tolkien, yet, Buffy has an edge that might not be found in other works. This book will appeal to all ages, and perhaps serve as a bridge. The slant is mostly Christian, but the Christianity is not presented in a way that looks down on other faiths. For those Bible students who look for \\"aha\\" moments in their studies, \\"What would Buffy Do?\\" has many. If a Youth leader is looking for a new tool to interest a bored Sunday School class, they would not be making a mistake in picking up a baker's dozen of this book. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"If you like Buffy than you will love this book.

Some people complain that there is no &quot;God&quot; in the show but as you read on you will be surprized how ethical and spiritual the show really was/is.The only bad part of this book is you need to have seen the shows to be able to follow it. Non-Buffy watchers would be really confused and maybe frustated because they would not understand what is being said.

(And particularly unnecessary, I might add, considering I can't imagine non-fans would buy the book, and the index includes a rundown of every season and characters.) I know what Angel's curse is and the meaning of vengeance, and some of the very basic and almost childishly imparted philosophy included can't help but come off as annoying in it simplicity. Vengeance and anger-leads-to-hate cliches are all over the book, and the constant back-and-forth of the discussions (first season, then fifth, then a parallel to second) page after page becomes downright dizzying in parts. The book suffers heavily from a lack of focus in its narrative -its chapter titles are about the only clear and concise thing about it, and, again, I felt the author was able to hide under summaries of Buffy episodes and pale, thinly drawn parallels instead of creating any real analysis. I found myself scrolling past whole pages describing episodes in graphic detail, complete with quotes, before finding any commentary at all.To be honest, the whole book is rife with platitudes and well-known information delivered as something startling and new: when I read &quot;As Jesus told the crowd that had gathered around the adulterous woman in the New Testament, only the person who is without sin has the right to cast the first stone,&quot; my eyes glazed over. Later recapitulations include the threefold law of Wicca and Christian salvation. If I were 14, I might be enthralled. (Then again, maybe I'm just not a self-help spiritual book kind of gal.)In the end, the real problem with the book, I think, is less to do with the author and more to do with perception: so many people continue to look on Buffy, Joss Whedon, and a great deal of pop science fiction in general as something inferior to, say, Friends (which even Jana Riess takes time to take a pot shot at - p.96), and books are published that match those expectations. Like the Buffy novels, this is aimed at &quot;the average teenage&quot; - whoever that is.Still, there are a few parts I savored: the discussion of humor as a means of empowerment against evil, the interview with Eliza Dushku (Faith), and the author's occasional forays into nonspiritual discussions of the characters. But overall, even as hard-core a fan as myself wonders why I bought it, beyond the funny value, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"I found in reading this, i not only learned more in depthly about my favorite tv show, but i also learned about myself. Using the techniques used by the author to examine Buffy spiritually, i examined myself. This book was not only enjoyable, but also a learning experiance. By looking deeply into the roots of Buffy and using different religous principles, not only does Buffy make reference to these religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Wiccan among others) but,in part is these religions. Aspects of them all make thier way into the the show's inner most working, and Jana Riess guides you along as you explore how and why. It is my favorite Buffy book by far. It is worth way more than the price. Even non-viewers will profit. You will not be sorry!"},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"Yes. I am a Christian. I became semi addicted to Buffy and it took me a while to figure out why.The show has all the elements of actual feelings/growing/exploration that normal kids go through. Spirituality is all through the book. What I liked best is that Good always wins over Evil. There is redemption, there is hope, and there is always a new dawn, with renewed hopes and dreams, just like in real life, sans the vamps and demons.(Although they are here, among us, but in human form - human monsters). We can hold on to our faith and pray that we would have the judgement and perserverence that Buffy shows, thanks to Joss Whedon."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"If you have any questions about life, faith, etc. read this book. Buffy fans learned so much from her actions while watching and this author explains the emotions and spiritual conflicts behind the episodes so well. Changed my whole perspective and as Jana Reiss spends a whole chapter saying: Change is good. I don't feel so alone or scared of tomorrow. When things do get to me, I just think to myself, What would Buffy do?"},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"I honestly didn't have high expectations when I picked this one up, but I was pleasantly surprised by how insightful this book actually is. After learning that Jana Riess earned her Masters in Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary and her PhD in American Religious Studies at Columbia University, it made sense why this book is so engrossing and well~written. There are no mind~blowing concepts to speak of here, just an excellent analysis of the underlying themes of spiritual growth and theology found throughout the series. A season by season synopsis is also included for neophytes of the television series. If you are a fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Christian and/or Buddhist theological writings, or both, then I would highly recommend giving this one a read. Of all the Buffy related books out there (and I've read them all), this one was by far my favorite.* If you enjoy this book, you may also be interested to know that Jana Riess began a project of tweeting the Bible on October 4, 2009, with plans to cover all 1189 chapters, summarizing each one in 140 characters.

The show was a lot deeper than I noticed as a teenager. A lot of things to think about and try in this book."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"The title of WHAT WOULD BUFF DO?: THE VAMPIRE SLAYER AS SPIRITUAL GUIDE makes it obvious that the author is trying to do two things: first, she is going to discuss BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and its spin off ANGEL to a considerable extent and second, she is going to do this in such as way as to provide spiritual guidance. I give the book a five star rating, but I have to point out that it is based entirely on the way it succeeds in the first of these two tasks. I consider this to be the finest single-author analysis of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER that has yet been published, but I did not find it to be especially useful in the second of its goals, of providing spiritual guidance.Initially I read this book simply because I am a huge BUFFY and ANGEL fan, and am a bit of a completist: I'll read just about any halfway decent discussion of BUFFY. Because of the author's desire to make Buffy into a spiritual role model, I approached the book with considerable suspicion. (For the sake of honesty, I should point out that I do have two theological degrees and did extensive graduate work on the religious thought of Kierkegaard, and still consider myself to be that rarest of creatures, a politically and socially leftist Southern Baptist, so I'm not in the least antithetical to religious ideas.) However, as I started working through Jana Riess's discussions of the various characters in Buffy and some of the themes, I was astonished at how often I found myself in agreement with her, or how she would mention some aspect of the show and I would immediately call to mind another instance that was compatible with what she said, only to have her bring that specific instance up in her book.I think this book will delight any fan of BUFFY or ANGEL. Riess has a profound understanding of the show and really grasps the dynamics of all the major characters. I learned a great deal about many aspects of the show, and gained insights that I had previously missed. For instance, I had not recognized that Warren, one of the villainous nerds from Season Six, truly had become the super villains he admired in comic books. Or when I read \\"BUFFY is less about the cycle of one's own sin and salvation than it is about saving others; it is always outwardly, and not inwardly, focused,\\" I realized that that was precisely true about the show.I was far less convinced by the book's attempt to set Buffy up as a spiritual guide. Perhaps this was just me. My spiritual guides have been people like Kierkegaard, Henry David Thoreau, Montaigne, Wittgenstein, Dostoevsky, and Samuel Johnson. I have never profited much from popular spiritual writers, whether pseudo-intellectuals like Joseph Campbell or spiritual writers like Philip Yancey. They fail to speak to the kind of spiritual struggle that I have been engaged in. It may well be that others will find this part of the book more compelling, but I have to be honest and say that I do not believe that any part of the spiritual guide part of the book left any impact on me.Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book for any fan of BUFFY. The discussion of the show is as good as we have seen before, and the character and season guides at the back are absolutely superb. On top of all this, the book contains a marvelous interview the author conducted with Eliza Dushku, who played, of course, the rogue slayer Faith in both BUFFY and ANGEL."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit, especially since I was reading it while taking a women in religion class. Many of the topics addressed in this book were addressed in my class, and likewise, many class topics were in the book. However, I do not feel that this book incorporates enough mainstream world religion into its analyses. I feel that the majority of the book correctly analyzes themes of certain Buffy episodes, and includes some great quotes, but doesn't really discuss Buffy's relationship to already standing religions, or a new \\"buffy\\" religion.Basically, this book says \\"Christianity, buddhism, and hinduism all have these practices that let people be nice to each other. Buffy has these practices too, see?\\" This book wants us to be nice because Buffy was nice. That's all I got out of it. But it's entertaining and a worthwhile read for Buffy fans."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"Of course fans will really enjoy another look into the Buffyverse but I do feel this book goes deeper than that.The author takes her knowledge and pulls us on a journey into the development of the spirt as portrayed by our favorite Slayer.The book does read a bit like a thesis but iwas well worth a read. I especially liked the episdoe guides and quotes that she uses throughout the book. A must for fans and a might :) for anyone on their own spirtiual quest."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"This was a wonderful book. I was almost expecting it to be goofy or worse, christian-based. Instead, it took the lessons Buffy taught us and applied them to life. The author pulled a lot from buddhism, which in turn led me to begin studying buddhism and try to follow its guidelines. I was happily surprised with this study of the show."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"Buffy is so much cooler than jesus it's not even funny. If there was a fight between Buffy and Jesus, that would be totally sweet."},{"Title":"What Would Buffy Do: The Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide","review":"This is the most apalling thing I've ever seen! Please don't get me wrong, I adore Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I think the show has some good messages, but it also has some very bad ones. Buffy and the rest of the characters on the show were not created as spiritual paragons, but as realistic characters who make mistakes, sometimes on a grand scale. And even if that were not the case, anyone who bases their spirituality on a TV show needs to get up from their spot in front of the idiot box and figure out what's really important in life."},{"Title":"Free for the taking: The life-changing power of grace","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read on the radical, life-changing transformation that happens as we learn to receive the free gift of God's love and grace. The author knows from first hand experience the freedom that results when we give up our striving and just allow God to love us as we are. All of our efforts to change pale in comparison to simply receiving God's love and allowing Him to change us...because true love transforms us in the deepest recesses of our souls, in places that our own self-effort could never begin to touch."},{"Title":"Free for the taking: The life-changing power of grace","review":"I discovered this book years ago.

The bonus was that it was signed and dated by the author! I didn't expect or request this. To the content: My copy of this book sat on my bookshelf for 32 years until I just recently pulled it out. What a treasure! It explains the common mistakes Christians make after regeneration. Namely, failure to understand or even attempt discipleship. The Biblical remedy for this tragedy is written in clear, concise language anyone can apply to their Christian pilgrimage. At whatever point you are as a believer, this book gives clear and vital direction."},{"Title":"Free for the taking: The life-changing power of grace","review":"This book has been one of the major tools used by God to lift me out of the blackness of despair, a consequence of my life-long battle with depression; for the first 38 years unaccepted. My only regret is that the book is now out-of-print. In my role as a pastor/counselor I have recommended this book, as well as given many, many copies, to hundreds of individuals. Written by a man born on the foreign mission field, whose life's goal of missionary service was crushed after only two years on the field; he had to limp back to the States. He speaks from Biblical truth as well as personal experience. I am a biased reviewer, admitted, but this has been a most blessed tool in the Master's hand in my life."},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21. Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","review":"Chandler has done a magnificient job bringing the Khmer Rouge prison &quot;S-21&quot; into clear view.During the reign of the Khmer Rouge S-21 was used as the prison, interrogation center, and finally, the place of execution for several thousand Cambodians who were suspected of counter revolutionary activity.Chandler shows that the mania of the Khmer Rouge leadership could not differentiate between the truth and made up stories under torture. One example of this gross misconception of reality within in the minds of the Khmer Rouge leadership is the fact that people were thrown into S-21 and executed on grounds of counter revolutionary activity simply because they had broken farming equipment, thereby tried to hinder the outcome of the 4 year plan for the agricultural sector!Chandler also manages to draw interesting parallells between the Nazi KZs and Stalin's terror in the 1930's, and the Chinese cultural revolution in the 60's. He shows that some ingredients of terror are always there, no matter if it happens in Treblinka, Moscow, the country side of China, or in the killing fields of Cambodia.Chandler's book is more than just a story of an awful prison in Cambodia. It is about the mechanisms that make some humans commit unspeakable acts(apparently by their own free will) against their fellow human beings, simply because of a belief in a political ideology!A must read for people interested in the thoughts and methods behind the slaughter of millions of people in communist and faschist countries in the 20th century!"},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21. Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","review":"The title &quot;Voices from S-21&quot; suggests that Chandler's book will contain interviews/narrative from the prisoners held at the infamous Cambodian santebal. There is very little in the book detailing any one individual's personal experience (understandably, since only a handful survived). The book is extremely well-researched (45 of the total pages are footnotes) and I found it a dry read. Gets into theory of the prison's existence and why the interrogators carried out their orders with such detachment. However there is very little by way of firsthand accounts of what went on, if that's what you're expecting from the book."},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21. Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","review":"Prof. Chandler gives us a remarkably deep analysis of Pol Pot's secret prison S-21, which within the autogenocide of the Cambodian people stands out as a haunting symbol. It reflected the unlimited paranoia of Angkar and its schizophrenic regime that 'was at once terrified and terrifying, omnipotent and continually under threat'.All family members (women, children and BABIES) of the condemned were slaughtered. Only 7 of the 14000 inmates survived.As prof. Chandler remarks chillingly: 'a reign of terror and continuous revolution requires a continuous supply of enemies.'There were no limits. As one of the interrogators rightly asked: 'If Angkar arrests everybody, who will be left to make a revolution?'The same subject has been treated by Ben Kiernan in his book 'The Pol Pot regime'. But whereas Ben Kiernan sees racism as the main motive behind the murderous regime, prof. Chandler digs far deeper and concludes clinically that 'the real truth behind S-21 is to be found in ourselves'!Indeed, the S-21 experience is not unique in the 20th century with its Nazi camps, communist show trials, Indonesian, Rwandan and Bosnian mass killings, Argentinean tortures ...He remarks also that the Cambodian regime was an imported phenomenon. The Khmer leaders were all recruited and educated by the Stalinist French PC in the 1950s.This nearly unbearable book should be read as a reminder that 'ordinary people can commit demonic acts' (R. F. Lifton).David Chandler is not afraid to say 'how things really are' (L. Betzig).A terrifying book about a terrifying experience."},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21. Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","review":"David Chandler, a well-known historian of Cambodia, has penned a superb work. As an historian of Southeast Asia, I am acutely aware that most works on the region only appeal to a specialized audience. This work, limpidly written, is different. It is a powerful witness to one of the great disasters of the twentieth century: the deaths of approximately 1.7 million Cambodians under Khmer Rouge rule. The work draws on a wide range of scholarship, ranging from studies of the Holocaust to those on Stalin's terror. But what makes this work compelling is that Chandler zeroes in on one place -- S-21, or the infamous Tuol Sleng prison, where the Khmer Rouge interrogated, tortured, then killed suspected enemies of the state. Drawing on the mass of forced confessions recorded by the prison interrogators, this book takes us into the terror of Khmer Rouge rule. A powerful, disquieting book that will &quot;appeal,&quot; if that is the word, not simply to specialists on Cambodia but to a wide range of persons troubled by humankinds propensity to engage in acts of terror and brutality."},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21. Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","review":"An extraordinary view into the secret prison of the Democratic Kampuchean (DK) government of Cambodia (1975-79). This well researched book by a renowned historian provides the reader with an in-context look at the horrors of Pol Pot's regime and the consequences of his paranoia of \\"hidden enemies\\". Dr. Chandler's poignant use of confessions forced from unfortunate and often innocent victims paints a grizzly portrait of power without constraints. It mattered not that neither interrogators nor prisoners knew what crimes had been committed, it was merely enough they had been arrested and sent to S-21, therefore they were guilty. With their de facto \\"guilt\\" established, it was the interrogators job to obtain a proper confession of these unknown, but treasonous, crimes. With or without a confession, there was only one verdict-death. Dr. Chandler has woven extracts from these confessions, interviews from the hand full of S-21 survivors, prison workers, and senior DK cadre, including Pol Pot, and a comparative analysis of other similar atrocities from the 20th Century into a balanced, historically valid picture of the horrid activities that took place at S-21. This work will be useful text for any person interested in Southeast Asian history or human rights issues."},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21. Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","review":"S-21 -- an interrogation center where even the interrogators eventually fall prey to a mindless system of betrayal, false accusation, forced confession, torture and execution. A place where guilt or innocence is irrelevant to the task at hand. \\"Voices from S-21\\" is an in-depth study of extensive archives of S-21 \\"death confessions\\" interwoven with stunning interviews of surviving Khmer Rouge cadre who try to explain how and why they carried out the orders of the \\"Upper Brothers\\". David Chandler's meticulous research sets the stage for his thoughtful, scholarly, and compassionate analysis of this horrorific Cambodian tragedy, and places the brutal acts that occurred there in international historical perspective. With \\"Duch\\", the former S-21 commander, now in detention awaiting an agreement on an international tribunal on crimes against humanity during the Pol Pot regime, \\"Voices from S-21\\" is most timely, and will be an invaluable resource to human rights advocates around the world.This book served in some ways as an inspiration to Ysa Osman, a young Cambodian Muslim researcher at the Documentation Center of Cambodia, who in September 2002 published \\"Oukoubah - Justice for Cham Muslims under the DK Regime.\\" The author profiles 13 Cham Muslims who were held at S-21, including one of the most vicious interrogators on the staff who was eventually himself executed there. Using biographical material in their confessions, this ambitious reseacher tracked down surviving family members and neighbors for the full details of how each prisoner was arrested and an overview of DK genocide against Muslims. Highly recommended for readers of \\"Voices from S-21.\\"Updates -- The 2005 DVD version of Pan Rithy's film \\"S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine\\" is an equally brilliant look at S-21. Two surviving prisoners and numerous former KR cadre assigned at S-21 discuss the insanity and barbarity that once filled S-21 and the its associated killing field at Choeung Ek. The 2005 book \\"The Chain of Terror\\" by the impressive young scholar Meng Try Ea of the Documentation Center of Cambodia provides an inside look at the horrors of the KR Southwestern Zone's prison system."},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21. Terror and History in Pol Pot's Secret Prison.","review":"I bought this book while in Vietnam before travelling on to Cambodia. I knew I was going to visit Tuol Sleng (S21) and Choeung Ek (Killing Fields) in Phnom Penh, as well as the multitude of cultural fascinations in this war-ravaged and tortured country... I wanted to learn something about *why* the Khmer Rouge killed so many of their own people for no good reason. This book helped me grasp how it was done; how the Khmer Rouge thought: from the former peasant soldier, angry at the privileged upper classes of Phnom Penh; all the way up to the foreign-educated and pathologically paranoid Pol Pot (alliteration unintended!) and his upper echelon. Fascinating and horrifying history... but this book does not spend a lot of time going into the details of the torture and horribly inhumane treatment of the prisoners at Tuol Sleng. This allows a clinical approach to attempt to illuminate the psychology of Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge during that turbulent era, which encourages the reader to read on but does not haunt one with nightmares. Armed with some of the analysis in this book, I was able to detach a bit more and not absolutely lose it when I stood inside Tuol Sleng myself... Weeks after Cambodia, I finally finished the book, and am a better person for having done so, I believe."},{"Title":"VOICES FROM S-21.

An excellent book, with some aspects that put me off, though: blunt anticommunism, some assertions about Soviet, Chinese and Vietnamese leaders that are rather anecdotal than based on serious historic scholarship, and weird comparisons between the turturers at S-21 and psychoanalysts."},{"Title":"Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The U.S. Army and Nee-Me-Poo Crisis","review":"Over the years I've read a lot on the subject of the Indian Wars. However, it seems that many recent publications are just a re-hash of materials, from secondary sources, presented as a new thesis or from a new perspective. Nez Perce Summer is a notable exception. Greene has used a wealth of primary sources, many never used before, in order to turn up new information and call old notions into question.This is not a history of the Nez Perce, it is a military history of the campaign against them. While many these days prefer their Indian wars history from an Indian perspective, they should not be deterred from reading this work. This is a history of the military campaign, not a support of it. Indeed, one cannot come away from this without being amazed at how the Nez Perce continually stumped the most experienced Indian fighters of the time.The narrative is well-written, and Greene holds our attention as well as any fiction writer could. I highly recommend !this book to anyone--scholar or casual reader--interested in the study of the Indian Wars."},{"Title":"Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The U.S. Army and Nee-Me-Poo Crisis","review":"One word adequately describes this book-Superb! I have read other accounts of the Nez Perce conflict but none with this degree of detail. For example, other authors have skimmed over some of the smaller engagements of the campaign (such as Canyon Creek) but Greene gives this as well as other episodes the full treatment they deserve. In his introduction, Greene clearly states that he mainly relied on primary source material, using secondary sources for background only. This decision clearly paid off.Footnotes are used extensively to bring to the fore conflicting testimony as well as useful background information. All of this is augmented by excellent maps that illustrate the action. Greene avoids wasting the reader's time with moralizing sermons. He correctly portrays the military as simply trying to do the job thrust upon them by their civilian masters.Truly, the best parts of this work are the final chapters detailing the culminating conflict at Bear Paw Mountain. At last, I feel like I am on the way towards understanding this battle. I walked away from this book with new respect and understanding for Greene, the Nez Perce and the much-maligned frontier army."},{"Title":"Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The U.S. Army and Nee-Me-Poo Crisis","review":"In Nez Perce Summer 1877: The U.S. Army and the Nee-Me-Poo Crisis, research historian Jerome Green provides an informative, superbly researched, and wonderfully written account of the Nez Perce conflict with the larger white culture as represented by the U.S. Army. Green is one of those rare historians able to combine meticulous scholarship with a genuine flair for vividly drawn and engaging presented storytelling. Nez Perce Summer 1877 is ardently recommended reading for students of American frontier history in general, and Native American studies in particular."},{"Title":"Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The U.S. Army and Nee-Me-Poo Crisis","review":"Published in 2000, Jerome A. Greene's NEZ PERCE SUMMER, 1877 isn't the most recent work on the Nez Perce tragedy, but it does the best job of combining a detailed, blow-by-blow account with a larger overview of this enormously complex and panoramic event, which stretched over three and a half months in the summer of 1877 and constituted one of the saddest mass injustices in the history of the Indian Wars.Greene, who wrote the book under the aegis of the National Park Service--it's available online at their website, but I wouldn't recommend reading it that way--is especially good at explaining where things happened in relation to other things that were going on at the same time and what all the parties concerned were doing simultaneously-- an invaluable asset in an account of a military campaign. And his final chapter, \\"Consquences,\\" does a splendid job of drawing back and fairly and objectively evaluating the outcome and import of the campaign, not only for the Nez Perces but for the American army and also some of the individuals involved. (Which reminds me to say that the backnotes are often as interesting as the book itself.)There are other good books about the Nez Perce campaign, notably Bruce Hampton's more passionate and journalistic CHILDREN OF GRACE (1994), as well as Mark H. Brown's pathbreaking THE FLIGHT OF THE NEZ PERCE (1967); all three are highly readable. But if you have time for only one, it should probably be Greene's, since Brown's account has been superceded and Hampton's book, though it has many virtues, ultimately leaves you without the grand picture.In fact, my one major complaint about NEZ PERCE SUMMER, 1877 is that it doesn't provide a timeline (neither do the other two books). This would have helped enormously in getting a handle on the complicated, multi-layered events of the story, and while an author can be excused for failing to realize how important this is for his readers, his editor shouldn't be. Luckily, you can get a great timeline on the Internet, put together--very well, as far as I can see--by Montana schoolchildren! ([...])Aside from this flaw, NEZ PERCE SUMMER, 1877 is indispensable reading for anyone seeking to understand what it all meant."},{"Title":"Nez Perce Summer, 1877: The U.S. Army and Nee-Me-Poo Crisis","review":"Jerome Greene has written the standard for those studying the War of 1877. I am currently using this book as the master reference for my writings. I am very pleased with the List of References, and the Summary Appendix Listing the known Army and Tribesmen casualties; what's missing is the Civilians and Noncoms casualties. Through out, Mr. Greene maintained a neutral viewpoint, something that is absolutely necessary for a serious and worthwhile reference work.Mr. Greene is now to the Nez Perce War what Bruce Cotton was to the Civil War. It is the \\"master\\", to which all other work must be reviewed against. Incidentally, the famous author, Terry C. Johnston used a prerelease draft supplied by Jerome Greene as the basis for his novels on the first half of this conflict.I am very pleased with this book and I wish all the historical events making up the history of the American West had such a through, scholarly work summarizing the events and identifying those involved. It is something other scholars should think about; it sure makes research easy for a novel writer like me.Of course, no work can cover all the facts and neither does Mr. Greene's. Further research into the works of those actually involved would be the next level of detail, the serious students will go to.Mr. Greene's approach to a very complicated series of events, making up this Indian outbreak, was to discuss one subject at a time, while ignoring the others until that subject was complete, then take-up another and do the same. The result became a saw tooth of events that jumps the reader back and forth through history, none seemly related to the others. That is why I rated the work as I did. That aside, it's nothing a good set of notes can't correct.Nevertheless, this is an important work and a must copy for every library covering the history of the American West.Thank you Mr. Greene."},{"Title":"Semi-Markov Processes and Reliability (Statistics for Industry and Technology)","review":"The authors state in the preface to their book that their goal is to provide \\"a thorough approach to semi-Markov processes and their applications in reliability\\". This is an ambitious objective for a 222 page text, since a large body of research on Semi-Markov processes has developed over the course of the last forty years or so.In the opinion of this reviewer, Limnios & Oprisan never even come close to their grand objective. Their book is simply too short, too terse and too condensed to give a thorough treatment. The authors realized early on that they would need to reference the vast body of literature. It is strange to this reviewer that their treatment, copyright 2001, chooses as its main references out-of-print French texts by Neveu (1964) and Janssen (1969). The authors' choice of difficult-to-find auxiliary references makes their treatment that much less accessible.The prerequisite list here is extensive. The authors claim that all that is required is an understanding of Markov Chains, like you might find in Stroock'sAn Introduction to Markov Processesor Norris'Markov Chains. Furthermore, the authors claim to cover the following list of topics in the first 29 pages of their book (which comprises Chapter 1): measure theory, Laplace transforms and continuous-time Markov processes. In reality, Limnios & Oprisan introduce (barely) these and other topics including: stopping times, the Optional Stopping Theorem, stationary stochastic processes, martingale theory, Ergodic theory, strong Markov Processes and renewal processes.In order to get through the first chapter of Limnios & Oprisan, you'll need an excellent background in these topics. I recommend Rogers & Williams 800 page, two-volume setDiffusions, Markov Processes, and Martingales: Volume 1, FoundationsandDiffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales: Volume 2, It Calculus.Chapter 2 runs a mere 18 pages and purports to cover \\"Markov Renewal Processes\\". I stopped counting how many times the authors give references to out-of-print books in this chapter. I also lost count of the number of times the authors use the phrases \\"it is straightforward\\", \\"it is easy to show\\", or \\"it is well-known\\", in the context of mathematical problems having none of the above properties.This book is useful to the reader in one sense: it whets the appetite for an understanding of Semi-Markov Processes and Reliability Theory and puts this reviewer in the market for a well-written book on the topic."},{"Title":"Semi-Markov Processes and Reliability (Statistics for Industry and Technology)","review":"The previous reviewer is correct that this is a very concise book, and the authors' statement in the preface that the material is \\"within the reach of those who have had a first course in probability\\" is a wild exaggeration. In reality, a good prerequisite would be some familiarity with measure-theoretic probability (e.g., including Lebesgue-Stieltjes integration and things like the Borel-Cantelli lemma) plus an acquaintance with stochastic processes at the level of Ross'sStochastic Processes. The book does contain some excellent appendices summarizing prerequisite topics, but these would only be suitable as a review, not to learn the material. Nevertheless, for the mathematically prepared (or those willing to really put some time and effort into it) this is an excellent (probably the best available) compendium of modern research on semi-Markov processes as applied to reliability and survival analysis.Those more interested in applications and practical techniques for semi-Markov processes would findFlowgraph Models for Multistate Time-to-Event Data (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics)of interest, or the chapter on semi-Markov processes inFundamentals of Queueing Theory (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics).

It is a must read for the ones interested in his life as well as in his writings."},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"Don't buy unless you have an obsession for Steinbeck. Better to buy well-written biographies of J.S. or his first and last stories..."},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"Steinbeck left an autobiography of sorts when he died, a collection of personal letters to his friends. His widow and his friend worked together to gather the letters from everyone they could. They edited them for clarity and published them in chronological order.The result is the personal story of a very creative, complex writer who worked every day with his hands. When he wasn't writing novels using pencils and a legal pad, he was mending the fence or fixing the roof. He loved people as much as he loved solitude, so he began each day by reaching out with these letters to his friends around the world. He talked about his surroundings and his thoughts and his ongoing projects.All of this would be enough to make a wonderful book, but there's the added benefit of Steinbeck's writing style. Steinbeck used as few words as possible, always trying for a poetic effect without pretension. He wanted to be honest and accurate, but he knew the value of capturing an image or feeling with a colorful use of words. As a result, this massive book is a pleasure to read, from start to finish. Steinbeck's writing style keeps you interested but never overwhelmed.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed a few Steinbeck novels. Aspiring writers should read it, as well. When you're done, read the Steinbeck chapter in 'Alcohol and the Writer' and Jackson Benson's books on Steinbeck. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"An unbelievable recount of a man's life through his own eyes. I didn't think that a collection of letters would amount into a good read, but I was blown away by Steinbecks determinedly honest prose. The candor and focus that Steinbeck displays in his interaction with friends, family, and associates is outstanding. Steinbeck once again wields his magical touch and inspires thought and introspection without preaching. A truly great writer, and a truly great book. This collection takes you through Steinbecks journey from college dropout, to published author, to two time divorcee, to Pulitzer Prize winner. My only criticism is that there were too few moments of rage, anger and outburst, which is difficult to capture in letter form. However, it is a raw, honest, and unforgiving account of a man's walk through life, as it serves as inspiration for any aspiring writer out there. The ending letters are excellent, and it is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"How can a book of letters be as fascinating as a John McPhee book, as well-written as a Steinbeck novel, as educational as the Iowa Workshop, as well as being fun, witty, and never pretentious?

But perhaps &quot;write&quot; is the wrong term - &quot;think&quot; is better. Wow! can this man think. And then he is able to express those thoughts in a clear, eloquent and, most of all, honest way that is a treat to read.The book begins with a letter from the young, penniless author to a friend. At the time, Steinbeck was in isolation when he took a job as the winter caretaker of a lodge in Lake Tahoe. From there, he takes us along on a life journey through three marriages, financial success that always made him uncomfortable, fame that he often detested, Pulitzer and Nobel prizes, adventure in settings from the Sea of Cortez to Saigon.The insights are astounding. His lack of pretension in the midst of his success amazes.Here was a sensitive, often gruff but completely honest man who was not afraid to reveal himself in total to the friends he cherished."},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"John Steinbeck wrote his own autobiography without intending to.

As his third- wife the book's co- editor Elaine Steinbeck makes clear in her introduction Steinbeck was a life- long letter-writer. Steinbeck usually started his day writing letters to his friends, and business- associates. They were the warm-up for his real writing.Steinbeck speaks frequently in these letters of his love of writing. He writes with a refreshing frankness and directness. The book tells in no doubt an incomplete way the story of his struggle for literary success, of his three marriages, of his relation to his parents, children and a number of friends.Steinbeck seems in these letters a fundamentally decent, loyal , hardworking person. However one of the interesting elements in the letters is seeing how his relation to certain people, most notably his wives, changes in time. His first wife Carole in the early years is described and written about almost exclusively in superlatives. After his divorce from her he speaks about those years as ones in which each was angry at the other much of the time. His second wife, the mother of his children left him after five years, and his initial enthusiasm for her naturally cooled. Though he vowed not to marry again when he met Elaine SCott, who was then the wife of the actor Zachary Scott he found apparently the great love of his life. In one especially moving letter he will thank her for their life together and for her especially good relation to his two sons. Another exceptionally good letter is written to Elaine's daughter who is about to marry. His advice to her again shows him to be caring and non- conventionally wise.One especially notable set of letters are those he wrote to his lifelong friend Carlton A. Sheffeld( Duke). Another are those to his publisher Pascal (Pat)Covici.I have never been a special fan of Steinbeck, but reading these letters I have a sense I somehow did not fully appreciate his work. So these letters will probably move me to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"This 900-page tome contains rare insights into Steinbeck's life and his views on writing and the creative process. Well worth the time if one is interested in these subjects.The content is chiefly Steinbeck's letters; so he is the author, but editorial comments are carefully distributed throughout, along with occasional excerpts from related correspondence. This is a selection of correspondence initiated by Steinbeck, chosen and edited with loving care by Elaine, his third wife, and Robert Wallsten. This is the meat, the good stuff, including the intimacies he was willing to reveal to those closest to him.What has been left out is as important as what was included; therefore Elaine's bias must be taken into account. To the extent possible, what is revealed is the Steinbeck that she wanted remembered. For example, I expected something of the highly public flirtation of Carol, Steinbeck's first wife, with Joseph Campbell, and of Campbell's influence on Steinbeck's writing style. There was no mention of Campbell nor the affair, which I find highly dubious, given how painful the matter was.(John's revenge, an academic told me, was to model a character in SWEET THURSDAY after Campbell.)"},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"This is the only review I've ever written for Amazon, if that lends you an idea of how much I think about this book... This book is incredible. If you are a lover of Steinbeck, and/or if you are an aspiring writer, this book will feed both needs. The pages are an incredible view of Steinbeck's day-to-day life which reveal, not surprisingly, that his life was really so much more than day-to-day. While I enjoy his correspondence and the history presented in this book, what I appreciate more is the ability to really intimately understand how to come up with ideas and write well. I recently came across the page (as I'm not yet finished with the book) where Steinbeck and William Faulkner correspond via letter(s). I was so wooed by this that I simply sat and stared at the two names on the pages, together. If you enjoy the feeling you get when you read 'Grapes of Wrath' or 'As I Lay Dying,' please don't pass this book up. This would also be a MUST for any lover of Steinbeck. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Steinbeck: A life in letters","review":"John Steinbeck never wrote an autobiography, but his letters probably reveal more about the writer and the man than an autobiography could have hoped to.We have the time in which he lived to thank for the Steinbeck letters. For the art of spontaneous letter writing was on the wane and these letters are a good reminder of that great loss. Phone calls and emails are not very good substitutes, for while they do suffice the moment they don't sustain over time.John Steinbeck was everyman, suffered every weakness, stood up to every task, doubted his own talent, feared every beginning and grew with every experience.In one of his early letters he admitted his shortcomings when he was cornered by academia. He hated the idea of proper spelling and punctuation for a clean manuscript in his first draft. He said, \`I put my words down for a matter of memory. They are more made to be spoken than read. I have the instincts of a minstrel rather than those of a scrivener... when my sounds are in place, I can send them to a stenographer who knows his trade and he can slip the commas about until they sit comfortably and he can spell the words so that schoolteachers will not raise their eyebrow when they read them. There are millions of people who are good stenographers but there aren't so many thousand who can make as nice a sound as I can.'That letter should give heart to storytellers that are challenged in the ways of Steinbeck.Here's a scene written in 1936 that reoccurs throughout the book. He speaks of being scared to death, as usual, miserable, sick feeling of inadequacy as he begins a new work. But says he loves it once he gets down to work.He also has trepidations about dealing with death. In a letter to a friend that has just lost his mother Steinbeck shares a feeling of inadequacy that most of us feel when he says, \`there's nothing for the outsider to do except stand by and maybe indicate that the person involved is not so alone as the death always makes him think he is.'On April 29, 1948 he says he's about to embark on a marathon book about the Salinas Valley. \`It is what I've been practicing to write all my life. Everything else has been training. I feel that I'm about ready to write it. It may take three years to write and it will be the best that I have learned and a lot that I have never even indicated.'It is obvious that Steinbeck used a long period of time to work up to that major project for it was more than two years later, August 30, 1950, when he mentions the Salinas Valley story again as he talks himself toward the beginning.Then in a letter written to Mr. and Mrs. Elia Kazan from Nantucket July 30, 1951 Steinbeck is six hundred pages into the book with about three or four hundred pages to go. In that letter he gave the title as East of Eden and goes on to tell how perfect it is for the book. It comes from the first sixteen verses of the Fourth Chapter of Genesis. The title comes from the sixteenth verse, but he says the whole passage is applicable.In a letter written to Kazan on October 14, 1958 he sums up his love for writing. \`...I like to write. I like it better than anything. That's why neither theatre nor movies really deeply interest me. It's the fresh clear sentence or thought going down on paper for the first time that makes me pleased and fulfilled.'In a letter April 18, 1952 he mentions Kazan and the House Un-American Activities Committee. Said he read his full statement to the congress and hoped that the communist and second raters don't cut him to pieces.Then on June 17, 1952 he said Kazan called that morning from Paris said he was absolutely crazy about East of Eden and wants to do it. He also said the American communist and the Hollywood left had done their best to destroy him, but he could live with the truth.In 1955 Elia Kazan produced and directed the film, East of Eden.Steinbeck was generous in sharing his thoughts and methods he used when writing with other writers.\`...Write freely and as rapidly as possible and throw the whole thing on paper. Never correct or rewrite until the whole thing is down. Rewrite in process is usually found to be an excuse for not going on. It also interferes with flow and rhythm, which can only come with a kind unconscious association with the material. \`\`...the more one learns about writing, the more unbelievably difficult it becomes. I wish to God I knew as much about my craft, or what ever it is, as I did when I was 19 years old. But with every new attempt, frightening though it may be, is the wonder and the hope and the delight.'Those are just a few notes from a writer's perspective that I came away with and I'm sure you'll come away with a set of your own.The book is so rich in day to day living that you almost forget that you are in the presence of a man that over his writing career had won a room full of awards along with the Nobel Prize for literature in 1962.Tom Barnes author of \`Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone,' The Goring Collection,' \`The Hurricane Hunters and Lost in the Bermuda Triangle.'"},{"Title":"100 Days Of School","review":"Harris has put the concepts of counting into a truly delightful book for the young reader and teachers of young readers.

Edwards Deming, one of the architects of Japan's industrial success, regarded the understanding of variation as one of the most important managerial skills. Unfortunately only few books on management treat that subject at all, and these that do, most frequently give it only a very superficial coverage.The reviewed book is the only one I know that gives a full explanation of both the practice and the theory of statistical process control (SPC) - the way to understand variation. As a manager and TQM coach I fully recommend the book to managers and management students, as a mathematician I recommend it to students and researchers in statistics.Readers without mathematical background should not be scared by many mathematical formulas in the book that explain why SPC works. They may very well skip the reading of equations without any loss in understanding of how SPC works and how to use it in practice.In my opinion the book of James R.

He began life as a miner, and took to poetry after losing his eyesight in an explosion. His work is quite uneven, but certainly includes highlights. Much appears to have been written in imitation of other poets. Much of \\"The Passing Of The Storm\\" resembles the work of Robert Service and may appeal to fans of the Bard Of The Yukon.The highlight of this particular volume is the title piece, an epic poem which fills a significant part of the book. The tale of a group of people brought together by a mountain storm, it's not only an interesting ballad but full of surprising character studies.

Serrano and Elgorriaga's book makes a figurative leap over these hurdles toward its readers through in-depth explanations of the singing technique and precise translations of the Spanish text. The first half of the book relates some of the major recent developments of flamenco through the biography of Juan Serrano, guitar accompanist, solo performer/composer, and co-author. The second portion gives examples of the phrasing, voice quality, and inspiration of the singers in text and on the accompanying cassette (highly recommended). I would give five stars to this book had it included a section on some of the brilliant new performers of today who represent a new direction in flamenco music."},{"Title":"Flamenco, Body and Soul","review":"\\"An introduction to the enigmatic and fascinating world of flamenco\\", says the introduction, and the book fulfils this function very well. Few are better qualified to write such a work than Sr. Serrano: born in 1934, he was at the time of writing both old enough to have played for the great singers and dancers of the past (and to have been friends with the legends of the past such as Ni&ntilde;o Ricardo and Manolo de Huelva), and young enough to evaluate newer artists and trends. Nor must we forget his own contribution, first as the young fen&oacute;meno in Spain in the 50's, then subsequently as one of the famous four (with Sabicas, Mario Escudero and Carlos Montoya) who raised Flamenco to such heights of popularity in the USA, and indeed world-wide.This is clearly a labour of love, and very well done. Commencing with Sr. Serrano's autobiography, it continues with a brief history and then surveys the various aspects of Flamenco in turn. Easily intelligible even to the uninitiated, the style is not merely serviceable but excellent, with many felicitous turns of phrase. But perhaps the happiest idea was the inclusion of a cassette illustrating the points made in the book with some of the great recordings of the past, and a couple made specially for the occasion by Sr. Serrano. Besides the photographs of artists such as Ni&ntilde;a de los Peines and Manuel Torre, there are many interesting ones from the authors' private collections &mdash; the most endearing of which is of an intent-looking Juanito, aged three.The point of view throughput is a personal one, and not all with agree with some of the evaluations (e.g. of the relative merits of Fosforito and Juan Talegas). There are some minor quirks as well, such as the reference to the latter (d. 1971) and to Ni&ntilde;a de los Peines (d. 1969) in the present tense. However, this remains (with Donn Pohren'sThe Art of Flamenco) one of the best and most readable introductions in the English language.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"50 Natural Ways to Better Breathing","review":"Interesting little book but actually not quite what I was after!

I had been a Bergman fan for years when Gado's book came out and when it did it was like lightning bolt. This is not just some pamphlet to add to your Bergman collection once you've read all the rest. This is the SEMINAL study of Bergman; no one can write about the filmaker in the future without knowing this book. It was the first to get past the religious mumbo-jumbo and the literary high mindedness to discover just what Bergman is actually saying. Meticulously researched and beautifully written, it is, above all, the most compelling psychological study of the director ever attempted. His discussion of &quot;Persona,&quot; my own personal favorite Bergman film and admittedly a difficult nut to crack, quite simply renders useless virtually every other critique of the film that had been written previously, and that includes essays by Susan Sontag and a host of others with similarly sharp minds. These pages are filled with insight after insight. The only possible complaint I have is that Gado seems uninterested in the &quot;filmic&quot; quality of Bergman's work. There's little discussion of how the films look and feel via cinematography, framing, sound, lighting, editing, what have you. That's fine. If he hadn't left that for others there'd be little left for anyone to write about."},{"Title":"THE LEFT HAND IS THE DREAMER [ 1st ]","review":"Here's a book that'll keep you in your chair, though not on the edge of your seat.

The scenes Nicole Jordan presents are breathtaking, poetic, beautiful, erotic, intoxicating, bold, and passionate! The reader learns about Aurora and Nicholas as they learn about and discover each other as well as about themselves. Their fire is ignited from the very beginning of the book as Aurora and Nicholas gaze into one another's eyes, then fire becomes a roaring blaze when they kiss. When they realize passion and love are one in the same the fire is fueled uncontrollably! Both characters are strong individuals that have and can endure what life expects of and deals them. They learn about true courage, commitment, desire, passion, and love. Aurora has always been what society expects of a &quot;proper&quot; woman, but yearned to be passionately free. Nicholas is a man who chose to be free from society's expectations and lives life to the fullest. They are separated for a short period of time after their wedding night, and each discovers something different. After reading an erotic journal that Nicholas entrusts to her, Aurora believes she has learned all she needs to know about desire, passion and love but feels she should never open the heart to love because it will only be broken. And vows she will never allow that to happen to her. Nicholas discovers differently. During their time apart he realizes that his feelings for Aurora are stronger than any he has ever felt for a woman. He thinks at first those feelings are simply desire and lust. However, after spending time and getting to know her he realizes he wants Aurora's heart and now must convince her. The book is heart wrenching, suspenseful, surprising, &amp; tearful from it's beginning to it's VERY passionate ending! This is book two in &quot;The Notorious&quot; series by Nicole Jordan. I highly recommend this book as well as book one in the series, &quot;The Seduction&quot;! Nicole Jordan is an amazingly talented author and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I LOVED this book. From the beautiful Prologue, until the very end, you are given a story with wonderful main characters, great secondary characters (Nicole makes secondary characters as fun and interesting to read about as the main one's), a wonderful story, and some really sensual love scenes. Nicole's writing at times, seems poetic, and the lush love scenes are so beautiful, they leave you breathless. The Passion starts off exciting and is a thrill from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down.Lady Aurora Demming meets Nicholas Sabine as he is about to go to the gallows. They make a pact, and share a glorious night of passion before he is to be hung. Aurora marries Nicholas to avoid marrying the man her father betrothed her to, and Nicholas marries Aurora so that she can become the guardian of his sister. You'll enjoy the story of Aurora and Nicholas, and their sensual journey to love. I did."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Where to start? This was the first book I'd read by this author. It started off quite well, with an interesting, if somewhat far-fetched premise. However, if one can suspend disbelief (and I usually can), this book captured the reader's interest...at first.I blasted throught the first 100 pages. The book was shaping up well. The characters were likeable, and I cried a little when Nicholas \\"died\\", even though I knew he wasn't really dead. The plot was moving swiftly, and the focus appeared to be firmly on the relationship between hero and heroine. That's just as is should be. So far, so good.But then the book started to fall apart. Aurora really began to get on my nerves. She was lamenting about how much she missed Nick and what might have been. Then Nick returns from the dead, and suddenly she doesn't want him anymore. Then she doesn't want a true marriage with him (kind of late for that, chickipoo!) unless it's based on love. So then he falls in love with her, and admits it to her, and again, she changes her mind and decides that she doesn't want him anymore. Then she realizes she's in love with him too, but casts him aside for someone else based on some pretty lame excuses about honor and duty. Then she wants him again. Arrgh! As my English mother would say, \\"changeable as the bloody wind!\\" I wanted to smack her and tell her to make up her stupid mind already--choose the man you love, the one who's name you already share! I'd started out liking her, but this pretty much killed any warm feelings I had about her.And then there was the overabundance of sex in this book. I'm no prude, but it got to be ridiculous. There had to be at least a dozen sex scenes in this book, and most lasted for almost 10 pages. I was starting to roll my eyes and mutter, \\"Oh, for Pete's sake, are they doing it AGAIN?\\" It seemed like they were either fighting or screwing (mostly screwing) for the last 2/3 of the book. I was like, get on with the story. Where's the love, the romance in my romance novel? If I wanted erotic fiction (I don't), then that's what I'd buy. I started skimming whole sections of this book, and skipping scenes entirely because I was getting bored.I was barely able to make myself finish this. If I can borrow another book by this author from the library, I might consider trying it. Otherwise, I'll save my money. Unless you're a die-hard fan of this author, I'd suggest you save your money and skip this book."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"At a friends reccomendation I purchased the last Nicole Jordan &quot;Seduction.&quot; I liked it enough to purchase &quot;The Passion.&quot; Wow, what a difference one books make. This is a powerful book, both in the &quot;steam&quot; factor and in the story and plot factor. I have never read an erotic romance that had a better story based upon love and respect. The two character Aurora and Nicholas, draw you into their pain and confusion over this new passion. This book in fact brings to mind &quot;The Duke and I&quot; by Julia Quinn. This is much more steamy, but the story is as fresh as &quot;Duke.&quot; Get a big cup of coffee on a cold winter night and enjoy this wonderful story! Good Reading!"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I have never despised a female character so much! This is my second book from Nicole Jordan and it'll most likely be my last. I had to force myself to finish this one (hoping it would get better). The introduction of Aurora's character was so far afield from what she regressed into throughout the novel. Initially she struck you as an interesting if not courageous personality... then she became self-righteous and over-dramatic, going around and round for CHAPTERS with the same insecurities and arguments about the type of person she thought Nicholas was. Literally CHAPTERS are spent in Aurora's emotional angst over how adventurous, &quot;violent&quot; or at the very least interesting Nicholas' character was to the detriment of Aurora's &quot;independence&quot; (i.e. living by herself fearing what everyone thinks-striving for a boring and shallow life). In fact shallow is a great adjective to explain the overall plot. The explanation of her physical and emotional abuse by her father was so weak that it didn't really substantiate the melodrama that ensued as a result of it. And once her father was introduced, the entire situation was not as dynamic as one would have expected. I can't believe that such a strong male character evolved while the female character regressed into such an irritating drama-queen. All in all, quite a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I won't rehash the plot. Everyone has already done that. I will, however, say that if you loved The Seduction as much as I did, don't automatically assume you will love this one the same. The sizzle just isn't there. Ultimately, there was very little push-pull between the characters, no chemistry that made you hold your breath. The Seduction was memorable in every way. The Passion, for me, ranked among the very ordinary. It wasn't awful; it just wasn't gripping. Frankly, I expcted more."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"This book started off with great promise. Now, I've read and loved other books by Ms. Jordan, but I'm not sure where she went wrong with this book. I was fully involved with the hero and heroine - witty dialogue, chemistry jumping off the page ... but then when the book returned to England, it was like a completely new book started. The heroine changed from a take charge kind of person, to a wimpy 'I don't know what I want.' kind of person, and it just lost me as a reader. I put it down and moved onto something else. This book had great promise, but didn't live up to it."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed by this book. I truly enjoyed The Seduction and was looking forward to The Passion. I had a hard time relating to the characters and following what little plot there was. I found it very difficult to finish the book. I have read several of her other books and find this one falling way below her standards as good reading material."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"THE SEDUCTION by NICOLE JORDAN was a magnum opus - and now THE PASSION continues to enthrall with her unrivalled passionate style and a tenacious love between Lady Aurora Demming and Nicholas Sabine. In terms of sensuality, THE PASSION is overshadowed by her more indulgent style in The Seduction, but in THE PASSION, Ms. Jordan more than redeems herself in her narrative and the poetic journal entry of a tragic love paean left behind by Sabine's mother which makes the read more personal and erotic.Struggling between passion and decorum, Lady Aurora Demming braves the wrath of her abusive father to wed to Nicholas, who is to be gullotined for a naval crime. The wedding was a marriage of convenience and lasted only for a day - but little did she know that Sabine had escaped execution. He returns to stake his claim on Aurora, but Aurora will not allow passion to rule over her when the clamoured independence and security she sought so hard for could be abandoned for reckless passion to Nicholas.As usual, both Aurora and Nicholas are characters which are flawed and fiercely protective of their loved ones. It's a passionate tour de force with moments of poignancy, especially when the dilemma was waged in Aurora's head and how she convinced herself to follow her heart.THE PASSION still manages to scorch but compared to THE SEDUCTION, it lacks the former's sensitivity and avant-garde fiery scenes. Nicole Jordan with her deft characterization, opens up the story with a journal and that is very refreshing. The readers are held captivated by the intense dialogue and tight pacing, and will most certainly relish in Aurora's go for a stake in a heart-wrenching passion with Nicholas.THE PASSION is still undoubtedly one of the best in spicy narration. For all its breathtaking passion, one of the journal entry sums up my verdict: There is no escape from the shackles and bonds of THE PASSION."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Based on the reviews I read here, I had expected something very different. But I found Nick, the hero, to be rather irritating, and the heroine, Aurora, was brainless. Whenever Aurora tried to explain that she was terrified of something, Nick would just start kissing her and throw up her skirts. And like a brainless idiot, she would melt in helpless passion then later agree with Nick that she was somehow to blame. I wanted to slap her.The secondary characters popped in and out without having much depth. Several promising story lines were never followed - the violently angry father, the hoyden half sister, the jilted fiancee, the famous rake - they never had much of a part in making an interesting subplot. It seemed to me, the plot consisted of having Nick think of ways to shut Aurora up by taking her to bed."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"favorite scene with aurora-telling geoffrey she loves nicholas and happy that geoffrey also found true love.favorite scene with nicholas-nicholas tells aurora he'll find harry and finds him.favorite scene with aurora and nicholas together-they make mad, passionate love after she sees geoffrey and tells nicholas she wants the marriage annuled."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I loved this book! [...] since I loved The Seduction,I took a gamble.I thought Nicholas and Aurora were wonderful. I totally understood her fear of loving a man who was a perfect stranger to her and giving up everything that was familiar to her. I really liked the journal and all the plot twists. And the lovemaking was hot enough to singe my fingers!This kind of book is what real romance is all about. If all you want is action and adventure, this story won't be for you. But if you want great characters, deep emotion, hot sex and beautiful writing, you'll love The Passion as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Nicholas and Aurora are certainly suited for eachother, it seems like all they think about is sex..of course the name of the book is The Passion, so what else would the book be about??? The story is very well written, and even the love scenes do not leave alot to be desired, if you get my meaning. The only part of the book that bothered me was Aurora's constant whineing about her long lost love, Gregory. She thought of him so much I was beginning to wonder if Nicholas was Gregory pretending to be Nicholas! I also was finding myself actually feeling sorry for Nicholas for being saddled with a wimp who couldn't make up her mind about which man she was going to love.. Aside from that, I did enjoy this book, enough to give it five stars. You are never bored with the story and lets face it, Nicholas is quiet the hunk (But of course, would he be anything else???) Enjoyable read! Just be prepared to turn on the air-conditioning!!"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Her last book, The Seduction was so good that I had this one ordered right away. Am I ever glad I did! With just these two books, I add her to my list of authors that I buy right away without even having to read the back cover. Well worth the money and a definite keeper. I hope this writer is around for years to come."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I expect a lot when I read Nicole Jordan's novels, and this one *does not disappoint* !! It is everything I hoped it would be, and more...(Lady) Aurora Demming is a great character; and in the opening pages I am already thrilled by her brave defense of Nicholas Sabine... I could relate to her immediately, as I'd have wanted to have done the same thing (but doubt I'd have been quite as brave)... but that's what our heroines are for!Almost instantly (again, in the space of just a few pages) the reader is swept into Aurora having to decide whether to marry a man who may be a ruthless pirate, a murderer -- can she trust him? But even though it may be dangerous, it's still a better choice than what she's facing back in England.. a lifetime full of misery, married to someone who will dominate her , someone she has no love for at all. Nicholas seems 100% more wonderful as a prospect, even if his days are (VERY) numbered...And OH, the wedding night! I won't spoil it for you.... suffice it to say that as usual , Ms. Jordan writes the most gorgeous love scenes... this one is just as gorgeous... and without giving the plot away, there *are* a lot of twists and turns, but all believable. The driving forces behind both Aurora and Nicholas are fully explored, again, very plausible, as is their overpowering attraction for each other.When Nicholas finally agrees to curb at least some of his dangerous pasttimes, the reader is heaving a sigh of relief.. I , for one, was desperate for them to get together. Being a romance novel, I know I won't be disappointed in the end, but *getting* there is great. It's a page-turner.... as usual, with NJ's books, I can barely put it down, would prefer to read it straight through and NOT go to work in the morning!For those who love the book ECSTASY, also by Ms. Jordan, Raven Kendrick is introduced in this book, and she has her own important parts to play in helping the two lovers along.But the love scenes are to die for. Nobody does it better than Ms. Jordan. And they are infused with the feelings *I* look for in my romance novels... love, love, love. A lot more than just the physical.Enjoy! I'll be re-reading this one many times. A definite keeper!!"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"In spite of the mixed reviews, I bought The Passion out of sheer curiosity. The old fashioned plot of a man who marries on the eve of his wrongful execution is reminiscent of my all-time favorite, unforgettable romance, Shanna, a #1 bestseller classic by Kathleen Woodiwiss written in 1977 and which I acquired and kept in my shelf for almost 2 decades. I find the temptation to revisit a familiar storyline irresistible.I have read a couple of Nicole Jordan's novels, The Ecstacy and Desire, the 3rd and 4th installment of her Regency-era Notorious series. Her novels are romantic, sensual and sexual.Romance readers collect books because of the unique and extraordinary scenes or sequences or simply the unforgettable characters created by the authors. In my case, the title alone, Shanna, for example, will evoke memories of a beautiful romance that stays and lingers and becomes part of my romantic fantasies. In the Passion, the journal will be my endearing reminder of this captivating book.The Passion does not come up with the unforgettable romance, emotional tension and lush adventure set by Shanna. Shanna, for me, is a romance of the highest order. Romance readers who have not read Shanna but who are captivated by a similar storyline, that is, a man who marries on the eve of his execution but escapes a hangman's knot, should read and find it for themselves.While the Passion is written more than two decades later after Shanna, I find that The Passion is a very satisfying attempt by Nicole Jordan to weave a similar romantic novel combined with raw, hot, wild sensuality typical of her creations,which in Shanna, undoubtedly lacks in that department.Readers of the romance genre will be drawn to the excellent narrative prose of Nicole Jordan in her creation of a bold, beautiful, passionate and erotic book, a journal which in the story is a gift of Nicholas's father to his lover.As an opening salvo, Nicole Jordan, in her prologue, seduces her readers with the excerpt from the journal. To further enthrall us, she starts each chapter with a passage from the journal. For her epilogue, Nicole Jordan starts off with the journal entry, this time, the journal entry of Aurora herself, to show, in turn Aurora's love for Nicholas.The Passion is all about the story of brazen, untamed passion of Nicholas Sabine for his reluctant wife, Lady Aurora Demming who agrees to marry and bed him for a night in exchange for freedom from her domineering father and an escape from marriage to a despised man twice her age. While Nicholas cannot force love from his reluctant bride, he uses raw and fiery passion to knock off her defenses and slowly binds her to him in love.Sex burns the pages of this romantic book. It is tastefully done and reflects the excellent sensual writing skills of Nicole Jordan. I love sensuality in my romance books and Nicole Jordan will definitely satisfy romance readers with this intensely seductive book of wicked carnal pleasures and undeniable love....."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I don't know why the other readers gave this book such high reviews but throughout the book I was trying to find a plot, some unique characters, some passion, some story but I couldn't. The two main characters just fall on in love on first sight -- give me a break! Also, there is NO conflict, and I really don't see how anyone can love the heroine of the story -- aggravating and indecisive as hell! Unlike her other novels, Ms. Jordan in this one failed to make my heart ache or even make me read the book throughout the night. I didn't feel anything when I read the book. The characters -- especially the guy-- was too romantic that it is unbelieavable. Also, the way he talks is too mushy!! Who talks like that anyway -- &quot;be mine siren...&quot; what the hell is that?! Sorry for the profanity but the book really aggravated me with the automatic love between the main characters and a conflict that does not exist. Please, the heroine resists the man because she was afraid of getting hurt but she jumps into bed with him really fast. Get real!"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"The Passion - by a wonderful writer Nicole JordanReview entry: November 2000It has been five months since I was captured by the book of Nicole Jordan The Seduction and became a slave to her writing. Five months of waiting for The Passion to finally be published. At long last The Passion arrived and with trembling fingers I opened the book and read ......Only today did I allow myself pen and paper to set down my thoughts about The Passion... I remember vividly the book that made me remember Nicole Jordan as a writer &quot;seducing&quot; me with The Seduction only to unleash the &quot;passion&quot; inside me with The Passion. I was captivated from the beginning, the story and her characters vividly etched in my memory to stay there, never to be forgotten.I could not know how this book could profoundly affect me, awakening a tender longing and hungry desire to read a story so masterfully crafted by an author who's talent seems to improve with every book she writes.Nicole Jordan takes you with The Passion to the world of Nicholas and Aurora with scenes that are beautiful, passionate, breathtaking and captivating. A story of true love, courage and desire. A story of two people exploring feelings they never knew existed.Aaah, The Passion by Nicole Jordan..... truly a book worth buying, truly a book worth reading and truly a book worth keeping!"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I read this one a few months ago, and I liked it very much. Though I would not call it excellent, it is very good.The only thing that really annoyed me in the book was that the hero had the annoying habit of using sex to win the heroine over, rather than talking to her. All problems were solved with a quick roll in the hay, and she bought it hook, line, and sinker each & every time.I do have to say I was anxious to read about the American cousinNicolas, but since reading this book, I'm even more anxious to read about his friend, Lord Clune. But, I have 2 more (Estacy &Desire) to go before I can read Lord Clune's story.One more thing about this book -- there was one scene in particular, involving some playtime while riding a horse ... :)You will just have to read the book & discover this interesting passage for yourself! Let just say, for me, it was probably the steamiest scene in the book.1-10 scale: 9.7 Star scale: 4 1/2"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"The love scenes are HOT. The storyline of &quot;The Passion&quot; is interesting and original. Nicholas Sabine is a consummate hero and Aurora is great as the wounded, fragile, but tough heroine.I highly recommend this to any romance enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"This was the first book by Nicole Jordan that I read, and I loved it so much that since then I have read all of the books in this series. They are all great, she is definitively one of my favorite authors.Since the very beginning the book sizzles with passion. The fist time they made love was so beautiful and so charged with emotions (he was sentenced to die the next morning) that it held me enthralled. The next morning when Aurora tries to save him and is told that the sentence is being carried out and Nick is already dead, I actually cried! Even though I knew he must had somehow scaped or there wouldn't be a story to tell, the thought of him dying was enough to make me weep.Nick is an incredible character. He is sensual, corageous, passionate, confident and so masculine. There was not a moment in this book when I found fault with the way he acts (unlike other heroes that at the beginnig are real jerks and it is not until later that they reform). He is not the kind of man that tries to deny his need for the woman he loves, he knows what he wants and he is determined to get it, even if he has to risk his life. His relentless pursuit of Aurora made me fall in love with him, and the intense chemistry beween them keeps the love scenes sizzling hot. Every time they meet is intense, passionate, carnal and erotic and I would be hard pressed to choose one favorite scene from this book. There are so many!An incredible book. I have read it twice and from time to time, I like to re-read my favorite scenes. An all time favorite.(Make sure you also read the other books in this series \\"The Seduction\\", \\"Desire\\", \\"Ecstacy\\" and \\"The Prince of Pleasure\\", they are all equally good)"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I was happy to read Nick's story.

My only consolation is that I get to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Actually the hero Nic is not a true pirate, but a man trying to protect the dying wishes of a father. The way the couple meet is fabulous and quite unexpected...in jail. The strengths of the leading lady given the times is quite admirable. She rescues without question and that includes the hero. The sexual tension is all Nicole Jordan...never disappointing. I had my fingers crossed in the end hoping that love would win out over loyalty. I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who recognizes the &quot;bad&quot; in themselves...and those who don't."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"I read all the ravs on message boards &amp; expected to be swept away with passion when I finally got to read Nicole Jordan's new book. The characters were not memorable, the plot uninteresting, the writing overdone. Boring. Ms. Jordan needs her imagination sparked. Maybe then she'll develop a fresh storyline, instead of giving readers one that should have been retired years ago."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"This story is about Aurora Demming who escaped marriage to a man that was twice her age.

This wonderful romance has an old-fashioned plot - handsome pirate marries innocent damsel on the eve of his wrongful execution - with the more sophisticated characterization, emotional tension and sensuality we see in today's best romances. The combination makes for a fun, lively read. The main characters are both wonderfully drawn and develop well over the course of the story. Their romance is both intense and passionate. A real treat."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Loved this book. Have read it over and over again. Ms. Jordan has a way of putting into writing a love story that echos many a woman's fantasy. Yes, all her books I have read so far end with the good guy winning out and capturing the woman's heart but hey, isn't that what a good romance is all about? The descriptive romance scenes are written in very good taste, neither over-written nor under-written."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"In 1813 in St. Kitts, British West Indies, English visitor Lady Aurora Demming objects to the military's treatment of condemned prisoner Nicholas Sabine. The English know him as the pirate Captain Saber while the Americans consider the merchant fleet owner a privateer.Nicholas worries about what will happen to his half-sister Raven. He persuades Aurora to marry him, consummate their vows, and serve as Raven's guardian as the latter makes her London debut. With the urging of her cousin and his wife, Aurora agrees to this one-day marriage of convenience as opposed to marrying her father's choice of spouse, the arrogant, odious Duke of Halford. However, neither Nicholas nor Aurora expected him to survive the gallows and come to England to claim his bride.With over a dozen best-selling historical romances, readers know Nicole Jordan is a sure winner for readers who like their romances a little spicy. THE PASSION is a seductive tale that contains all the fire and conflict the audience expects from a novel written by this talented author. The story line centers on two strong charcaters struggling between their love for one another and the War of 1812 interfering with their relationship. Ms. Jordan has written one of the best romances of her career.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"If ever a book was appropriately titled it's this one! From the very sensuous prologue to the very emotional last page, and everything in between - this book reeks PASSION! A h&amp;h you will love, very real issues, sympathies for both sides, and love, love, love! This book is beautifully written and will grab your heart and not let you go! Each chapter beginning has an excerpt from an erotic journal that was written by the hero's father's mistress, who was his one true love and they are a beautiful beginning to each new chapter. As usual, Nicole Jordan burns up the pages with hot sensuality (as well as sensual beauty) and creates a love story that is what I would call an example of what the genre is about and is, in my opinion Nicole Jordan at her finest. Do NOT miss this one!!! (And BTW, five stars wasn't enough for this one!)"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"The Passion by Nicole Jordan was indeed that...passionate, but I really can't say that I liked this book at all.Aurora Demming, the heroine, starts out so strong. Fearlessly and courageously going to aide an imprisoned, and \\"sentenced to die\\" Nicholas Sabine. He offers her a marriage of convenience that will save her from an unwanted arranged marriage in exchange for her protection and wardship of his half sister. At first I was captivated and then it happened....Fast forward several months and the Aurora that I loved turned into the Aurora that I hated. She turned from a strong and fearless character into a \\"pseudo- strong character\\". Nicole Jordan attempts to make her strong and independent, but I found myself annoyed at all the attempts she makes to distance herself from Nick. She loved him so much on her wedding night, thought about him constantly, missed him terribly, but when he shows up wants NOTHING to do with being his wife.....Sorry this one was NOT for me.Try the unbelievable prequel The Seduction....that one won't disappoint!"},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Great beginning...took off and then began to plod. The hero was great. Ms. Jordan is a wonderful writer but there were few twists and turns to sustain interest in the story. What held my interest was the change in the hero's personality over the course of the book and the engaging writing style of the author but it was a little disappointing. I still look forward to The Enchantment this summer; her writing style is charming."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"THE PASSION: Story of Nicholas Sabine &amp; Lady Aurora Demmings This book is the second book of Nicole Jordan's NOTORIOUS SERIES. The first book is THE SEDUCTION, story of Damien's, an acquaintance of Nicholas Sabine. The third book is originally named &quot;Enchantment&quot; but was later changed to &quot;DESIRE&quot; to make it sound sexier (I think its fitting too considering the first two titles of this series). DESIRE is the story of Lucian, cousin of Nicholas Sabine in the 2nd book. It is due out this coming November, 2001. I am hoping that the third book will have updates of the couples from the 1st two books.Nicholas Sabine lived a life of a rebel. He is a rich, handsome rake who enjoys risk &amp; lives recklessly/dangerously. When he wants something, he goes for it without thinking of the consequences. Meanwhile, Lady Aurora prefers peace, solitude, simplicity &amp; stability. She can ignore her wants/needs (even her own happiness) to accomplish tranquility in her life yet she will fight for others who needed championing. She distance herself from the world, from people to protect her heart. With a tyrant father, she also longed for freedom. It was hard for both the hero/heroine to realize what they felt for each other because Nicholas never knew, let alone felt love... while Aurora is determined to protect her heart from such as love. I understand both the H/H especially the heroine. Whenever she loved someone, she loses them and knowing the kind of life Nicholas lead, it is very realistic for her to take a step back away from Nicholas to shelter her heart. The sweet part of this book is that no matter how much she tries to ignore and deny the feelings, it is there. Getting stronger. The more Nicholas pursues her, the more she finds herself drawn to him. He saw her protective shell and means to break it, to set her free... Despite Nicholas dangerous character, he was playful to Aurora. Teasing her, charming her. I liked the way he pursued her. I didn't think he became &quot;too soft&quot;. In fact, I think this is what drawned me more to him. He was a pirate, dangerous and a condemn man (to be hanged) but his mischievous grin and his gentleness towards Aurora awes me. Nicholas means to have her but not in a forceful way. She wants her to surrender herself to him freely. She just needed a little nudge...and a lot of PASSION. In the end, Aurora tamed him and Nicholas set her free. It's Magical!The short appearance of Damien and Vanessa (The Seduction) was a bit disappointing yet practical given the fact that Sinclair and Nicholas weren't really good friends. They were merely an acquaintance. I honestly didn't think I'd like a very erotic romances in a novel. The sex scenes in this book is somewhat explicit (just like in THE SEDUCTION) but the way Nicole Jordan detailed it out didn't sound disgusting or risque. For me, it's sweet &amp; scrumptious :-) After reading THE SEDUCTION, which I have enjoyed so much, I was a bit hesitant in starting this sequel because of the negative Amazon reviewers. I was afraid I'd waste my time on this one but finally decided to give it a shot -- considering it is part of the series which I have started. I am glad that the negative reviewers didn't totally sway me off from this book, otherwise, I would have missed out on one delicious adventure. This book truly proves that everyone have different taste, preferences and opinions. I suggest you read the negative reviews, balance it with the positive then give this book a shot like I did and decide for yourself. Who knows you might like it and enjoy it, just as I did."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"The story started out good enough. Lady Aurora sees Nicholas being beaten by his captures.

What has happened to Nicole Jordan's flare, depth, emotion and unforgettable characters? Where's the excitement in that? The hero was way too soft! Throughout the whole book he did nothing but try to please the heroine. UGH! Leaves the hero unmanly if you ask me, more of a wimp. No conflict at all! The love scenes lacked PASSION only because there was no connection between the hero and heroine. Just a bunch of sex that didn't &quot;make it&quot; due to the lack of story and great characters."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"This was a boring read, frankly.

I find this rather frustrating.Overall, a very affecting novel (quite steamy sex scenes), interesting and worth a read."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"The novel is a totally pale imitation of Shanna by Woodiwiss, in which woman decides to marry aconvict because he is about to be hung, he is a supposed pirate, and is somehow saved and decides to go after her after one night of love.This book was completely wooden, most especially the love scenes. Good writing has a wonderful ebb and flow, but this just kept going around in the same dull circles as she rejects him at every turn for no really good reasons that any person can see.I never got the real sense of commitment I needed, and the supposedly sexy and salacious details mainly came from a journal that is so badly written, even if it is supposed to be in French, as to be laugable.I never believe in the heroines's love for him when she finall says she will settle down-he just thunks her into sexual submission with him setting himself a two week challenge to win her.When the fiance predictably comes back, she acts as if she could not care less about poor Nick.Aurora is totally missnamed-instead of the Dawn, she is dusk, totally grim and uninspiring.To add to the confusion we have Nick's sister Raven, his friend Lucian and her fiance all falling in love! Worse than any Shakespeare play. Obviously they are trying to set up for other novels in the series but it would have been a really good idea for the author to be successful with this one before galloping off to the others.What a dull read."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Lady Aurora Demming hasn't been lucky in love. First she loses her beloved lifelong fianc&eacute;, then her father betroths her to a cold man twice her age. It's not surprising that she's willing to take any chance that comes her way to avoid the match her father made, so she's decided to visit her cousin in the West Indies to avoid the marriage for a little longer.Nicholas Sabine is an American shipping magnate who is caught behind enemy lines during the War of 1812. Because he's defended his ships when the British attacked him, he is labeled a pirate and sentenced to hang. He was behind enemy lines for a good reason, to bring his sister home with him, and despite being sentenced to death is most worried about finding a way to take care of her when he's killed.With an idea you would only find in a romance novel (and probably already have), on the eve of his execution Nicholas asks Lady Aurora to be his wife. He'll leave her a great deal of money if she'll find and take care of his little sister for him, and for Aurora it means she doesn't have to marry the man her father's chosen. Oh, one last thing, she has to agree to consummate the marriage so no one can say it isn't legal.So they marry, consummate, he lets her think he's dead. She finds his sister, heads back to England, mourning the husband who made her &quot;feel things&quot; on her wedding night. He escapes, heads to England to find her. She's shocked that he's alive and doesn't know if she wants to be married to him now that he's back. After a bunch of bedroom scenes her \\"dead\\" fianc&eacute; shows back up. You can probably imagine how it goes from there.In a historical sense, there's a lot wrong with &quot;The Passion&quot;; actually in any sense there's a lot wrong with it. Aurora seems to care about what society thinks and yet she willing marries a condemned American pirate. Her cousin offers her another way out of her unwanted marriage, but she doesn't take it and instead marries a criminal. Then, when said criminal shows back up, she's not sure she wants him for flimsy reasons about the fact that he's a rake and her not being sure of him, or what people would think. Honestly, her reasons for not wanting to be with him are nonsensical and just an excuse to keep the story going an extra two hundred pages. She's an English noblewoman, who is legally married in the early nineteenth century-she's not going to find some magic way out of it.Before I let on that the book is totally past redemption, I do have to say that I like Nicholas. Obviously, I think the heroine is totally unworthy of him. I'm never really certain that either of them are in love, despite what they say, but he seems committed to giving her the benefit of the doubt and still wants her even after she rejects him about a hundred times. There's something noble about most of his actions. In fact, he's the only reason I kept reading the book after about page 100. I skimmed every scene he wasn't in past that point.I give \\"The Passion\\" two stars. It's really not very readable, and the hero is the only thing saving it from being a total disaster. Oh, and the love scenes? I didn't see anything special. There were a lot of them, to be sure, but nothing earth shattering. If you want to see this story done right, I'd read Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's &quot;Shana&quot;. This was my first Nicole Jordan and probably my last, so I have nothing else of hers to recommend in its place."},{"Title":"The Passion","review":"Good god, The Passion was really hard for me to get through.

In The Passion, Ms. Jordan puts to the test all the boundaries of erotic, sensual, breathtaking historical romance...Nicolas Sabine (known also as an illustrious Capitain Saber) is condemned as a pirate by the Brittish Navy Officers and is about to be executed for his alleged crimes.If The Seduction fans recall, he was briefly introduced as the mysterious American newcomer to the Hellfire League---a club of rakish nobleman dedicated to debauchery and seductive pastimes!...However, his circumstances have taken a huge downwards spin since those days...And as he despairs that the heavens have ignored his pleas, a most unlikely angel comes to his rescue - literally! - in the form of Lady Aurora Demming. He is both mystified and surprised that a gently reared young miss as Aurora would care one way or another about the fate of a condemned criminal...Aurora has woes of her own...and aplenty. After having only recently lost her dearest fiance, she is on the brink of being sacrificed to an unwanted marriage to an aristocrat twice her age...And she has no clue as to how to get out of her predicament...Not until she makes the most outlandish, risky pact with Nicolas Sabine....The man who has managed to affect her senses in such a profound way and in such a short span of time...Nicoles wished to fullfil a promise that he had made to his dying father: to provide his half-sister Raven with her rightful place in the polite society.

While they made this arrangement, neither Nocolas nor Aurora realize that they had also bargained away their hearts to an everlasting love that will consume them both...After having returned to England, Aurora greatly mourns the loss of the man who such deeply connected to her soul and shown her such searng love...and then as quickly abondoned her and perished. Unrequited love. Unforgotten. She relives his gentle touch ...and remembers his smoldering gaze...and his passionate embraces.Only her handsome,passionate, loving husband of one-night is not quite dead...On the contrary! He has escaped his captors and having never been able to forget his precious, breathtaking angel of a saviour, he comes back to claim his once found love....His wife.

The man showed grace and class by sticking to the subject and not getting into petty name calling and finger pointing.To me he proves that when we obey the Lord and speak the truth in love, we can still speak the truth, we just don't have to lower ourselves to our enemies level."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"What is the \\"Blessed Hope\\" of the church today? Is it the escape of tribulation by a secretive rapture of Christians prior to the Great Tribulation? Or is it the visible return of Jesus Christ to the earth to redeem His people and judge His enemies? George Eldon Ladd, in The Blessed Hope: A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture, argues for the latter, thus debunking the theory that the Rapture and the Second Coming of Christ are two distinct events separated by the seven year \\"Great Tribulation.\\"George Eldon Ladd is widely considered one the most influential Bible scholars of the 20th century. After pastoring two Baptist churches early in his career, he eventually settled in as New Testament professor at Fuller Theological Seminary in California. Throughout his career he sought to engage the broader academic community with Biblical writing that liberal scholars would have to take seriously. He also sought to promote more unity within the conservative, evangelical world.In Ladd's day, much like our own, Dispensationalism was the predominant view of the church. In fact, some were so rabidly Dispensational, that they considered any other eschatological (end times) view to be heretical and dangerous. Ladd argues that such a stance is unnecessary and preposterous. He gives a brief historical lesson in this book showing that many stalwart Christian defenders of the faith were NOT Dispensational in their theology. Ladd' s view is that there should be plenty of room for various views, as long as the views are defended from Scripture. Ladd's personal view is Historic Premillennialism, which is similar to Dispensationalism in that it espouses a literal 1000 year reign of Christ on earth. But it differs from Dispensationalism in that it see's the rapture occurring at the same time as the Second Coming of Christ, at the END (rather than beginning) of the Great Tribulation.Regardless of one's end times viewpoint, it should be noted that Ladd makes a good case for a post-tribulation rapture both from a historical and a Biblical standpoint. Most of the early church fathers appear to have believed in a literal 1000 year reign of Christ (millennialism) and saw the 2nd coming and rapture as occurring at the same time. Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian are some of the church fathers Ladd presents as holding to these views. Perhaps the most significant of these is Irenaeus who was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John the Apostle. While it doesn't guarantee the validity of the Historic Premillennial position, it is intriguing that a Christian who is one generation removed from John the writer of Revelation would hold these views. Furthermore, the apparent acceptance of other church fathers makes the case from history compelling. But, at the end of the day, it's Scripture that must be the deciding factor in the case. And Ladd's primary arguments are from Scripture.Ladd points out that nowhere in Scripture does it explicitly teach that there will be a \\"pre-tribulational\\" rapture. First Thessalonians clearly teaches a \\"rapture\\" when we shall be gathered together with the Lord in the air. But to suggest that this rapture will occur prior to the Great Tribulation is an inference that is not explicitly stated. The passage states: \\"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.\\" 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 (NASB)Ladd's case is presented throughout that New Testament Christians were not looking to be raptured out of tribulation, but instead the Bible taught Christians to expect tribulation. Given this fact, that Christians throughout the centuries have endured persecution unto death....why would God change this course with the \\"end times?\\"One Scripture that Ladd uses effectively is from 2 Thessalonians 2, where the Thessalonian Christians were afraid they had missed the \\"Day of the Lord.\\" \\"Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.\\"2 Thessalonians 2:1-4 (NASB)Paul sets their mind at ease by telling them the \\"Day of the Lord\\" won't occur until the \\"apostasy\\" and the \\"son of destruction\\" is revealed. Why doesn't Paul simply tell them to relax about the Day of the Lord since, as Christians, they'll be raptured before it occurs? Was Paul unaware of a pre-tribulation rapture? That seems unlikely since Paul is the one who wrote the most significant passage on the rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. Since most scholars are in agreement that the \\"Day of the Lord\\" refers to Christ's coming in judgment at his Second Advent, the passage in 2 Thessalonians seems to give credence to the belief that the Second Coming and the Rapture are simultaneous events that occur at the end of the Great Tribulation.Another argument that Ladd addresses is the idea of an \\"any moment\\" rapture. Those who oppose Historic Premillennialism state that it takes away the idea that Christ could return at \\"any moment\\" as taught in Scripture. Ladd points out that the \\"any moment\\" passages refer to the outplaying of all the \\"end times\\" events that could being at \\"any moment.\\" Furthermore, he states that the Dispensational view requires a \\"nation of Israel\\" to be in existence before the rapture of Christ. Therefore, those with a Dispensational view couldn't have held to an \\"any moment\\" rapture anyway, until 1948 and the re-emergence of Israel as an actual physical nation.Regardless of what you \\"end times\\" view is, \\"The Blessed Hope\\" is a book that Christians should read and examine with an open mind. While you may not agree with all of his conclusions, it would do any Christian well to consider the validity of Ladd's arguments. Ladd's hope was that Christians of various camps could debate these issues in Christian love without breaking fellowship. It was also Ladd's concern that many Christians would one day find themselves unprepared for tribulation because of their blind hope in a pre-tribulation rapture that was unlikely to occur. Ladd makes a good case for his viewpoint, and the wise Christian will prayerfully consider if he's on the right track regarding future events."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"This a book on the Posttribulation view of the question pre, mid or post tribulation.

He recognizes that, \\"...Jesus did not undertake his ministry with the evident purpose of starting a new moment either within or outside of Israel. He came as a Jew to the Jewish people. He accepted the authority of the Old Testament, conformed to the temple practices, engaged in synagogue worship, and throughout his life, lived as a Jew.\\" In reference to Matthew 16:18-19 Ladd comments, \\"The saying does not speak of the creation of an organization or institution, nor is it to be interpreted in terms of the distinctively Christian ekklesia as the body and the bride of Christ, but in terms of the Old Testament concept of Israel as the people of God. The idea of \\"building\\" is an Old Testament one.\\" Ladd further states, \\"Jesus took his stand squarely against the background of the Old Testament covenant and the promises of the prophets, and recognized Israel, to whom the covenant and promises had been given, as the \\"natural sons of the Kingdom\\" (Matt. 18:12)\\" One of his subtitles in this book is \\"The Church is not the Kingdom\\" These are concepts that I surmised from my study of Scripture and I was elated to have them so adamantly and clearly confirmed by a man of Ladd's obvious deep understanding of God's Word. Against this backdrop comes my disappointment with Ladd's exposition on the synonymous occurrence of the Rapture (of the Church) and the Second Coming of Jesus. My version of his book is on my Kindle so I don't have the page number, but the Kindle location is 706. Ladd states, \\"We may be permitted to limit this study to the New Testament teaching, for pretribulationists assert that the Church does not appear in the Old Testament predictions. Since our study has to do with the Church and the Tribulation, any evidence deduced from the Old Testament would be considered irrelevant by pretribulationists.\\" Ladd does not defend this statement with examples, he simply states it as if it were fact. He offers no proof. He has just declared over half the Bible as out of bounds! I am stupefied at this assumption. Even if it were true that dispensationalists believe this, would it not be prudent to point out the gross error in making such an assumption and consult the ENTIRE COUNSEL OF GOD on the matter at hand? Or is it that Ladd, himself considers the Old Testament irrelevant imputing his own prejudice to Dispensationalists. It shouldn't matter what they think, or what a Covenant theologian thinks; what matters is what God says about it whether in the Old Testament or the New Testament. Ladd's defense of his position at this point becomes a house of cards and can not be taken as an intellectually honest, unbiased quest for truth on the subject at hand. This review is not the place to lay out the entirety of my own view, but let me just say that the Tribulation is decidedly not about the Church, whether she is still around at the Tribulation or not - IT IS ABOUT ISRAEL! It is about chastisement and salvation for Israel and judgement for her oppressors and all unbelievers. Jeremiah prophesies, \\"Alas! for that day is great, there is none like it; and it is the time of JACOB'S DISTRESS, but he will be saved from it.\\" (Jer 30:7) I suggest reading Jeremiah chapters 30-33 in their entirety to peer into the window of God's love for Israel. The Church is in no way the recipient of these promises. In Jeremiah 33:14-26 God promises to restore the Davidic Kingdom and re-establish the Levitcal priesthood. I know we have been taught that the Melchiezadekian priesthood replaces the Levitical, but Scripture does not teach that. See also Ezekiel chapters 43-46. In Romans 11 Paul states, \\" For I do not want you, brethren to be uninformed of this mystery, lest you be wise in your own estimation, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until THE FULLNESS OF THE GENTILES HAS COME IN; and thus all Israel will be saved; just as it is written...\\" and Paul goes on to quote OLD TESTAMENT SCRIPTURE Is. 59:20-21, Jer 31:33-34, Is 27:9. I have heard (or read) dispensationalists use the Scripture verses of Is 26:19-20 as a proof text for those believers who have gone up in the Rapture (this includes Jewish believers) being \\"hidden\\" during the Great Tribulation. Since the majority of believers are now Gentile and will have been brought to \\"fullness\\", perhaps they ARE removed and attention once again focused on Israel and the unbelieving nations. YOU decide, but only after consulting the entire corpus of Scripture. I do not have the time, space or your attention span to go further - suffice it to say that Ladd's treatment of this subject is lacking. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"George E. Ladd's \\"Blessed Hope\\" is an excellent work, but not nearly so thorough nor as accurate as Tim Cohen's works (see below).Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago. The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming. These men are novices and not prophecy \\"experts\\" or \\"scholars\\" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, \\"The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea,\\" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: \\"The REAL Rapture\\". If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's \\"The REAL Rapture\\" (based on a volume in his forthcoming \\"Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period\\" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon)."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"In this higly readable study Ladd discusses the relationship between the rapture and the second advent of Christ.

Ladd possesses a high view of the inspiration and authority of Scripture in this work. I recommend his book highly."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"Ladd maintains that \\"blessed hope\\" (Titus 2:3) is not salvation from tribulation, but instead the promise of union with Christ when Christ returns in glory. Hope, so conceived, unites the believer with the Lord, who was acquainted with tribulation Himself. Still supportive of his own views that favor premillennialism, Ladd distinguishes pretribulationism as an unnecessary interpretation of Second Advent biblical and extra-canonical referents.Unnecessary as it might be in Ladd's opinion, yet pretribulationism garners controversy among Rapture-oriented Christians who debate what amounts to a 19th-century doctrine advanced by exegetes such as a Scot named John Darby. The author's stated intent is to dispose of the \\"pre-trib\\" element by authority of the canonical Scriptures without recourse to Tradition or the Fathers of the Church. However, the first chapter of this text remands so-called pre-trib proponents to texts of the primitive Church for her sense of the second Advent of Christ. Hope has a history of exegesis in ancient records such as the Didache, Shepherd of Hermas, and Dialogue with Trypho (St. Justin Martyr). Rightly so, Ladd identifies the absence of pre-trib interpretation in this history.With little more than the obvious that the pre-trib doctrine has no patristic roots, the book reaches a solid historical foundation in its second chapter. In chapter two, Ladd traces the 19th-century exegetical interest in futurism or what he also calls the prophetic revival. He captures what was a prevailing disgust in papism as symbol/sign of Christian unity among Western Christian futurists, and extends his review to contemporary 19th-century dissenters of the pre-trib doctrine. Noted dissent came from Dr. Erdman of the Moody Church, Chicago, among others.Ladd lost an opportunity to link the unity of the Church to eschatology, but in all fairness to the author that was not his project regardless the implications of 19th and 20th-century debates in chapter two to unifying Protestant Christians. The remainder of the text seals the fate of not only pre-trib dispensationalism, but also any doctrine of millenniealism as far as unifying the Church. The doctrines concerning the final events of the second Advent fail to unite Protestant Christians.There is another gem inside this book. Chapter six, \\"Watch,\\" refutes pre-trib arguments concerning the Day of the Lord. Central to the theme of the chapter is the meaning of watchfulness concerning the soul as opposed to vigilant anticipation of the day for Christ to return. Whereas Ladd's use of referents to watchfulness is congruent with primitive interpretations of the Day of the Lord, which are untarnished by pre-trib spins, he accomplishes little more than state the fact.Readers from across hermeneutic traditions will agree on one point. This text deserves a permanent place in the debates concerning the second Advent of Christ. For this reason, I recommend the text for careful study."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"The author is well-rounded in his theology - warning the church of the easy believism of a pre-trib rapture. This is my kind of book because he uses 'solid' scriptural reasoning to prove his points. If you're determined to believe in a pre or mid-trib rapture then this book is not for you, but if you want to read something that makes sense this is a good place to begin."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"\\"The Blessed Hope\\" carefully studies the Bible to see if a pre-Tribulation Rapture of the Church is clearly taught there or if it is equally or even more clearly taught that Christians will go through the Tribulation and be \\"raptured\\" only at the end when Jesus returns in glory.He starts with quotes of what early Christians wrote about Revelation in this regard. He also chronicles how the pre-Tribulation idea first appeared and was promoted around 1831. The author then looked at the verses referring to the blessed hope, Jesus' glorious return, and the rapture as well as the verses pre-Tribulationists use to support their views. He showed that a pre-Tribulation Rapture is, at best, an inference and how the verses used to support it can be understood to support a post-Tribulation view if read in context.Personally, I've never been able to see a pre-Tribulation Rapture in the Bible despite being taught that by my church since I was a child. I found it interesting that this author used many of the same arguments that I had seen in my study of the Bible.My mother also read this book. She couldn't see a pre-Tribulation Rapture taught in the Bible, either, but wanted to understand the arguments for it in case she was missing something. She liked that this book explained the pre-Tribulation Rapture argument, but it also pointed out the things she had noticed against it. She now feels confident that she's not missing some truth that she'd been overlooking that would compel belief in a pre-Tribulation Rapture.The last chapter is somewhat dated as he referred to \\"current\\" views, and the book was written in 1956. Also, while I agree that sharing the gospel with the entire world is important, I believe this because that's what Jesus told us to. I don't agree with the author's view that Jesus is prevented from returning until Christians get their act together and have achieved a certain goal as to the number of nations that have heard the gospel. It is God that brings people to belief, and everything is coming about in His timing, not ours.I think the book presented a very clear explanation about how a pre-Tribulation Rapture came to be taught and why a post-Tribulation \\"rapture\\" more solidly fits what the Bibles teaches about the end times. I'd recommend this book to everyone interested in the Rapture."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"Most of what I've read/listened to in the past is the pre-trib view. But more recently I've heard other's teach different views of eschatology. I had always taken the pre-trib view as my default position, but I hadn't really deeply dived in to research the view. I started off with two pre-trib books and then went to two post-trib books. This book stood head and shoulders above the rest. It was fairly easy to read, it made really good arguments for the post-trib position, and it made a lot of sense. Thanks to the teaching in this book, I now see that the post-trib view lines up very well with Scripture.I've jumped from my default pre-trib position to a strong post-trib position. I don't see why people debate this anymore. Obviously the post-trib view is correct! :)"},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"I think this is a good book to help prepare us for what will be happening in the near future.

Redding"},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"FWIW, I had been a pre-trib believer since I was a kid. THat was all I'd ever been taught. But now as a midlife \\"why do I believe this?\\" exercise, I decided to do some research on the topic and began with my Bible. I was pretty amazed that, viewing Scripture in context and objectively (pretending I'd never heard of the second coming), there wasn't any real evidence of a secret rapture of the Church. Everything pointed to the Second Coming occuring *after* The Tribulation. So I began to do some research on where, exactly, the pre-trib rapture idea came from. Without re-writing Ladd's book, I suggest that you purchase it and read it for yourself. The information is pretty common knowledge out on the web, even; but the tragedy is, too many \\"pre-trib\\" believers aren't reading it and are even building doctrine, dogma and creeds around a theory that they can't support with Scripture. The pre-trib theory is just an assumption based on very very loose inferences at best. It should never be on the same level of Scripturally sound teaching as, say, Christ's birth, death and resurrection, folks. Read the book."},{"Title":"The Blessed Hope (A Biblical Study of The Second Advent and The Rapture)","review":"I've read many books on the subject, and found this book by Ladd to be the most fair in discussing all the views of end time prophesies in the Bible.He uses a lot of scripture and does not waste time discussing \\"current\\" events, as so many other authors do on this subject. So, if you are looking for a \\"meaty\\", yet small book, on all the important scriptures dealing with the Return of Jesus Christ ( The Blessed Hope ), this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Learning to Think Strategically (New Frontiers in Learning)","review":"I've got a desire for learning strategic thinking lately and decided to read books on this subject starting with the ones that get the best reviews. This book has got five star review (15 five stars + 1 four stars at this time). That's impressive. After reading it, however, I started to wonder how many of these five-star reviews are from friends and colleagues. At least two reviews reveal that they are fellow professors from Columbia University.I appreciate this book very much on one thing--that is \\"strategic thinking can be learned.\\" I am a poor strategic thinker, so I feel extremely encouraged.Other than that the rest of the book is very repetitive and sometimes so convoluted that it wants you to give up learning strategic thinking. In certain parts of the book, she goes on lengthy discussions on a simple concept such as \\"adaptation\\" or \\"reflection.\\"I wonder how many people who gave it five-stars actually finished the book. You can see the shared highlights (on Kindle) at the beginning of the book and than not a single highlight for the rest of the book. By the end of the book, I was totally exhausted and thought about taking years of break before reading another book on strategic thinking.The book also serves as an infomercial for the author's executive consultant service. At times, I felt that the author might have intentionally made the strategic learning difficult so that the reader would hire her for consultation. As John Maxwell once said, \\"A scholar makes a simple thing complex, and a communicator makes a complex thing simple.\\" After this book, I agree with him.So far the book I like most is \\"Strategic Project Management Made Simple: Practical Tools for Leaders and Teams. Even though it's more about management than thinking, you are forced to think strategically by practically dealing with the strategic management.For now, I am moving on to the next highly rated book, \\"Thinking Strategically: The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life."},{"Title":"Learning to Think Strategically (New Frontiers in Learning)","review":"Julia Sloan has written a must-read book on methods of learning to think strategically that is suitable for corporate executives, graduate students, and others in diverse fields of business management. With a very readable text, clear figures, and sample scenarios she delves into the various important components of this subject. A major conceptual contribution is the seven strategic thinking dimensions for critical dialogue presented in chapter 13. Chapter 23 follows with five critical attributes needed to learn the process. With her vast experience abroad dealing with executives from many different cultures, Dr. Sloan brings a global perspective to the topic. This is a scholarly yet readable book with fresh perspectives that will have broad appeal. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Learning to Think Strategically (New Frontiers in Learning)","review":"Julia Sloan models the very concepts she espouses in her brilliantly written and just-in-time book. What sets her work apart is that she not only reminds us of the imperative for critical thinking particularly within the competitive global business environment, but she offers the strategies needed to develop these new skills in today's complex world. Sloan does this by demonstrating the practical application of classical adult learning theory. Sloan's insight and wonderfully engaging style makes this work a pleasure to read.

Essential reading for every global business person.The author is clear,succinct and right on the mark with the differentiation between strategic thinking and strategic planning. The first half of the book is informative and the second half is insightful and challenging. Sloan raises questions that should be at the forefront of every strategic discussion: what and how are we investing in developing strategic thinkers? This book is candid, thorough and original. The author makes a convincing and sobering case for plain, hard work when it comes to learning to think strategically -- a welcome and honest assessment of what is necessary to compete on a global scale -- no simple short cuts.

Of particular interest was Sloan's description of the application of the surf and dive thinking levels -- it was clear with significant implications.

The strong moral codes presented in it are inspirational and timeless."},{"Title":"Rangers of the Lone Star: A Western Story (Five Star Western Series)","review":"Zane Grey delivers a fantastic read full of archatypical Texas characters. The prose is a little dated, but hey, it is a period tale by a vintage western master. If you like stories about the Texas Rangers you'll really enjoy this book. The plot has Rangers, rustlers and two beautiful women new to the Texas Country. All of these elements combine with a secret Ranger mission to the Big Bend badlands, an area notorious for the roughest, meanest hombres in the Old West. Pick this one up to see how Grey uses his unique prose, scenic locations and numerous -- sometimes predictable but never dull -- plot twists to tell this action-packed western."},{"Title":"Rangers of the Lone Star: A Western Story (Five Star Western Series)","review":"This book, parts of which were published in the 1970's as The Rustlers of Pecos County using different character and place names, is an okay book. It is one of only a handful of Zane Grey \\"fiction\\" books written in first person, and my opinion is, Zane Grey didn't handle first person prose very well when writing fiction. But aside from that this is a basic shoot-em up written early in his career, rejected by Harpers editors, and eventually combined with another book, Last of the Duanes, to form what many consider one of Zane Grey's best, The Lone Star Ranger. To fashion and custom of the times, this book is historically accurate and well crafted, but it just lacks the one element to make it great which I have yet to put my finger on. But it's Zane Grey, so how bad can it be? It's not bad, there are others just better.

It was slow.

The covers and illustrations, the intro pages- heck, even the size and weight- are darn near perfect in exactly the retro way they intended. But the writers have a background which includes scripting comics for Dark Horse, and that's how this reads.It's a meatless tribute to all things hard-boiled, featuring prose written in a spare (much too spare) style. Descriptions are sorely lacking, and the dialogue, while it talks &quot;tough,&quot; is un-creative.There is really only a couple of instances of good dialogue. Here is one: &quot;There's nothing like a mourning widow. And [she] was nothing like a mourning widow. More like a morning window, and I could see right through her.&quot; Not classic stuff, but if the rest had at least attempted this style the book could have attained a kind of punny vitality. But no. It doesn't attempt real spoofery, and it certainly is not authentic.It's like boys playing in sandbox much too vast for them. Descriptions of drinks and cigars give the impression that the authors just wanted to feel naughty, while a scene where the hero talks his way out of being killed by a thug is especially contrived, obvious and amateurish. Other aspects detract as well, but suffice it to say, Red Harvest this is not.I really can't see true pulp fans being fooled by this, but give it a try... after you've read Chandler and Hammett and James Cain and Paul Cain and Whitfield and Burnett and Daly and Browne and Brown and Huggins and Brackett and Cave and Whittington and Fischer and Ballard and Bellem and Latimer and Martin and MacDonald and Gault and Spicer and Miller and Dewey and Woolrich and Nebel and Gardner and Adams and Davis and Spillane and Kane and Chase and Albert and Halliday and... you see?There are much better out there.

On perception, consider the quote in this book from Karl Menninger, &quot;Attitudes are more important than facts!&quot; Attitude relates to need.

In turn, we receive the benefits of other people's efforts on our behalf. Or as Dr. Schuller puts it, &quot;...the deepest need of the human being is the need to be needed.&quot; We need to use our gifts. Our satisfaction comes from making a difference. Humility is admitting we need help.In reading Dr. Schuller's works, including this one, there is a realization that here is a man who is writing from first hand experience. He so powerfully teaches on forgiveness that you just know only a person who has mastered that challenge can so eloquently address the issue. This is an encouraging look at the Beatitudes. One additional point worth pondering is that Dr. Schuller believes Jesus gave them as a logical progression.

Garwood is an oft-overlooked but nonetheless significant instruction book aimed at the novice fingerstyle guitarist who is interested in learning to play real country blues fingerstyle guitar. It lacks the glossy pizzazz of newer instruction materials, but it truly delivers the goods in terms of solid guitar-learning knowledge.When this book first came out it was one of only two available study resources for this style of playing (the other being Happy Traum's book). Now of course there are literally thousands of instruction resources available. And yet I always think of this book first when someone asks me how to learn to play fingerstyle country blues. The reason is that Mr. Garwood the author chose an excellent method: He presents and explains this music in terms of the two most common bass line structures in country blues guitar (alternating bass lines and so-called &quot;monotonic&quot; bass lines common to Delta and Texas playing) and then he teaches these concepts by teaching non-simplified arrangements of many songs originally recorded by two of the classic practitioners of these methods: Mississippi John Hurt of Avalon MS, and Mance Lipscomb of Navasota, TX. As it turns out, the guitar music of these two players is both top-notch deep country blues and has arrangements that are actually accessible to the novice player. The end result is that, upon completing the learning of tunes in this manual, the student is able to play an excellent variety of legitimate country blues tunes in a variety of styles. More importantly, Mr. Garwood's approach to organizing this guitar knowledge serves as an excellent basis for further study. By that I mean specifically that his method of explaining these arrangements in terms of (i) bass line structures and (ii) free-form melody structures going over those bass lines, ... is a great way to approach ANY fingerstyle arrangement of ANY tune.The book has some excellent photos, and the simple, almost crude text layouts have a great retro feel to them. There are also examples of signature tunes by other seminal players like Rev. Gary Davis and John Fahey. The tablature used in this book is as easy to read as TAB gets, particularly for non-music-readers. Lastly, the music of John Hurt and Mance Lipscomb and Gary Gavis etc. is just plain wonderful stuff ... music that is fun to know and play over ones' lifetime.Obviously this book provided me with a lot of useful info in my music life, and even though it's out of print at this time I strongly advise the reader to grab an available copy if at all possible ... a nice addition to a fingerstyle guitar learning library."},{"Title":"The Animal Family","review":"This story by Jarrell is gentle, mythical, and stands the test of time. A short story about a solitary hunter on an island, who meets a mermaid, and together form a family with animals they meet. The tone is warm and soft, kind and at times bittersweet.While perfect for bedtime, cold or rainy days, this book is appealing to me even as i grow older. The subtle lessons about companionship, newness, differences, loneliness, loss, and joy are not forced to the fore. Rather, an old-fashioned sense of creating an environment as a way to tell a story is key here. Inviting wilderness, homely relationships, and just enough magic and mystery to compel the story forward.One of my most treasured books since i was a young child, the is a timeless and infinitely re-readable story."},{"Title":"The Animal Family","review":"This book is truly what you would call a beautifully written piece of literature.

This story has a wonderful, dreamlike quality to it. The words and story flow lyrically and almost timelessly and the descriptions are simple and wonderfully vivid and beautiful. It will apeal to all ages. Children will like the funny story and gentleness of the words and teens and adults will find the deeper meaning as well as appreaciate the lovely scenes.

Not often, but they do happen\\"."},{"Title":"The Animal Family","review":"What an exquisite little gem this book is. I have been bemoaning the lack of great mermaid stories far and wide, and though I've tried a great many, none have ever even touched on the surface of the enchantment and mystery that I'd hoped for until a friend of mine whispered in my ear about The Animal Family. This isn't really strictly a mermaid tale, however, it's really a deceptively simple but layered story of a family that is not born, but made.\\"Once upon a time, there was a hunter who lived alone in the woods, dreaming of those who have left him behind.\\"In just a few pages, the author shows us the hunter's loneliness and makes us want things for him that perhaps he doesn't even let himself dream of.\\"But when the logs had burnt to embers and the embers had burnt away to coals, the man would lie in his bed, warm under the bearskin, and listen to the great soft sound the waves made over and over. It seemed to him it was like his mother singing...Then one evening, as he stands out by the seal rocks on the shore, he hears a song being sung without words....as the hunter stared into the moonlight round the rocks, a sleek wet head came up out of the water, stared at him with shining eyes, and then sank back under and was gone. It was nothing he had ever seen before. Its long shining hair and shining skin were the same silvery blue-green, the color of the moonlight on the water.\\"The hunter and mermaid of course make a life together, and they add to their family with some very unexpected and funny choices. The imagery is evocative and quite beautiful, and the ideas and language were at times so clever that I was chortling as I turned the pages.This is a story written in the traditional lovely, lyrical prose of old-fashioned fairy tales, and one that readers of classics will very much appreciate. The book was published in 1965 and was declared \\"a timeless and universal story\\" as reviewed for the New York Times Book review by none other than P.L. Travers, who also said \\"Occasionally, very rarely--like the spirit of delight--comes a book that is not so much a book but a kind of visitation.

I'd have been in there seven days a week except they were closed on Sunday, which has ever since been my least favorite day of the week.There were several children's librarians there during the years I lived next door, and they all took an interest in me as I was such a voracious reader.

He also wrote a few children's book, most notablyThe Bat-PoetandThe Animal Family, the later published the same year he died and winning the 1966 Newbery Honor. It is wonderfully illustrated by Maurice Sendak - ofWhere the Wild Things Arefame - in beautiful pen and ink drawings.The story is a sort of fable along the lines of Hans Christian Andersen or Lewis Carroll, but updated with a 1960s message. It is about a lonely hunter who lives in a cabin by the sea who with time comes to gather around him a \\"family\\" of very different creatures, first a mermaid, and then a bear, lynx, and human boy. Each is an orphan whose parents have either died or somehow left the scene. They all are very different animals yet find comfort and eventually identity with one another. It is a story in the spirit of the Age of Aquarius, when songs such asFree to Be You and Me and Free to Be a Familyresonated during a cultural revolution in which boundaries of class, race and, in this case, even species were being explored, when everyone was a \\"brother\\" and \\"sister\\".My reading of the story in its 1960s context is only one interpretation, this is not a heavy handed preachy book by any measure, it is timeless in its message about toleration of differences, the power of love to overcome anything (including for a mermaid to live on land, in effect brining a happy ending to Hans Andersen's otherwise brutalThe Little Mermaid), and in particular for those who seek out love and find it in the most un-expected places. It is a short book, easy to read, and poetically written. Over the past 40 years it has found a place close to the heart of many children and adults, I only wish I had discovered it sooner."},{"Title":"The Animal Family","review":"Every once in a while, an author manages to pull off a novel that carries with it the exact tone and magical feeling of a fairy tale. In the genre of The Last Unicorn and The Princess Bride, this beautiful story takes you into a peaceful world where a lonely hunter lives by the sea.The story follows the hunter's efforts to make a family for himself, and to keep that family safe. I don't want to spoil any of the plot points, but I will say that this gentle fable is going to fill each reader with joy and contentment.

While I enjoyed hearing it that way thirty years ago, it is probably even more apt in today's world of blended families. Each chapter is essentially a complete story, which parents will appreciate, not having to battle over whether or not to pursue the cliffhanger into the next chapter. Maurice Sendak's ink drawings are suggestive, and scene-setting, rather than explicit renderings of the characters, inviting children to participate in imagining the world inhabited by the characters.

Their masterworks are often so full of what they have spent a lifetime developing that most of it is lost on those who have not yet put in a significant amount of effort becoming familiar with that artist's style and means of expression. Yet, if one begins with their apprentice works one may become discouraged because they lack the miracles of the masterworks. So, where does one begin?Shakespeare offers the reader an additional challenge of an English that is removed in style and idiom from us by 400 years. It is not an insurmountable challenge. In fact, it is quite easy to overcome with a bit of time reading it and getting into the flow. It just seems strange in the beginning, but it really does become easy to read once you spend some time with it. However, getting over that small hill has kept many from enjoying the glories of Shakespeare.This play, \\"The Comedy of Errors\\", is clearly an early work. It has many virtues, but despite them it does not offer much of what we really value in Shakespeare. It is a very fine play and is constructed very well. It is a wonderful first work to read of Shakespeare because it is short and has a very simple plot. The new reader does not have to spend much effort contemplating characters or the immense subtlety of language of the great works. Its charms are direct and what it has to offer is pretty much on the surface of the words.The plot is, like all farces, ridiculous. It involves twin brothers who are served by twin slaves. They are separated early in life and when the play opens one set does not know the other exists. One set (the Antipholus and Dromio from Syracuse) visits Ephesus where the other set (the Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus) lives. The play involves people confusing the two sets to the bewilderment of those suffering from the confusion. It really is quite funny. Of course, eventually, all is resolved to everyone's delight.This edition, like all of the individual editions Arden offers of these plays, has a wonderful opening essay that offers a great deal of background on the play including a discussion of its performance history, sources, and discussion of the play itself. The appendices in the back offer excerpts from the sources and some brief information on the Gray's Inn performance of 1594.If you desire to study Shakespeare and are willing to spend time reading many of his plays, \\"The Comedy of Errors\\" is a good work to start with just to ease into the language and get a feel for some of the conventions of Elizabethan theater. Just don't stop here. Shakespeare has so much more to offer that you owe it to yourself to continue your exploration of this supreme artist."},{"Title":"The Comedy of Errors (New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"The Comedy of Errors is about two sets of twins that were separated during their childhood years. The younger twins decide to take the names of their older siblings out of respect. This causes many mishaps between the twins and the people they encounter. Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse set out to Ephesus to look for their siblings and this is where the misadventures begin. This play is classified as a comedy. The beginning starts out with Antipholuses father being sentenced to death. Further into the play it begins to very funny. There are so many details and confusions that you can't help but to be lost and confused about the plot. This play is enjoyable and will continue to keep your interest throughout the play. The mishaps start out as comical and eventually become more serious. People begin to be accused of crimes they did not commit and two innocent people are sent to jail. Shakespeare gradually builds up the suspense throughout the play and then ends the play with a scene where the characters are given reason to the previous incidents. The irony of the story and the constant confusion of the story will cause you to begin reading and not be able to stop until you have completely finished the play. The many jokes and puns in the play will also contribute to your amusement. Like my humanities teacher says, &quot;You don't understand it? GOOD! That means that Shakespeare did his job well.&quot; The main purpose of this play is to completely confuse you and make you laugh while doing it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a laugh and an intellectual challenge."},{"Title":"The Comedy of Errors (New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's vision grew tremendously over the course of his writing career. However, this play demonstrates that his uncanny power as an artist grew quickly and was present in some form from the very begining. It is exceedingly hard to buy the common notion that this was his first comedy when it is so much better than &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; in nearly every way. The dialogue is fast paced and screamingly funny. The characters interesting if broad and there are some surprising touches that, aside from being interesting in and of themselves, point down the road to later, darker comedies. Chief among these is the amazing opening, perhaps still unequaled in all comedy for the level of grimness. These are the first words uttered in a play long seen as a kind of sitcom of Shakespeare's plays: &quot;Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, and by the doom of death end woes and all.&quot; The speaker is Egeon, a merchant about to be put to death for simply coming from the wrong country. The whole first scene feels like a cloud is hanging over it and there is a sense of fear-infused urgency that catches the mind off guard and makes the joyous, lunatic story all the more welcome while at the same time coloring it with real drama, making it all the more exciting. To be sure, there is little real depth and much of the play is like a sitcom but only the best of sitcoms and perhaps &quot;Monty Python&quot; at their most absurd is a better comparison. The plot is well chosen (from the Roman comic dramatist Plautus) and well handled. For some reason the play is not well known even among the early comedies which is a shame. It is probably the best of them, even surpassing the wonderful &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. Aside from being an easy read, keep in mind the play is good to perform as it holds up well and doesn't suffer from being tinkered with. I've seen one production that was mostly straightforward but did a few weird things that worked like magic. They would've sunk almost any other Shakespeare comedy. I must also mention the last moment between the two clowns. It is as heart-warming and humane as it is funny. The master is already present AND growing. Do yourself a favor and pick up this play, you'll laugh your head off!"},{"Title":"The Comedy of Errors (New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Usually Shakespeare is easier to watch on stage than to read. Yet this one is bound to confuse no matter what form you experience it in.Two sets of twins, one high born, the other their slaves, are cast in the ocean by a storm during childhood, splitting them into two sets of one son and one slave. Their father, searching for the lost pair, journeys into the right town, Ephesus, at the wrong time. He is to be executed as an political pawn. Meanwhile, the other pair of mismatched twins finds themselves in Ephesus, too, well confusing the good people of Ephesus, including the lost pair's wives.William Shakespeare was just starting as a playwright when he wrote this, a comedy, sometime around 1594. Bigger fish were still to fry. This, his shortest extant play, has plenty of charm and slapstick to go along with what the Pelican edition editor notes are some pretty awful puns based on Elizabethan pronunciations. If you are looking for a good laugh, Shakespeare's a few centuries out of date. \\"Comedy Of Errors\\" works better as an appetizer for meatier Shakespeare works, showcasing his wondrous use of and joy with the English language.Many of the best lines reflect the play's concern about misrepresentation and frustration with life's station:\\"How many fond fools serve mad jealousy?\\" (Act II, scene i)\\"For slander lives upon succession,/Forever housed where it gets possession.\\" (III, i)\\"The venom clamors of a jealous woman/Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.\\" (V, i)\\"Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, where in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?\\" (II, ii)The last line is one of the slaves, Dromio of Syracuse, lamenting another beating at the hands of his master, Antipholus of Syracuse. There's more slave beatings in this play than in the whole of \\"Roots\\", yet in this case they serve as comedy in Homer-strangles-Bart fashion.Much of the rest of the comedy involve confusion between this Antipholus and Dromio and the other pair, who bear the same names, except they are known as Antipholus and Dromio \\"of Ephesus\\". People approach them knowing their names; Antipholus's \\"wife\\" upbraids him for being a stranger to her bed.The Pelican edition is designed to be read with minimal expository interruption, giving you brief explanations of archaic terms but not the historical analysis of, say, Folger editions. I like the latter approach, but have to say I found myself with enough information to juggle here with the text itself. Keeping track of the misadventures of the two sets of mismatched twins requires some concentration.Still, there's real merriment in this play, similar to that found in the superior Shakespeare festival of confusion, \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\". You also get a lot of interesting observations about male-female relations where Shakespeare is either sending up or celebrating the traditional male-dominant order. It's hard to tell.It's hard to tell a lot of things where \\"Comedy Of Errors\\" is concerned. You have fun being kept guessing."},{"Title":"The Comedy of Errors (New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"With copious notes that help contextualize the language, the New Folger Library edition of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; helps ease new readers into Shakespeare while adding a new level of comprehension to those more familiar with the bard's work. The play begins with a lengthy story by Egeon, a melancholy merchant from Syracuse who is sentenced to death in the city of Ephesus. Egeon tells the lamentable tale of how his family was split in two. Years after the tragic event, Egeon's son Antipholus, now an adult, asked about his mother and twin brother. Antipholus then left home in search of them accompanied by his servant Dromio who also has a twin brother separated from him during the same tragedy. Egeon has been searching for his dear Antipholus ever since in hopes of not to losing both his sons for good. After Egeon's tale, we see Antipholus and Dromio who are also in Ephesus. Antipholus of Syracuse eventually runs into his servant's twin, also named Dromio, who is in the service of Antipholus' twin brother who is also named Antipholus. Confused? Well, things get even more jumbled around as identities are mistaken and expectations are boxed on the ears. On the surface, the play concerns the joy companionship and sorrow of separation. Yet examined deeper, the play resonates with, among other things, Platonic themes expressed in &quot;The Symposium,&quot; notions of universal brotherhood, and the confinement of social/political roles. An excellent play at an affordable price, this edition of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; is more than suitable for either academic or entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"The Comedy of Errors (New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"There is no doubt that this comedy of Shakespeare's is delightful, crazy fun. You could call it the father (or mother) of all sit-coms. The play is suitable for middle school production and viewing, with some modifications. For my students and myself I prefer the Folger's edition of Shakespeare's plays for three reasons. First, the footnotes are easy to read and across from the text. 2. The choice of illustrations and 3. The introductory information. When purchasing for my students, though I have tried other publishers, I now always choose Folgers."},{"Title":"The Comedy of Errors (New Folger Library Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare isn't usually pure. I mean we can't label many of his plays as a pure tragedy or a pure drama or pure comedy. King Lear has jokes, A Midsummer Night's Dream has moments of terror, and even a violent revenge play like Titus Andronicus yields subtle psychological insights. But the Comedy of Errors, along with the Merry Wives of Windsor, is one of two Shakespeare plays that can be played as an almost pure farce.The plot revolves around two pairs of twins separated as infants and unaware of each other's existence. Each pair is composed of a servant and a lord; both servants are named Dromio and both lords are named Antipholus; one pair lives in Ephesus where the play takes place, and the other pair lives in Syracuse. At the start of the play, the pair from Syracuse arrives in Ephesus.This is pure commedia dell'arte. It is a farce, a situation comedy, based purely on an an impossible premise involving ludicrous confusions and misunderstandings. Money is given by Antipholus of Ephesus, in order to pay a debt to a merchant, to a surprised Dromio of Syracuse who doesn't quite know what to do with it. The creditor seeing Antipholus of Syracuse on the street asks him for the money but is rebuffed. Antipholus of Syracuse denies ever having seen the wife of the Antipholus of Ephesus. Meanwhile, the intended bride of the Ephesus Dromio henpecks the Syracuse Dromio.Jolly good fun, full of action and slapstick.

This is one play where the laughs never stop. What makes this so phenomenal is that Shakespeare conducts the &quot;errors&quot; or mistaken identities almost the way a good director may conduct a dance. Also, while he maintains the spirited comedy throughout, he also builds the tension. First the &quot;errors&quot; only lead to comical confusion and misunderstandings. Later, the &quot;errors&quot; cause Antipholus of Ephesus to suspect his wife is cheating on him. (If you ask me he had better grounds for suspecting this then the so called noble Othello. After all poor Antipholus of Ephesus was locked out of his own house!) By Act 4.1, the &quot;errors&quot; get more serious. Two innocent people get arrested. By the end of act 4, the &quot;errors&quot; have gotten so intense and out of hand, that not one or two, but SEVERAL of the characters are in serious danger of being physically hurt!

At just under 90 minutes, this is somewhat shorter than some of the other Caedmon Audio recordings, but it presents the complete text of the play in a lively performance.

Instead of expected profound insights into child psychology and wise practical advices, I found a wordy discourse on the life of bees and butterflies, shallow preaching, and amazing ignorance. As a child psychologist she is plain incompetent. One example: describing a situation where a child started crying when a stranger brought in an umbrella and put it on a table, and stopped crying when the umbrella was taken away, the author attributed the crying to some mysterious &quot;love of orderliness&quot; in babies, instead of realizing the obvious fact that the child was simply scared of a large unfamiliar object, as is often the case with small babies. The author is ignorant in general science as well. For example, she claims the knowledge of human anatomy didn't exist at all untill 17th century, completely ignoring the rich experience of ancient Egyptians etc. Overall, this book is outdated, ignorant, and shallow, and is of little practical help in bringing up children."},{"Title":"The Secret Childhood [First Printing]","review":"Since 1936, when her seminal work 'The Secret of Childhood' was first published, Maria Montessori has been the leading figure in promoting a holistic education approach to children of all ages. Concepts as radical as the three fundamental freedoms (the freedom to repeat work, the freedom to move around the classroom and the freedom to choose which work they want to do) that each child should have, blast forth form the pages like a breaking news story.However, the 'secrets' in the book quickly surface as Montessori begins with a look at the traditional perception of the child. She believed that the child was going to be the major concern of the twentieth century and when the education systems that exist today are compared to those of the turn of the 20th century, it can easily be argued that she was right.She does not end with feeble predictions, however, and goes on to talk of how adults have failed children and will continue to do so unless they change their attitude to children. For some this book will not turn out to be the rainbows and cuddly toys that they traditionally associate with books concerning young children! She pulls no punches in condemning those who have held children in such low regard for so long.The psychological features present in the new born child, feature strongly in the early part of the book. Montessori cites the work of Hugo de Vries as a precursor to her work on 'Sensitive Periods', which are essentially, periods of time throughout the child's development where he is able to learn certain life skills. Once these periods are missed, it is unlikely that the child will be able to learn the skill, ever. These skills include speech, mobility and several others. From this snippet alone, it would seem that this work is very important to all parents, or people who are thinking about being parents.Next there is a look at 'Order' and how important a well ordered environment is to the child. It is not as simple as putting everything away so that the child can not hurt him or herself with things or break things. Montessori believes that the child should be encouraged to explore the environment. She believes that the only real way that the child can do this, is if the environment is maintained so that the child can become familiar with its contents. The environment, she is careful to add, is not solely made up of the physical rooms and items, it is also made up of actions, sounds and everything that a child is exposed to.The second part of the book focuses on how to educate the child. As with much that Montessori writes, there is a certain spirituality contained in the book that seems to help adults in their comprehension of the fact that the child is to be perceived as a whole being. Throughout the section that tells a brief history of the first school, there is clearly a more metaphyical nature to this approach of education.The first school was opened in 1907, called Casa dei Bambini. The observations that Montessori took here are the basis for the Method she is famous for and also the overall essence of this book. Montessori, unlike most other educators, designed her classrooms to be 'hands-on' learning environments. She fashioned the equipment based on the work of 19th century education innovators, Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard and Edouard S&eacute;guin, with an emphasis on 'Sensorial' education and what she called 'Practical Life' exercises. (These exercises consisted of everyday tasks such as washing hands and buttoning coats, which she determined, led the children to higher independence). The materials were very didactic and allowed her to focus on the theory that she had of the child needing work for the hands.In the next section, she discusses the observations that she was able to make from the children in this setting. As mentioned earlier, she determined that there were three essential freedoms that the child needed to have in order to be successful. These freedoms are interspersed with observations about various other psychological behaviors that the children displayed. Their propensity for 'order' astounded Montessori and soon she allowed them to put the materials away, instead of having the teacher of the classroom do it. This, seemingly, small incident and many more like it, are the makings of Montessori. Her focus on detail is what allowed her to see beyond what other adults had either failed to see or had chosen to ignore.She continues with interesting information concerning the child's lack of attraction to toys that were placed in the room, due to their focus on the didactic materials that were present instead. She also discusses traditional rewards and punishment systems and how children are typically turned off and unaffected in the way that the system is designed to work. She writes instead, about 'Spontaneous Discipline' which she infers is directly related to the sense of order and the work for the hands.She continues the controversial (in some circles) theme of the book that introduces the role of the child as that of 'worker'. She exponentially speaks of the instincts that the child shows for work and follows this with the differences between the adult's work and the work of the child. Throughout the whole book, the focus that Montessori puts on elevating the child to a higher plane than that of the adult, is constantly noticeable.Her theories of inner growth through work are tied together in the last section also and we see the anthropological expertise that Montessori has brought to this study. She shows the steps that each of us go through to become an adult.In recognizing the wisdom of this great observer of people, this book goes a long way to helping the argument that the child-focused approach is the finest way to create great adults from children."},{"Title":"The Secret Childhood [First Printing]","review":"This is an important work because it highlights what is wrong with common trends in parenting. You learn that the parent is there to foster a positive environment in which a child can thrive. It is not complicated. The child will show you what they need and when they need it.

This is one of her late works, so you will find most of her thoughts in there, but in a way more holistic and generic.All her knowledge is derived from hands-on experience, so consider reading it slowly to grasp all meanings. Ok, Montessori is a bit difficult on working at home (try a good school for better support), but consider and implement some aspects of it and you will soon discover a new child. It is also more generalized, but I think that is the best way to master the genius behind the specific details of her educational system.

Not only easy targets but hardly worth our attention, if we are truly considering the legacy of Guy Debord and his central role in the formation (and dissolution) of the Situationist International.After several tired criticisms (particularly those borrowed from the Encyclopedie des Nuisances) and then a (perfectly reasonable) defence of Raoul Vaneigem's split with the SI, we are presented with a conclusion of sorts:'Conclusions are already clear in the development of our arguement, always suggested by the text and by its gaps.' What does this mean, especially in the clear absence of any 'development' herein? It means the author realized this hatchet job did in fact have nothing to say, and so chose the easiest means of escape from a jumbled invective: red-faced, they storm out of the room."},{"Title":"Guy Debord Is Really Dead","review":"read the thoughts of someone who would die to be Debord but is instead a third-class intellectual. and a mentally handicaped one too.there has been criticism directed against Debord and the SI that has been constructive and insightful. this however is one of the worst literature on the subject - if not THE worst."},{"Title":"American Pioneers: Ives to Cage and Beyond (20th Century Composers)","review":"While not a definitive work on any of the composers featured here, this book quickly gets you where you need to be to get a handle on what makes these musical whackos tick.

This is a bridge linking the two major classics from Locke, An Essay concerning Human Understanding and the Two Treatises of Government. In this volume, we see Locke's dependence on Stoic philosophy (especially that of Seneca) and the effect that Aristotelian philosophy had on him.&quot;As the Strength of the Body lies chiefly in being able to endure Hardships, so also does that of the Mind. And the great Principle and Foundation of all Vertue and Worth, is . . . That a Man is able to deny himself his own Desires, cross his own Inclinations, and purely follow what Reason directs as best, tho' that appetite lean the other way.&quot; And how does one do this? Locke's answer is through education (i.e., through habit).Anyone wishing to understand the thought and philosophy of Locke, can not afford to ignore this volume in the corpus of Lockean writings. This edition is a very scholarly edition, there is another modern edition available as well. To bad the editors of the Clarendon Edition of the Works of John Locke are not very organized, at the rate these volumes are being produced, the complete writings will not be available during my lifetime.The world needs a modern edition of the writings of Locke, he is too important a thinker not to have this - if nothing else, for us inspiring Lockean scholars. :o)"},{"Title":"Some thoughts concerning education (Pitt press series)","review":"This is amazingly accessible for a book written 320 years ago. A small bit of his vocabulary is archaic, and his delivery is more wordy than is common in modern prose. Still, today's reader will find interest in the ideas, not just the book's place in history.To place him in history, Locke's life spanned the last three quarters of the 17th century. He followed the scientific revolution initiated by Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton, whom he admired, and the philosopher Thomas Hobbes. An early philosophe, he predated Burke, Hume, Voltaire and Rousseau by about a century.While Locke was a doctor, certainly the worst advice in the book has to do with medicine. Although the scientific revolution had begun, it had not progressed to the point of evidence-based theories of disease. As one example, Locke proposes that his upper-class readers put their children in thin cloaks and shoes, so they will be toughened by exposure to cold. No thought of isolating them from bugs.Fully half of the book used dedicated to the moral and ethical formation of a child. He discourses at length on what to do about children who lie, daydream, are cruel to animals, are querulous (froward), inattentive, rude, bashful and otherwise imperfectly formed in character. He is very classic in his view that one must educate the whole child. In fact, he only gets around to talking about academic subjects in the last fifth of the book, opening with the quote \\" Learning. -- You will wonder, perhaps, that I put learning last, especially if I tell you I think it the least part.\\"Before getting to academics, he addresses dancing, which he believes is useful to a child in many ways; music, which he thinks is not worth the considerable time it takes to master; drawing, which he thinks is a skill every gentleman should possess; swimming, which is salubrious for the health and can save your life; fencing and horseback riding, which are essential gentlemanly skills.Young children need to learn how to read and write. It is important that they learn naturally. Being forced to learn can sour the experience for them and get their whole academic career off to an unfortunate start. Children should be surrounded by reading and writing, and be led to exercise them for pleasure.In this context, children should not be asked to read texts that are beyond their appropriate level of difficulty, or that are foreign to the child's natural interests. He specifically says that any attempt to read the Bible in order would be seriously misplaced. Children should be taught the essential Bible stories such as the story of creation, Abraham and Isaac, Joseph in Egypt, Daniel in the lion's den and so forth in a simple form and in such a way that they tell a moral. In other words, children should be familiar with the Bible as a cultural touchstone of Christian society.Locke was surprisingly modern in his religious views. Rather like the philosophes who followed him and the deists who established the American government, he thought that the Christian religion was a good thing even though he says that there are some items of faith that simply cannot bear scientific investigation. Familiar with gravity from Newton's work, he posited that the great flood might have been caused by a shift in the Earth's center of gravity. But he quickly says that this is the kind of inquiry we ought not to undertake; there is a clear divide between the worlds of natural science and religion, and we make a mistake if we confound the two.Then on to academics. Foreign languages are important in the measure that a person will use them in life. That is saying, the ability to speak a living language is a considerable asset. Knowledge of grammar, he believed, is not nearly so important. Latin is not worth the time that was usually given to it in his age, and Greek is important only for the professional scholar.Locke believed the geography and history were very important. He also believed, contrary to my experience with modern students, that they are intrinsically interesting. He believed that every person should master arithmetic, geometry, and rhetoric. Memorizing long passages in foreign languages, however, and writing poetry he characterizes as fruitless wastes of time, the development of life skills that are simply not remunerative for most people.Concluding his advice on academics, Locke went on to say that the child should be familiar with the manual skills, the crafts such as carpentry, gardening and the like. He advocated that learning manual skills is essential in mental development. He recommended that a child learn bookkeeping, inasmuch as he would someday be in the position of managing an estate.The whole book is written with a great sense of humanity. Locke treats the child as an adult in the process of formation, fully worthy of dignity, not to be beaten or dominated in any way for any purpose other than character development. Locke supports corporal punishment, but only as a last resort, only when authorized by the father, and only upon occasion, to reinforce a specific instruction. His philosophy is quite consistent with the practice in American schools even through the 1960s or 1970s, when Benjamin Spock was ascendant, until the principle of individual responsibility faded as therapeutic schools of child rearing became ascendant. Put another way, Locke believed firmly in free will. Every child is a moral actor, responsible for his own actions, and it is the responsibility of the parent to develop that moral character.I leave it to other reviewers to recite the ways in which Locke's views tie out to those of Aristotle and his other philosophical precursors. To me the news is in how well he outlined the path going forward from his era into our own."},{"Title":"A kind of loving","review":"Vic Brown becomes infatuated with Ingrid Rothwell, thinks for a while that he loves her, but realizes he doesn't.

Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and I still don't like it. It is all about this guy named Vic who gets this girl Ingrid pregnant and then decides he has to marry her rather than face the derision of the people in his town. Then he moves into his Mother In Law's house with his new wife. That was his second mistake. Naturally the two of them don't get along and Ingrid becomes indifferent to his sexual advances causing tension in the household.Ingrid then loses the baby through a miscarriage caused by an accident and then Vic has no valid reason to stay with her. He goes to his sister who he has always had a close relationship with who advises him to stay married!!! That was probably the worst piece of advice I have ever read in a book. This is what happens when you care more about what people think of you rather than having the courage to stand alone and be different from the rest of the herd. The author give a very sad portrait of Working Class Life in England during the sixties and I am glad that we have moved on the a more progressive Society.Vic is a sad example of an egocentric guy who is ruled by his pathetic sexual needs.

It asks important questions. Do we wish to live in a pluralistic society? Should a culture base its actions solely on religous beliefs? What is absolute and what is relative?More importantly, it outlines the use of religion in the pursuit of political power. This is not just a cynical view but rather is based on documented past human behavior and the current political behavior of the Republican Party.Unlike one of the reviewers, I think that there is an issue here and it is not \\"overblown.\\" Do we as a nation want our tax dollars being used to support organizations that descriminate in hiring based on creed? Individuals who believe that abortion is a sin have every right to object to their tax dollars supporting that activity. People who believe that the State should not support religious organizations have every right to object to the practices attributed to the Salvation Army in NYC (of all places).Seemingly insignificant movements have, in the past, achieved over time and in the setting of favorable circumstances great power and done great damage. Absolutism of any stripe leads to fascism and dehumanization.I do not think that Goldberg is an urbanite, elitist intellectual who is divorced from rural & religious America. I do think she is concerned, thoughtful and relatively balanced. Given her ethnicity, it is very likely that members of her family (perhaps distant though they may be) directly suffered from the dehumanization of an Absolute Ideology (no need to even spell it) in Europe during the middle of the 20th century.We should bear in mind that the Constitution was designed by individuals very close to the arbitrary and absolutist tendencies of European governance. They well recognized the historical lessons from a region of the world that experienced virtually continuous civil war for centuries. Our Constitution was designed to protect us from people like the Taliban, the Nazis, the extremists on the Religious Right, etc. The Constitution outlines a process based on rules to balance and distribute power. Most disturbing were Goldberg's comments on the effort being expended to limit the power of the judiciary in this balance of power equation.A worthwhile read which lead to my taking some of the recommended steps outlined in Goldberg's book."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Make no mistake about it, there are millions of passionate conservative Christians intent on taking over America and Goldberg does a darn good job explaining exactly how they plan to do it. Mobilize the Churches, home school the kids, create Think Tanks, buy media, own publishing companies, find Evangelical Colleges, takeover local government, obsess about abortion and gay marriage. This isn't a book about political theory--this is book about on-the-ground tactics. Goldberg has done her homework--attended the conferences, toured the campuses, interviewed dozens of Christian nationalists. But don't expect a cool nuanced presentation, Goldberg is mighty offended and plenty worried and not the least bit afraid to let it show."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Reading the review that John submitted, below, made me wonder if he read Goldberg's book at all. If he did, he'd know that she would agree with him on many of the points he offers to counter her arguments. Goldberg very clearly states that this book is not addressing the majority of evangelicals. At her reading here in DC, in fact, she told us that she's been invited to numerous churches throughout the country (including evangelical congregations) who are angry at Christian nationalists for appropriating Christianity in such a corporate, militant, and political way.And, Goldberg has her facts straight. She travelled around the country to the megachurces (they only look like malls, John), interviewing politicians, talking with Christians. She is careful not to offer facts without telling us where they came from, and in most cases, the quotations make the point without much commentary at all.Anyone who denies that Christian nationalism is not shaping our country isn't paying attention. The Christian nationalists themselves don't hide it at all (that would be against their Christian mission). There are numerous quotations from very public Christian nationalists that echo what George Grant, of Coral Ridge Ministries wrote in his book The Changing of the Guard: Biblical Principles for Political Action: \\"Christians have an obligation, a mandate, a commission, a hold repsonsibility to reclaim the land for Jesus Christ, to have dominion in cicil structures, just as in every other aspect of life and godliness. . . it is Dominion we are after . . .World conquest.\\" How could anyone come up against these people and deny that they have an agenda? In fact, if James Dobson, Tim LaHaye, George Bush, Pat Robertson or any of the other MEN in Christian nationalist power were to actually read this book, I doubt that they would argue with most any of it.Of course I've been piecing this all together every time I read the newspaper or listen to talk radio. So, for me, Goldberg's book clarified what I already knew. It is a cohesive history of this movement and if I doubted my \\"hunches\\" about any of it, I no longer do. However, Goldberg's book isn't just about the fact that it's happening; it's also about WHY it's happening. Goldberg asserts that our sprawl, our capitalism-above-all-else, our need for an enemy when there's no obvious choice, our lack of connection with our fellow Americans, have turned us into people who crave a sense of community, a place where we can be a part of something bigger than our 9-5 jobs. And, realizing that working so hard just to be good consumers is actually an empty existence, makes us want to be a part of something meaningful, or at least something that seems meaningful."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I found this book quite disturbing, especially early on. Goldberg meticulously and relentlessly chronicles heartland America's infatuation with Christian fundamentalism. If it was simply their own personal delusions, that would be disheartening enuf, but Goldberg reports that they want to impose their beliefs on our nation and thus she dubs it \`Christian nationalism'. It might well be called \`Christian extremism' just as in the Mideast comparable behavior and goals are called \`Islamic extremism'. This is nothing new -- indeed Constantine imposed on the Roman Empire his approved variety of Christianity which dominated Europe for a thousand years until the Enlightenment. Our Founding Fathers were close enuf to those times to realize the importance of separating church and state.Two thoughts lifted my spirits somewhat. As she describes them, Christian nationalists seem so over-the-top and embolden by their successes with the Bush administration that they appear to be overplaying their hand. Hopefully they'll shoot themselves in the foot but Goldberg urges us moderates and liberals to take an active role in helping that happen. In the final chapters she describes actions she believes are urgently needed to win the \`fight'.The other thought derives from her quote on page 105 of a Baptist preacher's wife, \\"... genuinely upset about the social consequences she attributed to evolution... She also blamed Darwinism for creating existential despair. If evolution is true, life has no meaning, she said. \`Where's this universe heading? What's the purpose of it all? There's no standard, no guidelines.'\\" Does this mean that if Christians could see a \`purpose' in evolution, they'd embrace it? And on page 191-2 Goldberg says \\"Ideologies that answer deep existential needs are hugely powerful. The Christian nationalists have one and their opponents largely do not.\\" But by carefully scrutinizing where evolution's come from and where it's going -- what I call \`evolution's trajectory' in my book \\"Concepts\\" -- I propose an ideology which I believe can be embraced by both liberals and thinking Christians alike, and thus avoid the fight Goldberg advocates. Perhaps a way of getting these Christians to think outside their religious box is for them to recognize the contradiction in their rejection of science while embracing the benefits of science in medicine, food, travel, communication &c.; For example, the mega-churches where they hear science denounced have sophisticated electric lighting, electronic audio & video, heating & air conditioning &c;, all of which are results of science.Certainly Goldberg's book's essential reading. But then go to my book's Amazon webpage and type \`evolution's trajectory' in its \`Search inside this book' box. Might it provide a common ground?"},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"If you have ever wondered what really drives Christian Nationalist, Right Wing Conservative, political-social prowess, READ THIS BOOK! The Christian Right is a real threat to the foundations of American civil liberties and human rights in general. I found Kingdom Coming to be well researched and eloquently written. The facts laid out in the book constantly build upon one another weaving a movie-like diabolical plot masterminded by the conservative religious leaders and their political allies. Read this book, get all the facts and decide for yourself. Either way, open your eyes to what really underlies the tie betweeb religion and politics in America."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Kingdom Coming is a political/social book about the rise of the Religious Right and its tenacious efforts to change the law of the land and sway public opinion over to its side. Once considered a group of radicals whose ideas were too extreme to worry about, the various organizations and individuals aligned with the Religious Right have succeeded to a far greater extent than anyone imagined. How the different components of the Religious Right managed to accomplish this feat is the main subject of this book; complete with methodology exposed, tactics revealed, and strategies examined.Probably the greatest concern to Goldberg and others like her is the Religious Right's use of deceptive tactics to sway the public. The use of reason was getting them nowhere, so they decided in the late 1980's to adopt other strategies to persuade the public over to their side. Running \\"stealth\\" election campaigns (not letting the public know a trained candidate's true agenda until after the election), finding and/or training scientists and PhD's to support and give credence to the Religious Right cause, conducting biased studies, etc., are all well- known and well- documented instances of unethical persuasion. Since many of the ideas of the members of the radical Religious Right were anti- liberty, unreasonable, and often illogical, its members decided to turn to the next level and seek out highly educated individuals who were sympathetic to the cause. Once the public heard that several people with Ph.D's were supporting Religious Right ideologies, the credibility of their claims would be strengthened and more people would be convinced to accept them. This strategy was key to the growing influence of Religious Right dogma, and Goldberg spends considerable time talking about these and other deceptive tactics used by these people in their attempts to move the United States closer to theocracy.Goldberg successfully exposes many of the tactics used by the Religious Right and while many of them are well- known, they are often surprising for their obvious level of deceit. One is the concept of \\"Intelligent Design\\". There was no such term in the past- it was created by the members of the Religious Right for the sole purpose of introducing creationism into the school classrooms. Since the radicals knew they would never get away with inserting religious dogma into the science textbooks, they decided instead to disguise their ideas as science. By then creating a term like \\"Intelligent Design\\", they were able to give the idea scientific clout; making it sound like an official doctrine of science that, therefore, should be included in school textbooks. It really is a clever strategy, if you think about it. It's an act of complete and total deception and it ranks right up there with some of the better political strategies of recent history.I like the way Goldberg wrote this book. Her approach is dead- on and her writing is highly effective. She even manages to write in a respectful way when she talks about some of these adversaries- an admirable feat, considering the use of deception so common in the movement's political strategies. She is obviously very concerned about the destruction of basic liberties and civil rights that will invariably occur if the ideals of the Religious Right really do become law. Legalized abortion is only the tip of the iceberg. There are many, many other areas where the Religious Right wants to stick its collective nose, and in almost every instance, personal liberty would be tossed to the wayside in favor of strict religious dogma.Overall, Kingdom Coming is a very good political book about one of the most critical social issues of our time. The Religious Right and its many members and organizations may not ever succeed at making the United States government an all- out theocracy. But its ability to chip away at personal freedom should be viewed with concern by all Americans. Like Goldberg states plainly, the American way of life and Constitutional guarantees are at stake. Once a few rights have vanished, the road will be paved for further erosion of basic liberties as the nation inches closer and closer to religions/fascist- style of government rule."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I'm a member of the choir to which Michelle Goldberg preached. I find Christian totalitarianism to be a frightening aspect of American life, and I find it distressing that America has a president who supports even the most terrible aspects thereof. I have lived away from America, where I was born, for 16 years now, and I grieve for her. The vast value in Ms Goldberg's book is the last chapter in which she advises on what to do about Christian totalitarianism. It is not enough to be horrified about the fact that these are people who deny individual rights while screeching without foundation that theirs are being violated, that they are raising generations of moronic robots through the process of home-schooling which, in my view, has not been adequately considered or investigated. The Christian coalition boasts most particularly of its vast grassroots movement, and those who stand for America's true promise must have one of the same. Why are there no liberal mega-churches? Surely believers in the empowerment of God and not the narrow-minded bigotry of some of His children would enjoy communion with the thousands, as well. Why are there not more organizations such as MoveOn, and why does MoveOn not recognize more thoroughly that it is specfically social issues which are dividing America?Ms Goldberg's book has two passages which seem most remarkable to me, in part because she chooses not to comment on either. One quotes General Tommy Parks, familiar as a war commentator on television, talking about the dangers to democracy which Christian totalitarianism might bring about. What was the forum which General Parks chose? Remarkably, it was \\"Cigar Afficionado\\" magazine. The second features a Christian \\"abstinence\\" lesson in which two teenage girls are presented talking about sex. One says that Mr. McDonald said one thing about it while the other says that Mr. Egan said another. The lesson apparently is that teenage girls should be discussing sex with adult males whom they call by their surname and who, therefore, are clearly not relatives. I believe that this can stand without comment.Ms Goldberg has written a most important book. Some, like myself, will read it for the vicarious vindication of long-held beliefs. Others must read it for a better understanding of a cultural force which has been trampling on the freedoms of America ever since George Bush and his minions stole the election of 2000. I say again -- read it! Read it, read it, read it, read it!"},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Unfortunately I am unable to give this book more than five stars. This is a very important book on many different levels. Several other books have described the origins and current organizations that make up the religious right, however, this book actually talks to the grass roots people who fuel this movement.Probably the most disturbing aspect of this book is the implications for the very the country that we live in. Although a Christian type theocracy is not imminent, we live among a large number of people who actually want such a thing and are activly working towards it. These people are determined and very tough, admirable qualities no doubt, unfortunately their beliefs are lacking in reality, to put it kindly.The scariest thing about these people is that evidence does not matter to them, so there is no room for thoughtful discussion as the author points out. It is impossible to discuss the merits of a scientifically based theory like evolution with people who are closed off because of their literal belief in a non-scientific book like the bible that was written thousands of years ago.Many ask why there is so much divisivness in politics these days, I believe this is the reason. We are currently divided among those of us who live our lives based on the observable world around us, and those who live based on Faith and belief in an unbelievable all powerful being. By definition, Faith is belief without evidence, so the often times the less evidence, the stronger the belief. This creates an enormous chasm between the two camps because there is little if any common ground. There is literally nothing you can say to such people to change their minds, which is why religion is the number one cause of war in this world.In the end, I fear that the Liberal Democratic Republic that we currently live in is in great danger. Those of us who do not agree with this nonsense will be marginalized or worse, and unless something drastic happens, more and more religous zealots will be elected to office. These zealots clearly have an agenda, and are seriuos about implementing it for all of us whether we like it or not. P.S. If anyone questions the chasm between the reality based world and the faith based world, simply look at some other reviews of this book, and I am sure you will see that they are divided in much the same way."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I read a genuine horror story the other day.The story takes place in a powerful country, the mightiest superpower in its world, with seemingly limitless financial and especially military resources. The world this country was a part of hade - at least in some parts - reached a scientific and technological level utterly unimaginable only a few decades before, and in many places throughout this world its inhabitants were able to enjoy a comfortable life where more or less every single aspect of their daily lives had been taken over by technology. But alas, this luxury was not for everyone, and in many parts of the world the people still lived in extreme poverty, where warfare, starvation, natural disasters and other calamities made life an eternal suffering. However, the inhabitants of the particular superpower had no reason to worry about this; even though its military forces on a regular basis went to war with various nations across the world in order to, as the people in charge put it, \\"fight for freedom\\". Yet, while technology and scientific reasoning offered answers to most of life's questions, irrational superstitions and over 2000 year old religious teachings (originating in a different country in a different part of the world) still lingered; and when the reader is introduced to the story the religious fundamentalists have somehow managed to penetrate every aspect of society in ways never heard of before.And the real horror of it all is that it's not fiction. It's a true story. The country in question is the U.S., and its fundamentalists are the sympathizers of Christian Nationalism, a quasi political-religious movement struggling for a complete and literal interpretation of the Bible. Michelle Goldberg, a journalist who has written for, among others, Rolling Stone and The Guardian, has with Kingdom Coming written a very revelatory expos&eacute; of how the Christian right, especially after \\"president\\" Bush came to power, has grown ever stronger and are now starting to pose a serious threat to liberalism and freedom of choice.Unimaginable sums of money have been distributed to a myriad of religious organizations (almost exclusively, however, to those with a Christian identity) due to Bush's so-called Faith-Based Initiative, at public schools across the nation the debate rages whether or not Darwinian evolutionary theory is a good thing to teach students, homosexuality is still an extremely hot topic for millions of conservatives, and so on. And the feelings involved are strong indeed, because, as Goldberg so accurately puts it: \\"There's no greater motivation than the conviction that one is following God's order.\\" (Page 193)Throughout the book Goldberg - who writes about such a complicated issue as politics in such a non-complicated manner that readers with little or no political knowledge will be able to follow her reasoning - highlights different layers of society that the ultra conservative Christians attempt to change, or have already succeeded in changing. She travels across the country, meeting believer after believer, and it soon becomes apparent that even though the fundamentalists are still far from a complete takeover, the vision they have in mind is indeed a frightening one; an America structured as a theocracy, where the people live exclusively according to biblical teachings and despise such things as equality between the sexes, abortions, sexual freedom, scientific research and education, and more.Yeah, it's pretty creepy alright, and it's easy to dismiss the believers simply as religious freaks. However, the issue is quite complicated, and it's very dumb indeed to dismiss or ridicule the voices raised. After all, representatives from the Christian right have the same right to voice they opinions as everyone else, even if these opinions happen to be that abortion doctors should be put to death or gay people cast out from civilized society: \\"Such infringements should be fought for reasons both principled, because Christians have the same right to free speech as everyone else, and political, because these abuses generate a backlash that ultimately harms the cause of such church/state separation.\\" (Page 206)Kingdom Coming is a truly frightening book describing a U.S. most people, especially non-Americans, didn't even know existed. That the mightiest country in the world can be the home to such a large - and influential - group of extreme religious fanatics is troubling, to say the least, but it's even more troubling that most people don't know about it. The refusal to face reality is not a good way to learn. The sections where Goldberg describes her meetings with various Christian fundamentalists are definitely the most interesting sections in the book, and had only these sections lasted a little longer and been larger in number the book would have turned out even more interesting and important than it already is."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"This book gives a look behind the curtain. It shows how those who would make our government into a fundamentalist Christian theoracy go about convincing us to do that.Their methods are based on fomenting hate, setting people against one another, creating THEYs. \\"THEY want to steal away our Christian nation.\\" \\"THEY want to destroy the institution of marriage.\\"All who believe in separation of church and state, and all who believe our government, rather than being established as a Christian nation, was established to be pluralistic and to protect the rights of minorities, should read this book.

It is less than 30 days until the 2012 election, and the \\"best choice\\" figurehead of the movement so well described in this work, is... according to the polls, potentially electable. Which, to me, is a horrifying prospect particularly in light of the information contained in this book.Our collective electorate is, I fear, sorely lacking fully developed rational capacities. Logical and obvious reasons for this are nicely articulated in this well written and well researched book.Many of the names Michelle Goldberg names, are now part of the national dialog. Not the least; Rick Santorum and his buddy the Second Coming of Christ the Rev. Moon himself. I can only wonder what Michelle Goldberg makes of her subject now that her namesake (Bachman) and Sarah Palin are with us.So. If you want to know what is REALLY going on in the USA, right now, read this book. The book may be six years old, but is more true now than when it was written. You will be disturbed.

We will see who laughs last. When they take over a political party and start steam rolling the country to impose their religious belief's...that's when I take them seriously!Kingdom Coming: The rise of Christian Nationalism by Michelle Goldberg. I bought this several months ago and finally got around to reading it recently. I read her almost every day on the Daily Beast and have often admired her work and honesty. She was on one of the shows I watch nightly on MSNBC and the book was advertized so I bought a paperback copy of it. I found it a very enlightening work well written, articulate and accurate when it comes to the facts and details. I have read several other books in the same vein including Chris Hedges 'American Fascist's' several years ago. These are scary people and every person in this country needs to inform themselves about and their agenda. Because they are a real live threat to our Democracy and our way of life that's coming from within. What they are proposing would be tyranny plain and simple. We are not a Christian nation they claim nor have we ever been one. Because there are a lot of us dwelling in the country who are not Christian, my whole family included. It doesn't make much difference what our religion is or if we have none...we have been here before the Civil War and have as much right to be here as anyone.I can see why some considered this a left wing paranoid rant. That type never fails to (the biggest mystery is why did they bother buying it to begin with when the title said it all). It doesn't present these Christian's in a very flattering light. And most Christian's have an extremely hard time looking at themselves as they really are. And I am only speaking of those Christian Reconstructionist's and Dominists...no other main stream Christian's. Myself I could care less what another person's religious beliefs are...until they start imposing them on me in the form of laws. Until they start insisting we are a Christian nation and our laws should be based on their religion. That's when they are going too far. It presents them as they truly are, a terrifying group of people with a vision of Christianizing this country despite the Constitution. Most of those who criticize it the loudest don't know enough about this country to know that most who founded it were Deists which is not Christian (check Wikipedia). One of the many reasons why a Separation of Church and State was added to the First Amendment. A lot of people at the time (Christian's included) feared one religion ruling which was the order of the day in the early days of colonial America. This country was awash in religious intolerance Garry Wills 'Head and Heart' a history of religion in this country. A lot of Christian's still fear those who are willing to impose religion in government. When that happens all other religions are eventually persecuted. Our founding fathers wrote the Godless Constitution the Christian's now erroneous claim as theirs. It wasn't left out by accident. Nowhere in the document does it say God! Even if it did there are numerous God's the world over.But, what I found even more disturbing are those who dismissed Ms Goldberg as a Jewish elitist or intellectual. Who accused her of hating Christianity among other things. It looks to me like anti-Semitism is alive and well in this country too. You can scoff all you want and call her an alien from outer space. But, in reality you are the ones who are the fools. It's right under your noses and growing while you laugh. So hiding your head in the sand isn't going to make them go away."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Goldberg successfully chronicles and documents in one slim volume all of the issues that progressive liberals are so uncomfortable with in the America of the 21st century -- the rise of Christian nationalism. Chapter by chapter, the author discusses the right's attack on federal judges, the teaching of evolution in schools, secular society, and women's rights to choose. There is a very scary segment within our population that has a firm hold on the Republican party and the people that Goldberg reports on are it. Goldberg achieves a good balance between first-hand reporting and anecdotal chronicling of this rising movement."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Another great book documenting the malignant and rapidly-spreading tumor that threatens to destroy not only our great SECULAR nation but the entire modern ( read ADVANCED ) world and all the painstaking progress we humans have made over the past 500 years. Make no mistake: these so-called Christian nutjobs want to turn back the clock to a romanticized vision they have of something called \\"Biblical Times\\", when everyone - especially women and slaves - knew their place, and all was right with the world. Of course these modern-day religious freaks are enjoying the fruits of the Enlightenment and scientific progress by living much longer and healthier lives; they fly in airplanes and go to medical doctors, neither of which existed in the good old days. Many of these people live in the deep south, where the heat and humidity are legendary but, thanks to SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS they are comfortable in their air conditioned cars and houses and HUGE Mega-churches - again, none of that in Biblical times. I say let these people live ouit their visions and dreams: send them back to where they think they came from, the roaring-hot Middle East, with no technologies invented after the year 1. See how much they like that, and then they can get back to the rest of us with an update - presumably written on parchment. But - wait! Most people there and then were illiterate. They'll have to make it an Oral Tradition for a few generations before somebody - the world's first used car dealer? - figures out \\"writing\\" and \\"paper\\". But then that would be \\"progress\\", and progress ( and of course Progressives ) is Bad, very Bad.This book is a great clarion call for all rational and reasonable and patriotic citizens to wake up and turn back the tide of these idiots, before it's too late."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"This book intrigued me. When I first read it I didnt like alot of it, but the more I re-read it the more I like it. And then I saw the author on C-SPAN and was so impressed. Hope C SPAN does a repeat of her piece, since it is one of the best segments they have done in a long time.The New York Times had a piece by Neela Banerjee titled Religious Left Struggles to Find Unifying Message where the author writes of a recent gathering at All Souls Unitarian Church in NYC where '1,200 of them from 39 states, to wrest the mantle of moral authority from conservative Christians, and they were finally planning how to take their message to those in power'. And that at a session on ethical behavior, including sexual behavior, the 50 or so activists talked little about what to tell Congress about abortion or same-sex marriage preferring to talk about fluffy stuff. And that 'Since the last presidential election, liberals of various faiths have talked about taking back religion from the conservative Christians who helped bring President Bush and a Republican Congress to power. Yet liberal believers have so far been unable to approach, even modestly, the success of the religious right and command the attention of Congress'.The article notes that the turnout at the Spiritual Activism Conference is high, but if the gathering is any indication, the biggest barrier for liberals may be their regard for pluralism. Rev. Tony Campolo, an outspoken liberal Baptist minister from Pennsylvania who once served as a spiritual adviser to President Bill Clinton, and attended the conference. \\"The thing about the left is that they want everybody to feel good.' Then a young man in a tunic stood and challenged him by saying 'I thought this was a spiritual progressives' conference,he said. \\"I don't want to play the game of 'the Bible says this or that,' or that we get validation from something other than ourselves. We should be speaking from our hearts.'Which brings me back to this book Kingdom Coming by Michelle Goldberg. In the chapter Exiles in Jesusland the author writes 'Whenever I talk about the growing power of the evangelical right with friends and acquaintances, they always ask the same question: What can we do? Usually I reply with a joke: Keep a bag packed and your passport current. I don't really mean it, but my underlying anxiety is genuine.' I and many other would agree with this 100%. I have been on Yahoo boards where we ALL agreed that with GWB in the White House we better all have our passports up to date. And some of us intentionally visit favorite countries often even invest in second homes because we do fear the right wing. What troubles me is the author seems to think that its religious conservatives that are the biggest threat, when I believe its conservative extremists of ANY kind that who pose a threat.As someone who attends state and local government meetings its appalling how the conservatives turn out, and the liberals or progressives stay home. The squeaky wheel gets the grease is what I was taught as a kid. Sadly I have friends who are conservative who for years have religiously written monthly or more often to their elected officials to 'short and sweet' about issues of concern. My progressive friends don't. And the liberal friends I have, only turn up for demonstrations. So my question is WHY aren't those who are so upset with the religious right and GWB crowd doing much to change things? That's a big part of the 'solution.'If non religious right types are to take this country back to some form of sanity, then we had better show that we stand for some moral and ethical absolutes. And yes, liberals do have morals and ethics. Just as agnostics and atheists do!And I do take issue with her stereotyping of groups like local militia. Maybe she simply doesn't know there are progressive type militias. From my firsthand experience we are concerned about avoiding messes like what happened after hurricane Katrina when so many people expected government to take care of them. The local militia people I known are concerned about survival during a natural or man made disaster, and being prepared with enough food, water and other supplies for at least a year. And retaining gun rights so that should society breakdown that one could still hunt and protect themselves and their family and friends. Tell me how well did the government local, state and then federal do after Katrina? Ever talk to those who had a survival mentality who have done ok and are back on the mend since Katrina? Or don't people want to know what works better than government? Yes, there are the fruitcakes on the far right.Stereotyping like this makes as much sense as the far right lumping eco terrorists in with those who are mainstream environmentalists. Or suggesting that gay marriage will weaken heterosexual marriage when the fact is heterosexual marriage has suffered huge divorce rates for decades.And as a third generation homeschooler I find her take on homeschooling to be somewhat disappointing. Not to mention we have homeschooled since the 80's for academic reasons as do hundreds of thousands of other non-religious and even liberal families. She writes a lot about Michael Farris and his involvement in homeschooling and even his Patrick Henry College located in rural Virginia. A very small college I might add. Yes, a few of the students work for a few in congress and even in the White House. But they are so few I don't see the concern.How about the mostly progressive or liberal homeschoolers who make the national news for their successes? I personally know of NO conservative homeschoolers who are well known. Do a google search for Michael Farris or visit some mainstream and progressive homeschool Internet boards and one will discover he is not liked by most homeschoolers and is considered a nut case who wants to control all homeschoolers. Something most homeschoolers have not allowed.And what about the fact that states and even the Federal Courts side with science classes that teach the theory of evolution and not intelligent design or creationism? Better yet, why do so many people still send their children to failing public schools rather than private or homeschools? What responsibility does a parent have to educate their children? The author ignores these questions. Call me an optimist when it comes to science winning out over myth and hysteria.Where are the suggestions on how do we get America back on track. No suggestions on how we become a nation where divorce is rare, where no child need fear being hurt because of encounters while on the computer. Or an educational system that doesn't have a drop out rate amongst minorities that is over 50% in some communities. Or how we become a society that saves money for a rainy day rather than a society that is in credit card hell, with people buying things they don't need. Or simply a more compassionate society.The author then writes on page 210 'This is what we are up against. Christian nationalists worship a nostalgic vision on America but they despise the country that actually exists -- its looseness, its decadence, its maddening lack of absolutes.' What's so damn wrong about wanting the good parts of nostalgic America like that under a progressive Democrat President named FDR? I think the author needs to step back and realize that there were good times in past decades. We have always had challenges as a nation, but to ignore the positive isn't good. In fact I think constantly focusing on the bad, makes people depressed and over time burned out at even wanting to try to make things better. Lets make sure that we also stress how far we have come.She then continues 'Our side, America's side, must be the side of freedom and Enlightenment, of liberation from stale constricting dogmas. It must be the side that elevates reason above the commands of holy books and human solidarity above religious supremacism. Otherwise, God help us all'. As an agnostic it troubles me that some think that you cannot believe in morals, ethics, patriotism and still be a non wacko American.The 'human solidarity above religious supremacism' is interesting because the author seems to ignore the fact that one can have human solidarity and also be religious. One need only look at Martin Luther King, or Lech Walesa and how they combined the two to make for big changes in society. Thus I would have appreciated some serious suggestions on what needs to be done to change things for the better.Lastly. I met Dr Rushdoony whom she writes about alot in the book.

This book details the rise of militant christian groups intent on \\"taking the land\\" and remaking America and the world in their vision of theocracy.The author is mostly fair and balanced although her secularism is never questioned, she gets as far inside these movements and what they mean for America as she can. She is at her best when describing the process of how fundamentalists have accumulated political power to themselves, often under the radar of the political establishment. The only flaw in this book is that it firmly dates itself to the George W Bush era rather than taking a broader view. Having said that it is still well worth a read if you're interested in the power of the religious right."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Goldberg, a secular Jew, provides a hard-nosed look at the agendas and power of ultra-conservative Christian organizations in the United States. Goldberg calls this trend \\"Christian Nationalism,\\" after the openly-stated goal of many fundamentalist leaders to \\"take back America.\\" From, of course, the gays, the morally decadent (such as distributors of birth control), the Darwin-lovers, and the unpatriotic atheists who believe in separation of church and state.Goldberg comes on strong and occasionally a bit sarcastic--for example, she bemoans the way Intelligent Design proponents have flaunted academic degrees to present their theories as \\"something more respectable than creationism in drag\\"--but her anti-fundamentalist rhetoric may not be overstated at all. Her research exposes the very real underground motives of the religious right, who feel bound by their beliefs to combat a spiritually bankrupt nation. There's no greater motivation than the conviction that one is following God's explicit orders.\\"Dominion theologians\\" nationwide take Genesis 1:26-28 (where God tells Adam to assume dominion of the world) as scriptural direction for Christians to assume control by divine right. The Christian duty is to seize it. Evangelists with crazed followings preach that the separation between religion and politics is \\"what Satan likes most,\\" and call for a regime that will clean up the \\"[expletive removed]\\" (gays). Jews better repent, too, since the holocaust God planned didn't seem to get through to them. But more dangerous than these extremists are the everyday right-wingers who are raised to carefully infiltrate government and the Judicial bench for the good of Christ, so that that our nation can be set right ... so that we can quit handing out condoms, quit treating gays like they're equals, quit pretending evolution is more scientific than creationism. Under President Bush's lead, government grant money by the millions poured into these agendas. The back cover promises a \\"witty, funny\\" read, but I couldn't laugh. Religion-gone-bad is jaw-droppingly frightening, and this is a hard book to put down.Goldberg calls for action. She explains that \\"the anxieties that underlay Christian nationalism's appeal--fears about social breakdown, marital instability, and cultural decline--are real. They should be acknowledged and, whenever possible, addressed. But as long as the movement aims at the destruction of secular society and the political enforcement of its theology, it has to be battled, not comforted and appeased.\\""},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"After reading \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" I am almost finished with \\"Kingdom Coming\\".

She presents the statements of many figures in the aspiring 'Christian Taliban' - such as James Dobson, Tony Perkins, Tim LaHaye, Donald Wildmon, Pat Robertson, Roy Moore, and others - which include such prominent Republican party officials as Tom DeLay, Bill Frist, Rick Santorum, Sam Brownback, Tom Coburn, John Ashcroft, and of course, George W. himself. These men are truly representative of a Christian Taliban - some even want to prohibit consensual sex outside of marriage & give the government power to enforce it! The aspirations of these people are chilling - they want to use the power of the judiciary & law-enforcement to ram fundamentalist Christian beliefs down Americans' throats. Mainstream Christians who do not share the ultra-conservative views of these men should read this book as well; it is a major wake-up call to what they are planning to do.Those who criticize the book as 'persecuting Christians' have got it wrong; Mainstream Christians who believe in tolerance of others' religions, including atheism, are not the threat; the fundamentalist zealots who wish to force their dogma on Americans using the power of the government to do so are the threat. It is these people who Ms. Goldberg focuses on and not the mainstream Christian churches.Along with John Dean's 'Conservatives Without Conscience', this book is a deadly serious warning about a conservative fundamentalist movement that borders on a mentality similar to those they claim to be fighting in radical Islam. If these men are allowed to further their views using the U.S. legislative, executive & judicial branches to do so, the United States will soon indeed be a theocratic country."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Has America finally had enough of the divisive, fear-mongering politics of the religious right? The drubbing that Republicans took in the mid-term elections (November 2006) might suggest so, but it's probably too early to tell. In the mean time, Michelle Goldberg, a self-described secular Jew and \\"urbanite,\\" adds her warning to the growing literature on political evangelicals, about 80% of whom voted for President Bush. Goldberg acknowledges that Christianity and what she calls \\"Christian nationalism\\" are two very different things, and that the latter by no means represents all evangelicals. She also admits that in her travels from coast to coast most of the evangelicals whom she met were thoughtful and amiable people.But that's no excuse, she says, for their revisionist history (America as a \\"Christian nation\\"), pseudo-science (young earth, intelligent design), their assault on the judiciary, simplistic ethics (stem cell, abstinence, homosexuality), confusion about church and state, and their overall Manichean worldview that the President himself articulated to the entire world after 9-11: \\"Either you're for us or against us.\\" I fully share her concerns and her frustrations, if not her fear that our political system is about to collapse from the weight of misguided evangelicals.Her book was written before some notable bench marks that might hint at a decreasing influence of the religious right-- the fall of Ted Haggard; the broader outlook of the National Association of Evangelicals that has, for example, shunned the likes of Dobson on environmental concerns; David Kuo's book Tempting Faith that documents just how little genuine interest Republicans have in evangelicals except to exploit their vote; important evangelicals like Jim Wallis (whom she mentions) who have been extremely critical of the capitulation of the faith to political ideology; and, let's hope, the common sense of mainstream Americans reflected in the November 2006 elections that defeated candidates like Ralph Reed and Rick Santorum.As with Randall Balmer's missed opportunity (Thy Kingdom Come), I fear Goldberg's hand wringing and shrill tone will lose some of her audience, and that's a shame because she's written a good book. It doesn't help, for example, for her to complain that some people have blamed gays for the Nazi Holocaust when she herself repeatedly quotes Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism and compares conservative evangelicals to Germans under Hitler. Still, I was glad I read her book, even if it depressed me to read about believers sucking up to Caesar."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Goldberg's book is witty, humane, and fair, yet it doesn't pull any punches about the dangers posed to secular society by Christian extremists. She is at pains to point out that the brand of fundamentalist Christianity (what she at one point refers to as \\"Christianism\\") does not represent, by any stretch, all American church-goers. Nevertheless, Christian nationalism as practiced by a committed minority does represent a clear and present danger to freedom, reason, and humane treatment. In many ways a more readable, if less scholarly, treatment of the same ground covered in \\"American Theocracy.\\" Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Beginning to read this book I braced myself for a biased rant against Christianity, however the sources and references given made it an even more disturbing read. Goldberg presented information that I had checked online as well as through print from materials from various organizations; the information presented was spot on. Though the author states that not all religious people and organizations are to be feared, she does show that there are many highly influential organizations that are producing change that could crumble the very fabric of what this nation was based on. No, that is not overstating their effects, it is shown time and time again and the process that is bringing it about.This book presented arguments backed by quotes and documented affiliations from many of the higher ups within our government. To see this tangled web and mostly to see it in action while reading through this book, I have a completely new understanding of political events and controversies.This is the one book I will recommend to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Most Christians are not right wing and most are strong supporters of a secular, nonsectarian government. I want to get this idea out at the beginning of my review, because the only criticism I have of this extremely good book is that Goldberg does not seem to realize that the group that is her most natural ally are Christians who realize that the Religious Political Right holds a host of positions that are contrary to the understanding of the Bible by most Christians and even many evangelical Christians. We are in a better position to counteract the Right because unlike her we have something in common with the Religious Extremists of whom she is rightfully afraid: the Bible. The fact is that most on the far right are simply terrible readers of the Bible. Despite lip service to the Bible, most fundamentalists simply haven't read much of it and what they have read has been given to them by religious leaders who use proof texts that are almost always taken completely out of context. The great opportunity that other Christians have is challenging the dreadful readings of the Bible by those on the Right. So far too many Christians have been hesitant to do this. The Religious Right is almost willfully ignorant of American history and depressingly gullible in accepting any of a number of absurd beliefs, but as Goldberg correctly points out these people allow their misunderstanding of the Bible to trump historical narratives that can stand up to historical research or scientific beliefs that can be verified employing the scientific method.As a Christian I believe that right wing Christians represent the greatest threat to the United States since the McCarthyism of the fifties and possibly since the secessionist movement in the 1850s. They are threatening to destroy the political experiment begun in the 18th century by a group of men profoundly influenced by the ideals of the Enlightenment (almost all of the major founders openly acknowledged Enlightenment ideals in their writings, from Madison to Jefferson to Franklin to Washington to Hamilton and even to Adams, easily the most conservative and religious of the major founders--and if Adams, the most conservative founder, was outraged by talk of America as a nation with a special connection to God, an outrage he frequently expressed in his writings, it is almost impossible to grasp how they could think America was founded as a Christian nation). The Religious Right ignores history. For most of US history a host of religious leaders have lamented the fact that the nation was founded as secular. For instance, when the constitutional convention began Benjamin Franklin suggested starting it with a prayer, but this was soundly rejected. The constitution itself does not mention God or religion except in the First Amendment to guarantee that people would not be deprived of their right to worship as they see fit and to guarantee the separation of religion from government. Contemporary religious leaders all recognized this and lamented it. Only in the 1980s did anyone think of claiming that the US had been founded on Christian principles. Forget that there isn't the tiniest bit of evidence for this amazing turn of mind: the Religious Right just believes it without evidence.Apart from failing to distinguish the majority of Christians from the Christian Nationalists, this is an extremely accurate, very well presented book. The book is in one way an updating of prior work done by Sara Diamond and Frederick Clarkson, both of whom in the nineties warned us of the dangers posed by the Domionists or Christian Reconstructionists. More recently the Dominionists have been discussed at length by Kevin Phillips in his excellent AMERICAN THEOCRACY. Goldberg's advantage over any of these books is that she is such a remarkably clear writer. Phillips brings a more sophisticated understanding of history and of the way that Reconstructionists link up with other major issues, but he does not write nearly as clearly as Goldberg. There are a host of other books that deal with the influence of the Religious Right, but this is the best for bringing out the Dominionist aspect of its political agenda and the best for explaining specifically why these extremists are so dangerous.Goldberg focuses six chapters on very specific issues through which most of the impact of the Religious Right is felt: the completely unsubstantiated myth that America was founded as a Christian nation on Christian principles; the role that homophobia and hatred of gays plays in the politics of the Right; the Intelligent Design canard; the way the Bush administration has rewarded fundamentalists with cash from the Faith-Based Initiatives; the expanding use of abstinence for curing a number of ills, despite a growing body of evidence that it fails in this; and the Right's attempt to pack the courts with very conservative judges while at the same time attempting to gut, if possible, the powers of the courts.This is a scary agenda. If they success they will turn America from a democracy into mob rule. She quotes at several points from Hannah Arendt's THE ORIGINS OF TOTALITARIANISM. There is absolutely no question that the Religious Right is totalitarian. I grew up a fundamentalist. The Right has a very hierarchical reading of the Bible. Although Luke-Acts presents a picture of the church in which the structure is more horizontal, many Christian traditions have promulgated a vertical structure. The Dominionists take this to an extreme. One frequently hears ministers or religious teachers stating that it is the responsibility of children to blindly obey their parents, for wives to obey their husbands, and for all to obey their ministers. This was always painful for me, raised a Southern Baptist, to hear. The central Baptist doctrine has always been the Priesthood of the Believer, which holds that no other person can serve as a religious authority for any individual believer. But the Dominionists and other very conservative Christians believe that one should abdicate one's own responsibility and adopt an attitude of obedience. This breeds a mentality that is exceedingly close to that found in totalitarian movements. The most depressing parts of Goldberg's book is where she points out parallels between the vision the Religious Right has for America and the rise of Nazism. (Interestingly, one popular site on the Internet right now is one that provides a series of statements from Ann Coulter and Adolf Hitler about liberalism and asks the reader to try to pick out which one is by Ann and which by Adolf--it is nearly impossible to tell for certain which one wrote what.) It is unlikely that the Reconstructionists will ever get the kind of America that they want. Americans are famous for their love of freedom and I doubt that most Americans could never accept the particular hell on earth that these people imagine as their Eden. Our culture is too rich, too diverse, too vigorous for that. But remember that late Weimar culture in Germany and Austria saw an absolute explosion of culture, from Gustav Klimt, Karl Kraus, Fritz Lang, Robert Musil, and Ludwig Wittgenstein to Freud, Bertolt Brecht, Walter Benjamin, Kurt Weill, and Thomas Mann. How could a culture this rich be replaced by the kind brought about by Hitler and the Nazis? The Religious Right's vision for America is excruciatingly similar to that of Hitler's, with homosexuals and liberals substituted for Jews and Communists. If you make those simple substitutes while reading Nazi materials, they sound just like today's Religious Right, and vice versa.I want to strongly disagree with Kerry Walters's \\"Chicken Little\\" review. He, writing as an ordained Episcopalian minister (I write as a licensed Baptist minister) writes, \\"But that the culture is likely to gain a great deal of political power, as Goldberg fears, is an open question.\\" I can assure Rev. Walters that they have already achieved a great deal of political power. The question is whether they can gain enough to bring about the kind of society that they envision. Although not nearly as strong a book as Goldberg's, I would strongly recommend Esther Kaplan's WITH GOD ON THEIR SIDE: HOW CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS TRAMPLED SCIENCE, POLICY, AND DEMOCRACY IN GEORGE W. BUSH'S WHITE HOUSE. Kaplan does not explain the Religious Right nearly so well as Goldberg, but she provides an almost unending list of very specific abuses that the Religious Right has wrought in government. This has already happened; it is not theoretical or merely possible. For instance, abstinence programs have had a dramatic impact on sex education in America. One thing we know for certain is that nonsectarian sex education delays the age at which teens have sex, lowers the risk of pregnancy, and lessens the risk of contracting an STD. But under Bush a host of health officials are ignoring genuine sex education and replacing it with abstinence programs. In international conferences on health policy, the United States has become notorious for promoting abstinence as the main method for dealing with AIDS, passionately opposing programs that involve the distribution of condoms (a position that not even the Vatican now opposes). Funding for AIDS programs has lessened under Bush and the Religious Right has embraced positions on global warming that ignores all of the scientific evidence. As Goldberg points out, the Religious Right pretty much owns the Republican Party on the local level, and writes an extremist party platform at each presidential convention. And as she shows, the courts have been overwhelmed with religiously acceptable judges. We are going to be feeling the effects of these appointments for decades. No, the question isn't whether the Right will gain political power. They already have that. The question is how much.I am hopeful for overreach on the part of the Dominionists. If Roe v. Wade were to be overturned or if the 1965 Voting Rights Act is not renewed, this could cause the kind of anger and outrage that could organize a countermovement. If the Right tries to legislate moral positions that many Americans find reprehensible, there could be a backlash. Recent polls have shown many evangelicals moving away from the GOP based on environmental issues. Whether this is a blip or a long-term trend will be seen. My gut tells me that Americans don't want the kind of America the Dominionists yearn for. But neither did most Germans want the Jews persecuted or deviants imprisoned.I think this book is must reading for anyone who cares about America. It should also be required reading for Christians who are concerned with the way that religious extremists are presuming to define what the Christian position on all these issues truly is. My fellow Christians should contest their understanding of the Bible, of history, of science, of democracy, and of the rights of others. If we don't we could very easily find the nation that we have long esteemed become something that we abhor."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I don't recall a time in US history when the assets of the Executive Branch are being used to create what comes close to a theocracy.

As with any polemic, a reader who disagrees with the author will call it ascreed, but one who is sympathetic to the author's view will find it insightful and a forcefulargument. I fall into the latter categoryMs. Goldberg's theme is simple: the far-right, conservative Christians are a present danger insofaras their intent is not simply to win others to their convictions but, rather, to force their style ofgovernance on the United States. The 31-year-old author describes herself as a \\"secular Jew\\" whois a contributing writer to the magazine \\"Salon\\"; she describes a tremendous amount of researchthat she put into the book, having interviewed a large number of the Christians she writes aboutand attended megachurch services and conferences of the faithful. She names not only the usualsuspects (Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, James Dobson, Tim LaHaye, Paul Weyrich, Ralph Reed)but many others that I had never heard of.While I have no admiration of these conservative Christians, these \\"people of faith\\"--I couldnever be one of them--I have never felt threatened by them. However, if one gives credence toMs. Goldberg's testimony, they are a clear menace to our society. They not only want schoolprayer, the \\"under God\\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, the Ten Commandments displayed publicly,and the other trappings of their faith, they also want elected government officials, teachers of ourchildren, and everyone with influence on our lives to be of their ilk.She talks about \\"Christian Reconstruction\\": \\"Reconstruction theory calls for a stealth strategy toChristianize politics and culture.\\" She refers to one Gary North, \\"one of the movement's keytheorists, (who) wrote of the need for activists to penetrate secular institutions to 'smooth thetransition to Christian political leadership....Christians must begin to organize politically within thepresent party structure, and they must begin to infiltrate the existing institutional order.' \\" (p. 14).She quotes a variety of the far-right Christians, whose words point out the menace of their ideology.\\"We must remove all humanists from public office and replace them with pro-moral politicalleaders.\\" Tim LaHaye. (p. 39).\\"Christians have an obligation, a mandate, a commission, a holy responsibility to reclaim theland for Jesus Christ--to have dominion in civil structures, just as in every other aspect of lifeand godliness...World conquest. That's what Christ has commissioned us to accomplish.\\"George Grant, identified as executive director of Coral Ridge Ministries, \\"a multimedia empire\\"headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Paxton, a history professor at Columbia University, \\"We know from tracing itspath that fascism does not require a spectacular 'march' on some capital to take root...Fascistsare close to power when conservatives begin to borrow their techniques...\\" (p. 179).She adds, \\"Those who don't want to live in the country the Christian nationalists would createhave no choice but to fight...the threat will not simply fizzle out without a countermovementorganized to defend pluralism, religious equality, reason, and personal freedom. If current trendscontinue, we will see ever increasing division and acrimony in our politics. That's partly because,as Christian nationalism spreads, secularism is spreading as well, while moderate mainlineChristianity is in decline.\\" (p. 181).Well said."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Michelle Goldberg has written a concise, thoughtful examination of a fringe of Christian evangelism that she sees as a growing political threat. She makes it clear (something the film \\"Jesus Camp\\" does not) that this kind of Christianity is a minority within evangelistic traditions, and certainly a minority within America overall. Still, one need look no further than the 2004 presidential election to see that extremists do have power when combined with more moderate voting blocks. Goldberg examines some of the leaders of this movement and focuses on four social issues which have begun to affect political policy: gay marriage, science in public schools, abortion rights, and sex education. Ultimately, this is a book about democracy and voting. If small voting blocks didn't have the power to sway elections (and affect public policy), no one need be concerned about others' religious beliefs (or their misuse of these beliefs). I think Goldberg is overly paranoid in some of her imagined worst case scenarios. There is a vast difference, for example, between wanting to deny gay people their civil rights and wanting to round them up and send them to concentration camps. Just because horrible acts have proceeded from these types of injustices doesn't mean that atrocity is the end result of every act of political prejudice. I have a feeling that once GW is out of office, the fear about the Christian right will abate.

I underline that \\"institutionalised\\" part - I am privileged to know many fine Christians who seek to put their faith into practice and who, to paraphrase Jesus's words from the Sermon on the Mount, \\"let their light so shine before men, that they might see their good works and glorify their Father in Heaven\\". Christianity is an individual's religion, a personal commitment between a person and God. This is its great strength; in its proper form, it seeks to change the world one person at a time, not by coercion, but by example.Its problems start when it tries to do things the other way around, by impressing its way of doing things (be they right or wrong) en masse on people who don't want to adhere. I have watched the growing trend of Christian churches in the USA seeking to exert political influence with some concern. This excellent book encapsulates it all very nicely. Written before the 2008 Presidential Election, it highlights the attempts of the religious right and those who ride on their coat-tails to make the USA a \\"Christian nation\\", something that by definition cannot exist in reality. It requires a comprehensive rewriting of history, to ignore the fact that the Founding Fathers were gentlemen of the Enlightenment and often at best Deists (in his campaign for the Presidency, Thomas Jefferson was famously accused of being an atheist by his rival). It also requires a fundamental rewriting of scientific fact, to make \\"intelligent design\\" a school subject, although it is only creationism in disguise and totally lacking in factual basis. When facts become changeable to suit majority opinion, then we're really in trouble.Diversity is the life-blood of American democracy, and a much-admired facet of it. Suddenly, this is endangered, and while an Iranian-type theocracy is not on the horizon, the danger signals are there, especially when a former Governor whose only real qualification for office is essentially her religion and who believes that she is part of the last generation could conceivably get her fingers on the button to unleash Armageddon.The joy of this book is that it is no polemic; it is straightforward and factual. It insults nobody, and it backs up its statements by quotes from the people involved. In many ways, its very reasonableness and rationality make it even more scary. It is a clarion call to wake up reasonable, rational Americans, so that they rise and take back the real polyglot America, not the fictitious, self-serving America of the \\"Christian\\" Right's delusions. As God famously said to a depressed Elijah, \\"I have still 7,000 prophets who have not bowed the knee to Baal\\". Hopefully, there remain many Americans who have not bowed the knee to the Baal of false, distorted Christianity."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"This is a good look at what the fundamentalist Christian right believes and is trying to impose on the rest of the country. Goldberg has a shrewd eye as a reporter, has read a fair amount of academic material, and written with genuine passion and concern.For those who have not had contact with the fundamentalist Christian right, much of what she describes will seem frightening to the point of disbelief. Yes, there are people in the US who want to impose a rigid version of Christianity onto the rest of the nation. They believe in the literal truth of the Bible as the original source of all wisdom and truth, and they are convinced in their righteousness to the point that some would sanction legal execution and even murder for their cause. Their mentality is cloistered - to block different perspectives from getting them to question their beliefs - and paranoid and wholly unaware of their own hypocrisy. They believe that the US is sinful and needs to become christianized, to live in strict accordance with their interpretation of the Bible. The mandate, in their view, comes directly from God, hence there is no room for compromise - their beliefs are absolute and indivisible. Their belief is also impervious to logic and evidence: my uncle, when confronted with the fact that there is fossil evidence in favor of evolution, merely replies that \\"the devil puts that there.\\"I believe Goldberg's characterization of their wacky world view is essentially correct, because there are people in my own family - cousins - who are involved in the movement. (We are somewhere on the atheist-agnostic spectrum, definitely the \\"urban secularists\\" whom Goldberg wishes to protect.) While my closer cousins are tolerant of our beliefs (as we strive to be of theirs) and share a strong bond with us, we recently met some more distant cousins and it was a frightening encounter. As their children were homeschooled, they regarded mine with suspicion that exploded into vicious accusations that they were \\"in league with the devil\\". It was genuinely shocking and personally offensive to us.What Goldberg accomplishes in this book is look at them as a highly organized force that wants to take over the country, a political movement. They began to gather steam from the time of President Reagan, when they were incorporated as a voting block and core of highly motivated grassroots activists into the GOP. They want to ban abortion, restrict the teaching of evolution via legislation (i.e. the world is 6000 years old, etc.), outlaw homosexuality, and restrict sexual freedom outside of marriage; they also wish to subvert the US Constitution so that religion can dominate the state. Up until the time of Bush II, they had made great progress, from the nomination of judges that favor their view to battles on school boards in favor of teaching \\"intelligent design\\" as a scientific alternative to neo-Darwinism, and the campaign for sexual abstinence outside marriage (i.e. against disseminating basic knowledge on women's reproductive health). There are armies of these believers in mega-churches, in \\"home schools\\" to keep their children free of the taint of public education, and in innumerable political groupings. Then, under Bush, they entered the government mainstream for the first time to systematically subvert science policy, got grants under the faith-based initiatives - government funds to provide social services AND proselytize - and enter the judiciary in greater numbers than ever before.That is where the book stops, in early 2006 (at least in the hard cover edition). What Goldberg has reported is valuable, but I have a number of criticisms of her approach. First, with the 2006 and 2008 elections, it is clear that the book is somewhat out of date. With the Terry Schiavo controversy and other issues tied to Bush II, the country has decisively rejected the fundamentalist Christian right, at least for the time being.Second, I believe that Goldberg over-estimates how far the fundamentalist Christian right can go. In other words, once their beliefs and true agenda are better known, I am sure that more Americans will reject them. The recent Tillman assassination, for example, will expose many of their true colors. However, Goldberg is much more frightened than I am: she repeatedly labels them as nascent fascists, worries that they will continue to grow and gain influence, and will never compromise.Third, Goldberg's tone is over-heated and near hysterical in her creation of a dichotomy between fundamentalist ruralists and urban secularists. From within my own family, I know that the lines cannot be that sharply drawn. While my close cousins say and believe certain things, they respect diversity and love to travel and were as experimental (in a manner of speaking) as the rest of us when young. I am convinced that it is only an infinitesimal minority that are so fanatic (like my more distant relatives). Indeed, they are somewhat like the Taliban vis-a-vis the rest of Islam, in my view. The book verges on, but never quite becomes, a polemic.Fourth, for all its breathless exposes, there is often a lack of density to Goldberg's writing. She has done good reporting work, but there was something callow about the book, like much of it was thrown together and not very deeply reflected upon. For example, she repeatedly refers to Hannah Ardnt's Origins of Totalitarianism (in my reading an abstruse and obscure book of impossible syntax and unfiltered facts) as a source on the rise of mass demagogic movements as if to explain the similarities between the rise of Hitler and the fundamentalist Christian right. (I do not believe Hitler is a good rhetorical benchmark.) I often felt disappointed in her summaries of points of view and her musings.All this being said, Goldberg's book is worth the read. She is a young writer, who will mature into a far better one. (My apologies if this sounds condescending - I do not mean to disrespect the many accomplishments of this book.) The reporting is valuable, she strives to be fair, and fearlessly presents a point of view. But this book is only a beginning and may already be outdated.Recommended with these caveats."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Christian fundamentalism has been a national problem at least since the Scopes Monkey trial; it is more or less a development of the past quarter-century, however, that such fundamentalism has gained political clout. Michelle Goldberg, a secular liberal Jewish feminist (one wonders if her being a lesbian would significantly increase the right-wing paranoia these labels provoke) has assembled a terrifying factbook of the history, agenda, and methods of the religious right, all with considerable humanity, felicitous writing, and minimal elitism.All of her subjects, from Focus on the Family to the wretchedly misnamed Discovery Institute (the main thinktank behind \\"intelligent design\\") are easy to oppose. Goldberg's feat is to show how such groups, so naturally objectionable to secularists and the mainstream religious, have ascended to heights previously unthinkable within the Republican party. Her analysis is well-documented and journalistically sound (though plenty of outside sources are used, she also spent much time with primary material, including conference calls with important religious right figures).I must admit to find it a depressing read. I am, however, cautiously optimistic that the type of lunacy described in the book is at a high water mark; this was written before the 2006 congressional elections, and John McCain (to say nothing of Obama or Hillary) doesn't have near the influence in religious right circles as Bush does. Still, as Goldberg points out, some of their most important advances were made during the Clinton years.Though an unabashed secularist, Goldberg refreshingly does not withhold support for sensible religious leaders. Most prominent among them is Jim Wallis, the evangelical progressive who has become something of a go-to man for churches that are tired of their right wing captivity.Topical and urgent, it will also stand as a fine history of a peculiarly American political movement. Read it, wake up, and turn your faith, whether in humanity or the divine, into action."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"In this excellent, fascinating, and frightening book, Michelle Goldberg brings up the well-known fact that abstinence-only sex education programs for teenagers don't work. But an abstinence-only educator emphatically insisted that it doesn't matter that these programs don't work. What matters, she said, is that these programs tell \\"the TRUTH\\" that sex outside of marriage is \\"a SIN.\\" Apparently, most abstinence-only programs are less concerned with preventing pregnancy and disease than with pushing a religious ideology.I can't tell you how many times I raised my eyebrows over what I read in this book, nor how many times I had to put the book down in order to digest what I'd just read. Some of what Goldberg writes seems incomprehensible, yet she thoroughly documents all of it.The Reverend Moon's tremendous clout with the D.C. establishment and the religious right came as quite a surprise to me. I always dismissed him as a crackpot, but no more.Goldberg's book is about a parallel reality that is alive, well, and growing in the U.S. today--thanks to generous subsidies from the Bush administration and an unquestioning, incurious press. Goldberg is to be commended for providing much-needed insight into this subculture, which is making alarming progress towards the mainstream. This book is also a whole lot scarier than anything by Steven King--because it's true. With all due respect to King, even he couldn't make this stuff up."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"-Purchased from Amazon-\\"Kingdom Coming:\\"The Rise of Christian Nationalism\\"-Although extremely critical of 'Christian Fundamentalism' and their supportersby any other name; nowhere do I recognize an anti-religious, atheistic, secular,nor rationalist point of view in Michelle Goldberg's well justified disparagement,and castigation of an exceptionally obnoxious part of the specifically Christian'sinvolvement in Religion's intention to subvert all humanity, and every otherform of government to a theocracy. Thus, I detect an appearance and/or theintention to eliminate or reduce interest in all other religious and non-religiousmovements, so as to shine more light on her very own Faith, or Belief System.-"},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Golberg exposes the rise of Christian Nationalism, a movement that has roots in the John Birch Society. At its most extreme, it would do away with democracy and institute the laws of the Old Testament, a late bronze age and early iron age document written to reflect the times - times of extreme superstition.Among the excerpts from the Bible they hang their hats on are The Ten Commandments. Six of these commandments are included in most systems of morality - rules against murder, theft, adultery, lying, and envy - and a rule supporting the honoring of one's parents - all good things. Four, however, are specifically about how the Jewish God prefers to be worshipped. Among other excerpts, Christian Nationalists particularly like a couple of verses from the Book of Leviticus they use to justify gay-bashing. These verses are right next to other equally ridiculous verses, but these others they choose to ignore -such as the verses about killing children who swear at or dishonor their parents.They claim this nation was founded as a Christian nation. The founding fathers were a mixture of Deists and Christians who went out of their way to keep religion out of the Constitution. Some of them were against any organized religion but more of them were from minority Christian groups in their states and thus out of the power loop. One of the goals of Christian Nationalists is to rewrite this and other history to their specifications.You could dispense with this as conspiracy theory fodder except that the leaders admit their goals in sermons at megachurches, in position statements from their (I would say subversive) organizations, and in conferences. Goldberg happily shares with us their direct quotes. Despite their words being available, they're not generally for public consumption. Unfortunately, their views are shared by certain men and women who have occupied high offices in the US gov't, including George Bush, a president who filled governmental offices with believers and encouraged them to snub their noses at science when science was inconvenient.Chapters include attacks on gays, the courts, private sexual activity (including abortion and contraception), evolution, public education, and a few others. All these chapters demonstrate that facts mean nothing to Christian Nationalists and they sometimes admit it. Everything is faith-based - meaning not requiring evidence. This book was right on in 2006 and although their party no longer has the White House, I'm sure they are not letting the grass grow under their feet. The founding fathers must be turning over in their graves."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Goldberg's =Kingdom Coming...= and Hedges's =American Facists...= are the two most factually grounded, research-documented and semi-academic of the books I've run across on this important topic. But what I've been hoping for, but yet to find, is something more like Eric Hoffer's ancient =The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements= (Harper and Row, 1966), and here's why: I studied cult-deprogramming years ago and clinical psychology in more recent times. What I've become aware of is a seemingly widespread, three-stage, cultural phenomenon, only a bit of which is examined in either Goldberg or Hedges.Many people who were raised by strict, authoritarian, perfectionistic and dogmatically religious parents revolted against their parents' values and became political and philosophical wildhairs (\\"hippies\\" in some cases, but \\"counterculture\\" in general). In later years, some ran into a combination of crises in their lives (e.g.: drug addiction, alcoholism, loss of family connection, divorce, rejection by children, career collapse, etc.). And when they did, many of them suffered a \\"decompensation\\" of their egos. Some set out on a desperate search for a group of people who would rescue them from psychic pain they perceive to be \\"intolerable.\\"I saw this phenomenon again and again in the \\"new wave\\" Christian congregations I visited around southern California including numerous Calvary Chapels, Randy Brodhagen's Glory to God Ministry, The Rock Church & World Outreach, and (to make a point, because it is very different from those previously mentioned) Melissa Scott's University Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles. I also saw the same sort of very self-evident skew towards right-wing politics in these congregations.I heard the same story over and over: \\"I was lost and now I am found\\" (and =part= of something). In their earlier rejection of the \\"faith of their fathers,\\" they had simply replaced one form of fantasy with another (delusional radicalism). And in the desperation driven by their loss of support and mock-secure attachment to their \\"comrades,\\" they returned to the only =other= source of support and pseudo-security they could picture: the one that was still there in their childhood memories.One has no right to expect journalists to have immersed themselves in such psychological concepts as Bowlby's \\"secure and insecure attachment,\\" Baumrind's \\"parenting styles,\\" Piaget's \\"stages of cognitive development,\\" Kohlberg's \\"types of morality,\\" Karpman's \\"drama triangle,\\" Miller's \\"poisonous pedagogy,\\" or Erikson's \\"stages of ego development\\" to provide them with the tools to spot the stuff I've described, of course.

I highly recommend this book to other conservative Christians. Read this book and be encouraged!Despite my strong endorsement of this book, I do dock her two rating stars, one for her tendency toward hyperbole, as, for example, when she writes that Pres. Bush has busily stacked the courts with Judge Roy Moore clones. Yeah, right...If only. And I deducted another star because Ms. Goldberg tends to allow her emotions to overrun her reporting. As she describes many of the conservative Christian successes, the venom tends to drip from the page.

He was referring to W's pentecostal roots for his primary runs. Funny thing is, he wasn't being funny. Stern missed it, and Carlin would later ask him if he was self-hating.To all the rubes who voted this cadre into power on the basis of their political support for Israel, do yourselves an enormous mitz vah and read this book. It is well researched, but hardly objective. Nor should it be. You have in Michelle Goldberg, a voice crying in the wilderness. Such forecasters tend to be ignored until it is too late and the rest of us are wondering how so many were murdered. In the case of our modern day country-western Nero, the carnage has spilled over three continents and shows no signs of abating. Effectively, they have gotten the base to finance this revolting Putsch by sacrificing the fiscal stability of the future of their country. Like lemmings, jews and christians alike have thrown money and given the Nationalist fascist Kriztianz a green light for fear of the bogey man in the dessert who got a lucky strike back in 2001.Defeating terrorism and spreading Kristo-Democrazeit is not what they have in mind. It is a money grab, and a final tip toward the apocalypse that would make John, the disciple Jesus loved, sick. You see, it comes to this: if this movement can self-realize its own rapture, there are no other rules you need. So, get the Arabs and the Jews and the Hindus to square off and annihilate each other, marginalize the Buddhists, who don't believe in our version of redemption and retribution, and there will be peace for a 1000 years. Oh, and by the way, if there are any of the aforementioned groups who just refuse to get with the solution, there is salvation for you if you can help them self-actualize their role in your rapture. Not as good as 10,000 virgins, but whoever said you would have your willie in Paradise anyway.Goldberg writes a profound wake-up call - nowhere near as silly as this review. It's your country, Yank. Get rid of these people. Our planet is too small for this nationalist fundamentalism, and Goldberg is perfectly correct in sounding an alarm.

But as Goldberg herself warns, the \\"Christian Nationalists\\" she describes in her book are hard to refute \\"without sounding shrill and hyperbolic.\\" Goldberg has, to her credit, talked to a significant portion of the people she talks about. Her research was not all academic: she visited megachurches and christian policitical rallies, and talked with \\"grassroots\\" conservative Christians. However, she only mentions one conservative Christian who sees the same problems she sees within evangelicalism, while I strongly suspect there are more she could have mentioned to provide more balance. She also preens far too much about being \\"cosmopolitan\\" and \\"urban.\\" I would suggest to Goldberg that those are accidents of birth and education just as much as conservativism and ruralism, of which she speaks with such unmasked disdain. Unmasked disdain is the real flaw in Goldberg's book.

It exposes how American government, with it's traditional support for separation of Church and State, is being sabotaged by Christian Nationalists who believe that America should be a Christian Nation.Remember the Bush Administration's earlier attempts to promote Faith-Based Initiatives? How passionately the administration insisted that religious organizations needed special legislation permitting them to do 'good work' despite public doubts about the actual levels of restrictions (if any) and concerns that it would be nothing more than government funded bible-thumping, thereby violating the Constitution?Even though the White House does not publicly talk about it anymore, this and other objectives for their friends still exist. Their political favors will need to be collected on.With mounting casualties in Iraq, soaring healthcare costs, and a rising deficit, the president again appeased his friends by promoting the federal anti-gay marriage amendment over addressing these other issues. The amendment's ultimate failure was of little concern to them; it was the presidential weight behind this measure which mattered. Bush supported their position to build a 'good' nation.A real strength of this book is that it documents that the religious right and the GOP are working in cahoots regardless of whatever 'compassionate' language they temporarily attempt to cloak themselves up in.

The author did throw in a few references(aka: cheap shots) that may better portray her left leanings, but these really added up to no more than a few sentences in an otherwise well written and researched book. Makes me feel kind of scared being stuck in the middle as the last remaining moderate on earth........"},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"It all sounded so threatening in 2006 when this book was first published. With George W. Bush in the White House, Republicans ascendant in Congress and within state government, and political, economic, and social conservatism seemingly on the verge of triumph the ideas of Christian \\"dominionism\\" seemed inevitable. \\"Dominion theology\\" was incubated in the evangelical right, emerging in the 1980s to claim that Christians had to take responsibility for virtually every aspect of modern America. This was foreordained in the end times, according to its believers, and certainly a prerequisite for the triumphal return of Jesus Christ to the Earth and the ushering in the millennial reign.Michelle Goldberg, a journalist who is a contributing editor to Salon and an author published in a range of other periodicals, wrote this book because she said she \\"was terrified by America's increasing hostility to...cosmopolitan values.\\" It takes an investigative journalist's approach to the subject, traveling far and wide in search of Christ's nationalists. She makes no attempt at objectivity, and uses her mastery of English to draw a terrifying portrait of this death struggle in modern America. She expresses fears that secular liberals and even mainstream religionists are an \\"endangered species\\" as Goldberg sounds the alarm over the state of today's culture wars.Goldberg also draws striking portraits of the tight financial and ideological linkages between conservative economic forces, fundamentalist Christians, and the political right. She ranges from the political uses of homophobia to debates over Darwin and evolution, the problems of right wing education in such arenas as home schooling, sex and the wages of abstinence, and the war in and on the courts. Although her conclusions might have seemed appropriate when the book was first published in 2006, they seem to be somewhat overstated in 2013. Yes, Christian dominionists are still among us, and yes all of the issues that she discusses are unresolved, but it seems less as if secularists are necessarily at the barricades as much as was the case a few years ago. Perhaps that is because of the success of a political counterbalance to Christian fundamentalism. Perhaps other issues are a play.Or perhaps I am a Polyanna who is optimistic for the future. Whatever the case, Michelle Goldberg's hard-edged expose of Christian nationalism should be a clarion call for anyone sanguine that their fundamental freedoms are not in need of defense."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"This book is a call to action for any reasonable American who enjoys individual freedom of, or from, religion. The author doesn't just predict the end of our civilization, however. She does a good job of identifying organizations that can lobby our governmental representation to reject the broken philosophies of people like James Dobson and Leslee Unruh, and how we can participate in the process. Those of us who strongly believe religion and government should be separate, should do everything we can to keep these people from destroying the idea of America."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I've been concerned for awhile now about the rise of religion in politics, so when I saw this I figured I'd pick it up and delve into the matter a little more. I already got annoyed when I heard atheists and gays slandered as horrible people, when not allowing mandatory prayer in public school was called \\"anti-Christian,\\" and of course when people wandered around trying to masqeurade intelligent design as science.Behold, in hindsight, how little I knew.Michelle Goldberg brings far more than that to the table. I never knew just how devoid of oversight Bush's Faith-Based Initiatives are or that organizations such as the Salvation Army reorganized and purged undesirable elements from their ranks. Sections about the evangelical movement's history and extent, as well as the related home-schooling movement, were particularly eye opening.At times the book became so disturbing I began feeling pretty apathetic towards it all. With all of these events taking place and with all the organization, resources, and determination the movement has, why bother doing anything about it?Luckily towards the end Goldberg includes a few positive notes and developments, as well as suggestions on action to take. I think that, along with the controlled and mature writing style, is crucial. This book easily could have been a vitriolic attack on the movement without an attempt at a solution. If it had been, it would have served as proof to Christian nationalists that secular liberals are out to get them. Thankfully it didn't turn out that way. Goldberg reasons her point well at the same time she points out Christian nationalists are generally nice people with legitimate concerns. It's a logical, sensible book that manages to raise an alarm without being alarmist."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Christian nationalism... how can this be a bad thing? After all, isn't the United States a Christian nation, founded on Christian principles, and committed to Christian values, morality, education, governance, and just all in all Christian principles in general?Author Michelle Goldberg would say no. In fact, she builds a case that makes this a scary prospect, that makes the many people pushing for this vision of America scary people, and that makes a \\"Christian Nationalism\\" effort downright un-American.\\"The United States has always been a pious country, given to bursts of spiritual fervor, but Christian nationalism is qualitatively different from earlier religious revivals. Like America's past Great Awakenings, the Christian nationalist movement claims the Bible is absolutely and literally true. But it goes much further, extrapolating a total political program from that truth, and yoking that program to a political party. It is a conflation of scripture and politics that sees America's triumphs as confirmation of the truth of the Christian religion, and America's struggles as part of a cosmic contest between God and the devil. It claims supernatural sanction for its campaign of national renewal and speaks rapturously about vanquishing the millions of Americans who would stand in its way\\" (p. 6; from 2006 first edition).And after reading Kingdom Coming: The Rise Of Christian Nationalism, I agree with her.\\"As I hope to illustrate in the following chapters, however, the ultimate goal of Christian nationalist leaders isn't fairness. It's domination. The movement is built on a theology that asserts the Christian right to rule. This doesn't mean that nonbelievers will be forced to convert. They'll just have to learn their place\\" (p. 7).Scary. How will they do this?\\"While the Moral Majority had focused on direct mail and large rallies, the Christian Coalition trained activists and candidates on the local level. They ran in school board races and learned how to become Republican delegates. Crucially, Christian Coalition manuals urged candidates to keep their religious agenda quiet until after they were elected\\" (p. 14). Goldberg was able to participate in a number of seminars and workshops on this topic. As she heard many times, this was a battle for America's soul. \\"Conservatives control almost the entire federal government [in 2006], along with an enormous Christian counterculture, but go to any right-wing gathering, and you'll hear speaker after speaker talk about being under attack, about yearning to 'take the country back,' about the necessity of fighting ever harder\\" (p. 69).There are recognized highlights in this battle. The \\"protection of marriage\\" fight is one of them. \\"For the right, gays are living signifiers of decadence and corruption. They're seen as both repulsive and tempting, their mere existence sparking some deep primordial panic among much of straight America\\" (p. 54). Another is the fight to control the courts. \\"The movement's leaders see judges, often correctly, as the only thing protecting American secularism. They how that if they can take the courts, they'll have the country\\" (p. 168).The battle for America's soul is through the mind, with information filtered by the Christian nationalists. Goldberg writes, \\"For opponents of the right, one of the most alarming things about the current state of our country is the fact that so many Americans fervently believe things that are objectively false - that Iraq was behind September 11, for example, or that Bill Clinton was a more profligate spender than Bush, or that the world is only a few thousand years old\\" (p. 180).Goldberg believes the Christian nationalist agenda needs to be addressed head-on. \\"The anxieties that underlay Christian nationalism's appeal - fears about social breakdown, marital instability, and cultural decline - are real. They should be acknowledged and, where possible, addressed. But as long as the movement aims at the destruction of secular society and the political enforcement of its theology, it has to be battled, not comforted and appeased\\" (p. 191). She discusses this strategy in some detail.In a concluding \\"afterword\\" chapter, Goldberg writes \\"At a time when religious extremism seems everywhere ascendant [and she is referring to this issue around the world, not just in the U.S.], I see a different struggle, one between modernity, humanism, reason, and progress on one hand, and fundamentalism, tribalism, Puritanism, and obscurantism on the other. Liberals the world over are fighting religious tyranny\\" (p. 207). She continues, \\"The things so many Islamic fundamentalist hate about the West - its sexual openness, its art, the possibilities it offers for escaping the bonds of family and religion, for inventing one's own life - are what the Christian nationalists hate as well\\" (p. 208).Finally, Goldberg states the obvious: \\"It makes no sense to fight religious authoritarianism abroad while letting it take over at home\\" (p. 210).As I stated in my title for this review, this book is one of the scariest books most people will never read. The Christian nationalist movement is entirely comfortable with making the U.S. a model of itself, as defined by itself, and as judged by itself.Everyone else can be damned, or they can leave. It's their choice."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I read Michelle's book and I agree with about 95% of what she's written here... Her dark inferences with Christian Nationalism and Totalitarianism will get quite a rise in some quarters (especially those who believe they are doing God's work). She neglects any coverage though of Zionist groups, who work in combination with Christian Nationalists as a mean to solidify US support for Israel. After some $100 billion US dollars poured into the coffers of the Israeli government, you would think we would have bought enough good will where they might want to negotiate a peaceful solution.

I've also been quite aware of what's happening in the Christian Right, ever since I was invited by fundamentalist Christian friends to attend their on-campus dinners for the Brown University chapter of the Campus Crusade for Christ (Probably my most memorable dinner was when I found myself in complete agreement with the state of California director of the Campus Crusade for Christ, who thought I would prefer reading Thomas Jefferson's edited version of the Bible, which expurgated any references to the supernatural.). More recently, The New York Times published a year ago a series of articles on religious faith in the United States, emphasizing in one of its articles, the strong devotion of a few current Brown students belonging to one of several fundamentalist Christian groups on campus. Indeed, The New York Times' series was a more thoughtful, informative exploration of this issue, than Michelle Goldberg's new book; hers strikes me more as a clarion call to fellow progressives than yet another profound exploration of this very issue.Goldberg errs in depicting the Christian Right as a monolithic entity that may have more in common with the malevolent Daleks from \\"Doctor Who\\" or the drone-like Borg from \\"Star Trek\\". Judging from my own past experience, there exists a substantial diversity in belief within the politico-religious entity known as the \\"Christian Right\\" (A classic example is the wide range of views on expanding stem cell research, ranging from enthusiastic support from the likes of Nancy Davis, President Ronald Reagan's widow, to harsh criticism from the likes of Pat Robertson.). At best, Goldberg's depiction of the Christian Right may be useful to those unfamiliar with the issues; but I am inclined to think that it is, at worst, yet another superficial shrill warning to American progressives.Goldberg's coverage of the Intelligent Design issue is surprisingly quite superficial, relying mostly on eyewitness accounts outside the Dover, PA trial (Much to my amazement she chose not to cover the proceedings in the courtroom, missing out on what will be regarded as the 21st Century Scopes Trial.), instead of serious reporting based on interviews with Intelligent Design advocates like Lehigh University biochemist Michael Behe, author of \\"Darwin's Black Box\\" (which I regard as a sterling example of junk pseudoscience) and philosopher and mathematician William Dembski, or Intelligent Design critics like Brown University cell biologist Ken Miller, author of \\"Finding Darwin's God\\" (which I highly recommend) and University of California (Berkeley) vertebrate paleobiologist Kevin Padian (All four were witnesses for either side in the Dover, PA trial; professors Miller and Padian were the lead witnesses on behalf of the plaintiffs.). In essence, Goldberg has written the superficial liberal rebuttal to Ann Coulter's own superficial critique of evolution in her recent book \\"Godless: The Church of Liberalism\\" (I had the temerity to question Goldberg in private regarding her decision not to interview either Miller or Padian; her reply wasn't satisfactory to say the least.). Instead of reading Goldberg's review of Intelligent Design, I would have to recommend reading the popular works of distinguished paleobiologists Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge published by her publisher, W. W. Norton; most recently Niles Eldredge's \\"Darwin: Discovering the Tree of Life\\"."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Did not have dust jacket & not advertised that way!

If you are one of those people, you will likely be filled with a sense of righteous indignation when you read Goldberg's descriptions of the political and social maneuverings of the religious right. No matter how much you may personally agree with her points, however, it's best to bear in mind that this is a book written for a very specific purpose, and that purpose is to evoke exactly that reaction from exactly that type of person. It has an agenda, and does not by any means present a balanced viewpoint of current affairs; reading it with a critical eye and evaluating the evidence it presents for yourself is key.Evaluating the evidence Goldberg presents for yourself will likely cause you to find some of her arguments less than convincing. She tends to present the religious right as being organized to a rather surprising degree, but none of the evidence in her book supports this claim, pointing instead to a number of large organizations which often cooperate, but also sometimes work at cross-purposes. The book does not feel so much like a defense of her arguments as it does a laundry list of grievances committed against liberals. Goldberg tends to use language that is extremely strident, to the point that she sometimes sounds like the reflection of one of the crusaders her book vilifies. Her frequent comparisons of Christian Nationalism to totalitarianism are at first shocking, later overplayed.In spite of these faults, however, the book is very informative from a factual standpoint, and although her language often overstates her case, the fundamental points she discusses are all quite true. Goldberg also has a very solid and very convincing discussion in the closing sections regarding ways that those opposed to Christian Nationalism can reasonably hope to counteract that movement. Her main failing is in her overly strong presentation, and in spite of that this book achieved its purpose for at least one reader."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I read a review of this book in the Dallas Morning News. The religion editor said that very few Christians in the U.S. believe in dominionism. Thus, one of the cornerstones of the book is weak, because the author makes it sound like all evangelicals are dominionists (i.e. they want to take over America). The author herself admits that the number is maybe 12 % of all Americans, but my quess would be, it is much lower.37 % of evangelicals voted for John Kerry in 2004. Many evangelicals are thus not even \\"right-wing\\" (some are very conservative socially, while being liberal economically and on foreign policy). (Clinton spoke more about God than Bush does; Al Gore had a \\"WWJD\\" - What Would Jesus Do ? sign on his desk when he was Vice President, but liberals didn't find that \\"scary\\" or \\"chilling\\").I think that the sections of the book that equate right-wing evangelicals with fascists are particularly unfortunate. To put it briefly, there is really no overlap between them.Esquire magazine did a 1,000+ interview of American men. They found that 22% are either agnostic or atheist (6 % are atheist). 64 % either never go to church, or only at holidays. 78 % believe in God, but this study shows that we are very far in the U.S. from a \\"takeover\\" by evangelicals in black uniforms.There is more of a chance of American consumer culture \\"taking over\\" the religous right, than the opposite happening. Go into any megachurch and you will see that. One of the biggest people right now in America in terms of religion is Joel Osteen, whose message is upbeat and optimistic. Far from calling on Christians to \\"take over\\" America, his message seems to be one of just self-help and living a better life."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I just heard about this book on Fresh Air too. I have been well aware (and afraid) of the influence that the Cristian right has on our political process.

She has taken the typical fueling and fanning of the flames on cultural disagreements and turned them into \\"the sky is falling\\" types of arguments. But rather than arguing how far America has strayed from it's Judeo-Christian roots, she calls us to worry that we are not diverse, tolerant and laisse-faire enough.As she tackles the well-worn issues of modern society (racial, sexual, spiritual, gender) Ms. Goldberg recolors the anger and malice of the far right rabble into a negative but vivid lexicon for the far left.It is a sharp communication move, as it seems to have worked for the right from Bush senior forward, so why not embrace it to help the Howard Deans and Nancy Pelozzis of the world? Because it is poor form, bad politics and creates deeper schizms between citizens who simply want to live in peace and improve the future of this nation.America really is not in need of a female Rush Limbaugh in print.What we require is less fear mongering by the Limbaughs and Goldbergs and far more calls to shared purpose by the next Kennedys, Reagans and Clintons."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Goldberg's book is nothing but secular-leftist paranoia. It offers nothing new, but rather reaffirms the preconceived anecdotal ideas of the secularist.Goldberg should limit her writing to opinion pieces, because the lack of research and knowledge she displayed in this book is evidenced by her confusion over theological ideas and misconstruing political movements in history.This was not a book that deals with honest research, rather Goldberg wrote a propaganda piece that vilifies a group of people who oppose her ideological beliefs."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"This book is a left-wing, ultra-liberal polemical diatribe that was written by a young woman who, while a college student at SUNY Buffalo, seems to have overdosed on Hannah Arendt's book about the rise of Nazi totalitarianism in Europe and thinks it is happening here because of the Bush Administration. She did not, apparently, take American History 101, with the result that she exhibits no knowledge or understanding about religion in American history and grossly exaggerates the importance of today's Christian fundamentalist movement in America politics. Her suggestions about what the liberal left must do politically to prevent America from becoming a Christian Nation are truly hilarious. A terrible book, disjointed, repetitive, rambling, much in need of a good editor. Anyone who buys this book will be wasting his money. It adds absolutely nothing to the sum of our knowledge about Christian fundamentalism in America today."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Michelle Goldberg does not like Christians. Michelle Goldberg thinks that Christians smell bad. Michelle Goldberg gets an icky feeling when she stands next to a Christian, and, later, Michelle Goldberg is sure that Christian cooties crawl up and down her body. Ew. Michelle Goldberg needs to take a long, hot shower.All is not lost. Michelle Goldberg is a liberal. A progressive. A multiculturalist. Michelle Goldberg celebrates diversity.So, Michelle Goldberg met with Christians, and they were nice to her. She realized then that her prejudice was incorrect. Christians confided their deepest concerns. Like her, she discovered, Christians want a healthy, happy, safe America, where children thrive, the truth is proclaimed, and freedom and justice prevail. They may disagree on how to achieve these ends, but Michelle Goldberg realized that we all have to live with people with whom we disagree, and that the challenge is to find that way of coexisting with diverse neighbors that makes America great, and our democracy, not only strong, but possible.The final paragraph, above, is, of course, wishful thinking.\\"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism,\\" is the most hateful book I've ever read, and I study hate and have read classics in the genre. What makes this book so painful is that when other hate mongers were plying their trade, they had some wound that the reader could understand as exacerbating their hatred. What happened in Goldberg's short, privileged life to make her hate so much?The book jacket, in its colors, fonts, and design, is meant to evoke a propaganda poster of Nazis giving the \\"sieg heil\\" salute. This one, hate-mongering lie alone is cheap and malicious enough to render Goldberg radioactive to any ethical person.In this case, you *can* tell a book by its cover. Goldberg equates or associates Christianity with Nazism throughout her short, mean, ugly text (eg: pp 10, 22, 33, 54, 73, 153, 179, 188). When Goldberg is not equating Christians with Nazis, she is equating Christians with Muslims - not dimple-cheeked, multiculti Muslim poster children, but, specifically, Islamic terrorists (eg: p 22, 31, 39, 207-210).For good measure, Goldberg compares American malls to Stalinist architecture. As someone who lived in the Soviet empire, I just have to say, in her architectural criticism, no less than in her hate-mongering, Goldberg comes across as a hyperbolic chucklehead. I can just imagine the kind of restaurant reviews this chick would pump out. They'd be a weight lose bonanza.Haters must invent their Other of Choice. Otherwise, they'd see that human beings are all brothers and sisters. Goldberg invents her other of choice in a group that she admits, right up front, that she herself made up: \\"Christian Nationalists.\\" She provides the manifesto for this group, a document that she, as she readily admits, made up (6-8). In this, Goldberg is very like the authors of the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\\" a book to which this book, for all the right reasons, is frequently compared. (Do the Google search, and get back to me.)I know I've got only a thousand words here and should not be repeating myself, but did you get that, Gentle Reader? Goldberg, in a book published by a mainstream publishing house, *invented* a *fictitious* group of Christians, and their fictitious manifesto, which she penned *herself.* By her own admission. Is this bugging you as much as it bugged me? Jeez, I hope so.Let's cut to the chase here. How would you feel about a book that invented a name and a manifesto for a random collection of otherwise unconnected Jews who supported the war in Iraq? And claimed that they were involved in an unproved and unprovable conspiracy to take over the US? A conspiracy so scary that the sane, decent person's only recourse is, as Goldberg insists is the only recourse to \\"Christian Nationalism,\\" to \\"keep your passport handy and your bags packed\\"? (Where is Goldberg planning to go? She doesn't say.) How would you feel if someone grouped together all Homosexuals or all Jehovah's Witnesses or all musical comedy ticket buyers in the US, persons otherwise unconnected, slapped some spooky moniker on them, made a bunch of cheap comparisons between them and the Nazis or the Stalinists or Boris Badenoff and Natasha, used some cut-and- paste \\"conspiracy theory central\\" word processing program to create their manifesto and claimed that they were about to take over the country?Yes, there are Christians who do some of the things Goldberg accuses Christians of doing: they lobby government officials; they attend Town Hall meetings; they publish Op Ed pieces; they join the PTA; they learn debate skills. Goldberg wants us to believe that these very behaviors aren't the backbone of a multicultural democracy, but are some noxious virus that threatens your life. Goldberg has no evidence of Christians doing any of the following: stockpiling weapons, planning to blow up buildings, planning, in fact, to harm anyone.Yes, many Christians, as Goldberg claims, are uncomfortable with promiscuity among schoolchildren, homosexuality, and abortion. To read this book, you'd think that Christians are the only ones who object to these things. Goldberg is wrong. Atheist Bill Maher couldn't get through a stand-up routine without homophobic \\"jokes.\\" Demonizing Christians does nothing to help gay people. And plenty of non-Christians have a problem with abortion. Demonizing Christians won't advance women's right to choose, or reconcile that right with the vexing questions abortion entails.On the East Coast, the West, and in the heartland, I've worked on feminist, gay rights, and peace issues. I've marched, canvassed, and broadcast, often shoulder-to-shoulder with Evangelical Christians. In Red State Indiana, my greatest inspirations and support in gay rights struggles were born again Christians. Just thinking of them, right now, within the context of this vile book, I am, frankly, on the verge of tears."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Michelle Goldberg has researched and written an important book, one that will provoke discussion. I was impressed by the depth and breadth of her research and of the interviews with the people she writes about. She claims her biases up front.The most important aspect of the book is a delineation of the opposing world-views she describes, something that may be news to blue-staters: there are two competing views of American and world history, two competing standards for \\"science,\\" two competing notions of reality in American life today: an Enlightenment/humanist viewpoint and a viewpoint from which the Christian God, as interpreted by the Christian Right, is King of the United States. She suggests that dialogue between the two is impossible because there is so little common ground, and that those on the center and left underestimate the seriousness of the challenge to the U.S. Constitution and values.My only gripe with this book is that the scenario she paints is so dark that many readers may be tempted to defend themselves against the thought, rather than against the threat. She is describing real institutions, real people, real organizations whose own mission statements can be checked out with a few keystrokes at the keyboard.This is a must-read book for anyone who values free speech, freedom of religion, or is concerned for the way their tax dollars are spent."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"\\"Kingdom Coming\\" by Michelle Goldberg is a cautionary tale about Christian Nationalism and its threat to the Enlightenment values that are crucial to maintaining a modern democratic state as we know it today. Ms. Goldberg has done a superb job of surveying the movement, its leaders and its political ideals. Through her remarkable first-hand reporting and analysis, the author helps us understand that a liberal response articulating why rationality matters is urgently needed to counteract the forces of irrationality that threaten to undo our country.Ms. Goldberg explains how homeschooling has allowed superstition to be instilled in a generation of young people who are being encouraged to become politically active. Exurban megachurches provide organizers with millions of voters and activists who can be rapidly mobilized around Christian causes. The author dedicates individual chapters to discussing six areas where extremist positions have gained ground, including: revisionism of U.S. history; anti-gay rights activism; intelligent design theory (Creationism); faith-based public services; abstinence; and the U.S. court system. As Ms. Goldberg clearly shows, the Christian movement's success has been substantial and in many cases has been attributable to sympathy and support at the highest levels of the U.S. government.Significantly, Ms. Goldberg's comparative analysis shows that extremist Christian views have gained institutional support over time. For example, she compares how the Barry Goldwater campaign of 1964 shied away from the John Birch Society in order to distance itself from the admixture of militarism with religion to the Bush administration's embrace of General William G. Boykin after he had made several outlandish public statements about divine warfare. In fact, by appointing hundreds of ideologically sympathetic judges and bureaucrats to numerous positions within the federal government, Ms. Goldberg contends that the extremist Christian movement will continue to exert its influence for many years to come.Drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt, Ms. Goldberg helps us consider how fascism finds fertile ground once all objective reason has been marginalized from public debate. The author attributes a peculiar form of Christian postmodernism, in its rejection of objective truth as myths that are propagated by the so-called liberal elite onto the unwilling Christian masses, to be responsible for fomenting a paranoid fanaticism that ultimately may prove to be a catalyst to inspiring violent action against all those who are different or who may object to the Christian agenda. But such concerns are not merely theoretical; Ms. Goldberg goes on to share the experiences of herself and others who have already suffered discrimination as a result of the works of Christian extremists.Interestingly, Ms. Goldberg punctures the inflated claims of heartland moral superiority. The author points out that the \\"red states\\" where Christianity is strongest has higher divorce rates, lower education levels and are net debtors to the federal treasury when compared with the \\"blue states\\" where liberalism is strongest. The reality on the ground, then, suggests that the proclamations about Christian morals, Biblical guidance and American individualism are so much empty rhetoric; rather, such widely misheld beliefs probably provide simplistic answers to complex questions about changing economic, cultural and social conditions. While it is true that Ms. Goldberg does not propose a specific response to these underlying problems (which in any case would be beyond the scope of this book), her plea to liberals to stand up in defense of justice, reason and fairness is, in my view, totally appropriate: an enlightened, free and civil government is what is needed most to help solve the problems that plague the U.S. and the Christian community, and liberals need to make that fact better known.I highly recommend this important book to everyone."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"As someone who grew up in a home influenced by apocalyptic Christian fundamentalism, I admit right up front that I will not attempt an \\"objective\\" review of this book (whatever that might mean). I agreed with the premise Michelle Goldberg outlines (i.e., that there is a powerful strand of politicized Christianity in the US that holds the Constitution in contempt and that seeks absolute political control---Goldberg calls them \\"Christian nationalists\\") before she ever set fingers to keyboard. Frankly, I was amazed at the empathy and understanding with which Michelle Goldberg approached this material, and found that one of the strongest features of this book. Another of the strengths is in her willingness to let her subjects speak for themselves. Oftentimes the most damning comments come straight from the mouths of the Christian nationalists themselves, and Goldberg does a fine job of putting these quotes into an overall context that should chill anyone who still appreciates the ideals of the Enlightenment.For example, Goldberg repeatedly exposes a Manichean worldview in which the American body politic is literally divided into black and white, good and evil, with the Christian nationalists on one side and the rest of us on the other. (I leave it for you to guess which side is \\"good.\\") \\"Thus every political issue--indeed, every disputed aspect of our national life--is a struggle between good and evil\\" (p. 4). She quotes Pastor Rod Parsley: \\"Everyone asks, \`Why is it so close?' The light is getting lighter and the dark is getting darker. These two opponents are not just opponents. This is a values situation. This is lightness and darkness!\\" (p. 51). As Goldberg sagaciously notes, people have a perfect right to this Manichean worldview, \\"yet when the United States government works this way, it turns all nonevangelicals into \\"the other side.\\" The nonreligious are no longer even part of the debate...\\" (152). I would also note that in this view, the \\"wrongly religious\\" (i.e., those who don't accept a particular collection of tenets about God, the Bible, etc.) are also left out of the debate.Of course, though, this point is moot, because making the US an overtly Christian country, in which the nonreligious and \\"wrongly religious\\" are second-class citizens at best, is one aspect of the Christian nationalist agenda: \\"Among [evangelicals and born-again Christians] there is substantial support for amending the United States Constitution to make Christianity the country's official religion...\\" (9). Leaving us out of the debate makes sense to Christian Reconstructionist theologian R.J. Rushdoony, who denounced democracy as a \\"heresy and \`the great love of the failures and cowards of life'\\" (38). Whereas many try to sugarcoat this agenda for wider consumption, the raw truth is available for the flock: \\"Christians have an obligation, a mandate, a commission, a holy responsibility to reclaim the land for Jesus Christ--to have dominion in civil structures, just as in every other aspect of life and godliness. But it is dominion we are after. Not just a voice. It is dominion we are after. Not just influence. It is dominion we are after. Not just equal time. It is dominion we are after. World conquest. That's what Christ has commissioned us to accomplish\\" (p. 41, Goldberg quoting George Grant's The Changing of the Guard: Biblical Principles for Political Action.)This antidemocratic, authoritarian philosophy can't stand up to the scrutiny of the contemporary world, though, and so, as Goldberg explores in the bulk of her book, the Christian nationalists have set to work building an alternate reality in which myth is science, fiction is history, and public policy is faith-based. From the continued intrusion of creationists in our public schools, to the campaign to refashion the Founding Fathers as Christian nationalists, to publicly funded abstinence-only sex education classes, there is a parallel reality alongside ours. \\"Originally, conservative Christian activists just wanted to keep Darwin and sex education out of schools. When that didn't work, they developed an alternative, quasi-scientific infrastructure that would legitimate their religious beliefs in secular terms, and which they hoped to use to replace the doctrines they objected to\\" (p. 138). \\"To the Christian nationalists...publicly funded religious social services auger nothing less than an epistemological revolution. They allow knowledge derived from the Bible to trump knowledge derived from studying the world. No longer would American policy and American civic life be based on facts available to all of us, on the kind of rationality that looks at \`objective or even secular outcomes.' It would be based on faith\\" (p. 127). \\"What's lacking, though, isn't just truth--it's the entire social mechanism by which truth is distinguished from falsehood. Blunting Christian nationalism requires turning toward the Enlightenment and rebuilding a culture of rationalism. Unfortunately, multitudes of Americans no longer find Enlightenment values compelling\\" (p. 181).That last sentence sums up what is possibly the biggest challenge posed by the theocratic right. Because they no longer find the Enlightenment values of empiricism and reason \\"compelling,\\" they are assaulting the very criteria for establishing truth claims. Readers of this review may think this an exaggeration, but I can assure you from my experience as an undergraduate instructor that many students can no longer distinguish between fact and opinion, a consequence of twenty-plus years of a concentrated disinformation campaign. \\"This is a pattern that repeats itself again and again in the culture wars. When experts discredit some bit of fundamentalist orthodoxy, it's taken as further proof of the experts' bias. When religious conservatives are proven wrong, their faith in their righteousness only grows, along with their hatred of the conspiracy they see arrayed against them\\" (p. 78). \\"With no agreement on the most basic of facts or sources of authority, discussions between today's creationists and evolutionists seem particularly futile. Dialogue is impossible without some shared sense of reality\\" (p. 93). Lest the reader think this is merely an academic issue with no bearing on the real world, they need to remind themselves that this alternate reality is populated by pharmacists who confuse themselves with theologians and/or doctors: \\"A rash of Christian pharmacists have refused to fill prescriptions for both the morning-after pill and for ordinary oral contraceptives--180 such incidents were reported in one six-month period in 2004....In Denton, Texas, three pharmacists working at an Eckerd drug store refused to fill a rape victim's prescription for the morning-after pill\\" (p. 156). In other words, these ideas and beliefs have real consequences for people, especially for those who don't hold these ideas and beliefs.Others have critiqued Goldberg for her comparisons to fascists, whom they usually equate unequivocally with Nazis. While comparisons to Nazis are always inflammatory and rarely helpful, we must remember that fascism has some definable characteristics and that most (if not all) of the movements Goldberg describes can be seen to share many of these characteristics. If it walks like duck, etc. Others have taken her to task for conflating Christian fundamentalists with Christian evangelicals with Christian nationalists with theocrats etc., implying that because the Christian nationalist movement is decentralized and diffuse that it is not real at all. These criticisms, all specious, are tactics employed by the theocratic right, along with a cynical use of \\"religious liberty,\\" to pursue a pernicious agenda under the radar. We ignore Goldberg's book and the movements to which she alludes at our peril."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Ms. Goldberg's book is a must-read for liberals, secularists, and mainstream Christians. I do not find her conclusions overblown or alarmist, but in fact quite astute. The facts speak for themselves, and she has done a commendable job of connecting the dots between the GOP and the dominionist movement, illuminating their goals and their processes. I do not think it is wild speculation, for it is clear that the evangelical right is making strong progress inflitrating the GOP, and there is every reason to believe that this will continue. It is a sad state of affairs, I believe, that in this modern age, this movement has acquired a veneer of legitimacy in the public discourse. The dominionist/christian reconstructionist movement is a gathering threat, and should be treated as such."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Fascism is a totalitarian philosophy that emphasizes state power to the exclusion of personal liberty. \\"Islamo Fascists,\\" according to the Bush administration, are radical elements of Islam intent on destroying freedom and encoding fundamentalist Islamic law in civil society. Reading Goldberg's book, I couldn't help noticing that Christian Nationalism is to America what \\"Islamo Fascists\\" are to Islamic countries; a radicalized religious movement intent on destroying personal liberty and codifying their religious views into secular law.One of the things I liked best about Goldberg's book is the extent to which she quotes the movement's leaders, in effect letting them dig the hole they fall into. For example, Christian Nationalism asserts the supremacy of Biblical law over constitutional law, illustrated by Howard Philips, quoted by Goldberg:\`The overarching question we face today is: \`Who is America's sovereign?' and \`What is his law?'... The Holy Bible makes clear that Jesus Christ is our sovereign...Clearly, if the words of the framers are honored, Congress has no authority to restrict the establishment of Biblical religion in the State of Alabama - neither has any federal judge such authority.\\" [p. 167]No liberal could possibly define the threat to our constitutional government from Christian Nationalism better than Philips. Goldberg gives the inside scoop on how the religious right plans to infiltrate and control the government, and use it to establish a religious/fascist state. One step in this plan is indoctrination of youth. As Goldberg explains:\\"The influence of these kids, trained from infancy to be Christian culture warriors, is already making itself felt. Ferris's Patrick Henry College, located in rural Virginia, caters specifically to home schooled evangelical students. It has existed only since 2000, and accepts fewer than one hundred students a year, yet in 2004's spring semester it provided 7 percent of the White House's interns. Twenty-two conservative congressmen have employed one or more Patrick Henry interns, and a Patrick Henry graduate works on Karl Rove's staff..\\" [pp 2-3]Another page from their playbook is to fly under the radar. Goldberg explains how the religious right trains its members to keep a low profile:\\"Christian Coalition manuals urged candidates to keep their religious agenda quiet until after they were elected. Supporters would learn who the local Christian Coalition candidates were through voter guides distributed at evangelical churches, but the general public was often in the dark.\\" [pp 14-15]Reading Goldberg's book, one of the things that struck me was how extreme this movement really is; thus the reason for keeping their agenda out of the public view. Here's an example from Goldberg's book:\\"In 2003, Rick Santorum told the Associated Press, \`...the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, ... [but]... this right to privacy ... doesn't exist in my opinion... You say, well, it's my individual freedom. Yes, but it destroys the basic unit of our society, because it condones behavior that's antithetical to strong, healthy families.\\" [p. 157]Rick Santorum is a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania. He is just one in a long list of high-profile Republicans supporting Christian Nationalism. Others include George W. Bush, Karl Rove, Ned Ryun (former speech writer for Bush), Tom Coburn, Jim Demint, Orin Hatch, Tim LaHaye, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld.Like many movements, Christian Nationalism has evolved from earlier roots. Goldberg explains that \\"today's Christian Nationalism movement began in the anti-Communist John Birch Society, \\"a conspiracy-minded grassroots group founded in 1958...Christian nationalist arguments and campaigns often precisely echo Birch propaganda, and movement leaders like Tim LaHaye began as Birch organizers.\\" [pp 10-11]Their strategy is pretty straight forward: control the political arena, dismantle public institutions (such as public schools) that are offensive to the movement, and install activist judges that will \\"legislate from the bench\\" and help establish the Christian Nationalist's agenda.The central premise of Christian Nationalism is that fundamentalist Christians have an inherent right of dominion; the God-given right to impose their religious views and literal interpretation of the Bible on society. They seek to outlaw birth control and abortion, reinstate school prayer, and promote their version of Christianity through public schools and government institutions. They advocate their right to engage in discrimination (based on sex, religion, gender, sexual orientation and nationality) while being funded by public monies. They oppose science on many fronts, including evolution, global warming, biological research, reproductive science, and the environment. Their foreign policy is dictated largely by the belief that we are in the \\"last days,\\" prior to Jesus' return, and that America must support Israel, even when they engage in war crimes. They look forward in anxious anticipation to the next world war; the climax of which they believe will be the triumphant return of Jesus, when those who support their view of religion will be caught up in the \\"rapture\\" while everyone else dies an ignoble death.Not surprisingly, a major component of the movement is propaganda. It's a shameless formula for fascism. As Hannah Arendt said:\\"Before mass leaders seize the power to fit reality to their lies, their propaganda is marked by its extreme contempt for facts as such, for in their opinion fact depends entirely on the power of the man who can fabricate it.\\" [87, quoting Hannah Arendt, \\"The Origins of Totalitarianism\\"]The book focuses solely on the leaders - shakers and movers - of Christian Nationalism, but fails to mention or discuss many of their fringe supporters that are not directly associated with the movement (the Mormons, for example). This was a mistake by Goldberg, in my estimation, because these fringe supporters have often provided some of the most consistent support for the movement.With just that one complaint, this book ranks as one of the best I've read this year. It's a remarkable book that needs to be read by every American patriot."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"The organized push from Evangelicals to dissolve the separation between church and state is currently one of the most potent threats to individual rights in the United States. With 'Kingdom Coming', Michelle Goldberg presents a detailed intellectual history of Christian Nationalism as well as documents how Evangelicals have permeated American culture.This book is rich in intellectual history. In the first chapter, Goldberg explains Dominionism, which holds that Christians have the god-given right and duty to be sovereign over one's country, if not the entire world. This idea derives from Christian Reconstructionism, which argues that American law should be replaced by Biblical law.You will learn about many important figures in the intellectual origins of Christian Nationalism. This includes the following thinkers and writers:* R. J. Rushdoony, the profoundly influential prolific writer who wrote that homosexuals, blasphemers and unchaste women should be sentenced to death as well as insisted that Jesus Christ would not return until Christians establish a thousand-year reign on Earth. Rushdoony is the father of Christian Reconstructionism.* Francis Schaeffer, whose 'Christian Manifesto' argued that history is a contest between two antipodal forces: the Christian worldview and a materialist (secular) worldview, that the U.S. was founded on a Christian Consensus and that any public official who \\"commands what is contrary to God's Law [abrogates his authority].\\" Unfortunately, Goldberg only speaks of Schaeffer for a little over two pages.* David Barton, a Christian revisionist historian who writes extensively on how the separation between church and state is a myth and that the founding fathers intended for basic biblical principles to permeate public life.* Marvin Olasky, a prolific writer who is considered the founder of Compassionate Conservatism. One of Olasky's major works, 'The Tragedy of American Compassion', argues that there was a golden age of social services provided by churches until the secular government of Franklin Delano Roosevelt made social welfare the government's responsibility. President George W. Bush cites Olasky as his leading influence for funding faith-based initiatives.This book also thoroughly documents how Evangelicals are changing American culture. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:* Many widely-read revisionist history books such as Barton's 'Original Intent'.* Textbooks designed to bring Christian science and morality into classrooms such as the intelligent design championing text 'Of Pandas and People'.* Television shows that promote Christian ideology such as Pat Robertson's '700 Club'.* Rock concerts and campus clubs intended to convert and recruit the younger generation.* Highly influential political activists such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, James Dobson and Ralph Reed and their respective non-profit political organizations.* Active Christian think-tanks such as Answers in Genesis, Discovery Institute and the Family Research Council.* Media moguls such as the Reverend Sun Myung Moon.* Many recent/current legislators with openly pro-Evangelical agendas such as Sam Brownback, Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, Rick Santorum, Jesse Helms and former House Majority Leader Tom Delay.After the first, each chapter is organized around a specific political campaigns that the Religious Right has embraced: against gays, for intelligent design, for faith-based initiatives, for abstinence-only education and against \\"activist\\" judges. The ongoing war on abortion rights is also thoroughly treated.My only complaint is that, like a waitress who seasons your food without asking, the author rudely inserts her socialist views throughout the book. She even explicitly celebrates FDR's New Deal for \\"[bringing] socialism to America.\\" As if everyone who is anti-religion is also pro-socialism! Irritating as this is, it does not ruin an otherwise informative book."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I am a 'Liberal Thinker' living in Mississippi (I know; an oxymoron, at best). I find it interesting that most of the reviews which claim this book's findings to be 'paranoid', etc., are written by urban, Northern readers. The other side, like myself, who live in rural, and/or Southern areas, know from where the author speaks.Wake Up Yankees and city-folk! (And I am originally both, myself). There is a rampant and, sadly, creeping increase in the number of people who are described accurately in her book. And they are on the hunt for more, and more power; they are no longer spending most of their time in church, Sunday school, etc. THIS is what the author is trying to say: they feel that they must no longer sit on the sidelines, and just vote for their \\"true\\" candidates in local elections; they feel the world is getting more and more 'evil', that the 'end of days' is near, and that they therefore must do what they 'must do' to fight the Antichrist (whomever that is to them). I know you think I am only saying this because of where I live, but people here are acting evermore and more aggressively, and in their own fashion, so are the right-wingers all over our country!Unfortunately, if they would stay to themselves, and even limit their opinions and power-grabbing to their past activities like trying to convert people like me, going on 'mission trips', traveling around the South to their various summer tent revivals a-la-Elmer Gantry, etc., - no problem. BUT THEY HAVE CHANGED!!! I have been here 6 (long) years now, and I have seen them expanding more and more - towards more power on a national level, and also towards taking on larger as well as more overt acts re: their beliefs. One example is the PA evolution case some other reviewer cited. Here in Missssssssippppi (where many of these things emanate from) they are passing crazier and crazier laws. And I predict that these, like any epidemic, will spread insome fashion, to a state like yours. 5 years ago, the egislature voted that each school room, even kindergarten rooms, must post a sign \\"In God We Trust\\". My daughter, in 2nd grade at the time, asked 'What does that mean? And why is it in a school? I mean, shouldn't it be in a church or someplace like that?' Thank goodness for the clear thinking of youth.Then, 2 years ago, the right-wing forces here, ever on the warpath to ensure that their actions will stop the spread of criminal and wrong-thinking behavior had a bill enacted ordering that each public building has the right to post one or both of the following: the Ten Commandments (of course) and/or an excerpt for The Sermon on the Mount. One of the legislators explained 'We don't care if its illegal; sometimes you just gotta do what's right'.And, let's not forget the former Alabama Judge refusing to move that stone behemoth of the Ten Commandments, no matter what it cost him personally. Plus that matter didn't end there; not only did legions of his supporters gather at his courthouse for endless prayer sessions, but he probably will run for Governor of that state; coffers of monies from all over the country have already been promised to his campaign coffers. Also - even though that replica of the 10 Commandments weighs more than King Kong, the top politicians begged the ex-Judge for it, so he shipped (?) it to our state (and others) - it came here to be displayed on the grounds of our state capitol, where each gubanatorial candidate make speeches outdoing the other in his \\"neverending-until-the-day-I-die-over-my-dead-politican's-cold-white-hands'-body-will-you-pry-this-most-holy-replica-of-why-we-are-here-on-earth-and-why-only-we-and-not-anyone-else-will-ever-enter-the-kingdom-of-heaven-and-the-'others'-can-only-BURN-IN-HELL-FOR-ALL-ETERNITY\\".I know many of you reading this will think \\"she's only saying that because of where she lives\\"!Of course, this isn't what is exactly happening in the North, or other non-Southern places. BUT - more and more religious extremists are increasingly involved in politics there as well. Besides the PA case, in Ohio they are debating teaching 'Creative Design' (huh?!) in the schools. All over, some politicians are positive that the cause of juvenile \\"misbehavior\\" is the lack of prayer, etc., in the schools. And it goes on and on. They are getting bolder and bolder and, unfortunately, the politicians feel they have to cater to them more & more. Pres. Bush finally vetoed a bill - the first time in 6 years+ - BECAUSE of the religious right. I'm not saying he himself doesn't share their beliefs; but that is NOT the reason for his one and only veto. And the Democrats are not much better. I never thought I would see the day when Senator Hillary C. would actually tell an audience something to the effect that she 'sympathizes' with feelings that abortion=murder. And she is currently representing New York and wants to represent the whole nation! If that doesn't back up what the author states in her book, I don't know what does. We MUST fight back. Let's call our politicians, and others, every opportunity we can!!!!One final thought: I do agree with one reviewer that the views fo these religious far-right folks are not held by most Christians; and also that we must ask why? Why are these religious rt. wingers becoming more and more forceful? I think its because they are very, very frightened. And we should try to approach them from that angle, with understanding; but, at the same time, we must make them understand that we will also push back against their attempts."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Good journalistic writing about a subject which would be laughable if it were not so worrying. Only 4 stars, as MG never attempts to convince anybody who is not already on her side. That may be a sign of a realistic approach, but it also leaves one a little short of satisfied.Not sure either if her quotes from H. Arendt on totalitarianism quite make it clear what kind of threat to civilization we are looking at here. I see Christian fundamentalism less like a new bolshevism, fascism or nazism, but more like \\"our\\" Western version of the Taliban or the Iranian mullahs' theocracy. Terrible no doubt, but different from Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Mao etc.Not being American myself, nor living in the US, I am not constantly exposed to the antics of US christianity. I need this kind of book to keep abreast of the evolution of madness. Best parts of MG's book are those about the cultural war on the \\"gay threat\\" and on evolution vs. designism.For me, the Eureka moment when I understood the nature of a strong current in today's US public was the ridiculous uproar over Janet's boob. Oh my, if a partly naked beautiful woman can threaten the world as much as many claimed, then really the US is on par with Afghanistan. Culturally."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"4/4.5First of all, this is not an objective book but at no time does Goldberg pretend it is. It's not an academic study but a culmination of a journalist's research into the political arm of fundamentalist Christianity. I also don't personally agree with everything that Goldberg does. None of this, however, diminishes the importance of this book in bringing attention to a movement that is increasingly bold in trying to make the rest of the nation live according to their religious beliefs.Instead of letting others have their own religious beliefs (or non-religious beliefs), this movement cries foul and claims religious discrimination when non-Christian nationalists try to stop them from imposing their religious beliefs on others. For example, when leaders and members of this movement try to prevent gay couples from getting married or having adoption rights, etc., they claim religious discrimination if they are impeded in any way. Somehow they equate not being able to dictate other people's lives as a violation of their own religious freedom.Goldberg covers several issues in this book from gay rights to sex ed, from creationism in schools to faith-based initiatives. She shows how it's not a movement for Christian rights but a move towards theocracy or theonomy. Although written in 2005, it doesn't seem like the Christian nationalist movement has been set back all that much, if at all. Note that Obama has not changed the fact that faith-based groups receiving public funds can discriminate against gays, non-Christians, etc. in hiring. Our tax dollars are being used to promote a particular religious group's beliefs.Kingdom Coming also introduces the Christian Reconstructionists which appear to be the Christian Taliban. They are anti-democratic, wanting a theocracy that punishes homosexuality, adultery, and other things with death. (I'm assuming this also included children who mouth off to their parents since that is also in the Bible.) Even the leaders of other far right Christians who don't necessarily support these particular extremist ideas join forces with the Reconstructionists in order to get certain objectives achieved. It's scary stuff. Religious movements do not belong in politics, but the Christian nationalists contrarily argue that religion should BE politics.Goldberg isn't forecasting the immediate demise of our democratic nation. She's very specific about this. But she warns that allowing the Christian nationalists to slowly chip away at the democratic plurality of the US will lead us to a type of country in which the majority of us don't want to live.Read this book if any of these ideas scare the bejeezus out of you. It's not anti-Christian. It's anti-totalitarianism. It's live and let live. As a Christian, I don't want others who also call themselves Christians to be able to tell me and the rest of the country how to live based on their own subjective interpretations of the Bible and whatever supposed personal communications they have with God. This is not religious freedom. This is tyranny."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Michelle Goldberg, a reporter for the online magazine Salon, has written what will strike us \\"blue\\" staters (sorry to be so simplistic, but it's just so darn...convenient) as something out of a horror movie--but it's all true. Traveling from megachurches to courthouses to faith-based drug \\"treatment\\" centers, she relates the history and current plans of what she calls the Christian Nationalist movement, an offshoot of the even scarier ideology of Christian Reconstruction, which states that America has always been and will be again a strictly Christian nation, and that secularism is a lie spawned by the devil. Their strategy to take the country \\"back\\" involves a kind of Trojan horse scheme in which legions of home-schooled Christian soldiers, law degrees in hand, slowly infiltrate school boards, courts and finally the government and transform the entire culture into something that combines Old Testament legal codes with New Testament evangelism. They carefully mimic secular speech and attitudes, but beneath the \\"code\\" they signal their true agenda. For instance, George W. Bush's old campaign slogan of \\"compassionate conservatism\\" echoes the title of a book by one of the movement's leading strategists, Marvin Olasky.In one chapter, Ms. Goldberg relates how thinly-disguised propaganda spouted from megachurches helped pass anti-gay marriage initiatives in every state they were on the ballot in the '04 elections (and maybe ensured Bush's victory). This confounded democratic campaign workers, who saw little or no competition in their door-to-door operations.Elsewhere, she reveals how the Bush administration's \\"faith-based\\" initiative has turned into a gravy train for organizations whose main goal is Christian prosyletizing! Even more worrisome, these groups aren't bound by equal-opportunity employment rules, so they're free to discriminate on the basis of religion or sexual orientation.There are also chapters on how creationism, um, \\"evolved\\" into \\"intelligent design\\" and the holy war against the courts in the wake of the Terri Schiavo case. The plan for the courts is especially scary, since they want to either stack them with \\"true believers\\" or, through lawsuits, strip them of their legitimacy, creating a power vacuum they'd be happy to fill.From the beginning of the book, Ms. Goldberg admits that she's an urbanite secularist (she lives in Brooklyn), but for the vast majority of the book she lets the Nationalists' words and actions speak for themselves. In fact, it's only in her conclusion that I think she falters. Her solutions to opposing the movement--which she sees correctly as incipient fascism--all involve the government or the courts. This misses the root problem, in my view, which is faith itself. The extremist beliefs of fundamentalists must be challenged and their minds changed, since Ms. Goldberg's ideas, although logical, would only result in an endless tug-of-war. I'm not suggesting that secular humanists start knocking on doors a la Jehovah's Witnesses, but liberals and civil libertarians must use the media to their advantage. Even the supposedly liberal entertainment business should get more involved. If explicitly pro-secular movies are too risky, at least we should see something at least pro-science and pro-fact. The alternative, if the Christian Nationalists have their way, would be be all Americans of all faiths (or none) being trapped in a hell of their making."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"As a Jewish American woman, Goldberg is rightfully concerned when Christian Nationalists demand an officially Christian state. She is moved to gather detail on what such radicals actually want for the future. And some want a full restoration of Old Testament law, perhaps as practiced in the Puritans' Massachusetts Bay Colony, including the death penalty for witchcraft, blasphemy, adultery and homosexuality. Other radicals appeal for a new struggle to establish Christianity throughout the world. As she cites George Grant from in the late 1980s,\\"Christians have an obligation, a mandate, a commission, a holy responsibility to reclaim the land for Jesus Christ -- to have dominion in civil structures, just as in every other aspect of life and godliness.But it is dominion we are after; Not just a voice.It is dominion we are after. Not just influence.It is dominion we are after. Not just equal time.It is dominion we are after.World conquest. That's what Christ has commissioned us to accomplish. We must win the world with the power of the Gospel. And we must never settle for anything less ...\\" (p. 158)Goldberg doesn't contest whether such Christian Nationalists represent religion as Jesus taught it. She just appeals to the U.S. Constitution in defense of all religious minorities. But since the Constitution enshrines some of the values which can be found in the Bible (such respect for other people) perhaps she has a certain appeal to religious values after all. In defending her society's freedom from church control, she is also fighting for the freedom of religion from state control.-author of Correcting Jesus"},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"To those of you who think Christianity is being attacked, it is not.

That is because it predates our modern technology. This does not mean it deserves to be the guiding light for all who roam the earth.I grew up Catholic but am not interested in religion anymore. I have no problem with anyone who wants to practice their religion.

That did it for me. I wanted to read it.Michelle Goldberg is thorough in her presentation. She discusses the development of the \\"Christian Nation\\" philosophy, and she shows how, in the hands of the militant mindset, it can be dangerous. She also focuses on: the push to have Intelligent Design taught in public schools, the federal funding of faith-based groups, the promotion of abstinence as the key to the sexual problems of the nation. She also covers other issues as well, which you can find out by reading the book. And through all of this, she highlights the \\"Christian Nationalist\\" leaders including, of course, Jerry Fallwell, Pat Robertson, Tim LaHaye, etc. But she also mentions many others, not quite so well known, but active in Christian Nationalism.A lot of this was not too new to me, as I've read other books about the radical Christian right. But what stood out in my mind was that the author was not trying to lump all Christians into the same category. In fact, on page 8 she states that . . . \\"The Christian nationalist movement does not represent a majority of Americans - it does not even represent a majority of all evangelicals.\\" However, she believes that they are a highly mobilized minority who have made a huge impact on American society all out of proportion to their numbers, and the impact has scary implications for Americans - maybe even for other ChristiansNo book can cover everything. And I reiterate, I appreciated and agreed with a great deal of what I read here. But there are a couple of other issues I think need to be pointed out:1. A lot of what we call the politically \\"conservative\\" had its roots in anti-Communism. It is easy to forget how militant the Communists were in their day. I am two months and ten days younger than George W. Bush Junior - and I remember the cold war all too well. I remember when Hungary was swallowed up into the Soviet system, and when Russian tanks invaded Czechoslovakia. I was a young teenager during the Cuban missile crisis.2. Also, it is easy to forget how equally militant atheism was in those days as well.However, I do not fault Ms. Goldberg for not emphasizing this more. And I certainly do agree with her that those of us in the moderate to centrist positions need to flex our muscles as well, and (learning, ironically, from the Christian right) begin making ourselves and our positions known and become just as persistent as the Christian Nationalists.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I found this book an excellent insight into the power of the Christian Right and its hold on the American public.

This book may not be as objective as some might wish - for example there are many Christians not amongst the far right, or indeed on the left, and omitting them from the book makes the Christian Right seem \\"scarier\\" than perhaps it really is. Having said that, Goldberg does identify some important, and disturbing trends amongst some Christians who appear to be of the mindset that they speak for God and for everyone else as well. Suffice it to say, it is fortunate that Christianity cannot be reduced entirely to this, for there are many Christians who think otherwise. I recommend it to self-critical Christians or secular readers, as well as anyone concerned with reviving our democracy."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"I'm don't understand why amazon.com isn't offering Goldberg's book until May 15--I bought my copy at a Border's bookstore earlier this week after hearing Goldberg interviewed on NPR.My overriding sense of _Kingdom Coming_ is that it makes too much of the phenomenon of \\"Christian nationalism.\\" I don't think there's any doubt that fundamentalist, politically conservative Christians tend to live, as Goldberg asserts, in a parallel universe which rewrites science, the Bible, and history. In that sense, there definitely is a hardcore culture of Christian fundamentalism in this country. But that the culture is likely to gain a great deal of political power, as Goldberg fears, is an open question. In my experience (I write as an ordained, \\"progressive\\" Episcopalian), most Christians in the U.S. are extremely wary of their right-wing brothers and sisters. It's difficult to see how that (very healthy) wariness will diminish.Goldberg looks at the rise of Christian nationalism in six areas: political influence, homophobia, intelligent design debate, faith-based social services, heterosexual mores and AIDS, and Christianity in the courts. In general terms, nothing of what she says is likely to surprise: conservative Christians are trying to go politically mainstream, homosexuals are the new \\"enemy\\" of the Christian right, evolutionism is under attack, sexual \\"promiscuity\\" is punished by sexually-transmitted diseases, chemical addiction is a sin and needs to be treated by faith, and the Christian right's desire for \\"biblically sound\\" courts and judges. But what's eye-opening is the detail with which she fleshes out the generalities, including link after link between the new Christian nationalists and the GOP.In the long run, though, there's something unsettling about the book. As Goldberg herself admits, she's both an urbanite and a secularist, and one can't help wondering if she's so alarmed at conservative Christians at least in part because they tend to be rural and religious--two categories that are pretty foreign and hence come across as especially strange to her. There's very little effort on her part to try to understand why those whom she calls Christian nationalists feel as alienated as they do from mainstream society. Instead, the tendency is to imply that they're nutcases--and dangerous ones at that--and dismiss them. But this \\"othering\\" of people is always dangerous, because it tends to minimize their humanity, and our moral responsibilies to them. So read this one with caution. It's style is very friendly, and the subject matter is intrinsically interesting. But the conclusion may be overblown."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"At one time in the past I would have described myself as extremely liberal. But now I would probably describe myself as holding views about 60% in agreement with liberalism, the other 40% ranging from moderately conservative to very traditional. Despite the fact that I still consider myself a liberal on many issues, I am turned off by sanctimonious political correctness and coldly secularistic perspectives. For this reason, I was all set up to hate Kingdom Coming. I was expecting it to be a left-wing diatribe, an alarmist attack on everything conservative and Christian, replete with all the knee-jerk liberal notions. But to my surprise, I found it to be in large part a sensible assessment of extreme Christian conservatives.Goldberg wisely distinguishes right-wing extremism from moderate mainline Christianity. She knows that the extreme right wing is the minority, and that in fact most of American culture is secularizing. In one chapter I found to be poignant, Goldberg writes a strikingly perceptive description of the typical suburban megachurch. Rather than broadly condemning such churches, she writes with empathy about how megachurches flourish in the exurbs because there is no public space and no other institution of community. Goldberg largely maintains that same objectivity and empathy throughout, which makes her case that much more convincing that the extreme religious right (as opposed to the reasonably conservative ) is a danger.Despite these good points, there were some flaws. For example, while she covered the narrative of the evolution vs. intelligent design public fights, I thought she glossed over the subject of evolution theory with little understanding of its vagaries. I am no by no stretch a supporter of typical conservative movements that attempt to hijack the teaching of what is - whether one likes or not - accepted scientific theory. That being said, it really shouldn't be surprising that people resent being told that human life is merely a chemical accident. Like most progressive writers, Goldberg makes little attempt to understand the universal human drives behind the anti-evolution movement, however irrational the movement may be in its conclusions.Furthermore, while I see Intelligent Design as pseudo-science at best, I perceive that many progressive minded people wear their belief in evolution as a badge meant to distinguish themselves as hip, forward-thinking folks. They often forget the real spirit of science as a never-ending search for truth, which means always being willing to modify your beliefs in the light of new evidence. For many, evolution theory become a matter of trading one dogma for another. I could say much more about this, but I'll stop since evolution was not the main point of this book. I think Ms. Goldberg pretty well bought into the liberal mainstream in this area.I think she got the cart in front of the horse in her reasoning that if Roe vs. Wade were overturned, it could endanger the right to privacy established by Griswold vs. Connecticut. The fact is, the earlier case of Griswold vs. Connecticut deduces that a right to privacy is implied by many of the specific freedoms enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Griswold stands on its own, and is broad and essential in nature. Roe vs. Wade, in contrast, is only one application of the principle established by Griswold. The overturning of Roe vs. Wade would probably not endanger Griswold or the right to privacy. (I don't say this due to any animus toward the legality of abortion as such; personally I support it.)Goldberg (rightly) said much to condemn the actions of Judge Roy Moore, who refused to obey the Supreme Court's order to remove his 10 Commandments display. However, the same liberals incensed at Roy Moore said nothing concerning the actions of Mayor Newsome of San Francisco, who performed many gay marriages even though California law forbids it. By my lights, both these men were guilty of the same thing. Each man ignored the laws he was sworn to uphold, and acted instead on what he personally wished the law to be. You can't have it both ways. If Moore was guilty, then Newsome was guilty. But as liberals often do when discussing this issue, Goldberg conveniently omitted any mention of Mayor Newsome.Ms. Goldberg does a good job in the last chapter suggesting some political maneuvers on the part of left that would help its cause. However, I thought she made the same failure most liberals make in this area by ignoring common horse sense as to what left-wing rhetoric connotes to the ordinary man or woman. Rightly or wrongly, pro-choice is perceived by many as a transparent euphemism for an act that sounds a lot like murdering a baby. Evolution (i.e. macro-evolution) really does sound as though it reduces humanity to a mere mechanism. If liberalism is to succeed, it will have to learn to respect and accommodate the emotions evoked by these issues, and tailor the rhetoric to them.The irony of this book is that in being critical of the right, Ms. Goldberg is in fact documenting how conservatives have shown a far better understanding of this than have liberals."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"In the bulk of this book the author goes around the country to interview and observe members of the religious far right in the US. The specific sub-group of the religious far right are nationalist U.S. far-right Evangelicals who believe that their religion makes the U.S. the center of the world (unlike, for example, many other Christian denominations such as Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy where, people who view God as favoring one country or another over another would be viewed as heretics or untrue Christians).The author presents the results of her many interviews and observations in an attempt to present a picture of that group's views, power, goals, and the threat it poses to the values of the enlightenment and to secularisim in the U.S. Unfortunately she uses, as a basis of her analysis and exposition, almost exclusively her anecdotal obervations, interviews and experiences. Empirical evidence regarding the composition of this group and its views (i.e., what percentage believe that the Bible needs to implemented into legal statute, the percentage of those who believe that the destruction of Israel will proceed the second coming, etc.) is available from many sources (i.e., Pew Institute surveys, public opinion polls conducted by the \\"mainstream\\" press, etc.). yet the author does not make any attempt to utilize such information in her disucssion of the group's size and strenght, its goals, values or its \\"danger\\" to secularism (and to those who do not hold similar views). Hence the weakness of the book. If only Ms. Goldberg would have bothered to include such information in her exposition this book would have been at least a four star, possibly five. Instead its lack of a concrete basis leads to only a three star rating."},{"Title":"Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism","review":"Maybe \\"The Lord\\" and his pathetic product's work in mysterious ways, but this author do not.

She tours the outbacks of Suburbistan to interview members of this strange religious tribe, and report to, I suppose, other secular journalists from the Bronx who haven't met any for themselves.This appears to be the new fad in paranoia. Kevin Phillips, Sam Harris, and even Jimmy Carter just wrote books making roughly the same claim. I'll give Goldberg this: she knows more than Harris, at least, and she's not as grating as Carter. She did get out and talk to people. She even admits she liked most of them. (Qualifying herself by pointing out that she also liked people she met in the wild and crazy Middle East.)The first serious problem with this book is simple: Goldberg doesn't know what she's talking about. I grew up in evangelical churches, and have been involved with Christians belonging to dozens of denominations for the past 45 years. Goldberg tries to catch up in a quick blur of tr avel, but it's like she's traveling through a foreign country. For example, she makes the absurd claim that there were only ten churches with 2,000 or more members in the whole country in 1970. She makes the Presbyterian Church in America sound like some ultra-insidious organization. I grew up in the denomination, and had no idea it was so exciting -- no one even told us to vote Republican!Goldberg's thesis is complete twaddle. I have never met an American Christian who wants to get rid of the Constitution and create a theocracy, and have been in hundreds of evangelical churches, urban and rural, of many denominations. Jesus said \\"render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's.\\" As historians who have studied the issue know, that advice has had a long and fruitful history in Christian thought, helping slowly form Western pluralism. A state religion is the very last thing most of us want.Goldberg is young and ignorant. She seems to think everything good in Western culture began with the Enlightenment, and that the Enlightenment occurred in 1973. Judging by the topics she covers, her real fear is not that Christians will shred the Constitution, but roll back some of the judicial and social \\"advances\\" of the past 30 years. Most of the book is about sex: abortion, gay rights, and promiscuity in general. Here Goldberg is right to think we would like to \\"roll back the clock,\\" or forward, depending on which direction you think we should go. But if she thinks significant numbers of Christians want to reform society beyond Constitutional bounds, or other than through reason and the ballot box, I challenge her to prove it with some real evidence, rather than the series of out-of-context statements and connect-the-dots inuendos that obfuscates this book.As for the reader who warns darkly about the words \\"In God we trust\\" in Mississippi schools, I don't suppose she's looked at American money lately? She talks ominously about the southern judge who displayed the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. Never mind the fact that the state Supreme Court, made up mostly of conservative Christians I believe, ordered it removed. Folks, anyone left or right, Christian or atheist, who wants to select facts like that to prove a particular case and work himself or herself up into a fine lather of paranoia, can do so any day of the week and twice on Sundays. It's called stacking the deck.The second main problem with this book is that Goldberg does not argue issues. Preaching entirely to the choir, she treats serious differences about the meaning of American democracy as if those who disagreed with her were some kind of sociological outlier group from Mars, and never even tries to persuade her readers that she is right on the issues. She explains that the book was born in a conversation with her agent, and it shows.I think Christianity helped create Western freedoms, and that liberty is part of God's modus operandi. I have stood in front of hundreds of conservative Christians and said the same, and no one has stoned me yet. Goldberg can disagree if she likes; it's a free country, and God willing will remain so. But she needs to get at least a minimal grasp of Christian thought before she can begin to do so intelligently.I guess we can expect more books on the subject. If any other secularists have similar ambitions, please do your homework! First, immerse yourself in the primary documents, the New Testament. (Which Goldberg may or may not have heard of.) Then read the Church Fathers -- Augustine in particular, and Justin Martyr. Do some Pascal, and John Locke, maybe John of Paris Then read Rodney Stark's four volume set on the influence of Christianity, Chesterton and Lewis, sure, Francis Schaeffer, and magazines like First Things and Books and Culture. If you're going to say something about \\"faith,\\" (Harris made a total fool of himself on this issue), please read my anthology on faith and reason at christthetao.com.Then go ask ordinary Christians. \\"Do you want to get rid of the Constitution?\\" \\"Do you think America should be a theocracy?\\" \\"Have you ever heard of Rushdooney?\\" \\"Do you secretly admire the Ayatollah Khomeini?\\" Prepare for some interesting facial expressions.

So I found this on the publisher's (AltaMira Press) website:Religions-whatever else they may be-are configurations of cultural information reproduced across space and time. Beginning with this seemingly obvious fact of religious transmission, Harvey Whitehouse goes on to construct a testable theory of how religions are created, passed on, and changed. At the center of his theory are two divergent 'modes of religiosity:' the imagistic and the doctrinal. Drawing from recent advances in cognitive science, Whitehouse's theory shows how religions tend to coalesce around one of these two poles depending on how religious behaviors are remembered. In the 'imagistic mode,' rituals have a lasting impact on people's minds haunting not only our memories but influencing the way we ruminate on religious topics. These psychological features are linked to the scale and structure of religious communities, fostering small, exclusive, and ideologically heterogeneous ritual groupings or factions. In the doctrinal mode, on the other hand, religious knowledge is primarily spread through intensive and repetitive teaching; religious communities are contrastingly large, inclusive, and centrally regulated. While these tendencies have long been recognized in the history of the study of religion, the modes of religiosity theory is unique in that it explains why these tendencies exist. More importantly, Whitehouse does not give the final word, but invites us to join a series of collaborative networks among anthropologists, historians, archaeologists, and psychologists, currently trying to falsify, confirm, or refine the theory. Are you tired of the flood of descriptions and interpretations of religions which offer no clear strategy for evaluation, comparison, and testing? Modes of Religiosity can provide you with a new way to think when you think about religion.About The AuthorHarvey Whitehouse is Professor of Anthropology and Director of Postgraduate Studies in the Faculty of Humanities at Queen's University Belfast. He is co-editor, with Luther H. Martin, of the AltaMira 'Cognitive Science of Religion Series'. His previous books include Inside the Cult: Religious Innovation and Transmission in Papua New Guinea (1995, OUP), Arguments and Icons: Divergent Modes of Religiosity, (2000, OUP), and The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology versus Ethnography (2001 Berg)."},{"Title":"The Landlord's Handbook: A Complete Guide to Managing Small Residential Properties","review":"This book taught me how to handle difficult tenants and prepare myself when new tenants move in.

They clearly have different agendas, but what transpires between them surprises them both.

I enjoy the history lesson about the church and the past that connect, it was smoothly lay out that you stay there to see what new fact would be reveal to the reader.

Also, each key entry is bolded in the margin for easy searching."},{"Title":"Preparing for Adolescence : Caution Changes Ahead (Junior High Builders Ser.)","review":"I am an adult woman in my early 30s, and a teacher. I have very strong feelings about the impact this book had on my own development, as it was my first (and main) intro to sexuality as a 6th grader in 1992, provided by well-meaning Christian parents.To be fair, I am reviewing the 1992 edition of \\"Preparing for Adolescence: Caution Changes Ahead,\\" published by Tyndale House, not the recent updated editions.That said, this book was my introduction to my sexuality, and as a high-achieving Christian child with high levels of anxiety in other areas of my young life, this book taught me to fear and dread something that I knew nothing about: The sex act, and by extension, relationships and my own body.I didn't know anything about dating, relationships, etc., and this book taught me little or nothing about that, but it taught me that whatever sex was, it was something with Irrevocable Damaging Consequences that would inevitably lead to:a. Loss of self-esteem forever, especially as a womanb. Loss of acceptability in God's eyes (you'd be forgiven, but always damaged)c. Danger of STDs and death, regardless of safer sex practices or non-penetrative acts (which were not discussed)d. The author made the ridiculous statement that when a romantic/sexual relationship ends, the person often becomes cold and callous as a person, or something to that effect. I was terrified of such a personality change.Several statements made in this book, with which I disagree to the strongest possible degree:-\\"If you do get AIDS, you have received a death sentence.\\" (Basically true in 1992, but the term \\"death sentence\\" implies a judgment and a punishment of execution, rather than as a tragic consequence of a hasty action).--\\"There is no safe sex, just as there is no safe sin.\\" Wow. The judgment and terror promoted by this statement need no elaboration.However, I believed it as a devout sixth grader, and was terrified of my own desires, being \\"tricked\\" by my own body, etc.Also, teen feelings of \\"love\\" were described as \\"infatuation,\\" which is often true, but not always. Love was supposed to be sacrificial, not pleasurable, is the idea that I learned. Pleasure was supposedly selfish. Even love was not to be trusted. It too was a trick! Whenever I felt like I might like somebody, I often questioned it as not being real, since I wouldn't sacrifice myself for them (!)--(On the risks of sex): \\"Girls are the bigger losers.\\" (Obviously true, since girls have the risk of pregnancy and social stigma. Ironically, Dr. D helps to maintain said social stigma by saying that guys brag, and that women bear all the pain and shame. He makes it seem like this is not just the common outcome in school, but the *natural consequence* for females, which will not change. He doesn't mention resiliency or the ability to recover from having one's heart broken.)--The dismissive statement that \\"Homosexuality...reflects deep problems, but it doesn't happen very often and it isn't likely to happen to you.\\" (Intended to reassure straight teens). I am not gay, but I find this statement ridiculous. What about the teens reading the book who genuinely are gay, or do have same-sex attractions?-The idea that God has, for our own good, put the \\"no-sex-before-marriage\\" rule into place (which incidentally does not actually exist as such in the Bible) for our own protection. It doesn't even matter if the couple is in a committed relationship, or even if it is an *adult couple*, not a teen couple. It doesn't count. It will end, there will be pain, etc.As Dr. D is a well-meaning father, I can see that he understandably wants to protect young teens from the consequences of hasty decisions with lifelong consequences. It's true. Teen sex is almost always a bad idea, especially with no protective measures such as birth control and barriers. I agree that teens ideally should delay intercourse until they are able to understand the consequences and take full responsibility for all the risks, hopefully at least until after age 18. However, not all teens will take his advice to wait til marriage. (Marriage seems like *for-ev-er* when you are 13!)He gives them no options for harm reduction, and implies that adult relationships (outside of marriage) are equally harmful.To be fair, the book makes good points about the transitory and cyclical nature of teen emotions, and it was definitely comforting to hear that emotions are cyclical, tending to go \\"from high to low to high to low.\\" In other words, terror or depression would not last forever. Dr. D. was also remarkably and surprisingly realistic and even-handed about masturbation's harmlessness. Also, Dr. D. definitely understands the pain of being isolated or ridiculed by peers. I definitely appreciated his realistic descriptions of peer pressure and self-esteem. But another book could do just as well on these fronts. Pass on this one. If you are looking for a Christian book on sexuality, please find a more even-handed, realistic, and comprehensive intro for your child.Thank you for reading."},{"Title":"Total Gundam Wing","review":"Any person who knows anything about Gundam Wing should read this book for comedy purposes. It was as if the author of this 'informative' book about the ten Gundam Series (mainly GW) was hit in the head with a 2x4, losing half of the knowledge they had and then making up the rest. The episode guide was wrong 44% of the time, and the character reviews were outrageous. They were biased (but then again, so am I) on their opinions about almost everything. One of the most awful mistakes made was when they confused Sally Po with Lucrezia Noin. How can you mistake Sally with Noin?!?!?!?!?! For one thing, Noin has purple hair and looks like a fruit bat while Sally has dark-blondish hair she twists. Apparently they did not proofread their work before publishing it, several grammatical, spelling and sentence structure errors were made. Sometimes they contradicted themselves, saying they liked a character but then again, the character was extremely annoying and stupid. What???. Also, they sometimes screwed up the history and family relations of different characters, for example: Treize Khushrenada. Family:Dorothy Catalonia (niece), Duke Dermail (brother). Stop me if I'm wrong, wasn't Duke Dermail Dorothy's GRANDFATHER, not her FATHER. Another mistake was when they suggested that Milliardo Peacecraft had been taken in and raised by Treize Khushrenada, who is only 5 years older. Inside were some 3-d goggles and pictures of Wing mecha, and that was something I thought I might enjoy, but not at the price. Go ahead, buy this book if stupid people make you feel superior, but whatever you do, DON'T buy it as a reference to the series."},{"Title":"Total Gundam Wing","review":"lol, okay, this is funny. This book was so inaccurate most of the time I wanted to cry. I've been to really bad fan sites that had better and more acurate information than this thing. Okay, so I'll admit, not everyone learns everything known about all the characters like I do, but still, I would think you would care if your information was right or not. By calling this the &quot;Unofficial Total Gundam Wing&quot; book they are doing a good thing. I'd also say half the information given is unofficial, I think they made most of it up if ya ask me. I haven't gotten around to seeing all of the other seires yet, so I do use this book very loosley as a refernce for the U.C. series, but as far as Wing goes, buy something else. Sure, the pictures are nice, except that one of Sally that says she's Noin... Though for that price, you could have a Gundam Wing graphic novel, or an action figure. Go with the action figures and graphic novels over this thing. If you want to spend your money on something that would make any true Wing fan laugh, this is a great buy! I would NOT buy this as a refernce though. Sorry to sound rude, but those people who say this book was very imformative, must be new Wing fans, and I fell sorry for them, 'cause they got a LOT of wrong info.

They have lots of typos, incorrect spelling of names & relationships. I think Dorothy is a distant cousin of some sort to Treize & if Dermail was Treize's brother well Dermail's parents must have been very fertile geriatrics to have a son old enough to be Dorothy's grandfather & also be the parents of a 20 to 23 year old man [I forget if Treize was 20, 21 or 23 in the series, but even the older characters were usually in their late teens]. I found Wufei's bio to be very incorrect & the other pilots data wasn't always correct either. If you want accurate Gundam Wing info buy something else or surf fan sites, the fan sites are usually obsessively correct if at all possible. It's a very good thing that they labelled this as an Unofficial GW book, because if this was an official book they could probably be repremanded for falsehoods or something. If you don't expect to much get it, otherwise save your money & get something else on GW instead, the GW: Tech Manual isn't too bad although that has a few goofs too, doesn't anyone know how to correctly spell Tsubarov's name for heaven's sake?!?!"},{"Title":"Total Gundam Wing","review":"I am a big fan of gundam and a really big fan of Kiyuki Tomino also known as Yoshiyuki Tomino.

Fortunately that series is no longer operative, but even more fortunate, Dr. Ferguson is.As bad as Communicator's was, Dr. Ogilvie should be commended for trying to improve it. Now to the book itself. As the other reviewer already noted, those who approach Daniel from a prophetic viewpoint miss the forest for the trees. Ferguson does not crucify scholarship at the expense of application. He provides deep truths with poignant illustrations (many of them with gripping Scottish overtones). Underlying Dr, Ferguson's interpretation of Daniel is a rock-hard foundation of God's Sovereignty. While focusing primarily upon the prayer lives of the heroes, Ferguson does justice to the prophetic sections when they arrive. He provides convincing exposition from a Reformed eschatological background. He also argues convincingly for an early date of Daniel.I recommend this commentary for pastor's and the curious layperson. In fact, this is one of the top non-technical commentaries on the book."},{"Title":"Daniel (Mastering the Old Testament)","review":"There are two ways one can approach the Book of Daniel. One can ignore the stories and focus on the prophecies in chapters 2 and 7-12, looking for explanations in history. This jigsaw puzzle approach to the Book of Daniel does not help one to live a better life. But, I must confess, that that was the approach I was looking for when I bought the book. I got so much more out of it as I studied Daniel's uncompromising life of prayer. Dr. Ferguson does not ignore history nor fail to indicate what events the prophecies refer to when this is clear, but much more important than that is the lesson that God is sovereign over history. He is in control. We can either, like Daniel, seek after God's in obedience or, like the kings of Babylon, go against His plan in a rebellion that is doomed to fail."},{"Title":"Daniel (Mastering the Old Testament)","review":"I'm not familiar with Ferguson, but this exposition of Daniel is a fitting addition to The Preacher's Commentary series. Daniel is one of the most difficult books to explain in the entire Bible, and Ferguson does a better job than most of making sense of it without sacrificing scholarship. Very useful for the Bible teacher or pastor seeking to make Daniel real for a congregation or classroom."},{"Title":"Daniel (Mastering the Old Testament)","review":"This is an excellent commentary on the Book of Daniel. It's not a &#34;critical&#34; commentary, so it's not full of information about etymology, syntax and dramatic nuances in the text. It's what's called a &#34;popular&#34; commentary, which deals more with practical application. As popular commentaries go, this one is superb. Sinclair Ferguson is a brilliant preacher, and it shows through in this offering. I am a senior pastor, and I could literally preach the words of this book straight into my sermon notes. I'm finishing up a series of sermons in the book of Daniel, and this is the only commentary that gave me any real help. I can only hope that the other offerings in this series are as good as Ferguson's, but that's a lofty hope."},{"Title":"Daniel (Mastering the Old Testament)","review":"Best commentary on Daniel I have ever read.

This is always a great idea when reading translated poetry, and happily it's done here. Katchadourian is a very fine translator as far as I can judge, but it's still nice to see the original and \\"check\\" your own translation against hers. There is a time or two I interpret something differently!Edith Sodergran was a very talented, singular poet in her own time, and the power and beauty of her poetry hasn't faded. That is most likely because she was ahead of her time in both the form and content of her poetry, and because, like all great poets, the particular truths of her life echo and illuminate human existence, period, and she writes with a great sensitivity to language. This volume contains selections from each of her books, and although how Sodergran wrote about things changed as she experienced life and searched for peace and truth through various philosophical/religious traditions, there always remain her underlying themes: a reverence for nature, a respect for her particular experience as a woman, and a concern for the meaning of various forms of suffering--war, poverty, hunger, disillusionment, illness, loss, and loneliness make up the short list! In her own time, Sodergran's poetry was, for mainstream Finland, a shock, a scandal, or a joke. Nowadays, it isn't--or at least is less so. I hope this fine translation continues to widens her appreciation in areas outside of Scandinavia. I would recommend this book to fans of what one might call feminist poetry."},{"Title":"Love & Solitude: Selected Poems, 1916-1923 (English and Swedish Edition)","review":"The marvelous poetry of Edith Sodergran is unfortunately not well known outside of Scandinavia.

His evil Uncle Miraz has recently decided his new-born son should become King of Narnia when Miraz dies, and therefore Caspian's life expectancy drops about ninety-nine percent. So, with the help of his half-dwarf tutor, Caspian escapes from certain death at Miraz's castle and goes to the ancient woods of Narnia to try to awaken the Old Creatures and the Talking Beasts. Having suceeded, he prepares for war against Miraz, and then uses an ancient horn to summon help in the form of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy.Truely monumental, certainly Narnia is the best children's fantasy ever.

So you have a lot of water nymphs, tree spirits, fauns, satyrs, and dryads about. Somehow it's all supposed to work in an allegorical Christian context. I think it does, but I'm in my 40s. My son needed relief, so I skipped parts and stopped to explain others. It still held his attention, because even at its most allegorical, Lewis's writing is captivating even for small children.

All the people they know from then are died but Aslan he can never die because he is one of the magical creature leafed in Narnia.

He has also tried to get rid of all of the talking beasts and dwarves but some are still left. King Miraz is now trying to kill Caspian the 10th who believes in the talking beasts and the old kings and queens of Narnia. Prince Caspian finds out that King Miraz is trying to kill him and flees into the woods where he finds some of the remaining talking beasts of Narnia. Prince Caspian knows these animals are against king Miraz so he helps them build an army of old Narnian beasts to fight off King Miraz and regain Caspian's throne.Before the battle Caspian thinks King Miraz's forces are too strong so Caspian blows a magic horn that's suppose to bring back the old kings and queens of Narnia.

Even worse, men and talking animals alike doubt the ancient tales about Aslan, the mighty lion from Over-the-Sea, who sacrificed hismelf on the Stone Table to save those whom he loved. Yet did not die.Beneath the surface plot and childlike banter among siblings, defenders and scoundrels, SCL has included many references to Christianity--without mentioning God or Jesus.

This particular production is weakened by the changing of the actors from the &quot;Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&quot; Perhaps the lapse of time meant they had to get a new Peter and Edmund (Lucy sounds the same), but the problem is that Peter sounds significantly younger than the actor playing Prince Caspian, and this ruptures the suspension of disbelief, as in the book, Peter is supposed to come off as the older king, patron to the younger Caspian. But while Caspian has a deep and resonant voice, &quot;older&quot; Peter is still a squeaky voiced kid (with a much higher pitch than Peter in TLTWATW). He never manages to sound sufficiently grand. It's really too bad because the rest of the show is wonderful.BTW the same problem with the change of actors dogs the subsequent BBC production of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,&quot; where Edmund, supposedly Capsian's age, sounds about five years younger.

Lewis's classic novel, the sequel to his even more classic \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.\\" While it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, Lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.When his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young Prince Caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz -- and in the hands of Narnia's secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it's no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. Just take a look at successful, unique authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Garth Nix to get an example of how Lewis' stories have influenced the entire genre.If you don't like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of \\"Prince Caspian,\\" especially the second half. While Lewis's beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis's best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it's a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling. But this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. The scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.But Lewis' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where Aslan wanders around fixing life for Narnian subjects. Fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?Peter seems a bit more jaded than before and Edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don't get enough to do this time around. But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn't believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia. Definitely give it a read before you see the movie."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Prince Caspian is the second published installment of the Chronicles of Narnia series. It is a little darker than The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe but still definitely kid friendly. As I stated in my review of The Lion... Christian themes are woven throughout the book; however, I believe you can still thoroughly enjoy the book even if you are not a Christian.Prince Caspian picks up one year in earth time which is approximately 1,300 years in Narnia, after the great battle and victory portrayed at the end of the first book. This time Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are summoned back to Narnia to help Prince Caspian, the rightful king to take his place. Aslan, which from a Christian theme, is portrayed as Jesus Christ does not play as visible of a role in this book as he does in the first. He finally makes a formal appearance about two thirds into the bookC.S. Lewis' writing style lends itself to a quick and pleasurable read that can be enjoyed by young and old alike and I would highly recommend the first two books in the Narnia series and plan to continue to read through the rest."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"The Cronicles of Narnia:Prince CaspianBy C.S. Lewis5/15/2008Even though this novel was written in 1951, the books have been big among many children and adults over the years. The motion picture based on the novel, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, has made these classical novels popular once again. Prince Caspian is based on the four children's return to Narnia. Even though it has only been one year in Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy's world, thousands of years have passed in Narnia. Author C.S. Lewis puts an English twist on words and phrases, giving the book a unique language of its own.This book is full of exciting twists and turns as the reader is given a chance to relive the Nanian experience in a new and exciting time for Narnia. The children arrive at their old castle, which is in ruins, and do not know what magic pulled them back to the other world. Soon they meet a dwarf who tells the kids what has happened in Narnia since their last departure. The author then takes the reader into another part of the book regarding Prince Caspian and his life in Narnia, a boy who lost his parents and resides in a castle with his uncle and aunt. As a boy who is forbidden to ever hear of the old Narnia, about a time of piece and the talking animals and different kinds of nature beings.The author confuses the reader a bit by jumping to another character, which is unknown to the readers. As the dwarf is telling the story, the author goes on with the story for a good part of the novel, that the reader looses track that it is a story within the novel. The reader is left wondering for many pages what this story has to do with the four children.The wording is a little outdated since the book was written in 1951, but the language also interests the reader. The length of the book is appropriate. This is not just a book for children, and adults, but also for the family to read together. The author is intent to keep the reader guessing what will come next. As Prince Caspian escapes from his evil uncle, Caspian finds that the old secretes of Narnia are still true, beasts and people of the old times still exist. On the far side of the land the children try and make their way through a large over grown forest and tough waters to help Prince Caspian and the land they have grown to love.The author paints an imaginative picture that helps the reader to visualize the land of Narnia. It is hard at times to keep focus to the story. The description of the old language is also hard to follow in some parts, but the author steps out of story mode and explains what he means by his wording choice. Thus the author is connecting personally with his readers.The ending is amazing, yet with a twist no one will ever expect in regards to the future of Narnia and Susan and Peter. This is a great story for all and ideal for parents to read to their kids. Even this book is older it is an unforgettable classic. I can't wait to see how close the book is related to the motion picture. Where will C.S. Lewis take us next?"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"In anticipation of the soon to be released movie version, I decided to familiarize myself with the plot by reading the book. Though this may not be as strong of a story as \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", it still possesses the charm of the first book in the series.Since Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy left Narnia, the world changed rapidly. Although only a year has passed in their world, time moves much more quickly in Narnia. Narnia has since fallen under the tyrrany of King Miraz, causing the talking creatures to virtually vanish. With King Miraz's plan to dispose of the heir to the thone Prince Caspian, the future of Narnia is darkening. But when the same horn that once summonded Aslan recalls the Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve, Prince Caspian has allies in his claim to the throne.While this may not be as strong of a book as the first book in the series, it may be unfair to hold the book to such a high standard. The book is a quick read and easily engages the reader. The Chronicles of Narnia may be the high water mark of C.S. Lewis's writing career.

Mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when I was young, and I was interested to see how they held up as adults. I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.As the first real sequel to \\"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", this manages to draw out the story and history of Narnia so that Lewis' creation reaches its full potential. The character of Caspian is readable although a little stiff at times, and the dialogue does falter occasionally where elsewhere in the books it is very smooth.

And yet the world of magical characters and Lewis's own wit and sprinkling of profound Christian principles carry the story and make it an enjoyable read in spite of its flaws.A prominent theme in Prince Caspian is the virtue of faith and belief; some of the children experience degrees of doubt in Aslan, and many of the Narnians have lost faith in him altogether.

I enjoyed reading about the Pevensie children rediscover Narnia. About 1,000 years have passed since they ruled Narnia, so Narnia looks a but different. I loved how Aslan revealed himself to the children one by one showing that the others should just believe. Narnia is such a magical world that I think anyone can enjoy reading about. I know I will reread these books in the future, and when I have kids I will read this lovely series to them as well."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"this book is a classic for all children hungry for an adventure.

A young king is on the run from his uncle who seeks to usurp the throne and the four children, who are kings and queens of Narnia themselves must battle a new foe and restore Old Narnia. The Christian allegory is quite strong in this book as it is with others. I found it a joy myself to return to Narnia after some time away. The new characters are quite fun. This story is better than the book previous (A Horse and His Boy) with good action and progresses the history of Narnia. I enjoyed this one enough to jump straight into the next one, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. I was reading the Kindle version and was very pleased to see that the illustrations were included and of good quality. Recommended."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"As usual, what can I say about the endless stream of masterpieces from the mind and soul of this great writer? This book begins in the far future of Narnian time and the near future of earth time as the magic horn is blown and the children are drawn to the bright Narnian multiverse from a grey English train station.What is notable about this second book in the series is the sparse use of story line to convey multiple meanings. The Narnia adventures have withstood the test of time because they relate to multiple levels of thought and spirit life. While in the train from Mannheim, Germany, I was reading this book when a small German child came silently up to me and stood by my shoulder transfixed by the book until his parents had to disembark at the next stop. Was this the Holy Spirit or did he just want to read a good children's story?This book is notable as an absorbing story and a biblical allegory when Lucy discovers the Lion and the group debates with her while travelling what seems to be the safest course only to find the way blocked and impractical. The Wilderness of Sin causes each character to define his varying degrees of belief and the role that thought verses belief plays in each life. The extreme life example is the dwarf who believes that even if the Lion existed he was simply a danger; to Sue who believes in the Lion but uses her \\"common sense\\" to allow the path of sin to detour the group and overcome faith. Study carefully the chapter titled WHAT LUCY SAW.The animals of Old Narnia are hard pressed tactically; they must decide whether to follow the path of faith in Aslan's return or adopt the path of realpolitik...amoral power politics as dominated mankind during WW2. A tentative alliance is formed with a werewolf and a witch and possibly the old queen. Narnia is in grave danger which Peter and the returning children thwart in the last minute. This is the Wilderness of Sin which modern nation states often find themselves in...read the chapter SORCERY AND SUDDEN VENGEANCE.Read this book slowly with the view that it is more than a children's tale. I contemplated this timeless tale while passing a grey German train station..."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This is yet another top notch audio production. All the Narnia books have been converted to audio with great music and voice actors, and this one is no different - Highly recommended.The story itself makes one laugh at the movie that came out and how different is was, but one can also understand that a lot of what happens in Prince Caspian could be removed as being labeled \\"filler\\". Nevertheless this is an enjoyable story and is the only story that contains all the four children as a main focus from the original \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\". This is the second time they enter Narnia and they have been called back by Prince Caspian using Queen Susan's horn which she was carrying and lost at the end of \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.\\"Prince Caspian's lives in a world where humans have taken over Narnia and the talking animals and beasts are now just legend, and legend that is not encouraged throughout this new realm. Prince Caspian is the rightful Heir, but his uncle is wielding the throne after Caspian's father's death. And once he has a son, Caspian is doomed and must flee, and he flees to find the old Narnians and take back Narnia for the old Narnians. This story tells of that and how the old Narnians battle to win back Narnia.It's a good story, not one of my favorites in the Narnia series, but still good nevertheless."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"When the Pevensie children find themselves in Narnia for the second time, everything they once knew has changed. 1,300 years will do that. A dwarf named Trumpkin has been sent to find them and fills them in on everything they have missed. It seems that the Telmarines have taken over and their leader, King Miraz, has made every effort to snuff out the memory of Old Narnia.The king's nephew Caspian, however, finds the old stories fascinating. Threatened by the birth of his uncle's son, Caspian flees into the woods. The remnants of the Old Narnians realize that the time has come to take back Aslan's country from the usurpers. Caspian blows the magic horn, calling the former kings and queens to his aid.C.S. Lewis spins a great story, but the plot is a bit complex for modern children. While Peter and Edmund are busy helping Prince Caspian fight his battles, Aslan and the girls are out romping about the countryside, regenerating joy. River gods, anthropomorphic trees and drunken Greek deities all join in the fun. It's strange behavior for a Lion, but somehow it makes sense in this context.The explanation, which comes at the end, is C.S. Lewis at his best. It seems that Lewis had been reading up on the voyage of the Bounty. In much the same manner as Fletcher Christian and John Adams, the Telmarines ended up on an island and married the local women. When they found a cave, they had a surprise in store for them. Luckily, Aslan gives them the choice to remain in Narnia as equals with the talking animals or to return to their island. He doesn't give the Pevensie children that choice, however: they are sent back to school in England.This is not my favorite Narnia story, but it does have its moments. Four stars."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"My journey through Narnia continued with this second novel in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed Prince Caspian and found it to be an even better book than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Part of that may stem from the fact that this story had less to do with discovering Narnia and more about the magic and events taking place there. Another wonderful book and I look forward to reading the next when I come to it."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I saw the movie first, and I believe that was a mistake. Because once I sat down to read this book, I was expecting the movie to follow the book. I was, of course, wrong.To read this book, I believe you got to have somewhat of an open mind and be imaginative. The Kings and Queens come back, and they come back many years later. The last time they left Narnia, they were much older...like young adults, and they come back in this book as children again. Narnia has changed and has changed for the worse. But the children, Prince Caspian, and the other Narnians fight to set things right.Aslan is not throughout the book, but shows up just in time. But I must admit that I was sad to read that Peter and Susan could not come back because they were too old, and the same time, I completely understood why.Overall, this was an excellent read, and C.S. Lewis writing is such a treasure. But this one was the book I liked the least out of all the books in the series. I guess the movie did ruin it for me.Thanks."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This, the second book written in the Chronicles of Narnia, is C. S. Lewis attempt to allegorize the reformation of Christianity, and he pulls it of splendidly. Narnia has been over run by the Telmarines, who do not believe in magic, talking animals, dryads, Aslan, etc. Prince Caspian, the son of King Miraz, has heard tales of the old Narnia growing up, and believes that those things really exist. The rest of the tale describes how the old Narnia is reawakened and defeats the reigning conquerers. This is a picture of how distorted beliefs enter the Church, and someone will come along (like Caspian), realize the problem, and set to reforming Christianity.Now, the actual book is not nearly so boring as the way I described it. All of what I described is entwined in a magical tale of magic, glory, and believable yet extraordinary people and animals. To the best of my knowledge, only C. S. Lewis is able to talk of such a subject and make it so interesting and fascinating, hiding the real subject deep in a labarynth of powerful allegory. It is very possible that you should miss the whole allegorical meaning if you are not looking for it, so great a job he has done of hiding it, yet it is there, waiting to be uncovered if we look deep enough below the magical surface."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Prince Caspian is the fourth book in the series of the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This story is about Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, who were Kings and Queens in Narnia. They were called back from our world to Narnia from a magical horn that Susan had left in Narnia before. They were called back to Narnia help to help Prince Caspian. Caspian's uncle, King Miraz, had killed Caspian's fater and took the throne of Narnia. Caspian found his life in danger and ran to Old Narnia, where dwarfs, fauns, and Talking Beasts are. Because of the need, Caspian used Susan's horn to call Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy back to Narnia. They were able to expel the Telmarines with the help of Aslan the Lion. I liked this book a lot, but I thought that the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was more interesting and a better read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read shorter novels, and like books that are exciting, but dull at times."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"After a work of such renown as the Lion, the Witch and theWardrobe, perhaps it is just too much for the next in the series tocompare. Of all the Chronicles, I found this to be the least engaging. I found it a small let-down to find myself in Narnia again so far in time from the Pevensies' reigns as Kings and Queens. The plot did not move me along as well as any of the other books in the Chronicles.This is the last book in the Chronicles in which all four of the children are back, and in that way, it provides for a nostalgic return to the Narnia of The Lion... The most interesting aspect was of how the conquering people had come to fear the trees and magic of the land, illustrating how conquerers and empires often despise and oppress what makes a people individual.Bottom Line: This one isn't bad enough to skip over, but it's a bit of a let down after the stellar first volume."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Prince Caspian is the second book in the chronicles. C.S. Does a good job preserving the foundation from The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, while building another creative story. I think the best part of the book is this one particular sword fight scene. As far as the rest of the story is concerned I think it was well written. If you read the reviews about The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe you will see that I wrote about the contrast between that first story and the Bible. This book was not quite as simple the only thing I found was the charactoristics of the Lion and their simalaritis to that of Christ, other then that this story is an imaginitive read for readers young and old.

When Caspian blew the horn, time on earth stopped for the kings (Peter and Edmund) and queens (Susan and Lucy) of Narnia. They opened their eyes to a very strange place, but knew somehow that it had something to do with Narnia, and therefore were not scared.The common theme in this book seems to be that the majority of the folk and creatures only believe what they see, and many common myths (like ghosts) that were created, passed down, and re-created. Although the children believed in the magical world of Narnia, and Aslan as well, the older children had doubts. What Lucy saw, they did not, so they kept pushing forward, instead of following the lead that Aslan gave to Lucy early on in their adventure to help Prince Caspian. However, after the adventure through the wardrobe, Edmund was more inclined to believe Lucy. And so most of the other creatures of Narnia also had their doubts. For instance, I believe Tumpkin (a hedgehog) said he believed either Aslan or the White Witch (whoever would help them defeat Miraz, and help Prince Caspian in battle.Read the book to enjoy the rest of this adventure.

WanPeriod: 6There once where 4 children Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy that where from London staying at their professor's house. It was time for school again so they went to the train station. They got sucked in into Narnia A magical place somewhere unknown. They landed on Cair Paravel and where on an island of remains. They where the kings and queens of Narnia. The king has hired a new teacher for Prince Caspian and taught him of the old Narnia which was forbidden because they wanted no one to know that animals and creatures ruled Narnia before. He was awakened and heard of him being killed. He left in search of the creatures. He found them and joined forces. The children where going to find the prince and they reached shore. Aslan showed them the way. They fought and Caspian the new king was crowned.I liked the book because of the detail and hard work of trying to imagine this place. \\"Peter's not using his shield properly.\\" This came from page 191 where Peter was fighting King Miraz. This book made me see the whole thing because of a picture and the words match the picture.This book is clearly awarded with many reader's thoughts. \\"Reepisheep became aware of his loss.\\" This quote comes from a mouse that lost its tail. It was cut off. The author keeps u guessing what's going to come next. This book has changed my reading and others too.My favorite part of the book is the part where Aslan calls the children to follow him. It was the most scenic part and very fast paced. It was thrilling to see the giant lion. This is still my favorite because Aslan fought. This book has really changed me."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I don't know why, but my daughter didn't care as much for this book as for the other tales of Narnia. During one particularly intense passage she almost stopped reading it. However, my nephew and other guys I talked to found this to be their favorite book of the series. This action packed book certainly has a lot of adventure, swordplay, and suspense.This book also has more explicit Christian themes than some of the other tales from the Narnia series. After centuries of absence the land of Narnia forgets Aslan and disbelieves the old legends. In this book Aslan returns and sets things straight. The themes in this work are so strong that many might forget the quality of the work and judge it merely on their personal like or dislike of Christianity.This book presents an interesting perspective. In many tales of magic a character summons up a being or person from another time and place. This story is told from the perspective of the beings who were summoned up! Lewis' personal title for the book was something like \\"Drawn Back to Narnia\\", but this title was rejected.P.S. Don't jump ahead to the conclusion, but the last page sets up a change and new possible theme that will need to be fleshed out in a later book."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Caspian has an uncle named Miraz.

They find themselves on an island that has been overgrown. Exploring further, they discover the remains of their old castle. They're back in Narnia years ahead of when they last left. When a dwarf appears, he begins to tell them the tale of the true king and the battle he is having in claiming his crown. Will the children be able to help? And will Aslan appear to help as well?I first read these books in third grade, and I struggle to get through this story. Today as an adult, I find it to still be my least favorite of the series. Too much of the book is spent giving background. The story picks up in the second half, but it's not quite enough to redeem the first. Some of my original disappointment probably also comes from realizing that this was not the same Narnia we left. With the centuries that have passed between books, the four children and Aslan are the only returning characters. Still, it's good to see them again, and a trip to Narnia is always worth it.While not a bad read, don't judge the entire series by this book. It is an important background to the next two books, so it is worth a read even if it's not quite as fun as the first in the series."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Beware! The evil, foul-minded people who are publishing these works (The Chronicles of Narnia) have profaned the fantastic writing of C.S. Lewis by rearranging the order of the seven books so as to confuse the reader and steal away some of the magic and wonder by imposing it in a chronological order rather than the artistic one in which it was rendered. Is the horrible time witch at play again or it could be that rascal Screwtape at work? I shake my head sadly at the poor folk who will read these books in the wrong order, actually thinking that perhaps the author meant for them to read Volume Six first. Yes, of course these books come highly recommended but I think it is most important to stress that they should be read in the proper order, which is as follows: 1. The Lion, The Witch &amp; The Wardrobe 2. Prince Caspian 3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 4. The Silver Chair 5. The Horse and His Boy 6. The Magician's Nephew 7. The Last Battle Please, do yourself a favor, if you are reading these books for the first time, read them in the right order."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Lewis does a good job when he writes the passage where the children don't all see the lion the same time, only the youngest does and then the next youngest... and that the older children sometimes don't believe the younger for petty reasons. But, at many other times, the general reader seems to suffer because Lewis is writing for children, and his analogies often suffer from oversimplification.One of Lewis's early failings is that he tries to make too much hay out of his talking animal analogy. All religions have their miracles, and some are said to have happened relatively recently. This does not mean that all reports of miracles are true, or that everything in the bible without exception was meant to be taken literally.But there are other flaws. Prominently, at the end of this book, Lewis, falls prey to the sloppy writing habits concomittant to most serials. Out of seemingly nowhere, he adds a long list of nameless and faceless, one-dimensional characters and quickly condemns them. What he doesn't do is write anything about them that would make us believe that they have souls. Among them, a bunch of mischevious schoolboys suddenly turn into swines, and Lewis is the Circe who transforms them. There's no charity here: he is condemning children, in mass, without us even meeting them.This is not the Christian spirit, and the oversimplification present in his analogy is often galling."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Prince Caspian is a part of the series of Narnia, a magical land visited only by a special few. While it isn't necessary to read any of the other books before this one, I highly recommend reading at least The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe. For those not familiar with the story, Narnia is a world that the Pevensie children have stumbled into, and with the help of Aslan (a mighty lion), became Kings and Queens of the land before eventually returning to their own home and time.In this book, the children have returned after Prince Caspian has blown Susan's enchanted horn. Their return is just in time; Caspian's uncle, who has taken over the throne, is aiming to kill Caspian and so destroy the last true heir of Narnia. Under his Uncle's rule, the original beings of Narnia (talking animals, mythical creatures, etc.) have been outcast and live in fear. Caspian and the Pevensie's will need to do all that they can to restore everything to its rightful balance, and take his Uncle off of the throne.The characters are not nearly as well developed in this book. We seem some spark of the former characters of the children, but they are really an aside to this story as compared to Caspian. But even Caspian is only half developed and for being a main character, I couldn't really connect with him. There are several minor characters that I did like. These being the badger, some of the dwarves and of course Aslan.The writing is aimed towards children and as such an adult might find it rushed and desire more detail. There isn't really anything offensive in it (aside from one minor curse word) and it is highly appropriate for anyone to read. It has a special narrator, who talks to the reader, and this makes the reading more personal, which is nice.I do like the series and while this isn't the best of them, it is still important to read it as it continues the story of Narnia and sets up some history for the next few books.Prince CaspianCopyright 1951238 pagesReview by M.

I am so glad that this book is just one in a series! It is the sequel to the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is about 4 children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy discover Narnia through a wardrobe. In Price Caspian the 4 children are trying to bring Narnia to justice by helping Prince Caspian become king and bring down his evil Uncle Miraz. It doesn't matter whether you like to read or not or if you are 7 or 20. It's a great fantasy. In this book you will find all kinds of adventure. You will discover animals that talk, animals that don'y exist, and even some dwarfs. When you read Prince Caspian your imagiation sets free. There is such good description that you can picture in your head what is happening. In addition, you can also connect with the characters well. I would rate this book a 4.5 because it has all the qualities a good book but the beginning isn't as good as i thougt it would be. It doesn't grab your attention right away but later in the book it gets... interesting. To improve the book I would have made the book more exciting because in the beginning of the book th children are at the train station and the train goes by and they end up on this island. It doesn't grab your attention and make you think what is going to happen next? Overall Prince Caspian is a great book.

There are six main characters; Peter, Susan, Edmund, Lucy, Prince Caspian, and Aslan. The story takes place in a land called Narnia. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy get to Narnia by Susan's horn. (You can find more information about it in the book; The Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe.)When they arrived in Narnia there were a lot of overgrown trees, Aslan was not ruling, and people thought that animals did not talk like they did in the other books. The new ruler was named King Miraz who was a bad ruler by killing the talking animals and not allowing magic. Prince Caspian was his nephew who did not like how things were being done so he ran away. Prince Caspian finds old Narnian taling animals and becomes their leader. Meanwhile Edmund and the other kids find a dwarf who is in Prince Caspian's army. When they heard that King Miraz wanted to kill Prince Caspian they leave immediately to go and find the Prince but instead find Aslan. will Peter, susan, Edmund, and Lucy with the help of Aslan find and save Prince Caspian and the land of Narnia? Find out by reading this book.I think Prince Caspian is one of the best books in the Narnia series. I think a lot of people would read it because its full of bloody battles and it reunited the main characters from the beloved book; The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"A great continuation to the series. One of the great themes in this book is that courage and virtue come in all shapes and sizes.It contains great lessons for the young reader while giving them an escape to the amazing world of Narnia."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"'Prince Caspian' finds Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy getting ready to return to school at the end of summer holidays, when they are suddenly pulled by magic into another world. Of course, at once they suspect they are back in Narnia, but nothing seems familiar to them. It turns out while only a year has passed in our wold, centuries have passed in Narnia.This is the second published book in the series (4th in the internal chronolgy). The first 2/3rds of the book are quite good, as the kids realise where (and when) they are, encounter Trumpkin the dwarf and learn of the recent history of Narnia, and the story of young Prince Caspian.However once they reach Caspian the story really sags, as it just seems the characters wait around until Aslan fixes everything.The Christian references are toned down a little in this one. All in all the weakest of the series -probably closer to 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"It is a bleak time for the Narnians of old. The talking animals are all in hiding and men who call themselves Telmarines are ruling the land. The men of Telmar are afraid of and hostile to talking animals, the dryads and hamadryads, the naiads, centaurs, dwarves, and satyrs. They fear them and have tried to destroy them. The woods are silent and the dryads sleep, dreaming of a free Narnia and better times. But the memories of old, free Narnia are alive and are passed on in secret. The nurse of Prince Caspian is just one who knows the exciting secrets of old, and there are many others. And so it happens that the young prince comes to love the old that is hidden more than the new that he will rule. But although the stories of old may feed the soul, they are dangerous to know. And that is the start of the prince's dangers and adventures. He may call on those free creatures who are in hiding, they may rally to his call, but will they be strong enough to overthrow their oppressors? He has one more magical link with the past, and he will use it at the moment of greatest need - the magical horn of Queen Susan bringing unknown help to those who use it, which has been preserved as a relic by the faithful.The Chronicles of Narnia begin, as everyone knows, with \`The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'. This story, \`Prince Caspian', is probably best read second in the sequence as it is a continuation of the original four's adventures. The High King Peter, King Edmund, Queen Susan, and Queen Lucy are summoned by magic back to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in time of crisis. The story of \`The Magician's Nephew' goes back to the beginning of Narnian time and a little earlier in our world's time to tell how Narnia was created in the first place, and it is probably best read about fifth or sixth in the sequence, but at any rate before \`The Last Battle' which tells how Narnia ends and is more frightening than the rest. The best loved of all the stories is probably \`The Voyage of the Dawn Treader', partly because it is the longest and richest story in the series and is supremely well written. It is very easy to read but full of interweaving plots, and thrills on land and sea, and full of hard realities like how people behave while thirsty on short water rations and no land in sight. It is the jewel of the set, and fits perfectly in the middle. Reading about prince Caspian will help set the jewel in your mind.\`Prince Caspian' is also an interesting story because it explains so much of the magic of Narnia, and gives those who wish to see an insight into politics, history (ours and Narnia's), battles, and human psychology. It is particularly revealing to see what a prince's education involves: some literature, some mathematics, some social graces, some skills in entertainment and music, some politics. Some people do not like this story because it is about a war, but it really is about what leads up to war, what happens after, and how the individuals involved all react and cope. The actual fighting is a small part of the whole, unlike a modern action film which is heavy on the fighting and light on the people. Having said that, the storyline is one of the simplest in the set as we stay almost all the time with the four children together, who quickly resume their adult roles once in Narnia.

The fact that Lucy is the only one able to see the glimpses of Aslan when the struggle becomes bitter speaks volumes about the virtue of faith, and we can already see in this installment how Susan began to lose hers.

They were similar in terms of the characters (with new ones too), war, celebrations, and the search for Aslan. They were different in the timing - several hundred years had passed between the first book and Prince Caspian and Cair Paravel was now in ruins. All four children are back in this story, but they are aging faster than in the 'real' life. In fact, by the end of the story you learn that two will not be back to Narnia because they are 'too old'. You meet the new and next King of Narnia, Caspian the Ninth, learn his history and about his evil uncle. The plot involves a conflict between old Narnia and the Telmarines, which leads to a battle between good and evil, and of course, good wins. Aslan becomes apparent and visible to the children when they finally believe in him again. Then, Aslan helps them and all the creatures of old Narnia win the battle. In the end, and before he leaves Narnia, Aslan banishes the Telmarines but gives them another place to live, heals the sick, and rewards those who diplay loyalty."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"The Dwarf Trumpkin tells the children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy)the story of Prince Caspian and how he escaped the castle of Miraz for fear of his life.

Lewis Report By: Cashew BrownThis book is about 4 kids that get sent to a magical place called Narnia. Narnia is a place of magic, mystery, and talking animals. They came across a dwarf that was about to be murdered. They rescued the dwarf from a long ,painful death from drowning. The dwarf, thankful for his life, told the children a long story about Prince Caspian . He told of a boy that was heir to the throne of Narnia. He ran away from his castle and got knocked out and woke up in a small cave with two dwarfs and a talking raccoon. They told all of the magical creatures that lived in the area. They all had a meeting and declared war on the castle. The dwarf ,having finished his story, led them to the mainland. They got lost in a large forest for several days. When they finally got out they went straight to Prince Caspian. They had a discussion and finally agreed on a duel with the king. Caspian had the duel the next day. Caspian had a hard battle but won.

The story line was very intriguing and the characters were explained very vividly. For example when speaking of Aslan, the lion, the book gave him a very powerful and noble type of command in the story. Each character in this book was fun in it's own way. My favorite character was Reepicheep, the mouse, the way he was so humble and how he cared about his honor but never once put himself down because of his size. I also liked this book because I love the time of knighthood and legends of Giants and Centaurs and other mythical creatures. That is why I chose to read this book in the first place.The author when he writes can paint a picture in your mind of the open fields, the great forest, even the warmth and love from the great lion Aslan that Peter and the other children felt. I find the authors way of description very amazing. This book was very adventurous full of battles, mythological creatures, spells, castles, kings and queens, anyone that is intrested in that sort of adventure should really read this book.

The impression I get is that Lewis wanted to repeat the success of LION/WITCH, but hadn't figured out how to scale up the story yet. The problems?(1) LION/WITCH had a tyrant, so this book has a tyrant, too. So there's another civil war. Repetition, as I said.(2) The rebels summon the kids from LION/WITCH to help, but why? The kids have no special abilities, like the hobbits. They don't bring twentieth-century technology with them. They're good at horseback riding and archery, but a typical Narnia soldier can do that as well. Basically they are there for propaganda purposes, to awe the Narnians, but that's not heroic, and so Lewis never admits that. Instead they have to fight in battles and risk getting killed.(3) To keep the kids from reaching the rebels and finishing the story, Lewis has Aslan appear and play hide-and-seek. Supposedly it's to test their faith, but why would Aslan think it needs testing at this point, particularly when lives are at stake elsewhere?(4) Eventually they reach the rebels and we get another war. But this time there's no heroic scene comparable to Aslan's self-sacrifice in LION/WITCH, so it's a second-rate repetition.(5) Most of the Narnia stories have a moral, but I don't see one here. That fighting is good?Most of the good stuff is in the last chapter when Aslan is trying to arrange peace. After revealing that Caspian had evil ancestors, he tells the boy that he is only responsible for his own acts. He lectures a wounded rebel on accepting adversity, then gives up and heals him anyway. He praises a man on the losing side for his bravery and advises the other rebels to follow him as they go into exile. And there's the poignant revelation when Peter and Susan learn that they can never come back. But the rest of the novel is pretty much a loss."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I have only seen the movie Prince Caspian. I am reading the book right now.

However the rest of the books so far are great!!!!! I did enjoy The Voyage of the Don Treader, it is great as it leaves Narnia and goes into other mysterious lands.

This particular book, the second in the series by the original reckoning, was one of my favorites because it gives the reader a more Narnian perspective of Narnia.

In gaining a better perspective on Narnians this book captured my imagination for what would next happen to the facinating and far away land."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Continuing through the Chronicles of Narnia, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is the fourth novel chronologically, and the second published. Because of the order in which the books were written, this book takes up where \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" left off, with the four Pevensies being called back to Narnia by magic, one year later in their time, but eons later in Narnian time.In the blink of an eye, the children are transported from a train platform, (not Platform 9 ), into the forests of Narnia, soon discovering the ruins of Cair Paravel, where they once ruled as Kings and Queens. After eating enough apples to keep the doctor away for a very long time, they rescue a Dwarf from certain peril, and begin another fascinating adventure together.The present King Miraz is doing his best to stifle the stories of old Narnia, where animals talk, and Naiads and Dryads and Dwarfs and Fauns were a part of daily life, and becomes highly upset when he discovers that his nephew Caspian has been drinking up the folklore, thanks to his devoted nurse, who of course gets the boot shortly after that. Unbeknownst to Miraz, the new tutor is also a closet Narnia believer, who begins his \\"Introduction to Narnia 101\\" and helps Caspian to escape impending doom.Learning that his usurping Uncle Miraz is up to no good, Caspian flees for his life, where by good fortune he is saved by some of the same Narnian creatures he has been dying to encounter. Having established his right to the throne of Narnia, King Caspian begins his first great adventure by getting acquainted with talking animals, dwarfs and other Narnians. Inspired by the great Centaur Glenstorm, a council of war is quickly organized, to make plans for an overthrow of the present government.Unfortunately, before he can warm up to the job, his runaway horse inadvertently gives the game away, and rather too soon, war breaks out. With the magical mound known as Aslan's How as their command center, in the midst of the mysterious woods, the battle does not go well, due to inexperience.Playing his last hole card, King Caspian blows the magical horn, and sure enough, without a moment to spare, help arrives via the Pevensies, former Kings and Queens of Narnia, \\"located\\" by Trumpkin, the rescued dwarf. Getting there however, was almost another adventure altogether, with boys who don't ask for directions, and don't listen to good advice. With the appearance of Aslan, and their faith duly restored, they reach their destination late but safely.The boys are tasked with straightening things out, and issue a challenge to Miraz, to duel for the right to rule. Circumstances then lead to a great and glorious battle, while the girls team up with Aslan to do some back-up work, right some wrongs, and perform a miracle or two. (This part happens very quickly, as if the author was trying to push in as much magic as possible in the closing pages.)Another exciting episode in the Chronicles of Narnia, but there's more to come.Amanda Richards, September 2, 2004"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"In this installment of the Chronicles of Narnia, the children go back to the land a year after their first visit. They are surprised to find that, although only a year has passed on Earth, many hundreds of years have passed in Narnia, and almost everything is different. Most of the magic is gone out of the land--the talking animals, moving trees, dwarves, and other creatures are little more than memories now, and the land is ruled and dominated by a race of men. The men, incidentally, are skeptical in nature, and do all they can to oppress magic and the true history of Narnia.The symbolism in this book is very vivid, and Lewis uses the plot very well to show the situation of much of modern society. The race of men (led by Caspian's uncle) refuse to believe in magic, and also don't believe in Aslan. Aslan is a Christ figure, so this unbelief in him is symbolic of twentieth-century skepticism. Many people today do not believe in miracles or anything that cannot be scientifically \`proven,' and a similar situation exists in Narnia, where men here the old stories of magic but many do not believe them. In an allegorical sense, then, this novel shows us the folly of skepticism, and the absurdity of believing in a world in which nothing wonderful can occur.Like the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia, this book is a delightful children's story. But there is a deep theology at work here, and this is one of the qualities which makes it appealing to adults. I highly recommend this book, along with the rest of the Chronicles, to anyone interested either in fairy tales or in Christian allegory or theology."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"But now there are!

Cair Paravel is in ruins and wild woodlands have grown all over Narnia. Talking animals and magical creatures are in hiding and an evil king rules the land. This book continues the adventure begun in the first book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.

Many of the justifications that it uses in asserting Christianity are the very things that atheists and agnostic disagree with. For example, in one section, Lucy is the only one of the four children who can see Aslan. As a result, the other children have to follow her on Blind Faith. Well, blind faith here is necessary because we accept the faith after knowing the truth. In Christianity, we are expected to have blind faith without knowing the truth. Read this book to your child pr enjoy it as an allegory as an adult, but be sure to talk about it with your children also."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"\\"Prince Caspian\\" is either the second or fourth book of CS Lewis' classic Narnia series, depending on whether one reads the books in published order or chronological order. The story picks up where \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" leaves off, with Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy back in England after having spent many years in Narnia as kings and queens. What follows is in many ways almost a straight rehash of \\"Wardrobe\\" and is possibly the most forgettable of the Narnia books. Were it not for the introduction of Caspian, one of the major characters in the series, it would almost certainly be the least memorable of the seven books.The children find themselves pulled into a strange world, this time by a magical force rather than by wandering through a wardrobe. Quickly (and predictably) enough the world is revealed to be Narnia. Why did they not know this right away? Because the single year they spent in the real world was many hundreds of years in Narnian time. Narnia has aged while they have not.The four children, who in Narnia are revered as legendary kings and queens of old, find that they have been pulled into Narnia to aid King Caspian, a prince from a kingdom of rather oppressive humans who have taken over Narnia and are attempting to squash all memory and knowledge of the land's talking animals and mythical creatures. Naturally, this means those people have to be stopped.If it sounds exciting, it's not. If it sounds boring, it is.Travelogues and adventures that are little more than episodic journeys can be great fun and often tap into the glory of exploring the forest as a child, but this journey simply has little or nothing to engage the reader or capture one's interest. The glimpses of how Narnia has changed in the years since the four kids were there are interesting, but the interest is minimal at best. The travels just lack punch or adventure.Lewis takes a few ill-advised detours that seem only to pad the story while hammering home the idea that people who do not believe in the mystical creatures of Narnia are inherently bad. The heavy-handed messaging in other Narnia volumes generally feel like the moral messages of any other classic fairy tale, but here they somehow feel wrong.All in all, \\"Prince Caspian\\" adds very little to the lore (and lure) of Narnia despite being a part of the central plot, with core Narnia characters throughout. Its greatest contribution to the series is introducing the off-kilter time concept, an old clich&eacute; of alternate world stories, and bringing the character of Caspian (as well as the delightful and brave mouse Reepicheep) to the series. And that's about this book's whole worth. It introduces you to characters you will grow to like later and to concepts essential to the series.Take note, because \\"Prince Caspian\\" is part of the core Narnia books (those involving the four original children and the characters linked directly to them) it's hard to recommend skipping this one - but it really fails to live up to the fantastic spectacle of the others. Children may enjoy the return romp to Narnia, but more likely even they will find that this one disappoints."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I've collected all the 1st edition reproductions of the Chronicles of Narnia series, however I have to say that the U.S. edition printing was on slightly better paper.

S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. Here, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are drawn back to Narnia, where hundreds of years have passed, and must work to overthrow a usurper and put the rightful king on the throne.The story itself is rather straightforward: the Pevensies are in Narnia to do a job and get out. It's all business, and the spirit of adventure the reader finds in the best books of the series is mostly absent here; it doesn't help that the story follows the same basic structure as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, only without most of that book's epic feel and emotional power. And yet the world of magical characters and Lewis's own wit and sprinkling of profound Christian principles carry the story and make it an enjoyable read in spite of its flaws.A prominent theme in Prince Caspian is the virtue of faith and belief; some of the children experience degrees of doubt in Aslan, and many of the Narnians have lost faith in him altogether. Other themes include chivalry and, as is always the case with Aslan, grace.Prince Caspian suffers from some storytelling issues. The novel starts with the Pevensie children, follows them briefly, and then jumps to Prince Caspian's backstory, which takes up nearly half the novel. When the story returns to the Pevensies, they spend most of their time doing little more trudging through the woods. Prince Caspian almost certainly would have worked better if Lewis had written the whole thing from the point of view of Caspian himself (along the lines of what he did with Tirian in The Last Battle), although this would only further highlight the fact that the Pevensies have very little to do throughout most of the novel (and half of what they do is squabble).On the whole, Prince Caspian is probably the weakest book in the Chronicles of Narnia, but even so, it's still worthwhile."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"The Prince Caspian has always been my favourite book of the Narnia series.

This time they are joined by new characters and also joined by the great lion Aslan.I rated this book a five because I thought it was simply a splendid book for all ages.

It has been thirty years since my first experience, and I have to point out that back in the 60's, the books were ordered as follows: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; A Horse and His Boy; The Magician's Nephew; The Last Battle. I am unsure why the series has been re-issued in a different order. It is more pleasing to be introduced to Narnia through the eyes of the four children, and then discovery the mystery of its making in book Six (Magician's Nephew), than the other way around. On to the book. Prince Caspian contains the weakest coupling of the real and imaginary worlds that Lewis attempted. The linkage between the Children and Narnia suffers greatly from the time differentials involved . . . however, the characters grow steadily, the plot moves at a pleasing pace, and the world is revealed much as an onion is pealed, layer by layer, by use of a &quot;story within a story.&quot; The harsh realities of politics, life and death are not overlooked, as many PC books today tend to do, yet the battle scenes do not succumb to graphic description as is done in far too many stories today, and certainly on TV. Narnia's magic retains the critical element of wonder and scarcity, though I must say that the talking beasts are trying at times. I guess it is harder to suspend disbelief as an adult than as a child-- my loss perhaps.The lessons in tolerance, teamwork and faith are well told, and the description is beautiful, even if the style is slightly out of date, and the language less accessible than before the great dumbing down of America brought on by the liberal education reforms of the 70's and 80's.This story, indeed this series, uses allegory to good effect.

To them, only a year has passed since their time in Narnia. But when the horn sounds, they are transported back, only to find that little remained that they recognized. They met up with a dwarf from the Caspian army, and he took them to meet Caspian. There, they fight at his side with the help of Aslan who awakens the old magic of the land and Mariz and his army are defeated. Caspian will be King Caspian and rule Narnia as it's rightful ruler.This was another enjoyable journey back to the land of Narnia. This book is recommended for young readers, and for parents who wish to share the adventure with their children, and for lovers of fantasy series."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"It's funny, how you come at these books as an adult and take something completely different away from them than you would as a child. I read these books about 20 years ago when my uncle gave me a complete set for my birthday. As a child, I think I read them simply as a fantasy/adventure story. As an adult, I can see the subtle religious references sprinkled throughout, and while some may see this as a hindrance to the story, at least through the first 2 books (I go by the original published order, not the new chronological order), I can look beyond that to the story underneath.However, in the case of Prince Caspian, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of story. It seems to me that the book can be broken up into two sections: the first being the Dwarf relating Caspian's understanding of his role of Narnia's future leader (the entire importance of this seems to be related to him over the course of one evening while star-gazing) and the second being Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy's trek through the jungle to get to Caspian. The ending seemed too contrived for my liking and far too rushed. It was all build up and no follow through as far as I'm concerned.Looking at the story differently, it is a story about faith; about how faith can be hard to see sometimes, but it's always there and as long as you believe in that faith, it will lead you where you need it to. Overall a good moral to the story, if a little didactic in the telling."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"It is a great book. It has very captivating writing.

MekonnenPeriod: 1It is about a young prince that hears of a great danger from a dwarf. He goes on a great adventure and becomes a great warrior. Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter come back through the wardrobe but see themselves in an unfamiliar Narnia. As they search on, they find the old gifts that Aslan had given to them. They come up with a conclusion that they have come back and the year that they were gone from Narnia was 100's of years.This book pleased me while I was reading it because it had elements of a great book. One of them is action. I as a reader can't get enough of books with action. They always give me Goosebumps when a king is threatened to be killed or when a person is almost shot. Another good element in this book is that it has a lot of fantasy. The creatures in this story are sometimes weird like the talking beavers, dwarfs, and half-horse half man.This book is great and has so many exciting parts in it. It has action, adventure, and fantasy.They fight giants or dragons. It makes me feel like I am actually in that story and I am fighting one of the beasts. It gets you so into the book that you find yourself in the morning with a book in your lap with drool down your mouth. In the story there is a scene where it shows that there are many different types of creatures in this book. \\"Peter now saw it was really alive and was in fact a Dwarf, bound hand and foot but struggling as hard as it could.\\" This shows to great elements I like about in this story. One of them is that it has a lot of suspense, and the other one is that it has fantasy. Dwarfs are very funny creatures and I like the way dwarfs play a role in this story. There is one scene in this story that caught my attention because it has suspense and a lot of action. \\"For a second the clash could be heard but it was immediately drowned because both armies began shouting like crowds at a football match.\\"My favorite part of the book was the part where Peter fought the king. It was really fun reading that part because it had a lot of action. It is really fun when Peter's skills are put to the test when he fights for his life and pride. He goes down and gets ready to fight a man that is much larger and stronger than him and fights until they both have to stop for a break. Books with action and adventure are usually the books that I enjoy reading. They are fun and have a lot of suspense and excitement. I think that Peter has a lot of courage to go and fight this king. His character flows with this story and its genre."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This book was great i really haven't read the others but this one was a great book and i can't wait to read the other ones!

Later on they find their castle last time they were in Narnia (but they don't know it yet). Then a dwarf comes and tells them a story of how Prince Caspian is in trouble and needs assitance right away. Before this had happened Peter and company had found their old weapons and gear givn to them by Aslan a long time ago. Edmund fights the dwarf to prove that the company and himself are really the kings of olden days. Edmund defeats the dwarf in combat and then Susan beats him with a bow. The dwarf finally realizes that it is actually the olden kings and he adventures into the wilderness to get to Prince Caspians aid. They get lost for a long time but finally get there after meeting Aslan and following him. They beat Prince Caspians step-dad in war and save Narnia from the Telmarines.

The overriding theme investigates how widespread knowledge of an original fact can become legend, then myth, and finally be forgotten all together. There is also another small subtext that I find just as interesting as the larger theme - especially in light of the author's own story. Lewis had a great love of pagan myth. He relates in \\"Surprised by Joy\\" that in pagan Norse myth he had an early taste of the Joy that ultimately led to his conversion. In some respects a regenerate pagan himself, it is not too surprising then to find Lewis often redeeming the pagan more broadly in his fiction. In the case of Prince Caspian, this is accomplished by the introduction of Greco-Roman deities and demigods working on the side of Aslan and the good. It is an approach that would not likely be utilized by the contemporary Christian author, but Lewis does it with his usual deft touch and leaves the reader glimpsing perhaps a bit more clearly just how completely a fallen world is being and will be reclaimed by a risen Lord. A good read, 4 stars, and certainly recommended."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"In this magical tale of witch craft magic and fighting, The ancient kings and queens of Narnia Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy find there selves back in Narnia in a strange beach after there await for the train.

It begins about year after THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE ended. Apparently, the war that was threatening England at the beginning of LION has either ended or isn't as threatening because all four of the Pevensie children are preparing to return to school. Their summer has just come to a close and they are waiting on the platform at a train station to go their separate ways to school. Suddenly, they all feel themselves being violently tugged. One moment, they're in England and the next they find themselves back in Narnia. Except Narnia isn't at all how they remembered it. After all, time doesn't pass in Narnia the same way it passes in our world.They discover that probably over a thousand years has passed since they last stepped through the wardrobe back into their homeworld. Narnia has fallen into a world of chaos. The magical creatures that were the citizens of Old Narnia have either all been exterminated are sent into hiding. There is a New Narnia now--one that is ruled by the wicked King Miraz. Miraz took the throne through murder, but since he had no heir of his own, kept his nephew, Prince Caspian, alive. But on a fateful night, a son is born to Miraz and his wife and Caspian must flee into the night.Thus begins his crusade to regain control of Narnia and restablish the legacy that the Golden Reign of King Edmund, Queen Susan, Queen Lucy, and High King Peter had left. A war is joined between the armies of Miraz and Caspian and a long siege in the wood begins. When the Pevensies return to Narnia, it is up to them to make things right and aid Caspian so that he can take his rightful place as King of Narnia.PRINCE CASPIAN basically directly follows the events of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE and is very much its sequel. The book is full of exciting events, but the tale unravels in a way that one would not suspect. Tolkien and Lewis were very close friends for many years and different as their writings are, there are parts of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and the LORD OF THE RINGS that will forever be compared. In this sense, PRINCE CASPIAN is very much like THE TWO TOWERS: it's a bit darker than LION, deals with some deeper themes, and even has a seen where the trees come alive again to help crush an evil army.LION, though not a complete allegory, was very much allegorical and PRINCE CASPIAN continues some of that same deep symbolism. When I first read the book, I understood some of the deeper meaning (such as when Aslan commands Lucy that she must follow Him even if the others do not), but I was unfamiliar with the history of Christianity to recoginze other elements of the story. Now that I do know about such things as the Reformation, I can see those events being alluded to in the story.Regardless, PRINCE CASPIAN remains a worthy sequel to THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. It's a fantasy adventure story that young children will love, especially if they've read LION."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"In the begining, the four children are waiting for a train to school.

It is the simplicity of the way he writes, even though we know how complex Lewis can be, that is always appealing to the younger fairy tale readers, but also, surprisingly, the older readers as well.With Prince Caspian we find another good and noble king, a leader that others will follow. It is good to see the tides changed in this the second book of the series as the talking animals are forced into hiding and the Old Narnia is all but gone.

Later on in the book we find out that the children had been called back to Narnia by Susan's majical horn (given to her in the second book of this series, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe). They have been called back to Narnia to assist Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the Narnian throne and the Prince of the Old Narnians, in his fight against his wicked Uncle Miraz, who is trying to destroy his nephew and the idea that the people of old Narnia now exist (Old Narnia was characterized by the existence of things such as dryads, nymphs, fauns, cenataurs, mermaids and mermen, and talking animals).

Get a copy and prop your feet up. It is a sweet return trip to Narnia."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Reading Prince Caspian makes it feel that it is the natural next book to read after The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. Rightly, it was C.S. Lewis' second book that he wrote in the Narnia series, which was later reorganized as he wrote other books to insert around them. This book brings back the excitement and literary style of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, and is a breath of fresh air after reading The Horse and His Boy.In Prince Caspian, the 4 children return to Narnia 1 year after they left, but in Narnia time, it had been centuries, and they returned to a place they hardly recognized. As the story goes, it tells of the history of Narnia and what had happened in those years. Basically, a race or men called the Telmarines invaded Narnia killing and driving out the inhabitants of old Narnia into hiding. This new Narnia rejected the magic and stories of the old Narnia, and it seemed to be a secularized society. There is a parallel of the new Narnia to the world we live in, where many reject the spiritual aspects of life, and the basis of their life is \\"seeing is believing.\\" Even the children were affected by this when Lucy claimed that she saw Aslan, but Peter and Susan rejected it. There is a theme of faith where believing is seeing, and as they begin to trust Lucy, being led by her \\"faith\\", they soon after saw Aslan.Another theme that showed was the apostasy of the inhabitants of old Narnia, but in it were a remnant of animals who continued to believe, even though many had rejected Aslan and the stories of old. It seemed that this secularism is a spirit that affected many in the land, and it was also interesting that the Telmarines used stories of fear to keep their people out of the woods of old Narnia. So often, it is the fears that keep us from really believing.Prince Caspian was the true heir to the throne, but his uncle Miraz was out to kill him having a son born to him. Such is also a parallel of our lives being the rightful heir to God through Christ Jesus, but having born into iniquity and trained in secular ways, it took a journey, as Caspian did, to redicover being the heir to the throne, and to us, being a child of God.Prince Caspian appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Trader and The Silver Chair as King Caspian."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I largely credit my love of reading with The Chronicles of Narnia. My fourth grade teacher read the entire series to our class and I loved every minute of it. With the contemporary release of theatrical versions of the first two installments, I've enjoyed rereading the books for the first time in twenty years.Prince Caspian is beautifully simplistic. Aimed at children, the ideas of duty, compassion, and heroism are wonderfully relayed in an easily digestible format. When I was a child, I found the stories incredibly stimulating, but now as an adult I realize the life-lessons Lewis taught with each installment of The Chronicles of Narnia. Prince Caspian is the story of doing the right thing even when you must go against everything that seems natural. It is the story of putting your faith in a higher power and purpose and leaving mundane worries behind.Keep in mind, however, that Lewis offered more than just a morality tale. Prince Caspian lays the groundwork for an epic story to come. In Narnia, Lewis created a varied and fantastic world where mythology, religion, and reality seamlessly meld.I so look forward to reading the rest of this series as an adult and critically analyze Lewis' style and purpose. I also, however, look forward to reading the series to my daughter when she's old enough.

Lewis found that a whole world of stories existed in Narnia. With \\"Prince Caspian\\", the second published chronicle of Narnia, Lewis gloriously returns to the world that the Pevensie children encountered in the first book. However, Narnia has changed: while it's been one year for the Pevensies, over a thousand years have passed and Narnia is in a dark hour, waiting for the rightful king to take his place.The story begins with Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy waiting on a train platform to return to boarding school: suddenly they are tugged into another world, and it slowly dawns on them that it is Narnia, although their castle is now in ruins. They save a dwarf from certain drowning and learn the tale of evil that has befallen the land: for talking creatures have all but disappeared from this magical land, and the evil King Miraz wants to make sure his nephew, Prince Caspian, doesn't take his place as the rightful heir to the throne.

I've read these books numerous times as a child, and reread them to familiarize myself with the stories before the movie versions come out. Rereading these tales as an adult, I can see what a profound influence C.S. Lewis had on a score of writers - the comments that are directed straight at the reader, the names of places and characters - and what an influence his faith had on these tales. The message that is woven throughout these stories is subtly under the surface, never in-your-face preaching, and the characters realistically struggle with belief and choices between right and wrong."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"C.S Lewis's book Prince Caspian is an exciting adventure of the return to Narnia. In this book, the characters from the Chronicles of Narnia, Susan, Peter, Edmund, and Lucy, suddenly get sucked back into Narnia after a year of being out of the magical land. The four children and a small dwarf named Trumpkin face battles and challenges on an expedition to find Prince Caspian. Even though this book was very hard for me to get into, I would still recommend it. At some parts of the book, I got lost because I was bored with it. The book was not quite mind catching enough. The adventures get pretty exciting at parts, and especially during the end of the book.In the beginning of the book, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy get sucked back into Narnia. On a walk through the woods and the beach, they found the Ancient Treasure House, where all of their Narnian presents were from the year before, or in Narnian time periods, thousands of years before. The only thing that they had to eat was apples from the apple tree. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy then discovered that there was a dwarf that was being thrown into the river. They became friends with the dwarf and used a boat that they had found to reach Prince Caspian by crossing a Narnian river. Aslan, the great lion helped in part of the adventure to find Prince Caspian. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy along with Trumpkin fought through a few battles, and at the end of the book, found a feast of glorious food. Will Susan, Peter, Trumpkin, Edmund, and Lucy find Prince Caspian, or will they face disasters in the river or get stranded with Aslan? Travel to Narnia and read about the adventures of Prince Caspian to find out.I think that C.S Lewis's purpose for writing Prince Caspian was to get back into Narnia for example having the magic of the Narnian world pull the characters back into the land and tell a different story. He wanted to set up the story as a future year to the Chronicles of Narnia. C.S Lewis definitely achieved his purpose.I think that Prince Caspian was a little bit of a boring read, and my mind would get lost from place to place, but again, it was kind of interesting and a pretty good book. I liked the parts when the story got into an adventure like for example on the Narnian River when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are trying to find Prince Caspian with trumpkin. Peter, Susan, Edmund, Lucy, Trumpkin, and all of the other characters in Prince Caspian were realistic, I could catch on to what they did, and also be inspired by them. The information in the book was okay, but I think that it could have been a little bit more mind grabbing. Some of the quotes in the book were\\" Trumpkin, you're a brick.\\" And \\" They are fast asleep and will not wake.\\"Over all, I think that Prince Caspian was a pretty good book, and I would recommend it. It was exciting in some parts, and Lucy, Peter Edmund, and Susan were pretty good characters.

I think a lot of people would read it because its full of bloody battles and it reunited the main characters from the beloved book; The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Against the usual tradition of favoring \\"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\" is my favorite of the Narnia series. The story opens with Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan, the old kings and queens of Narnia, now only children off to school. But before they can catch the bus, Narnia decides that it has need of them and brings them back to the land.Meanwhile, Caspian lives in the now-tyrranical Narnia in the days after the rule of the old kings and queens. He is fed bits and pieces of the old magic in stories told by his nurse, and then finds himself on a quest to bring that magic back. On the way his story seamlessly meets that of Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan, and the novel rises from there.The magic and philosophey of the Narnia books is clear in Prince Caspian. The battle of good versus evil is here, as always, but CS Lewis has a way of making it work cliche-- you could say that Narnia was the book that all the other cliched ones branched off from. I really do love these books, and they're a nessecity for any fantasy reader."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"It has only been a year since the four children - Queen Susan, King Peter, King Edmund, and Queen Lucy - reigned in the mythical world of Narnia. A place where animals spoke, and battles against evil - namely the White Witch - were won. However, in Narnia time, it has been close to a thousand years since the four children left the wonderful world, and returned to Britain to continue their studies. But now, as the four royals board a train to school, they are summoned in the most peculiar way, and whisked off to Narnia. Only, Narnia isn't how they left it. It has been destroyed - at least to a certain extent - and many of the animals are no longer enchanted. The destruction of Narnia, however, has not been caused by anything that the former Kings and Queens have done. Nor was it caused by the rightful royal - Prince Caspian. No, it has all been caused by the greedy King Miraz, who has pushed young Caspian out of the way, and claimed the throne, and now wants his blood, in an attempt to make his own son the next King. Now, it is up to Lucy, Susan, Peter, and Edmund, along with the help of Aslan - the Godlike lion - and Caspian - as well as the enchanted dwarves and animals of the Narnian lands - to take down the wicked King Miraz and his evil cohorts, in an attempt to restore the glory that Narnia possessed in the past.Perhaps it is the fact that I adore the characters of Lucy, Susan, Peter, and Edmund so much, which is why PRINCE CASPIAN has quickly become my second favorite book in the NARNIA series, right behind the wonderful THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. As always, the four children reclaim their charming dispositions for this installment, and bring to life an enchanting story, complete with new friends, as well as faux's. Lucy, once again, takes on the role of Mother Hen - even though she is the youngest of the lot - and leads her older siblings on adventure after adventure with the help of the somewhat mysterious Aslan; while Caspian will easily capture the hearts of readers based solely on his bravery and kindness, as well as inquisitiveness. Put on your robes, and embark on another enchanting adventure with the stars of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"There has been much talk recently about the Christian allegory in C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series of children's books. But Lewis preferred to see the purpose of his Narnia stories as one of \\"baptizing the imagination\\" in preparation for hearing the real gospel story. And if there is such a thing as a baptism of the imagination, Christian writers ought to take a lesson from Lewis in how it's done.Prince Caspian is the fourth chronological book in the series and one of my favorites thus far. I read through all the Chronicles when I was a kid, but I decided to re-read them as a result of all the hubbub about the recent Narnia movie. I had forgotten how the books had the strange quality of being both beautifully simple and deeply complex. In one sense they are simple stories of good and evil. But in another sense they are so entrenched in the Christian story that the mysteries of Christian theology are emphasized.Take the character of Aslan, who is both the heart of the books and the heart of Narnia itself. Lewis has this wonderful way of imbuing him with both the terror and the wonder of the Christian God. In Aslan we see a figure of light and beauty, a figure of almost limitless wonder that revives the soul in a single encounter with him. But we also see the terrible judge of all things, that being of infinite power and wrath that holds the divine right to execute eternal justice.I am also enamored with the different ways in which Aslan is presented in the different books. In The Magician's Nephew he is the benevolent Creator. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe he is the suffering Messiah. In The Horse and His Boy he is the Judge of wickedness. But in Prince Caspian we see something wholly different: Aslan as the divine Giver of life, the God who makes all things new.For example, contrast Aslan's involvement in the battle of Wardrobe with his uninvolvement in the major battle of Caspian. In Caspian he is content to organize the necessary elements to win the battle, while he goes on a parade with Bacchus and Silenus and the children of Narnia, spreading life and beauty, healing the sick, and having an all-around divine celebration of the return of Aslan and freedom to Narnia. For all the variation in modern sci-fi/fantasy films, novels, and comic books, I never see in them a scene like this. That is because the art and popular culture of modern humanity has excised God from the picture. The heavens are silent, and man is left to himself to create his own significance. The vision of Aslan restoring life to his world is an exhilarating experience like nothing else I've read, except for the biblical story itself.But while it is exhilarating, it is also depressing because there is no one like Lewis around today to write these kinds of sophisticated children's novels from a Christian worldview. There have certainly been writers who have tried, but none of them have come close to Lewis. And the bestsellers in Christian fiction are still Christified pop versions of romance novels and thrillers.But time in Narnia is time well-spent. Lewis is an author that understands both theology and mythology, and can wrap them up together in an unusual but sublime package."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]Prince Caspian, the second novel written and published and subtitled \\"The Return to Narnia\\", is the first of the so-called \\"Caspian Trilogy\\". Explicitly written as the \\"second\\" book in the series, \\"Prince Caspian\\" shows a much different Narnia from the one we first saw in \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\". Hundreds of years have passed, and it is actually in the era of Caspian that the most books of Narnia occur.Essentially the story is that a young prince, a human descended from pirates who found their way into Narnia via cave in the South Pacific, is heir to the throne of Narnia. The humans have taken over Narnia and have treated all the talking animals and creatures as mythological. In this milieu, Prince Caspian loves the stories and early histories of \\"Old Narnia\\", who is taught to him by Dr. Cornelius. Eventually, he discovers that Old Narnia is indeed true history, and not only that, Dr. Cornelius is not what he first appears to be.\\"Prince Caspian\\", in the actual method of story telling, is the most different of the Chronicles as a good portion of the first half of the book does not actually happen in the real time of the tale, but is instead recounted to the children by Trumpkin the dwarf. From it we learn the unusual occurrences that have taken place since they have been gone, and we also come to the first book of what I of as the Caspian Trilogy. Caspian's time frame gets the most treatment of Lewis, where the beginning of the world gets one book, the Golden Age two books, Caspian's lifetime three books, and then the ending of both the series and Narnia as one book.There are many ties in with Caspian and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Both are the rightful kings, both have uncles who are trying to kill them, and both must attempt to regain the throne. Caspian is successful, but he must place the belief in a supernatural world. Like Hamlet who must accept advice from the ghost of his father, so must Caspian place his belief in the older world to take his rightful place as King Caspian the XI.We also get directions from Aslan that, even if the crowd does not do what is right, we have the responsibility to do what we know is right. Instead of following Aslan when she knows she should, Lucy disobeys him and goes with the her siblings and the dwarf (a.k.a. D. L. F. -- Dear Little Friend). This scene in Prince Caspian illustrates the fact that you should not go with the crowd when God has told you what to do. Your responsibility is to Aslan, not the crowd. Instead of following Aslan she disobeys him and goes with the crowd. It is a positive message Lewis sends to his young readers about resisting peer pressure, because in the end you do not answer to this crowd but you answer to God..We also get the theme of the dwarfs as being for the dwarfs. Nikabrick, who cares for no one but the ones with power who will aid the dwarves, does not bear any love for Aslan. He would just as soon be with the White Witch, and indeed he brings evil beings into Caspian's councils, after which he is killed. His story is a sad story, and from this we get the theme that, even though it seems there are no friends for us, in the end God will take care us if we allow him, but if we do not God will not force himself upon us.Prince Caspian stands as one of the most interesting of the Chronicles for the relationship it shows between God and hnau, especially that remark about God getting bigger as we grow older. We also get several of the pagan elements in this text too, and how, although the Greeks and Romans used it in the wrong sense, God does indeed approve of revelry and that wild passion so intensely felt, for how could it be otherwise? If God did not approve of that passion, he would not have sent Jesus to die for us, because it is borne of that passion that Jesus came to die.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)..------------------------------[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The five works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complictions if you do not do it his way.Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomoly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"After reading the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I was eager to start this book, and I was not disappointed.

A situation most people can relate to, because it speaks of the treachery of men gradually choking out the magic in our lives. Ever felt that way about your life? Read this book."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This is perhaps the darkest Narnia novel. A struggle filled with despair as the last of the true Narnians rally under prince Caspian for a war to the death against the Telmarines invaders who ruled the land.I liked the fact that the prince refused the aid of the darker of the true Narnians, the witch, the giant and the werewolf. I liked even more the fact that these dark creatures were added to the book.It's a great book, for all ages, for all those who love the struggle against evil and tyrany."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I'm beginning to see why high fantasy almost always takes place on an epic scale. The short volumes of the Chronicles of Narnia don't really give you a chance to live in the world and experience it. Prince Caspian is at its most winning when it revels in the past. When the children return to Narnia, they discover a world that has aged for a thousand years without them. It gave the place a feeling of weight and grandeur before the plot caught up with them.Like LWW, PC is a slight narrative heading towards a single, swift, decisive battle that will be easily won by Aslan after taking a moment to meditate on faith and God. The main thrust of the story is about restoring Prince Caspian to the throne of Narnia, usurped by his murderous uncle Claudius--I mean, Miraz. His plight is what summons the four children back to Narnia, and his backstory is the subject of a four-chapter flashback. No, really. This is only a fifteen chapter book. Roughly a quarter of the narrative is a single, unbroken flashback that doesn't involve any of the four children we're supposed to be following. This is not the least of the narrative issues I have with PC, but overall the book did surpass LWW. It was more engaging and the ending was less of a deus ex machina.Also, the heroes are less useless in this book. Susan gets to use her bow (although she still isn't allowed to participate in combat). Peter and Edmund get their diplomacy on, but none of them have much of an arc. And Lucy... she is the main character of a Lewis-gets-preachy unnecessary subplot that really bothered me. Not because I'm anti-allegory (I'm not) and not because I'm anti-religion (I am, but I'm claiming objectivity), but because I hate sacrificing narrative cohesion for the sake of making an unnecessary point. While the group is trying to find Caspian, Aslan appears to Lucy and Lucy alone, bidding her to follow him. She mentions this to the group, but she's outvoted. The following night, she sees Aslan again, who seems to be irked that she didn't convince the others to follow him or, failing that, follow alone. He could have just appeared to all four children and been done with it. But instead, he chose to admonish the faithless for exercising otherwise sound judgement.I realize that for Lewis, this was probably meant to be a deep homily on the nature of faith. For me, it just points out what a jerk Aslan (and by extension God) can be. In case you hadn't picked up on this, I don't enjoy Aslan as a character. He shows up, bosses people around, and everyone thinks he's awesome. But aside from swooping in at the last minute to win battles, he doesn't do much apart from being mysterious and unapproachable. Think about it, he's almost completely unnecessary to the plot. His presence diminishes the actions of the children--who are the heroes of the story. He heals people and he rallies the troops, but he mostly just exists for Lewis to fawn over. This book (and its predecessor) could have been told without his physical presence, losing the painfully plot-halting allegory and making the heroes' deeds more heroic. Would have made for better books, in my opinion.On the whole, I liked PC more than LWW. It felt lived in, more self-assured. I'm looking forward to where this series goes, but I've had it up to here with the darned lion."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Don't get me wrong. I liked this book. I really did. But compared to the others I just found it kind of lackluster and a little unfocused. The book is called Prince Caspian but the emphasis didn't seem to be on him; it was on the children and how they saved the day. I was expecting something a long the lines of the life and times of Prince Caspian, or something like that. The history that we do get of him is passively told for a couple of chapters (which was interesting nonetheless) and everything else was about the re-emergence of Old Narnia.Prince Caspian was definitely more of a secondary character than the focus of the book. It almost seemed that he was just fodder for another adventure for the children which was kind of irritating. I was sad at the end, however, when we're told that Peter and Susan were getting too old to travel back and forth between the real world and Narnia. Very Peter Pan moment right there.Overall I guess I wasn't as impressed with this one as I was with the others. It is a little disheartening to go into something thinking you're getting one thing and get something else. Like I said, it wasn't bad by any means. It's still a fantastic story but I think the power of a title comes into play here. If the title of the book is Prince Caspian, I expect him to be the main focus of the story, not a secondary plot line."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"To begin the book, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are sitting at the railway station waiting to catch the train to begin the term at school. It's Lucy's first year at boarding school. Then, all of a sudden, they hear a noise like a horn, and suddenly, they're on a strange island. They go around the island for a bit, find food, and decide where to settle down. While reflecting on the island, they find that some things are very like their castle in Narnia that they had lived in only a year before. Upon further investigation, they come to the conclusion that they are at Cair Paravel, where their castle was located in Narnia, and it was in ruins now. After two days on the island, they go to a jungle-like place on the island, and they see two men carrying a dwarf inside a boat, and they conclude that the men are going to kill the dwarf. So, Susan shoots one of the men with her arrow, and both the men run away. The kids help the dwarf out of the boat, and the dwarf says thanks, and then asks who they are. The kids ask him the same, and the dwarf, thinking he owes them something in return for saving his life, tells them his story. The dwarf's story is about a boy named Caspian, and Caspian is the right to the Narnian Throne. He says that Caspian had a tutor that would tell him about \\"Old Narnia\\"(meaning when the Pevensies ruled Narnia) and that he mustn't tell anybody of this because they would kill his tutor, Doctor Cornelius. Caspian's uncle is the King of Narnia. One day, the King has a son, and Cornelius tells Caspian that now that his uncle has a son, he doesn't need to keep Caspian alive, and tells Caspian to run into the woods, as far away from King Miraz(his uncle) as possible. Caspian does as told, and while running from the castle, runs into 2 dwarfs, and a talking badger. Immediately, one of the dwarfs, Nikabrik, doesn't like him. The only reason being that he's a human. The other two are suspicious at first, but he tells them that he is going to bring Old Narnia back to the top, and they like him. The other dwarf's name is Trumpkin, and the badger's name is Trufflehunter. Trufflehunter tells Caspian that he will tell all of his fellow Talking Beasts about Caspian and what he plans to do. They do this, and there is a celebration and a feast when this is all done. The next day, Doctor Cornelius finds Caspian, and tells him that his horse, after he met Trufflehunter and the dwarfs, ran right back to his stable at the castle, and left tracks to where he is. The Doctor also suggests that he heard that there is a mythical place called Aslan's How, where they can find refuge for a few fortnights. So they headed off to Aslan's How, and eventually made it there. When there, Caspian announced that before he left, Doctor Cornelius had given him Queen Susan's Horn. Cornelius said that it was said that whenever the horn was blown, help would come. Although they knew help would come, they didn't know if it would call back the High King Peter, or maybe call Aslan from across the sea. They didn't know, but Caspian sent a talking squirrel to the light post at which the Pevensie Kings and Queens came from when they first arrived at Narnia, and he sent Trumpkin to the sea at which their castle was. So, at that, Trumpkin had finished telling his story to the Pevensies, but he doesn't think that they are worthy of fighting King Miraz, so the kids challenge him to an arrow-shooting contest with Susan, and Susan wins, and a fencing contest with Edward, and Edward wins. The Pevensies and Trumpkin set off to Aslan's How, and nothing to important happens except for when Lucy sees (or thinks she sees) Aslan atop a hill when they were on their way. Nobody believed that she actually saw him except Edmund, so they kept on. Near the end of the journey, the group starts to get shot at by King Miraz's army, and they decide to head back and go Lucy's way. They do that, and on their way there, while everybody was sleeping, Lucy sees Aslan again, and goes to talk to him. Aslan tells Lucy to wake everybody else up and follow him, and he says if nobody believes her, to come alone. She wakes everyone up, and it takes a little bit for all of them to come. Susan even threatens to not come at all, but she does anyway. Aslan leads them there, and eventually the entire group could see Aslan. First, Ed, then Peter, then Su, and after a long time, Trumpkin could see him. Aslan tells the boys and Trumpkin to go to Aslan's How(which turns out to be only the Stone Table) and tells the girls to come with him. The boys go down into the How, and they encounter a fiasco with a werewolf, a hag, and Nikabrik, all of which end up getting killed. Then, Peter decides to challenge Miraz to a duel. They write a document to duel, and a talking mouse, Reepicheep, Edmund, and a giant, Wimbleweather, deliver the document to Miraz. Miraz's Lords actually trick him into accepting by saying it would be too humiliating to accept and get humiliated in front of his entire kingdom and lose. So he accepts. Meanwhile the girls and Aslan slowly awaken all of the tree, water, and earth spirits. While Peter and Miraz were dueling, Miraz falls, and doesn't get back up again. Shortly after this, the spirits that Aslan awakened start to attack the \\"New Narnians\\" and one of the Lords that Miraz had insulted, quite literally stabs Miraz in the back. After this, Old Narnia celebrates their victory, and the Pevensies are sent home.C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite writers. I'm amazed at how he can pack so much emotion, action, drama, and humor into 238 pages. Although I've only read the first 4 Narnia books, Lewis's writing style makes me want to read all of them over again."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I first read this series back in high school. I enjoyed it as much now a I did then. A must read for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Have you ever been afraid? I mean, deathly, horribly, afraid? Not of the dark, or being hurt in sports or rock-climbing, or some other concrete fear, but of something more *ephemeral*? The answer is that, yes, we all have. It may have been fear of giving a speech, or singing in front of an audience, or of being laughed at by a girl that you wish to impress (or a boy that you wish to impress for the ladies). For Christians, it is somewhat deeper of a fear, and this is the real message of C. S. Lewis' *The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian*.In the book, the four Pevensies, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, are called into Narnia by Susan's magic horn she received from Father Christmas in the first book. A young boy, heir to the throne of his Telmarine ancestors who conquered Narnia several hundred years after the children returned to England, wanted to take the throne from his murderous uncle, Miraz, and reopen Narnia to the talking beasts and other creatures of Aslan that originally dwelt there.He and the Narnians are, of course, outclassed militarily by the humans on Miraz's side, and their more sophisticated (at least to the Narnians), though crude and of less quality, weapons. It is at this point that King Caspian blows Susan's horn, and the four children are pulled into Narnia.The book is a darker and less fanciful tale than *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*. The children do not have nearly such a fine time as they did on their first trip to Narnia, not until the very end at least. Whereas the earlier visit was a time of great personal blessing as well as responsibility, this was a time of hard work, with very little reward. At least this seems to be the case.Although Aslan still does the main work of saving the day, the children and the \\"old Narnians\\", lead by Caspian, are in the very brutal situation of having to kill an opposing army that is not *all* bad and villainous like the White Witch's army was in the original book. This was made clear enough by the fact that a large minority of the adult Telmarines chose to stay under Caspian's rule in Narnia, and even among the majority who left, there were some who were noble.Indeed, one could argue that this similarity to real-world warfare makes the book the \\"darkest\\" of the Narnian Chronicles, save for perhaps the final installment. Of seemingly lesser degree, but greater importance, is the struggle for faith in Aslan with which the children and Trumpkin the Dwarf must contend.At first none but Lucy can see Aslan, but He is there, and scolds Lucy for giving into the others, and then badmouthing them behind their backs. Instead, she must face up to their doubts in her and anger at her. She must follow Aslan, and hopefully they will, as well. All of this puts Peter, Susan, and Trumpkin against her. Edmund is a bit cold towards her, but this is just his nerves, as he really does support her.At the end, there is a short celebration, and then the children are sent home, with Peter and Susan told they will never return to Narnia. This seems like a pretty pathetic reward for their hard work and service. In the grand scheme of things, it is not, for Aslan (as God) knows what is best for them all, and has more great things in store for them. Indeed, though Susan will later deny Aslan and Narnia, she is likely still saved by the faith the four children found in Christ, Aslan's Person and Name in our world.You see, in the cosmology of the books, Aslan gave the children the greatest gift of all by drawing them to Himself, and bringing them to a faith in Him in both worlds. The instrument He used was Lucy, as she showed incredible faith and ability, God-given, to conquer her fears. Her fears of laughter, mocking, or rejection by her siblings. Afterwards, Lucy and Susan spread the message of Aslan to others, and they followed Him, and were in bliss in His glorious Presence. But it was Lucy's faith that made this possible in the first place.Though, as far as we know, Jesus is not a giant Lion in another world, the point about sharing the Gospel with those who so desperately need it, still stands. This can extend to other areas as well. Are we afraid to talk to others, for fear of them hurting us? Do we doubt or question God's work and role in our lives, instead of asking Him what He is trying to accomplish, and how we can serve Him? In these areas, and so many more, we hurt ourselves, others, and most importantly of all, our relationship with God, by letting our fears govern us. In this, we sin.This book, in it's content, and it's messages, is far more serious, and difficult, than the first Narnia book, but it is well-worth it to read for enjoyment, for edification, and for seeing in vivid form, the necessity of leaning on our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Even when others mock Him as not there, and even when we can not feel His Presence, He is there. He is the God Who created you and me. Trust Him and lean on Him today.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This book was purchased as part of a grant fulfillment by Kappa Delta Pi-Eta Theta Chapter of Brooklyn College.

Lewis, Prince Caspian (Harper Collins, 1951)In the old days, Prince Caspian was the second book in the Narnia series; these days, it's the fourth. While I can't remember how many times I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a kid, I know I only got through Prince Caspian once, and I was interested to see if there was anything in particular about it that had stopped me going back. (Upon reflection, it was probably my attempt to read The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which I never did finish during my youthful days.)In this installment, Peter and his siblings are yanked off a train platform and back into Narnia, but it is a Narnia that none of them know; in the year they've been away, a huge amount of time has passed there (it's never spelled out, but the estimates range from one hundred to one thousand years, and based on some of the markers we're given, the latter seems closer to the reality of the situation). Narnia has fallen on hard times. The Telmarines, a race of men from over the sea, have taken over Narnia and driven the supernatural creatures into hiding or extinction, and of the royal family, only the king's nephew, Caspian, has any interest in restoring order to things. With the help of a subversive tutor, Caspian flees the castle and finds himself in command of what ragged army the supernatural creatures can field, but without the heroes of old or Aslan himself, what hope do they have? So Caspian, who's been given a horn supposedly carried by Susan herself, blows it...What really interested me about the book this time around (and it's something I'm not even sure Lewis took into account when writing it), when looking at the whole series as a massive Christian allegory, is the way it treats relics. Relics, as we're all very well aware (at least, those of us brought up in the faith), were a big business in the middle ages. (Heck, you could still buy splinters of the One True Cross in the backs of tabloids in the early eighties; for all I know, you still can.) Needless to say, every last one of them was about as real, and as efficacious, as any foul-smelling brew you might boil up in your kitchen, package as snake oil, and sell to your neighbors. Lewis, on the other hand, whether as a concept or as a plot device, seems to have bought into the idea wholeheartedly. And it does make perfect sense as a plot device, though as with other portions of the story that seem to run counter to all the stuff I was taught in Sunday school (and I'm sure would be taught even more stringently now--J. K. Rowling certainly can't get away with putting magic in her books, at least in come churches), I wonder what was going through Lewis' mind when he decided to include this stuff. Pity he's no longer around to ask.That bit aside, though, Caspian is just as cracking good an adventure story as is The Lion etc., though our four friends are almost relegated to minor-character status here (and I'm not entirely sure that's unintentional, either) and we spend much more time with Caspian and his contemporaries. Fans of the characters from the first (excuse me, second these days) novel may be a bit put off by this, but if you stick with it, I'm sure this one will seduce you as well. ***"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"The Pevensie children are summoned back to Narnia thousands of years after the end of their reign to provide aid to Prince Caspian, who has allied himself with the talking animals of Old Narnia to unseat the cruel uncle that has usurped his throne.C.S. Lewis delivers more lessons derived from the Bible in this volume of his Christian parable, most notably the necessity of faith in keeping believers from wandering off the true path. In light of the foreign misadventures of our recent administration, I was most touched by the aspects of the story that touched on ethical conduct in times of war. Peter challenges the evil King Miraz to personal combat to avoid mass casualties (if only our own leaders could resolve conflicts in this way). At one point, some of Caspian's followers try to summon the spirit of the White Witch to aid them, but the Pevensies put a stop to that. They--and Lewis--understood that going to the \\"dark side\\" out of expediency is a sure path to losing one's own soul. Lessons aside, Lewis delivers as a storyteller, as well. This is an imaginative, fast-paced fantasy and a worthy addition to the series."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Just to be clear, the Narnia Series is one of the best children's book series ever written. However, I found Prince Caspian to be much less compelling of a story than Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book was good and I give it 3.5 stars, but it is not great. The Christian allegory is still there, but it is much less obvious. Nevertheless, this is still a good book and children will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"To say this is the worst of the series is rather to say how great the series is. This book is highly recommended, but the other six even more so. Prince Caspian is simply less engrossing as story. It is a book about bringing justice to the disenfranchised. It is perhaps the most character-driven of theNarniabooks, which is probably why it would be difficult to make into a movie. And the primary character is of course Aslan.The book focuses on Aslan throughout, whether or not he is there. Indeed, the overarching theme is trusting in Aslan, whether or not you see him. Pervading all the scene is Aslan- discussions about him, discussions about how he doesn't exist, and a presence that can't be seen but some know is there. Character develops in response to the dilemma of the unseen Aslan.Aslan isn't the only character though. We are entertained by beautiful descriptions, like a bear who must put his foot into his mouth (suck his paws), or a giant who is always putting his foot into his mouth (metaphorically). Indeed, battle plans are drawn up precisely because of the characters of the different participants. And we are introduced to perhaps the finest character of the Narnia series- Reepicheep, the valiant Mouse.But while character-driven, Lewis seems to have taken a step back from writing good character in this novel. There are good insights into the nature of belief, but the characters don't quite ring true. And while it makes sense that Aslan would save the day, as after all, the novel is about him, we don't get enough of a connection between the presence of the Pevensies and the salvation of Narnia at the end of that day.Thus there are two excellent reasons to read this book.Dawn Treaderdoesn't make sense without it. And for the lessons on faith that are gently told through story, as only a story can."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"There were no torn pages and the cover was secure.

With that background, I found this to be a good book, and at least as entertaining for me (reading this to my kids) as the aforementioned more famous title. If the latter is a re-told account of the Gospel message, then Prince Caspian might be a parable of the modern Church Age. To the \\"modern\\" characters in Prince Caspian, the four kings and Aslan and old Narnia are all things of myth and fairy tales (just like worldwide floods and resurrections, right?). Yet, the moderns get a chance to encounter the old world and experience a little real reality.

Lewis wrote in his children's fantasy series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". If you are reading the books in chronological order, as opposed to order of publication, it is the 4th book. \\"Prince Caspian\\" finds the heroes of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", young Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, returning to boarding school a year after their first adventure in Narnia. As they sit waiting at the railway station, the four siblings are whisked once again to another land, where they find the ruins of an old castle that looks eerily familiar. While only a year has passed in our world, centuries have passed in Narnia. Humans from the land of Telmar invaded Narnia long ago and persecuted the talking animals, dwarves, and magical creatures. But now young Prince Caspian, who is sympathetic to the creatures of Old Narnia, is in line to become King of Narnia. His uncle, King Miraz will do anything to prevent it.For those reading the books in order of publication, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is the first book to hint at broad human participation in the Narnian universe, although it poses more questions than it provides answers. As to Narnia's past, the plot thickens -encouraging readers to press on for answers in the other Chronicles. The dialogue in \\"Prince Caspian\\" has been improved over the often awkward conversations in \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". C. S. Lewis seems determined not to write protracted battle scenes, this time finding a way to avoid the great battle entirely. Not much happens in \\"Prince Caspian\\", but brevity is one appealing aspect of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". Whatever may be said of them, they don't bog down. Although one may glean a few moral lessons from \\"Prince Caspian\\", it is not so full of them as \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". This is primarily an entertaining adventure story for young children."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This book was great to me,it was awesome. I was so trilled to read it because it took my interest. I was interested in the book the whole time. I never got tired of reading it. I never stared into space reading this book like all the others that I read."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"My daughter and I finished reading this book tonight, and with three pages to go, she asked me, \\"Who is Caspian?\\" I think that says it all. She loved The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but Caspian barely held her attention. I really disliked it myself. The action is extremely slow to get going, and indeed, there isn't much action at all until the end of the book.The story is that Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy are whisked back to Narnia, and although only a year has passed in Earth time, an unknown amount of time (hundreds, maybe thousands of years) have passed in Narnia. The first two chapters are extremely boring, as the foursome arrive in Narnia (although they don't know that it is Narnia) and muddle about. Then they meet a dwarf who tells a story about Prince Caspian, and we're \\"treated\\" to a story within a story told to Caspian by his tutor. It was all very confusing, especially for my four-year-old. The next thing you know, we're back in present time, and there still hasn't been much action. Ultimately, there is a one-on-one sword fight between High King Peter and the evil King Miraz, which ends in what is basically a riot. That was decently exciting, but even the duel is relayed in the most boring fashion possible, with the other characters explaining what has happened after it has happened.Prince Caspian is an extremely minor figure in the book. \\"King Caspian\\" is the moniker used more often. His uncle, King Miraz, has usurped his throne. That's two kings. Then there's King Peter, and of course, Aslan, the King of Kings. This was very confusing to my daughter. Further confusing is how Peter duels Miraz so that Caspian can be king. The thing I liked best about the book is how Edmund redeems himself. What I liked least about it was everything else. Now it is up to my daughter to choose what book we read next, and I secretly hope she gives up on the Narnia series. The first book had a sense of wonder, but this was bland, violent, and really (in my opinion) rather pointless."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"The second published book in the Chronicles of Narnia series was Prince Caspian; and I have to admit, it didn't make much of an impression on me the first time I read it. That perspective has since changed, though I still feel that there are many weaknesses in the writing of the story, which should be pointed out.For one thing, the tale is divided into a number of sections, which differ drastically from one another, meaning that the narrative doesn't exactly flow. There are, I think, five distinct sections, each very different from the others. The arrival of the children, the backstory of Caspian, the journey towards Aslan's How, the battle with Miraz, and the victories of Aslan; the last being perhaps the most jarring and bizarre of the five, although there's obviously a reason for that.The first section of the tale; the arrival of the children, is largely set-up for the story. Not much is said or done of any consequence, other than a brief exploration of the area they've found themselves in, and a realization of where they are. They eventually meet a dwarf, who initiates the second section.Caspian's backstory is fairly interesting. We find out that King Miraz (who's actually a usurper; not the real king,) and his people; the Telmarines (basically human beings,) have pretty much taken control of the land away from its native peoples, and have been trying to erase even the records of their past existence. It's only through testimony by his nurse, and a half-dwarf that Caspian even learns about the mythical beasts who once peopled Narnia at all.This section of the story is perhaps the most disturbing if read by itself. The reason is that a few protestant communities genuinely believe that the real \\"church\\" was suppressed by the Catholic Church, and all records of it destroyed; a belief only supported by individual preachers, who arose in the last century and a half or so. One might easily conclude, at first, that Miraz is meant to be an allegory for the modern Catholic Church, and therefore, that this book is blatantly anti-Catholic, but I don't consider that likely, and I'll explain why in just a moment.The third section of the book is basically the kids and the dwarf wandering in the wilderness, in search of Aslan's How, where Caspian awaits. In my opinion, this section drags on a bit too long, but at least its message is quite clear; when Aslan (God) tells you to go someplace, you do it.The setup is this; to get where they need to be, the children need to get across a gorge, so they try to explore a bit and see if there's some route around it; some place where they could cross. Aslan wants them to go one way, and Lucy warns them about this, but none of the others saw him. They wind up getting themselves lost in the woods for a while, and nearly killed by the enemy, before turning back and going Aslan's way; across the gorge by a series of solid rocks that they hadn't been able to see at first.Sometimes, the answer to our problems is right in front of us, but the path just seems too difficult or dangerous. We take account of the wind and the waves, and forget to keep our eyes on the one person who truly matters. In retrospect, this may have been the high point of the story.In section four, some of Caspian's men betray him, and try to summon the White Witch, but they're killed before they can complete their spell. Caspian refuses to be a part of any of their black magic, trusting in Aslan, even though he hasn't shown up yet. Peter and the other kids do show up, however, and Peter offers to fight Miraz in single combat.This is the point where the anti-Catholic accusations are handily disarmed. Peter is clearly an allegory for Saint Peter; the first Pope, and all successive popes by extension, and Miraz, as I've said already, is clearly not a real king (not a real pope,) but a usurper (a heretic.) In many ways, the battle between Peter and Miraz has more of the tone of Athanasius against Arius or the Iconoclast heresy than the Catholic Church vs protestants, but regardless, the fact remains that if Lewis had meant this to be an allegory for an accusation against the church, he would probably have had someone other than Peter battle Miraz, and definitely wouldn't have kept referring to Miraz as a usurper of the throne. Miraz is a heretic who needs to be put into his place. That's how I read this allegory, which might as well be a history of the early church.The victories of Aslan are sprinkled throughout and past the fourth section, but are so drastically different from it, that I list them separately anyway. Of course, the wrapping up of the story is left to Aslan, as always, but there's also a very strange scene, where he trapses through a town with a crowd of magical folks, and starts magically transforming it back into old Narnia. Desks and walls turn into bushes and trees, very good people join his side, and very evil people metamorph into brute animals or plants. The entire scene is simultaneously whimsical and gruesome; a rare feat in a book like this, and the reason for this is obvious; God (Aslan) divides people just like this. To the just, he's a dream come true. To the wicked, he's their worst nightmare.The allegories are harder to read in Prince Caspian than they were in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and I didn't really enjoy the book as much; the main reason being that it wasn't as exciting. The White Witch was an everpresent and menacing figure (at least at first.) Miraz is only in a couple of scenes, and even then, makes only a very small impression on the readers. Somehow, I just don't think that Lewis enjoyed writing villains, though he could do so competently if he needed to. I just don't feel he did that here.Regardless, this book is fair material for Catholics to read, though, as I said, not as good as the first. It's not all that exciting for the most part, but it has some fairly good things to say."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This fourth novel starts with the abduction into Narnia by the magic horn Susan had received in the second novel and she had left behind, lost if you prefer, of the four kids from the railway station while waiting for the train to take them back to their boarding schools after summer recess.They find themselves in their old Cair Paravel palace and the old treasure chamber where they recover their swords, bows and arrows, and other magic presents, except the horn that has been lost, misplaced if you prefer. On the following morning they save a dwarf to be drowned in the river by two soldiers who run away after a first and only arrow reached them.The dwarf Trumpkin tells them the situation. Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines from Telmar. The legitimate king Caspian 9th was assassinated by his brother and the lawful heir marginalized, and finally was going to be executed because his usurping uncle had just had a son of his own.With the complicity of Professor Cornelius he escapes just in time and goes back to the old Narnians who had disappeared when the Telmarines had arrived. He is able to rebuild some kind of an army, but the usurper is on his tracks and war breaks out. The untrained and undisciplined old Narnians under the command of Prince Caspian are routed in no time and have to escape and find refuge in Aslan's How, a sort of monument built over the old Stone Table where Aslan had been executed by the White Witch to resurrect afterwards.During these battles Caspian had blown the magic horn that abducted the four kids.With the help of the dwarf they try to join forces with Caspian. But they get lost on the way because they don't listen to Lucy, the youngest child, because she is too young, and yet she is the only one to see Aslan who has come back, because she is the only one to believe in him. Edmund will be next, Peter quite later, and Susan will be last and reluctant.They come just in time at Aslan's How when a bitter dwarf was going to call the White Witch back with the help of a Hag or bad witch, and a werewolf. They suggest to propose a single combat to solve the strife and that proposal comes from Peter who is the High King of Narnia, and many other things.In spite of all logic the usurper accepts the challenge and is on the verge of losing when two of his courtiers cry treachery, kill the usurper and lead the Telmarine army into combat. The battle turns to Caspian's advantage when trees appear and walk and frighten the Telmarines. These come to a ford where there should be a bridge but that bridge has been demolished during the battle by Aslan and the girls with the help of some giant ivy.The army is made prisoner and Aslan reinstates Prince Caspian on the throne as King Caspian X. The Telmarines are proposed either to stay and accept the new rule, in fact the re-instated old rule, or to go to a land of their own. We discover that they were able to rule over Narnia because they were humans, marooned pirates in some South Sea island where they had found a door to Narnia.Aslan builds a door in the air with three sticks and suggests that the Telmarines go through back to their South Sea island. The do it only after the four children do it first, though the children will find themselves back on their railway station platform and the Telmarines in their island.This novel makes it clear that Narnia can only be ruled by a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve. This simple fact has to be understood and it is not simple. These primitive populations of dwarfs and other non human humanoids plus all kinds of magical beings, beasts that speak and trees that walk have to be colonized by people connected to Adam, humans. The first kings were four children, then the White Witch, one fourth daughter of Adam, took over. Then another human race, the Calormenes try to take over, but the kings and queens are still the four kids. And finally here some humans who got stranded in Narnia had taken over and had to be pushed back to their island by the four kids.Does it mean only human beings can rule the world, this one or the other world or worlds? Or does it mean that the only humans can rule this Narnia world respectfully, at least for the general ecology of nature and life, and yet all humans are not necessarily good for that, respectful of differences and of democracy, even if the only form of government can be a monarchy? Or, since Peter and Susan are excluded for the next episode because they are too old, does it mean only human children can rule Narnia?That's the aspect of the saga that is most surprising and it can only be explained by the fact that this saga is written for children and the four children are the go-between for the readers to be able to identify with the heroes, the action, and Narnia itself. And the aim is to nicely encourage positive values in these readers, certainly not sever them from what definitely looks like western established ideas. After all these novels were written during the Cold War and C.S. Lewis refused science fiction, a genre for adults. He stuck to fairy tales after all.But could the same situation have produced a de-westernized story that could have accepted that non-humans could perfectly well govern themselves in a democratic and humanistic way? We will of course never know.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"\\"Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but when you look back everything is different...\\"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sitting at the train station waiting for their train when WHOOSH!

I liked how the emphasis was taken off the race of people, but their hearts (Miraz was bad, not because he was Telmarene, but because he was truly evil; Caspian was good because he wanted to restore rights to the citizens of Narnia not because he was human). Also, for those who weren't gung ho about the heavy Christian allegory, take heart! Prince Caspian still has Christian themes, but it is nowhere nears as obvious as in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.I liked some of the growth we see in the four children. Peter hasn't really changed that much--he is still the take charge eldest, but Susan has a hint of what is to come and while I don't like where her character is going, I do appreciate the foreshadowing. Edmund has really matured; I think the scenes where he is the only one to back up Lucy were very poignant especially in light of his actions in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. And even Lucy doesn't come off as the epitome of perfection, which I appreciated.As always, Lewis continues to describe his land beautifully and populate it with interesting beings. I liked how Cair Paravel had become deserted and the landscape of Narnia had changed drastically.And since I listened to this on audiobook, I wanted to commend Lynn Redgrave on the narrating. I'll admit, I wasn't fond of all the voices she used, but her voice was definitely gentle on the ears.I Didn't Like:It's funny; as I relisten to these books, I begin to recall how when I first heard them (in my teens) I thought they were boring and dull. In many ways, over a dozen years later, my thoughts really haven't changed.A large portion of Prince Caspian is spent in the dreaded flashback. Four chapters are basically a story a dwarf tells the four children about Caspian. I am just not fond of this device; if it is that important, it needs to be SHOWN not reTOLD (and yes, Lord of the Rings has the similar problem with the chapter that never ends, \\"Elrond's Council\\"). It would have been much better, in my opinion, to just tell Caspian's story THEN have the children transport to Narnia (somewhat how the movie did it).Storywise, not a whole lot happens. Yet again, the children tend to be mostly bystanders in the conflict or the catalyst instead of actively getting involved. This isn't as bad as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, as Peter does have a duel with Miraz, but most of the conflict is resolved in the end by Aslan's appearance. I'm still not quite sure what the point of having the children there was in the first place. A lot of the story is hampered with Prince Caspian visiting all these animals, explaining his claim to the throne, and them immediately saying, \\"I'm on board!\\" Absolutely no tension whatsoever.Another thing I didn't care for was the almost complete lack of conflict. Peter has no trouble handing off the crown to Caspian. Caspian immediately believes all the stories about Narnia and has no troubles with four monarchs returning to help him. The \\"good\\" animals jump immediately at the chance to join Caspian's army. The conflict about Lucy seeing Aslan was one of the few exceptions and was welcome. I think it's possible to write a novel for young people without dumbing down the character interactions and taking away all complexities.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.Caspian's aunt has a baby.Peter has a duel with Miraz; there are several battles, but if you blink, you'll miss them.Overall:This is going to sound weird, but I found Prince Caspian boring and interesting at the same time. Interesting story told in a boring way. However, that is for a jaded almost 30 year old; maybe if I had read this as a young child or was reading to a young child, I wouldn't overthink it. As it is, it's still a decent story and mildly entertaining.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This is the second book in the Narnia series, and it is almost as good as the first. There are three things I really liked about it.The first is how Lucy is able to discern Aslan before the others do and leads them until he becomes visible. This a great way to explain both a preacher's role in guiding others to Christ and a way to highlight the things that small children are aware of that we often miss. It is a good reminder, and a great part of the story.The second aspect that I liked about this book is the timeframe of it. 1,000 or so years have passed in Narnia time since the first book. As we look at the world through the Pevensies eyes, much has changed for the worse. Just as the children try to right the wrongs they see and turn back the clock, Christians must do the same in our realm and pray Christ restores order to the world.The third aspect I really enjoyed about this book is harder to describe . . . but I really like how Lewis gets away with writing this book exactly how he wants to. Lewis uses white magic, black magic, dryads, dwarves, wood goddesses, and even introduces Bromios and his maenads as part of Aslan's army in the eleventh chapter. I love that Lewis was able write this as he wanted, to speak with clarity and courage and put things on paper that would never fly if it were written today. Its refreshing to read Christian fiction that defies the boundaries of religiosity and really dives into true Christianity. Its hard to imagine a modern Christian writer getting way with half as much as Lewis does . . . we don't even let the secular authors like J.K. Rowling off the hook these days.For the young, this is an exciting adventure tale that is told masterfully. For the mature, it is a fascinating and refreshing blend of theology and story. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"My fellow classic and fantasy readers, here is the book you've been waiting to read!This book has a great representation of a secret world. It's about four children called Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who, in The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe, stepped into a wardrobe and explored a wondrous fantasy world called Narnia. Now, one year later, the four children find themselves in Narnia -again. They find that in Narnia many years have passed since their adventures. They shelter a dwarf who tells them a tale of a young prince called Caspian, and venture out into the now very different world of Narnia.When I thought there would be sanctuary for the children to settle down and rest, or a trustworthy friend to depend on, or strong aid to help them on their quest, there was trouble and destruction where there should be peace. The children are always adventuring, and that is a reason not to put down this unpredictable, suspenseful book, and that's also why I like it. WAIT-why am I giving this all away. I suggest that you read the book!"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia has always been an exceptional children's book series, and Prince Caspian is not an exception. Written by Clive Staple Lewis in 1949, this children's book was part of a famous series that is known by many people. The book is a fantastic allegory for following in your walk with Jesus Christ after becoming a Christian. However, C.S. Lewis is a writer who appeals to all religions as well as all ages. The title doesn't do much justice for the book at all, since the Prince is a minor character. Perhaps Return to Narnia would fit better.The book begins with the four children of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (whose names are Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy) coming back to the magical land of Narnia filled with mythical creatures. They happen to come back 1300 years after the Narnia of the earlier book, and also in the middle of a war between the old Narnians and a tyrant ruler of the Telmarines that wants to kill them all. Now the children must join the rebel Telmarine Prince Caspian in an effort to retake Narnia.The fact that I just summarized the first half of the book is a testament to the length of this book; it's short, requiring less than three hours to read. This does nothing to make the book any less enjoyable though. The book is delightfully simple as well, C.S. Lewis's writing style is easy to understand, but has a strange prose feel that reaches deeper than most writers today can comprehend. The theme is quite easy to understand, and it discusses having a belief in God, represented by Aslan, a majestic lion who represents the messiah Jesus Christ in the Bible. Throughout the book the children must learn to depend on Aslan, and not themselves. The book is a great allegory for Christian faith, and even a child can understand the implications.The characters can be interesting as well, excluding Caspian, who is a young prince who leads the old Narnians in a battle, and that's about it...he has little dialogue, but he is shadowed by the four children. The children all have their own personalities, and are extremely likable, except Susan who, like doubting Thomas of the Bible, won't believe what she can't see including Aslan himself. If you plan to read the entire series remember that fact, it's important. Peter and Lucy have remained relatively unchanged. However, the change in Edmund, the sibling who betrayed his sibling in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, is also a great aspect, and is a delight to watch. Newcomers Trumpkin and Reepicheep, who are a dwarf and a fighting talking mouse respectively, bring in two amazingly well developed characters that are delightful in every aspect.Although it may pale in comparison to other books in the series, I have no real complaints about this book, maybe it's a little too short, but it really shows the theme of the story well, and spins a great and epic tale. If you like any sort of fiction at all, be sure to read Prince Caspian. It's certainly entertaining and deep with insight, and I don't even need to day \\"for a children's book\\".4.5 stars out of 5"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"PRINCE CASPIAN sees the four Pevensie children whisked away to the magical realm of Narnia where the four of them reigned as kings and queens for many years. Though only a year later for them, many eons have passed since the hunting of the White Stag at the end of the previous book.Cair Paravel is now in ruins and disrepair. The entire island in which it sits is deserted and thought by the inhabitants of Narnia to be haunted. Therefore none of the now-ruling class of Narnians -- Telmarines, humans originally from our world -- venture there unless to execute some criminal, rebel, or perpetuator of the old myths of four human children enthroned at Cair Paravel and a magical, mystical Lion named Aslan.And such was the case when our four heroes rescued a dwarf named Trumpkin from the hands of his Telmarine captors. Trumpkin then relates the exciting tale of Prince Caspian the rightful heir to the throne of Narnia and a classic tale of a jealous uncle, usurped authority, impending doom, and the possible return of the golden age of Narnia.PRINCE CASPIAN is every bit as enjoyable and addictive as THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE. Each page is as entertaining and captivating as the one before. And what so many people miss when reading these books is C.S. Lewis not only weaved some wonderful children's yarns but also threw in some hard-core theology and did so in such a way that even a child could understand."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"\\"Prince Caspian\\" is very good and very exciting. You find yourself wishing you could travel to Narnia! Near the end there is so much strange magic happening it's kind of ridiculous, but it's okay, because all of it is for good. It's wonderful when Caspian's childhood nurse is reunited with him. There are so many different moods in this small book: happiness, anger, sadness, fright, and bravery. You see different beliefs in this book: belief and disbelief in the days of Old Narnia. Then there are the Telmarines, who seem to believe in the days of Old Narnia, but they don't want to. As Prince Caspian is delivered the shocking news that King Miraz will probably kill him so that he is no longer heir to the throne, Cornelius already has a plan in his mind to keep the prince from danger. You soon find out what has happened to Queen Susan's horn; Doctor Cornelius had found it after years of magic spells and terrors. He hands it to Caspian.\\"That,\\" said Doctor Cornelius, \\"is the greatest and most sacred treasure of Narnia. Many terrors I endured, many spells did I utter, to find it, when I was still young. It is the magic horn of Queen Susan herself which she left behind her when she vanished from Narnia at the end of the Golden Age. It is said that whoever blows it shall have strange help--no one can say how strange. It may have power to call Queen Lucy and King Edmund, and Queen Susan and the High King Peter back from the past and they will set all to rights. It may be that it will call up Aslan himself. Take it, King Caspian: but do not use it except at your greatest need.\\"It turned out the horn had the power to call back both the Kings and Queens of Old and Aslan. I very much recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Narnia.

I would have liked to have seen a little more interaction between Caspian and Peter, and a more detailed battle sequence at the end."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"All of the stories in C.S. Lewis' excellent Chronicles of Narnia series are told in distinctly different ways. Prince Caspian could justifiably be said to be like an epic poem told in prose. It shares many qualities with other epics; most notably its beginning coming in the middle of the action. Prince Caspian, like other epics, contains a climactic battle. However, Prince Caspian (like all great epics) is not simply a book about battles. The great themes of Prince Caspian are those of awakenings, renewal and restoration.As the book opens, the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy) are suddenly called back to the magical land of Narnia from a British rail station. They return to find that the land of Narnia is suffering from the oppression of the evil Telmarine King Miraz who rules with an iron fist. The king's nephew, (and son of the murdered rightful king) Caspian, has discovered the truth about Narnia and has fled the palace in fear of his life. In his flight, Caspian encounters some \\"old Narnians\\" who used to live freely before the Telmarines came to rule Narnia. Under the Telmarines, the old Narnians have been facing extermination. After initial mistrust, the old Narnians agree to stand with Caspian in an attempt to reclaim his rightful throne from his uncle and to save those that are left of the old Narnians from certain death. A struggle then ensues.It is in the middle of this struggle that the Pevensies are called back to Narnia, where they once ruled as Kings and Queens. They encounter Caspian's loyal friend Trumpkin the dwarf. Trumpkin relates Caspian's story to them. The children agree to help Caspian. Together, the dwarf and the children set off to come to Caspian's aid.It is on this journey that the Pevensies and Trumpkin learn the old lesson that \\"The mind of man plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps.\\" (Proverbs 16:9) Forced to take a different route back to Caspian's camp than the one Trumpkin took from it, the children and the dwarf become confused and lost. They strive to the utmost limits of their human strength and find that it is not enough. It is in the darkest hour of this struggle that Lucy thinks she sees something on the horizon...a Lion.What follows is a test of Faith for all involved. Lucy, being the youngest of the children and possessing the most \\"child-like\\" faith, overcomes her doubts. She is then visited by the Great Lion Himself, Aslan (Lewis' allegorical representation of Jesus). In one of my favorite scenes in all of the Narnia books, Aslan and Lucy discuss the lack of faith shown by the others and what must be done:\\"Now child,\\" said Aslan, when they had left the trees behind them, \\"I will wait here. Go and wake the others and tell them to follow. If they will not, then you at least must follow me alone.\\"This piece of dialogue is one of the reasons why Lewis is one of my favorite authors. In the span of three sentences in a children's book, Lewis captures the essence of Christ's universal call to be His disciples. Another amazing thing about Lewis (and another reason why he's a favorite author of mine)...is that the book grows progressively more spellbinding and instructive from that point in the story on. Prince Caspian is, like many of Lewis' books, a whole education crammed into a tiny little package--all told in a warm and humorous way. I encourage you to get a copy today. Then read it. There is a lot to be learned from this book."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"In Narnia, the land between the lamp post and the Castle of Cair Paravel, animals talk.

Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series and the 2nd one published, continues the adventures of the Pevensie children in Narnia. The story opens with Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy waiting at the train station to return to boarding school for the year where they are yanked by magic onto the shores of a strange forested island.Time, one must remember, does not move the same way in Narnia as it does in the real world; the Pevensies could spend 100 years in Narnia and return to reality to find that no time at all has passed. It turns out that hundreds of Narnian years have passed during the year that the children have been away and the Narnian world has been thrown into chaos -- the animals no longer speak; a new line of kings govern the land with a harsh scepter; the oceans have risen and the landscapes changed; the people have forgotten the ways of the old line of kings; and the stories of the old Narnia have been forbidden to be told. Beyond that, it seems forever since the last time the great lion, King Aslan, has been seen at all, and his existence has been dismissed by most as mere silly legend.This installment of the series pales only slightly to THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. The story of our four Narnian protagonists shows us once again that their identities in Aslan's Kingdom have nothing to do with what they do and everything to do with who(se) they are. Lucy is faced with the toughest decisions this time around, as she is asked to choose whether she will follow Aslan even if the people closest to her consider her crazy for doing so. I am struck again by the ease of C.S. Lewis' storytelling voice. While he may not deliver the most complex plots or character arcs, the tone and pacing of his language makes me wish I were a child again and could sit in front of the hearth and listen to his stories aloud.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This is not my favorite of the Chronicles of Narnia. Not by a long shot. I remember I didn't enjoy it that much as a child, and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was not much better when I re-read it last month. To me, the action seems quite slow-moving. The writing seems much more wooden and dated than in Lion. The early stuff when Caspian is at the castle, learning about old Narnia, is not bad. But the main journeying part is dull. Also, Lewis seems more preachy in this book than in others. I re-read Lion before seeing the movie and thought it was fabulous. And I am looking forward to re-reading my absolute favorite from when I was a kid, the Voyage of the Dawn Treader."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Originally published as the second entry in the Narnia Chronicles, chronologically &#65533;Prince Caspian&#65533; is published in modern editions as the fourth in the series. It is not the most exciting in the series, but it&#65533;s still an enthralling story. Through Doctor Cornelius, who has true Narnian blood, Prince Caspian discovers that he is the rightful heir to the throne and that his uncle King Miraz is a usurper. When Miraz fathers his own son, Caspian&#65533;s life is endangered and he is forced to flee. Summoned by a magic horn blown in this time of peril, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy re-enter Narnia. Only with their help and the ever-present guidance of mighty Aslan does Caspian have any hope of saving Narnia from persecution and oppression under Miraz, and restoring it to the kingdom of peace it should be. The climax involves a thrilling and decisive duel.As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions. Lewis intended &#65533;Prince Caspian&#65533; especially to portray the restoration of true religion after corruption. But it also portrays spiritual warfare, showing the importance of our sufficiency being in Christ and not in ourselves. As Aslan says: &#65533;If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been a proof that you were not.&#65533; (p220) It further demonstrates the folly of atheism and importance of living by faith and not by sight, since God&#65533;s invisible nature does not mean he does not exist (p.150). The notion of Aslan&#65533;s perceived increase in size has profound spiritual implications about increasing one&#65533;s respect and awe of Christ: &#65533;But every year you grow, you will find me bigger.&#65533; (p148) Such important moral lessons about the role of faith in Christ are typical of Lewis&#65533; style in the Narnia series..."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This is the second volume published in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series (and, in my opinion, the second to be read even though it is not the second in the internal time sequence in the series).

The children aid the young Prince Caspian to obtain the throne and lead the talking animals back to their proper place: once more, a battle between good and evil."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Imagine if you once saved a magical other world... only to return later and find that centuries had passed, and everything had changed.Well, since the movie adaptation of \\"Prince Caspian\\" is about to come out, it seems appropriate to revisit C.S. Lewis's classic novel, the sequel to his even more classic \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.\\" While it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, Lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.When his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young Prince Caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz -- and in the hands of Narnia's secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it's no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. Just take a look at successful, unique authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Garth Nix to get an example of how Lewis' stories have influenced the entire genre.If you don't like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of \\"Prince Caspian,\\" especially the second half. While Lewis's beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis's best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it's a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling. But this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. The scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.But Lewis' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where Aslan wanders around fixing life for Narnian subjects. Fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?Peter seems a bit more jaded than before and Edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don't get enough to do this time around. But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn't believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia. Definitely give it a read before you see the movie."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"I will confess, first off, that while I read this book (as part of the entire series) as a child, I did not recall the story line, or any part of it. I will also confess that it did not strike me as exciting as the 1st book (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, for us.) But, while this book was not as exciting for me, it kept my 10 year old son constantly eager for \\"one more chapter.\\"In the book, when the children (from The Lion...) are whisked away to Narnia, very quickly they meet someone who begins to set the stage for the adventure they are about to have by explaining some things that have happened since they have been gone. I was quite ready to get on with the children's adventures well before the explanation was finished.I am not saying that you did not need the background information, or that it was written in a manner that would bore a person; I'm saying that I was eager to see what would become of the children I was familiar with and who had just barely been reintroduced when the explaining begins.I believe Lewis started on the train station to better tie in this book with the last--right away he starts with characters you've come to know and, hopefully, love--but that is where he traps himself. Having started you off on their story, he breaks for half the book to tell you another boy's story.(My daughter just told me now that Lewis used the train platform to set up a theme of being drawn in--and that Lewis always felt that you saw things only from the \\"magician's perspective,\\" and not from the perspective of those whom the magic was done on or to.)At any rate, by the time the explaining is done, you are not only eager to be on with the adventure to find out what happens to our four famous heroes, but also because you want to know how the new boy makes out. (Only, now, you will have to wait a while to find out what happens to him. This reminds me of The Two Towers--how you have to wait half the book to find out what happens to Frodo and Sam and then read the other half about them while left hanging about the rest of the party--and I wonder what it is about second books in a fantasy series.)What I loved most about this book was what transpired when Lucy first thinks she sees Aslan. From there until the children are reunited with him, there is something in the way the children interact with each other, and in the way they behave, which shows that these characters are growing and changing through their experience, and it adds depth to some of them and a realness to others. I found myself even more interested in their well being after this section of the book.Lastly, we get to find out what happens to the other boy while finishing the tale of our four heroes. There is battle, the odds are not good, and everyone must play their part if good is to conquer evil again in Narnia.My son really enjoyed the fighting part, as most boys his age do, and he would always beg for one more chapter when we were done readying. If I said no, being forbidden to read ahead, he would pick up the book and read through the chapter titles and stare at the picture and review the story in his head (up to where we were) and try to imagine what comes next.And there you have it. While I did not like it as much as the first (The Lion...) book, I did enjoy a certain part a great deal. Meanwhile, the intended audience, my ten year old son, was \\"spell-bound,\\" so I have chosen to give the book 5 stars. Perhaps it is only a 4 1/2, but I cannot go as low as 4 stars, so 5 stars it is."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"&quot;The Return to Narnia!&quot; Those who have read &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (Book 1 in the original ordering) know that those four words can invoke a rousing and passionate symphony that only those who believe in Narnia can hear. It is somewhat disconcerting, therefore, when the story opens with a rather clumsy squeak. The four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, find themselves unceremoniously _yanked_ back to Narnia after one Earth year and many Narnian centuries of being away. There is no party to welcome them, only apples growing wild to feed them, and only the ruins of a castle to shelter them.As the children have been gone for so long, some backtracking is necessary before their heroic adventures can begin. As he did in all the books in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, C.S. Lewis gives us a bit of Narnian history that puts the present events in perspective and is genuinely fun to read. This History lesson begins with the Telmarine invasion after the Golden Age of Narnia and ends with the battle between Prince Caspian and his evil uncle Miraz. It's a lesson so absorbing and believable that it makes Narnia seem more real than, say, Bavaria. The political intrigue sprinkled throughout the book is a fine bonus.What I liked most about &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; was the chance to see the two Kings and two Queens of Cair Paravel in action. Their adventures and their characters were given very little space or elaboration at the end of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;; so I was glad to be able to really see them as their royal Narnian selves. (Now that I've read further, I can say that &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; is even better for this purpose. After reading &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, I discovered why King Peter was dubbed Magnificent; and after reading &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, I learned why Queen Susan was called Gentle; King Edmund, Just; and Queen Lucy, Valiant.)And what would Narnia be without Aslan? (I LOVE THIS LION!) In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, the major lesson that he imparts is that we must have faith and follow him, even when we may appear foolish to others. If we keep insisting that we can find the way by ourselves, then we only get lost. There are other morals throughout the book, most of them woven into the story, such as King Peter's courage in challenging Miraz to a &quot;clean wager of battle&quot; (read: one-on-one combat), &quot;to prevent the effusion of blood&quot; (read: the blood of his innocent subjects). Lewis can moralize better than any other children's writer I know.&quot;Prince Caspian&quot; is not to blame for being the second book in the series--therefore, the sequel that can't help but be slightly disappointing.

Overall, I thnk it was a good book!"},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"As I go through and reread these novels, I am remembering how I felt when I originally read them. Even when I initially picked up the books to reread I remembered that Prince Caspian was not my favorite of the Narnia books but I hoped to see something in it that I hadn't before. I did but that only added to my ambivalence rather than building up my appreciation. The subtle sexism is less subtle in this novel than in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Not offensively so but undeniably there. Of course, given when it was written it is not unreasonable to expect there to be some sexism. Just disappointing, I suppose."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"PRINCE CASPIAN begins a year after the events of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, the Pevensies' years in Narnia having taken only a few moments of our world's time. As they sit together waiting to catch trains to their respective boarding schools, without warning they're pulled into another world that they don't recognize - a deserted island dominated by a ruined castle. This presents a very serious problem, as between them they have only two bag lunches and the clothes they stand up in - very thin supplies for being stranded for an unknown length of time in strange country. (Lewis' own wartime experiences and peacetime hiking expeditions enabled him to write about such things very realistically.)Only gradually do they realize that this country is the familiar made strange. It is their own capital of Cair Paravel, after untold centuries have washed over it - enough to turn the peninsula on which it once stood into an island. As they walk through the royal treasury and remember what once happened - from years of chess games with fauns to the talking moles who planted the now-wild orchard grown up to the castle gates - there's a compelling mixture of fascinating nostalgia and heartbreak, remembering all the splendour of the years of restoring Narnia to a free and happy country now reduced to crumbling ruins, where even the magical gifts from the first breaking of the hundred years' winter have been abandoned to dust and silence.When the first humans the Pevensies have seen in this sadly transformed Narnia appear, they have come to murder a dwarf by drowning him in the sea. Rescuing him, the Pevensies learn that Trumpkin represents the survivors of old Narnia, while the humans represent the worst of the new Narnia, the Telmarines who invaded the leaderless country centuries ago and silenced its magic however they could.However, the new Narnians are people, not monsters - in the generations since the conquest, many have never learned of Narnia's true history, such as Prince Caspian, whose story Trumpkin relates to the Pevensies. Caspian, the only son of the previous king, loved the tales of the old Narnia he was told as a child by the nurse who was the only person who loved him (his childless uncle Miraz merely tolerated Caspian as an heir of his own blood). When his nurse was dismissed for teaching him such stories, Caspian expected only misery from his new tutor - only to learn to his terror and delight that Doctor Cornelius was part dwarf, and that the old Narnia slumbered under its oppression but had not been destroyed. This is particularly well handled, and is characteristic of the difference between PRINCE CASPIAN and its illustrious predecessor. In THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, Narnia was a magical country oppressed by a magical enemy, and the Pevensies were isolated non-magical elements. Here is Narnia is a disenchanted land where magic has been smothered, and the humans have done almost as much damage to themselves, with lies to explain why they fear the sea from which Aslan always entered his kingdom and the forests which once gave battle.Cornelius' hope was that when Caspian came to the throne he would not only be a good lord to the Telmarines but might unite the old and the new Narnia, waking the slumbering spirits of the trees and the waters and restoring the rights of Narnia in hiding. Their hopes have had to be prematurely put into action, however, as Miraz' queen has given birth to a son, marking the end of his tolerance for the boy who has a better claim to the throne than the man who sits on it.In helping Caspian to flee Miraz' castle, Cornelius gave Caspian Susan's magical horn and unwittingly sent Caspian straight into the hands of the old Narnians. Deciding this is their best chance, they have begun gathering for war to gain Caspian his throne and the old Narnians their ancient rights, and Susan's horn was sounded because of its magical properties of bringing strange help to whoever uses it - although the return of ancient kings and queens once more in childhood was something even stranger than Cornelius might have dreamed of.The War of Deliverance and the reawakening of Narnia do not follow the same pattern as the war against the White Witch, and may come as a surprise to first-time readers in terms of what does happen. PRINCE CASPIAN also has rather more complicated relationships on both sides than were seen in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, as both sides are divided as to their goals and how best to achieve them. The vicious politics of Miraz' court are something from which Caspian has been sheltered, but become more apparently later in the story - the Telmarines are far from being a united people under his rule, and several lords who helped put him on the throne are not blind to the fact that they could act as kingmakers once again. As for the Narnians, some have given up any hope of Aslan and have little use for humans, and have despaired to the point of allying with darker forces.Final points worthy of note:- Lewis' talent for writing superlative dialogue, as in other books, occasionally is most noteworthy for some of the villains. The council scene at Aslan's How - once the hill of the Stone Table - just as Trumpkin arrives with Peter and Edmund is particularly impressive.- Last but never least, PRINCE CASPIAN introduces one of the greatest heroes and chivalrous knights of Narnian history: Reepicheep, chief of the Talking Mice."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Prince Caspian: The Chronicles of Narnia / By C.S. of Lewis/ Harper CollinsPeter, Susan, Edmund, and Luzy are suddenly pulled into Narnia from their own land of England by a distress call from the Prince Caspian. Now most of the talking Beasts and enchanted creatures who once lived there in peace have been killed or frightened into hiding. Only Caspian and the rulers of Old Narnia, with the help of the great Aslan, can liberate Narnia and make it safe for its rightful inhabitants.Pirates of Earth's South Pacific passed through a link between Earth and the world of Narnia, ending up in Telmar, a land to the southwest of Narnia. They invaded and conquered Narnia, and their first king in Narnia was Caspian I, whose line continued unbroken through Caspian IX, father of Prince Caspian.

Lewis has a lot to offer to readers."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Prince Caspian, the second Narnian Chronicle to be written and the fourth chronologically, is a slightly longer, more subtle book than its prequel \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", but a book I enjoyed just as much.Waiting at a station for a train to school Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are whisked back to Narnia, hundreds, maybe thousands of years after they had originally been the kings and queens. Their castle Cair Paravel is in ruins, the animals are mute and the land is filled with Telmarines, a cynical people who don't believe in the great lion Aslan or any of the great happenings of Narnia's past. Narnia is ruled by Miraz, a usurper to the throne. The real king, Prince Caspian, has fled. With the help of the old Narnians in hiding, Caspian musters an army to fight Miraz and take the throne that's rightfully his. Can he succeed? Will the children be able to help. Will Aslan return?It's an exciting book, taking you far and wide among Narnia and its creatures. We hear a lot about the dwarves in this book, and of the community of talking animals. We also hear of Narnia's surrounding lands, and of it's constellations. Reepicheep, the feisty talking mouse, appears for the first time in the series. Other characters who appear that are worth a mention include the Greek god Bacchus (I love Lewis' description of him), the bumbling Bulgy Bears, the wise and faithful badger Trufflehunter, a frightening werewolf and many a talking tree. This book also sets things up nicely for \\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", the next and one of the most exciting books in the series.Author C.S Lewis was a sincere christian, and his beliefs shine through in all his work. Prince Caspian is no exception. Here, Lewis seems to deal with the issue of faith and belief. In the age Prince Caspian is set in, Aslan isn't visible, just as God isn't visible to us. There are a lot of people who won't believe in what they can't see (like the Telmarines) but even among them there are some who hear about the truth and are excited by what they hear (like Caspian). You can see the same thing when Aslan appears to Lucy and asks her to follow him, yet no one else can see him until they believe what she has to say. Another theme I noticed is that of how people respond to hearing about their savior. The Narnians respond in many ways, just as people respond in many ways on hearing of God's word. Some are cynical (like the Telmarines), some are faithful (like Trufflehunter), some are doubting and need to see some evidence (like Trumpkin), and some refuse to believe until the bitter end (like the mean dwarf Nikabrik).All of the Chronicles of Narnia are written for children, but I think some children might struggle through this, particularly during the war chapters. Peter dictates a letter in chapter 13 which is a bit verbose for kids, I thought. There's a bit of intrigue that might goover their head too. When I was a kid and I read this, I brushed over those bits, but I appreciate them a lot more now.Prince Caspian is fourth in the \\"reading order\\", but the only book you really need to read before this one is \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". If you enjoyed that book, you'll probably enjoy this too."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"This book was great. It had lots of action and adventure.

Lewis."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"\\"Prince Caspian\\" is the direct sequel to \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\"; the novel that was published second, but technically comes chronologically fourth in the Narnia series. In \\"The Lion,\\" the four Pevensie children become kings and queen of the magical Narnian realm and reign for many years, but when they return home they find themselves back in their child bodies, on the exact same day that they stepped into the wardrobe many years ago. A year later, the children are waiting at the station for their train to take them back to boarding school when they feel a strange pulling at them - and all of a sudden they are back in Narnia!But something is different - their beautiful castle of Cair Paravel is in ruins, and the land seems ominous and empty. Realising that the time-difference between the two worlds means that a thousand years have passed in Narnia whilst only one has gone by in their own world, the children feel quite lonely and displaced: strangers in a familiar land that has gone on without them. When a mysterious boat carrying a dwarf prisoner pulls up on the nearby river, the children rescue the dwarf and learn the story of what has come to pass since they last ruled the land. After their disappearance life went on, but in recent years the Telmarine (ie human) Miraz the conqueror invaded Narnia and drove the \\"Old Narnians\\" into hiding. The Talking Beasts and the dwarfs have scurried underground, the nymphs and trees have gone into a deep slumber, and Aslan has seemingly abandoned them. But the Narnians have one hope: the Prince Caspian, who was raised on stories of their kind and now leads a revolt against his uncle Miraz for the country's independence. The dwarf's tale links up his story with the children's', realising that the moment of their departure coincided with Caspian blowing Queen Susan's horn - which would summon aid to whoever winded it. Now the group head off for Aslan's How, in order to join with Caspian and defeat Narnia's foes.The story of Caspian is a somewhat patchy one as the viewpoints are continually switching and changing - first from the Pevensies', then from the narration of Trumpkin as he tells Caspian's story, and at one stage even from the point of view of two Telmarine generals. However, Lewis juggles all these narratives delicately, though possibly does a better job in the first half than the second. The trek of the four children to Aslan's How can get a little tedious, even with tantalising glances of Aslan on the way, and the one-on-one duel between Peter and Miraz is a little anti-climactic after some of the other vivid battle sequences that Lewis has described in other books.However, almost as compensation, Lewis gives us several moments of startling beauty and goodness - most prominently the sequence when Aslan returns and leads any willing soul - either Telmarine or Narnian - in a joyous revel through the countryside. There are other little touches like this, such as when Doctor Cornelius describes Caspian's mother as \\"the only Telmarine who was ever kind to me,\\" or Trufflehunter the badger quietly declares: \\"We don't forget. We hold on.\\" Most of all is Caspian's reunion with his old nurse that was sent away from the castle when he was only a young boy - I was ten years old when I first read this book, and I still recall how immensely touched I was at their reunion.More so than any other of the books, with the exception of \\"The Last Battle\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\" is tinged with heavy doses of melancholy and loss. For the children to return so long after their reign in the Golden Age, to a world that regards them as little more than a fairytale brings home C. S. Lewis's themes of loss and the inexorable passage of time. Even though Cair Paravel is restored to its former glory by the end of the story, to find it overgrown and in ruins is as devastating to us as it is to the children. Likewise, the children's eventual departure is also touched with sadness - their reign has past and must be relinquished to Caspian; furthermore Peter and Susan are told that they are now too old to ever return to Narnia.But of course, Aslan is always the same and this is in fact the Christian theme that Lewis injects into this book. Each one deals with a particular Christian allegory or way of life, and \\"Prince Caspian\\" is predominantly concerned with faith. Whether it is the afore mentioned Trufflehunter who holds fast to Aslan and the old stories, or Caspian who would desperately like to believe in the stories, or the sceptical Trumpkin, Lewis deals with the matter of faith from several different levels. Even the children themselves are \\"tested\\", with Aslan only appearing to those that are willing to believe that they are in fact following him - again this alludes to the children gradually growing up. It is easier to believe in something when we are younger than when we get older, and Peter voices the question: \\"why does he hide from us? He never did that last time.\\" The fact of the matter is that he isn't a tame lion, and sometimes all we can do is simply have faith that he is there, even if we cannot see him."},{"Title":"Prince Caspian (Radio Theatre)","review":"Only in times of great distress may the true heir to the throne of Narnia sound Queen Susan's horn; its imperious summons must be obeyed. Our favoite sibling quartet, who discovered a fantasy realm at the back of a wardove (see book one of this extended series) are suddenly whisked away from a railway station, where they are to board trains to their respective boarding schools. Delighted to return to their beloved Narnia, where they ruled for decades (which passed as mere minutes of Earth time), the children are puzzled to recognizemajestic Caer Paravel--but in ruins! Ages have paased, but human greed, treachery and ambition are never out of style.Young Prince Caspian, the true heir to the crown, needs the help of the Four Monarchs to rid Narnia of his uncle/usurper. Even worse, men and talking animals alike doubt the ancient tales about Aslan, the mighty lion from Over-the-Sea, who sacrificed hismelf on the Stone Table to save those whom he loved. Yet did not die.Beneath the surface plot and childlike banter among siblings, defenders and scoundrels, SCL has included many references to Christianity--without mentioning God or Jesus. He also incorporates many mytholgoical creatures, which makes a curious literary blend. It's a challenge to provide equal action for all four kids, but young Lucy still enjoys a special rapport with her precious Lion. Sadly, this wil be Peter and Susan's last visit to Narnia, since they are growing up. Even Edmund redeems himself after his treachery in the first book, but can you ever truly kill a witch?.

Rhine and his colleagues at Duke brought interest in the \\"paranormal\\" out of the seance room and into the scientific laboratory in their program of research that began in the late '20's and continues in other hands to this day. It also put Duke University on the map of world consciousness. This book is the one that first took the work and its possible implications to a broad public, leaving behind scientific jargon but keeping the gist of the important issues. The work was fascinating, controversial, and for many an outrage arousing apoplexy. It still is, to this day. If you want to take a fresh look at what first made scientists seriously wonder if the mind had a larger reach than the solid, little skull each of us carries atop the shoulders, then dip in here. Don't be misled by the propoganda that asserts over and over that \\"it was all a mistake, flawed methods,\\" etc. In fact, all the important criticisms aimed at the work have received very serious and compelling defenses in the years since this book was published. If you want to take your own look at these questions, this is a good place to begin. Then go on to see how science tries to expel findings that it doesn't yet know how to digest. That is another fascinating story."},{"Title":"The reach of the mind","review":"Rhine reviews experiments on 'paranormal' phenomena, mostly done in his lab at Duke. Unfortunately his overly positive approach does not present an accurate view of the field. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis; to hear Rhine's account you'd think these were all proven. If a tested phenomenon has been reported positively twice, Rhine considers it verified, no matter how many negative studies have been done, no matter allegations of experimental weakness, data manipulation and subject and experimenter fraud.Not one of the phenomena Rhine discusses can be routinely verified under adequately controlled conditions to this day. If people could see hidden objects and influence events such as the roll of a die, Las Vegas would have been bankrupted long ago.Since Rhine's discussion of paranormal phenomena are so flawed, the later chapters on social, scientific and religious implications are worthless.If you are looking for Rhine's \\"Galileo wannabe\\" moment, it's on page 156 of the William Sloane version of the book."},{"Title":"666: a novel","review":"Ah godda love this book, it's amazing kinda reminds me of Tatu.

This lack of spelling ability has caused me many episodes of embarrassment and concern. I have a dictionary at hand when ever I write. I seldom send anything out without having it read by an editor, my wife, Nell.Given the above, I wrote Marilyn Vos Savant and asked her this question. &quot;Do you believe that the ability to spell is a measure of intelligence, education or desire?&quot;Ms.Savant's printed my question in Parade Magazine.

It summarizes much of the advice found in other books on spelling improvement and includes such things as a list of the most frequently misspelled words but contains no drills. As close as one gets to the usual content of a self help book on spelling is a personality questionnaire.Nearly half of the book is devoted to the psychology of good and bad spellers so it makes sense to determine if the reader has the characteristics of either of these groups.Unlike many books on this topic, the author has not only read the best books on the topic but has interviewed the authors.It certainly makes sense to interview the experts but I have rarely seen this strategy used as effectively as it is in this book.Although she interviews the Anglo-Saxon scholar who the president of the Simplified Spelling Society, she misses the opportunity to address any of the real solutions to the spelling problem.She does identify the problem as &quot;phonetic irregularity&quot; -- many words are not spelled the way they are pronounced.She follows up this insight with a misleading quote from author Edna Furness (p.119) &quot;Research in linguistics has shown that the English language is more phonetic than we realize (approximately 85%).&quot;All languages are 100% phonetic. It is the writing systems that try to record meaningful sounds that go astray.There is some statistical regularity in English spelling. Four spelling patterns for the 12 elementary vowels will account for 75% of the vowel spellings in the dictionary. [See www.unifon.org/uu-18ways.html].Most writing systems achieve a spelling predictability rating of over 85% but not the traditional one used to transcribe English. In English, knowing how to pronounce a word will enable someone to come up with not one but a half dozen orthographically correct spellings. Since each sound in English is spelled 14 different ways, narrowing the spelling of a particular pronunciation down to 6 alternatives is an accomplishment.There may be an 85% chance that one of these six allowable spellings is correct -- i.e., matches the dictionary.Knowing the basic code does help narrow the field and Vos Savant lists up to five of the most common spellings for 39 of the 40 or so sounds in English speech. She also provides some useful mnemonic devices for selecting the best alternative in the group.Other practical advice includes how to use a spelling checker without being overly dependent on it.This is a book that anyone with an interest in spelling will enjoy reading.

This book grew out of the author's exhibition Stills from Lost Films he prepared for The Museum of Modern Art.

The main focus of the book is to showcase numerous rare and wonderful full page photos of these films, and for these exceptional photos Lost Films is very much worth owning."},{"Title":"World Sings Goodnight Volume 1","review":"We used this cd to help my little one fall to sleep as part of her normal bedtime routine. Now that she's almost two and can fall asleep easily on her own, we use this cd for quiet time with Mommy and Daddy. The cd consists of lullabies from around the world. The songs that are not in English are translated in an insert. Our favorite song is about a father who wakes up in the middle of the night to soothe his teething baby with chamomile. The soothing, melodic rhythms are uplifting and fill my heart with joy and love because they remind me what a precious gift my daughter is. I think it is rare to find music that can fill me with that much emotion. This album is so good that I even listen to it without my child."},{"Title":"Stylish Sewing: Techniques for Quilted and Embellished Clothing (That Patchwork Place)","review":"Patricia Nelson's Stylish Sewing presents techniques for quilted and embellished clothing.

Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"The fifth volume of the proposed 25 volume Complete Peanuts series finishes off the first decade of the strip by chronicling the years 1959 and 1960. This was about the time that many Peanuts fans (myself included) feel the strip really came into its own. Charles Schulz had established his main characters (Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder) with their own individual personalities and eccentricities. He had relegated the other characters (Patty, Violet, Pig Pen and Shermy) to occasional roles and basically stopped developing them (all eventually became afterthoughts in the strip).In this volume, Schulz adds his first major character in several years by adding Charlie Brown's baby sister Sally, which ended up being a great decision as Sally later became the poster child for unrequited love (with Linus - you actually see the beginnings of it in this volume) and school anxiety. But even this early on, she makes her mark to the strip.The surprise for me is that even though I was familiar with many more of the strips published in this volume than in any of the previous four volumes, there were probably 1/4th to 1/5th of the collection that I don't recall having read before in my life. That is, for me, what makes these volumes fun for me, the 40+ year old strips that are really new to me. I know that the percentage of strips I will have never seen will probably decrease with each new volume that is issued, just reading 700+ strips in a few days will bring back many great memories.My only gripe in this volume is that the introduction by Whoopi Goldberg was not an essay as the previous volumes have had, but merely a transcript of an interview conducted with her. I think there are enough famous people who probably were affected by Schulz and his work who could make the effort to pen a few pages. Whoopi is a bright woman, but the interview left me with a feeling of \\"blahdom\\".Anyway, another great volume in a great series!"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Our patience is about to be paid off on May 19th. This will feature a quite transitional period in Peanuts. Snoopy will start resting on the top of his doghouse (he'll continue using his wild imagination, much to the chagrin of his master Charlie Brown). Blanket toting Linus has developed a crush on his teacher, Miss Othmar (\\"The teacher, the subject of schoolboy's fantasy...\\") and every Halloween awaits the arrival of the Great Pumpkin, hoping he'll choose the Van Pelts' pumpkin patch. Lucy finds a part-time job giving advice and \\"psychiatric help\\" for 5 cents (she seems to have a regular customer with Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown is about to be a brother and is ecstatic about it (he passes out chocolate cigars). His new baby sister's name is Sally. She starts out very cute and innocent, but will later become a consumate whiner (Charlie Brown taught her everything he knows!). She'll also develop a crush on Linus, who's too preoccupied with his crush on Miss Othmar. Meanwhile, Charlie Brown has a crush of his own on one little red-haired girl (we never get to see her in the cartoon strip, let alone know her name, but a few of the Charlie Brown specials would be a different story). And of course, Lucy is crazy about Schroeder, who's only crazy about Beethoven. Patty, who makes the cover of this Complete Peanuts, remains in the shadows of Lucy and, to a lesser extent, her friend Violet. Whoopi Goldberg has some poignant words in the introduction which I've read here on this website and she understands that part of the charm of Peanuts is that it tapped in on the things that make each of us sad or angry.Comics (which appeared in Holt Rhinehart and Winston anthologies like But We Love You, Charlie Brown, Peanuts Every Sunday, Go Fly a Kite, Charlie Brown and It's a Dog's Life, Charlie Brown) include Charlie Brown trying hard to fly a kite, kick the football from Lucy and win a baseball game. Lucy insults Linus when Charlie Brown awaits Sally's arrival \\"I wanted to be the only child but you spoiled it for me!\\" Snoopy becomes a boxer fighting with a boxing glove on his nose. Charlie Brown is asked about his opinion about dogs. When he praises them, Snoopy embraces him and won't let go! Charlie Brown composes a typically wishy washy poem (\\"Somedays you think you know everything, somedays you don't think you know anything..\\"). Linus, Lucy and Charlie Brown look up in the sky and share what pictures the clouds seem to paint for each of them. Lucy and Linus see their father driving off and think he's going to the store, thus beg him for comic books and candy. Charlie Brown gets insulted by Violet and Patty and says \\"I'm sort of a spiritual scratching post for them to sharpen their claws!\\" Above Snoopy's doghouse is a big icicle. Charlie Brown tries to get the timid Snoopy away from the endangered doghouse with a pizza (and it works like a charm as soon as Snoopy smells the aroma!). Even the crabby Lucy shows a little compassion for a change as she observes: \\"Happiness is a warm puppy!\\"To answer the last reviewer's question, I seriously doubt the Sunday cartoons are in color (though, that would be nice). Nevertheless, assuming you're as big a fan of Peanuts as I am, you're going to want a copy of this volume as soon as it comes out!"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Charles Schulz's inexorable neurotic parade of children as adults continues in this great series by Fantagraphics (also known for reprinting such staples as Krazy Kat, Pogo, Dennis the Menace, and countless others). Somehow depicting adult miseries, disappointments, and conflicts with children greatly de-fangs the somewhat less than skippy happy subthemes that permeate this incredible strip. And it hasn't lost its bite some forty years later. If anything, this series has slowly revealed the true timelessness of \\"Peanuts\\".Charlie Brown remains downright pitiable. No one likes him, no one ever did, and likely no one ever will. He demonstrates his \\"depressed stance\\" (October 19, 1960) after an onslaught of failure and ridicule. But he does manage to show up Lucy when she dons his shirt (February 22, 1959), though only in a self-deprecating manner. Any early signs of self-confidence (see Volume One) have nearly vanished by this point. But he never gives up even when faced with utter defeat (by this time the famous baseball games populated a lot of strip time). And then there's his struggles with inanimate objects. When he finally gets his kite into the air, it simply explodes (March 13, 1960).Lucy stands fast in her deep dominating neuroses, but she's a little tamed down from her earlier maniacal appearances (see Volume Two). Right off the bat in January 1959 she takes great pride in pointing out the faults of others. Why? \\"I want to make this a better world for me to live in!\\" And she continues her futile quest for Schroeder; whose piano continues to symbolically separate them. What's better than unrequited love? Hopelessly futile unrequited love, of course. Schulz depicts this brilliantly.Linus still faces the world with a lamb's innocence, only to get beaten down mercilessly by reality. This volume includes the first appearance of the Great Pumpkin (known by many from the Dolly Madison sponsored Halloween TV special that played in solid rotation for decades). But in 1960, Linus's attempt at a new popular mythology met with a bitter end.Snoopy continues as the fantastic centerpiece of the strip. He dances, imitates others, begs for food, and remains a little surreal. He even gets downright existential. On October 24, 1959 he sits in his dog house wondering about life: \\"Sometimes I lay awake at night wondering why I was born... Why was I put on this earth? What am I doing here? ..And then suddenly it hits me... I haven't got the slightest idea!\\" This very strip defies the entire traditional notion that a comic strip should deliver yuks alone. It actually inspires deep thought as well as laughter.And of course Charlie Brown's little sister Sally enters the scene. She's a baby in these strips, but she still falls hard for Linus (though he's not yet her \\"Sweet Baboo\\"). One depressing strip (August 31, 1960) shows her sighing behind a tree after overhearing Linus yell \\"I don't even LIKE little girls!\\" The very next strip shows her sobbing outright after giving Linus a good \\"Blah!\\" Sally's first major life lesson? Welcome to the club.Some of the strips further demonstrate Schulz's great sense of the absurd: Snoopy's head bulges with thirty-three marshmallows (February 28, 1959); the \\"Mad Punter\\" mysteriously punts footballs while little children lay asleep (December 12 - December 23, 1960); Snoopy boxes Linus, Charlie Brown, and Lucy with a single boxing glove over his enormous nose (July 31, November 6, 13, and 20, 1960); Snoopy gets saved from a killer icicle by pizza (February 8 - 13, 1960).By its tenth year \\"Peanuts\\" had its stride solidly set. This collection probably looks and feels familiar to anyone who grew up with the strip, because it remained more or less in this mode until its end in the year 2000. Most of the development of the main focal characters took place from 1950 to 1958 (of course some big additions are yet to come, like Peppermint Patty, Marcie, and Franklin). This book contains the culmination of that slow evolution. From this point on the series will show \\"Peanuts\\" at its peak (though some argue that the quality dropped in the 1990s). And though many of the strips will look very familiar to longtime fans, many of them will not. Those small but immensely popular Fawcett paperbacks from the 1970s and 1980s apparently didn't include all of the strips. So familiarity and surprise sit side by side when reading this series.\\"Peanuts\\" still remains one of the greatest comic strips ever printed. This series will simply reinforce that. And though the Sunday panels sadly don't appear in color, the effort likely remains much appreciated by the hordes of \\"Peanuts\\" fans out there. Continue on, Fantagraphics."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"What is happiness? On April 25, 1960, Charles Schulz, through his character Lucy told us: Happiness is a warm puppy. This immortal sentence is just one of the things that appears in the fifth volume of The Complete Peanuts, which comprises the years 1959 and 1960. As in previous volumes, we see once again why Peanuts is considered by many to be the best comic strip ever.In some sense, things have not changed from past volumes: Linus still has his blanket, Charlie Brown still can't fly a kite and Lucy is a champion fussbudget. On the other hand, things do move forward, albeit slowly. As original character Shermy (the first to ever speak in a Peanuts strip) becomes less significant, we get a new character with Charlie Brown's sister, Sally. Before she can even talk, she will have her heart broken by Linus, but don't worry, she'll recover fast.Resiliency is the key to many of these characters, none more so than the strip's centerpiece, Charlie Brown. Constantly luckless and often ridiculed by his \\"friends\\" (only Linus, and occasionally Schroeder, are relatively consistent in being nice to him), Charlie Brown, despite his glumness is actually the eternal optimist. He never gives up on flying his kit or playing baseball or even his belief that one day, Lucy will actually allow him to kick that football.Behind the deceptively simple drawing and the child characters (by this point in the strip, even the adult voices are gone), lies an often deep and sophisticated art, filled with wit and humanity. And like any piece of art that is great and immortal, it is timeless and as good now as ever, whether you're an adult or a child."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Each year for Christmas I give my husband a new set of theseHe loves them and looks forward to getting the each year"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"This is when Charlie Brown and Snoopy really got good. Great things happen in this book. Many firsts like Sally and the Great Pumpkin and many more cool stuff in this great book. Sally also falls in love with Linus and Linus falls in love with his teacher. I gave it four stars though because it is still early Peanuts and the later years were the best. I would give it five stars now but the computer won't let me. These are also the last years Patty and Violet as main characters. Although Violet will be main for the last time in 1961."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"The fifth volume of \\"The Complete Peanuts\\" covers the years 1959 and 1960. During this period, the four main characters are Charlie Brown, Lucy and Linus Van Pelt, and Snoopy. Schroeder, Violet, and Patti all have fewer appearances in the strip. Although, Schroeder has a clearly defined role which makes his character stand out more than the other two. Similarly, Pig Pen has a specific role while Shermy is a throw in character, despite the fact that both appear rarely. During this period, we have the first new character since the short-lived Charlotte Braun almost five years previously. Sally Brown is born on May 26th of 1959, we find out her name on June 2nd, and she makes her first appearance in the strip on August 23rd. We see her walking for the first time on August 22nd of the following year.There are some classic firsts which appear in this book. One is the first strip to have Lucy's Psychiatrist stand, in which she offers the classic advice \\"Snap out of it!\\" to Charlie Brown, followed by \\"Five cents please.\\" The Great Pumpkin is also mentioned for the first time in these strips. There are also some wonderful sequences here, including the impending destruction of Snoopy's doghouse to make way for a freeway bypass, Linus' crush on his teacher, Charlie Brown missing a baseball game to push Sally in her stroller, and many more.As with the previous volumes in this series, the index is an amazing resource. If you want to look up the strips in which \\"The Mad Punter\\" appears, all you have to do is check the index. The Foreword in this edition was written by Whoppi Goldberg and she reflects on her interview of Charles M. Schultz, as well s the role \\"Peanuts\\" played in her own life. \\"Peanuts\\" was my favorite comic strip when I was young, and it is wonderful to read all these classic strips again. There are also many strips here which were never printed before, so it is a great pleasure to experience them for the first time."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"It's a joy to watch the continuing development of the Peanuts characters through this, the fifth volume in the continuing series. You can safely ignore the 'introduction' - an interview with Whoopi Goldberg that casts little light on the Peanuts Gang or Charles Schulz. I have no axe to grind as far as Ms. Goldberg is concerned - she's a fine actress and an interesting person, but for a volume such as this, part of a complete collection, I'd expect a more relevant essay or perhaps some additional information on Mr. Schulz or his work.I will certainly be buying the remainder of the series as they become available."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"As they come out, I read and collect these volumes of the complete Peanuts, a comic strip that was so much a part of my childhood. Something of which I'm reminded every time I visit my grandmother, whose bathroom is filled with decades of Peanuts collectibles. I'm running out of superlatives to use to describe these volumes.In any case, in this volume you'll find the birth of Sally & the beginnings of her crush on Linus, Charlie Brown coming so close to winning that baseball game and ending up the goat (as Linus says, \\"of all the Charlie Browns in the world, he's the Charlie Browniest.\\"), Snoopy's ever-growing skills and \\"personalities.\\" In addition, you'll find an interview with Whoopi Goldberg as the introduction to this volume.All in all, a tremendous book. Read it."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"In the latest installment of the publication of the complete Peanuts Charles M. Schulz's world has reached the beginning of its glory years. All the personalities are in place: Charlie Brown the chronically depressed loser, Linus the blanket-clutching philosopher, Lucy the tyrant, and Snoopy as, well, whatever he's fantasizing about at the moment.Among the funniest of the strips in this volume are those dealing with The Great Pumpkin's introduction to the world, Charlie Brown's struggles with kite-flying and baseball managing, and Lucy's continuing passion for Schroeder. We also see the advent of Sally Brown and can monitor the gradual fading away of some of the original characters like Shermy, Patty, and Violet, who still pop up now and then but are no longer daily visitors. Fans of the great 1960s TV specials \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\", \\"Its The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\\", and \\"Charlie Brown's Allstars\\" will realize some of the strips contain dialogue and action that were later used for the TV shows.Its hard to wait six months or so between volumes, particularly when one realizes that some of the funniest episodes are still to be published, like Snoopy deciding his doghouse is a Sopwith Camel or Charlie Brown's conflict with the kite eating tree, but the anticipation will make the enjoyment that much sweeter!"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"Great for any comics fan.

The baseball themes are being fleshed out (complete with mass-quitting of CB's team) and the Psychologist's Stand makes its debut.What's most interesting is watching the beginning of Sally's crush on Linus. While the reprinted strips of before show Sally falling in love and Linus responding with revulsion, the new strips reveal some interesting tacks.First, early on in the book (in a strip that hadn't seen the light of day in the reprints I had read over the years), Linus actually expresses an interest in Sally, wondering if she would be dateable at 17 (when he would be 22). One gets the idea that Schultz actually wanted to develop a situation where Linus was in love but his object was unrequited.Later on in the book, Schultz hits gold: Sally falls, Linus is embarassed. While some of these strips are familiar, the section where Sally's heart breaks is new to my eyes. Towards the end of this book is a comic strip that is worth every penny: Sally sees Linus walk by and responds in a way that everyone has responded to a broken heart. Only Schultz could have reduced it to half a day's strip!"},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"A lot of people reviewing these Peanuts books quote the new things that happened in the year being covered. OK, OK, I'll give you a couple of things: Lucy opens her 5 cent Psychiatric Help stand, and it's the first year of the wait for the Great Pumpkin. This is the year that Charlie Brown gets a new little sister, Sally. Snoopy wants to go see her but decides to wait a few days until her eyes open. Is that enough to temp you?What I like is that so many of the books in the past have been small little books that had a bit of Peanuts but I've always wondered how many strips I've missed. Well, with this book you don't miss any of the strips for 1959-1960. By 1959, the well known characters are all here. They are all developed into the ones we love. Many of the strips look familar as they've been reprinted over and over. But many have not, and the familar ones are seen here as the semi-continuing story that makes Peanuts so enduring.I could continue praising, but I'm sure you get the drift. Here's everything from those two years -- 'nuff said."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"So many classic Peanuts themes and \\"devices\\" are introduced between these covers - Linus' first vigil awaiting the Great Pumpkin, the first (offscreen, to be sure) appearance of Miss Othmar, and the first appearance of Lucy's psychiatric booth - that the volume must and should have included SOME sort of article that put these seminal developments into proper perspective. Instead, we get a Gary Groth interview with, of all people, Whoopi Goldberg - and, yes, they take some veiled shots at \\"Dubya\\" along the way. R.C. Harvey, where were you when we needed you (to duplicate one of your fine essays from Fantagraphics' collected Pogo, that is)? Why befoul the straightforward intent of this splendid series with such tiresome left-wing bellyaching?The vast majority of the strips in this collection have been reprinted umpteen times and will be quite familiar to most Peanuts fans, but a couple of previously unseen continuities are present. These include a heart-rending tale in which Charlie Brown misplaces a library book and becomes increasingly convinced that he's doomed. (He ultimately finds it in the refrigerator, which leads to the question of whether any of the members of the Brown family ATE anything during this period - apart from the odd bowl of Snicker-Snacks, perhaps.) Sally Brown is born, and, rather surprisingly, takes three months to appear \\"on-panel\\" for the first time. Imagine a modern-day comic-strip creator displaying such restraint. Before 1960 is through, Sally is walking, clad in her soon-to-be-characteristic dress, and displays her first signs of (unrequited) affection towards Linus.It was during this period that Peanuts exploded into a national phenomenon on the marketing front, with the characters catapulting into our collective consciousness for good. More to the point, Schulz was shifting into his most fertile imaginative phase and beginning to contribute far more to pop culture than he borrowed from it. You simply can't go wrong with this volume, even as a stand-alone - for example, as a gift for someone who may not have much interest in the strip's formative years but might like to pick the series up at a point when it was rapidly transitioning into what we commonly remember as \\"the classic Peanuts\\" today."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"The best ever written.

They are great for roaming down memory lane. If you are a newer generation, you just might fall in love with this series. Not only do these comics reflect the age and times, so they have some historical significance, they are just plain fun, funky and funny with the kind of humor that hurts no one. You might even identify with some of the characters in this strip, since there seems to be just about every kind of character you can imagine except for ones that are just pure evil.

The preface with the interview to Whoopi Goldberg is also remarkable: it gives an unusual insight in Schulz's strip and characters, and it celebrates Schulz art as being universal and profoundly humane: although being a conservative, Schulz never pressed his points in his strip, and humanity prevailed on political bias, and Whoopi Goldberg recognized that."},{"Title":"The Complete Peanuts, 1959- 1960 (The Complete Peanuts: The Fifties)","review":"This book prints all the Peanuts comic strips from 1959 and 1960.

I think it's outrageous that those of us who admired Peanuts over the years and admired the fact that Charles Schulz was a man of conservative instincts who also was not afraid to use his strip as a place to instruct us in some lessons from the Bible should have to see this kind of junk from someone whose speciality is foul-mouthed hate diatribes toward anyone who isn't a raving leftist like her (to turn a phrase from this interview, Whoopi is the kind of person whose leftism trumped her humanity long ago).Do us a favor guys and get rid of these annoying left-wing celebrity \\"introductions\\" in future volumes and just let us enjoy the strips and let Charles Schulz's work speak for itself.UPDATE (8/29/06).

My objection to Goldberg's presence in this book is that this \\"interview\\" is USED as an occasion for her to get up on her soapbox with Bush-bashing that was not appreciated by me, nor should it be appreciated by anyone who has an understanding of where Charles Schulz stood on the issues. In this \\"interview\\" the tone is one of typical left-wing condescension in which anyone who has a conservative background or opinion must be interpreted solely through the supposedly sacred truisms of left-wing ideology. And that is what makes the introduction unwelcome and fundamentally dishonest in a collection of \\"Peanuts\\" strips.I stand by my characterization of Goldberg as a foul-mouthed jerk simply because that's an accurate one, and this \\"interview\\" only provides an insight as to what that just is. I only have to provide a transcript of her screed at Madison Square Garden from the 2004 campaign, or her public desire to introduce Lorena Bobbit to Bob Dole that she expressed on an Oscar telecast to note from where I speak when I use that description. And really now, \\"Suppressed Catholic\\" is my comment about Schulz using the New Testament in his strip inaccurate? I guess he must fall asleep every year at Christmas when Linus makes his recitation of the Nativity story and then says, \\"That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.\\" (LOL)"},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"I thought this book was ok but not the best in the series. I expected it to talk about all the characters and it did but once again evil stalks Kara and that sort of ennoys me. Yet it was a nice ending to the series. Emily, Adrianne, Kara and Ozzie go to Aldenmore to stop the Spider Witch from getting to Avalon. Though a sacrifice must be made. Ok it wasn't really sad at all for me. Well I could had been better and as long as people enjoyed then thats good. Everyone has a different oppion."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"This book is my favorite in the series so far. Kara FINALLY has some powers. Before I discovered this series I was boredly rereading the Harry Potter Books, waiting for the sixth one to come out.

It kept me reading ! the secrets sad but it's a good read for book reports! my teacher was wowed!"},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"I know I gave it 5 stars, but I have one comeplaint. Why Kara?Why is Kara the blazing star?It does not make sense. According to the other reviews, Kara is the least-likeable character in the Avalon series. And I say I have to agree. She is a selfish brat. And at times, she can care more about a concert then Avalon or her friends (see Spellsinger). Apparantly, most people like Adriane better. AND I AGREE!I've counted that only 2 books are about Adriane-and there is only one in the Web of magic series!Most of the books center on Kara. Rachel Roberts, pleasr write more about Adriane."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"This was an amazing book. The ending was a little sad though, I almost cried.

YOU HAVE TO READ IT."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"I loved Trial by Fire!

The Winding page turning book will keep you entertained the whole way through, and on top of it the illustrations are fantastic! I was looking for a interesting book that kept me excited and this book hit spot on! The girls take a spill in the dark and dangerous Aldenmor and find themselves on a life threatening adventure with Adriane's old friends, Zach and Drake.As well as a knew character, Dreamer, a mistwolf puppy. In the end this book will make any Avalon fan happy.Love,Obsessed Avalon reader"},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"i loved this book but i almost cried at the end. i wont spoil it but it was so sad. Even though it was sad it was totally awesome."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"Whoa!!!!!!!!!This book was utterly thrilling. It taught us a lot about Kara's magic (finally), though it still left some questions to be answered in the next series of Avalon books. Come to think of it, the mysteries don't just surround Kara--they're everywhere! But I won't tell and give away the ending. All I can say is that the time has come. The path to Avalon has been revealed, and it's avaiable for the taking to Emily, Adriane, Kara...and the Dark Sorceress, who's captured the mistwolves and is using them to attract the magic of Avalon to her! Not to mention she's manipulating Kara--again. Mainly, Emily has to heal the mistwolves, Adriane has to defeat the Dark Sorceress, and, well, Kara has to deal with Avalon. Those these three tasks may seem different, they're all a part of the same battle that must be fought to save all worlds in the web of magic. And, actually, Kara and Adriane work together to send the Dark Sorceress where she belongs, which is one heck of a shocker, though you could see it coming. Emily's hypothesis in the first book was right--when those two combine their personalities and magic, they really DO make a great team!This book was an amazing conclusion to my favorite series. Every Avalon fan MUST read it."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"In this book Emily, Adriane, and Kara go on a quest to find Avalon.

And i didnt like when she was able to go to avalon what about Adriannne or Emily? they deserve it more!! Anyway it was about them defeating the sorceress( Kara and Adrianne), (Emily) and destoring blackfire, healing the mistwolves and healing Aldenmore. I hope the next 6 book in the new series waan't talk about Kara more like she is not goood of a character."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"This book was the best book in the series, if not the world.Spellsinger wasn't that great, but this makes up for it. In this book, the girls get split up io different sections in Aldemor and have their own adventure, but togather they finally defeat the sorceress. Zach (yay!) returns and so does the Drake. It's very emotional in the end and I was crying(almost) with Adrienne. Luckily, Dreamer (wolf pup) was introduced and I can't wait to see what he does! This book is most definitly 10 star material. READ IT NOW!!!!From the first paragraph, you can guess that this book is all about Kara, but it's not. It's about all of them working as a team to find Avalon. An excellent closure(?) to an excellent series."},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"This is the final book in the Web of Magic series, but fear not, there is now a sequal series called Quest for Magic. I like this book because it has the most action and suspence since Cry of the Wolf (book 3). Everyone must use their powers in this book. They all get seperated when traveling across the Astral Planes to Aldenmor, Adriane and Storm the Mistwolf (my fav. group), end up in the cold Mts. of Aldenmor. Emily and Ozzie, an elf turned ferret, meet the elves they'd heard so much about from Ozzie. Kara and Lyra, a flying lepord, end up in an \\"otherworld\\" with Be*tween, the band mentioned in book 5. And once they meet back up again, they're on for the final confrontaion with the Dark Sorceress! Adriane and Storm are defenently my favorite characters, so my main complaint is that Kara alone is the one that finds \\"Avalon, the home of all magic\\", I think they should've found it together. I also think Kara played to big of a roll in Adriane's battle with the Dark Sorceress, Kara's intrusion in the battle kinda ruined it, I mean, maybe she could've helped, but she bassicaly was the one that finished her off. Adriane should have been able to do it on her own, or at least without quite so much help, she is the Warrior after all! But what no one can deny is that Storm was the real heroin of the story! A bit of a surprise, but without Stormbringer, the Sorceress's plans would have come to pass. Things don't turn out that well for Storm in the end though, it was actually quite sad, poor Storm... (If you are to sad at the ending, you could always skip to Ghost Wolf, book 3 in the new series.) Poor Adriane too... Anyway, great book, I would sugest reading the other books in the Web of Magic series first, but any fantasy fan should read this!"},{"Title":"Trial by Fire (Avalon Web of Magic)","review":"I must say it wasn't the best in the series and it wasn't the worst, it was perfect. I am a BIG fan of the avalon series so right away when it was out I so bought it. Anyways now with the story which is basically what we are supposed to type about, Emily, Adriane, and Kara now finally have to destroy black fire... and all have a major part to fufill(i may have spelled it wrong!lol) the prophcey and compelets their destiny. First of all Adrianne has to deal with the dark sorceress with Lyra as Storm turns into mist to save all the mistwolves from these crystals stored with Blackfire! She totally saves the day but... there was a huge price to pay for that. Kara well we find out more about her and she gets once again in this spellsinging spell and is in the sorceress cluthes. Basically the sorceress captures Kara to make her open these portals with fairy map given to her by firemental, to get the unicorn. But eventually the unicorn rescues her and she sadly goes to Avalon which is UNFAIR they all had should, not to mention gets her unicorn jewel!!! Well the magor thing, Emily has to destory blackfire, break the crysatls that contain the mistwolves and most of all heal the mistwolves with blackfire but has help with Zach and later the mages. Well I shouldn't really say they ALL complete their destiny since in book 4 heart of avalon Emily compeletes anpther of her destiny as well so she has to heal avalon later.

It was the way he walked that stopped her. There was purpose in his stride, his long legs eating up the distance.The only phone was in Gold Springs, five miles away. She sighed and decided to offer him a ride. Whoa! trouble was starting when he intoduced himself as &quot;Roberts, Joe Roberts!&quot;She was aware of the contratemps that would soon be raised when people found out that she gave the new sheriff a lift.Maria had been married to the previous sheriff, Josh Lightner and was being persued by her brother-in-law, Tommy Lightner, a bull-headed, bullying type of guy.When she allowed her son, Sam to meet Joe, they struck up an immediate friendship. She was very uncomfortable with being friends with Joe.Not only were there hard feelings in Gold Springs for Joe being appointed to organize a sheriff's department, Tommy Lightner was determined to have that position, but the people decided to give Joe the Hannon farm, a very decrepit, falling apart house in the hopes that this would drive him away.The Lightners seemed to think that they were above the law, that they were the law in Gold Springs. Then Tommy discovered Joe's past.Joe Roberts, at 40, was not about to be driven away and decided to win the townspeople with patience and dedication.What wonderful love story developed as Maria went to work for the sheriff to pay her bills and learned to live with the fear that Joe was like her husband Josh, a hero.

There are elements of the classic drama of gothic southerners, the powerplays and gossip of a small town, and the romance that blossoms despite itself. Elyssa Henry shows that love is part of the circle of life, and that everyone is subject to its law. The seeming coincidences that everyone notices when first in love are highlighted in this book, life-like in how people are drawn together by forces that could split them apart. I enjoyed the author's attention to detail, and vivid descriptions of the setting. No one could doubt that the story takes place in the South, and the tense confrontations between the traditional Old South and the &quot;yankee-fied&quot; New South are especially accurate. A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Family for the Sheriff (Family Matters) (Silhouette Romance, No. 1353)","review":"This was a nice, good, short read. I enjoyed it very much. The small town &quot;stuff&quot; that happened was very believable."},{"Title":"Teaching Listening Comprehension (Cambridge Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"Teaching Listening Comprehension begins by identifying and focusing on two of the most fundamental and pertinent questions that English foreign language teachers ought to be asking; What does listening to English in real life entail? and What problems do second language learners face when trying to listen in a foreign language? The introduction, which is roughly one fifth of the book, deals specifically with these two issues, with the remaining hundred or so pages being made up of classroom activity examples. Ur's knowledge, experience and common sense, and her refusal to lose focus of what we are doing and why, make each of her suggestions worthy of time and consideration, and her clear and non-academic style of writing makes for easy reading, too. Although Teaching Listening Comprehension is now somewhat dated (it was written in the mid-eighties), the pedagogical principles are still basically the same as they used to be. You may not want to try out all of Ur's suggestions (who would?), but if you are looking for a thorough and practical guide to the nuts and bolts of listening in a foreign language and how to be an effective listening teacher, and you are prepared to modify Ur's exercise examples to suit your own teaching environment, then there is much to be gained from reading and using her book."},{"Title":"Teaching Listening Comprehension (Cambridge Handbooks for Language Teachers)","review":"The first part of this book is dedicated to the general principles of teaching listening comprehension to language learners.

The other Love Languages books have a quiz in the back to help you identify your language, and that's right where I went with this book: to the back. I was disappointed to find no quiz in this book, but Chapman explains that teenagers would be quick to figure out how to manipulate the system if they knew that we were trying to figure them out. The book discusses the five love languages as broken down in Chapman's other books in this series, but directs them specifically at how teenagers are affected by them. I learned so much from this book about how to talk to my kids and that both of my teens are quality time people. During the course of reading this book, I've seen a change in my daughter already. She's spent more time talking to me, because I've spent more time listening to her.

It is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"The Five Love Languages of Teenagers","review":"As a teacher, I can appreciate what this author is attempting to do, and congratulate him on succeeding in the same. This is a wonderful book!Having worked with teenagers for over twenty years, I can say that understanding the teen begins with understanding their language; not what they say--but what they mean and understand. The author has done his research here.The chapters on the use of time, and the use of praise, alone are worth the cost of this book. We are reminded that our teens are not different people than they were as children, but merely older children whose needs evolve rather than change.Rather than summarize the book (which many others have done), let me just encourage the parents and teachers of every teenager to read this book and take the suggestions to heart. The author comes from a Christian perspective, which made me appreciate his findings all the more.For Christian parents who want to delve more into helping their teenagers understand the bible rather than trying to understand their teenager, may I suggest \\"Dragons, Grasshoppers & Frogs!\\", a youth-oriented commentary on Revelation.Again, Chapman's book should be required reading for every teacher, parent, and youth minister of teenagers. I only wish my mentors had sought to understand me in this way those many years ago.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"A Moonlit Knight","review":"This novel has the intriguing concept of a female knight. I thought immediately of the great \\"Fires of Winter\\" by Johanna Lindsay, which features the Celtic swordswoman Brenna. Alas, this novel cannot compare. It gets off to a good start but soon takes a wrong turn.There is nothing wrong with the character of Mallory, the heroine; she is indeed a kick-[...] warrior. However, we are offered glimpses of various characters, such as Queen Eleanor of Aquitane and the hero's brother Goddard, only to have these characters dismissed after a few sentences. They are supposed to play an important part in the narrative, but the author just shuffles them off as soon as they have served their purpose, and they never become real characters. Other cardboard characters include the hero's father, Mallory's rival Lady Elita and a couple of other disposable knights.Also, Saxon, the hero, is full of disdain for Mallory when he first sees her-we're talking serious dislike. We are expected to believe that the very next time he sees her, his attitude completely changes and he goes ga-ga over her. While this sort of conflicted relationship is typical of romance novels, it is usually accomplished with a little more grace. Saxon's attitude goes from one extreme to the other and never switches back at all. In fact, Saxon is so enamored of Mallory that he conveniently appears around every corner to save her. There isn't much real suspense, as we know that every time Mallory breaks a nail, Saxon will be there with an emery board to file it off. And sadly, the love scenes remind me of something from a teen romance novel (only more expicit, of course!)I applaud the author for writing about a woman warrior, but the overall effort is lacking in maturity."},{"Title":"A Moonlit Knight","review":"St. Jude's Abbey is no ordinary Abbey. Here young women are trained to be warriors. Mallory de Sainte-Sebastian has been trained within the Abbey walls and is a formidable archer. When she is called upon to serve the Queen, Mallory gladly does so. Assigned to protect and guard Queen Eleanor during the revolt against King Henry, Mallory works to uncover enemies surrounding the Queen.Saxon Fitz-Juste is surprised by the Queen's choice of warrior. Mallory is not at all what the royal court's troubadour expected. Her fighting skills are amazing and impressive. Her beauty alluring and irresistible. Saxon appears to be as concerned for Queen Eleanor's safety as Mallory. And he also appears to be more than just a troubadour.Mallory and Saxon's desire draws them together. But the danger at the royal court is increasing. And Mallory soon learns that with the Queen's life on the line, she can trust no one. Not even Saxon.I love a kick-butt heroine and did not expect to find one in a medieval romance. I was astounded to see one in Moonlit Knight! Mallory is a warrior in every sense of the word. I was afraid that her strength would over-shadow Saxon, but thankfully that was not the case. His secrets and intrigue made him every bit as strong a character. A true match for Mallory!If you enjoy medieval romances for the palace intrigue and steamy romance, you'll love Moonlit Knight. If you wish the heroines in medieval romance had more depth and were a greater part of the action, you'll adore Moonlit Knight. Mallory and Saxon are steamy, smart and totally able to defend themselves and others. It was exciting, thrilling and very romantic!

Sister/Lady Mallory de Saint-Sebastian is the best archery person within the abbey. Mallory will be the sister of St. Jude's Abbey to serve the queen and join her pantheon of heroines.The two King Henrys (father and son) battle to see which one rightfully holds the English throne and controls the destinies of all who live within their realm. Queen Eleanor is residing at her court in Poitiers. There are times when Queen Eleanor's guards cannot be with her. For those times, she needs a lady who can protect her. Therefore, Lady Mallory becomes part of the queen's personal household guards.Queen Eleanor's \\"Court of Love\\" is anything but what the title describes. The court overflows in subterfuge, gossip, and betrayal. When the queen's life is in danger, Mallory and her bow are there. Thus the queen requests that Mallory teach archery to her ladies. Of course Mallory obeys, but none of the queen's ladies are serious about it. They prefer to flirt with any man nearby. So Mallory finds herself protecting the queen, dealing with sappy ladies, and wondering just what Saxon Fitz-Juste is really up to. He may really be a jongleur, playing a lute and captivating people with his tales, but something does not sit quite right.***** Each book is a story in itself. This tale is full of drama and kept me wondering who Mallory could possibly trust in the court of snakes. The history of this knightly era makes a perfect back ground for the characters. The author keeps history straight, never bending it to her own whim, and this makes it so believable. Whether you love history, historical romances, or simply high drama, this book is made just for you! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"A Moonlit Knight","review":"As she has done twice before (see A KNIGHT LIKE NO OTHER and ONE KNIGHT STAND) Queen Eleanor d'Aquitaine visits St. Jude's Abbey seeking specialized assistance, a female bodyguard. Lady Mallory de Saint-Sebastian is the chosen one to join the Queen's guard as her archery is by far the best of those residing in the special abbey.Mallory is taken aback with the backstabbing and betrayal of those claiming allegiance to Queen Eleanor at her misnamed \\"Court of Love\\". One of them takes it a step further trying to assassinate Her Highness. Mallory risks her life to keep Eleanor safe. The Queen also asks Mallory to teach her ladies in waiting how to use a bow, but the frivolous females think that is a man's job and only go through the motions so as to avoid Eleanor's wrath. Mallory also notices lute playing Saxon Fitz-Juste, who seems a lot more than just a traveling jongleur; she plans to find out if he is a threat to her responsibility though deep down she hopes not because she finds him so very attractive.The third Ladies of St. Jude's Abbey novel is a delightful historical romance with the emphasis on the court intrigue of the era. The story line is action-packed from the moment that Queen Eleanor selects Lady Mallory and never slows down until the final confrontation between the heroine and Saxon. Readers will enjoy the reaction of the male bodyguards to the hiring of a female to join their ranks as Jocelyn Kelly provides another fabulous twelfth century tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Panorama de las Americas","review":"I ordered this book over a month ago and still have not received it.

What he is despearately searching for in this novel is the same thing that the Frankfurt School was searching for in their social philosophy: why this sudden and bloody collapse of Europe? And being Eurocentric, they also reasoned thus: why this suddent collapse of Europe, which is the collapse of Western civilization, which is the collapse of civilization itself?Loosely based on the lives of Nietzsche and Schoenberg, Dr. Faustus is a writer's attempt to extend the Faustian legend from the individual to society as a whole. It is full of reflections that can best be characterized as social philosophy: a mixture of doctrine, literature, history, and logic. Mann heroically attempts to be the old European writer, meaning, the conscience of the people, the priest, the judge, and the historical critic. And as heroes is general, he is doomed. Such attempts by writers are no longer taken seriously. Mann is searching for profound philosophical answers to existence in the rubble of Berlin and deep in the psyche of artists. This search itself, however, is caught up in the same drama that it wants to untangle. It belongs to a former era which, due to historical idiosyncrasies, receded from the European continet in a particularly grusome flow of the rivers of blood, the smell of burning human flesh, and the destruction of entire cities. Neither music, nor art in general can tell us why it happened and why it happened so drastically."},{"Title":"Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkuhn As Told by a Friend","review":"Mann's gorgeous, rich prose cannot save this dull, plodding tale from being an ordeal to read. The same density of language which charms the reader in the beginning becomes an irritant as hundreds of pages pass and almost literally nothing happens. Characters are well drawn, but in gloomy colors which evoke no sympathy. Not a single character stands as a hero; few are even likable. The narrator is a long-winded bore. In many respects, Adrian, the subject of this fictitious biography, remains inscrutable to the very end. Having loved THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN, I persevered to the end in the hope of finding something to make the time invested seem worthwhile. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkuhn As Told by a Friend","review":"There are certain myths that seem to center a culture, stories that define and create a nation's heritage. The Great Gatsby defines the central american mythos. The Brothers Karamazov centers the Russian canon; and without a doubt the Fausus legend is at the heart of Germany's entire history, both political and cultural. Thomas Mann's retelling of the Faust legend for the twentieth century rarely misses a beat in its probing inquiry into the nature of Aesthetics, Sexuality, and Politics. And while the central questions on the role of power in relation to morality and the limits of artistic freedom that are the center of the Faust legend are here, Mann also manages to bring originality and his literary gifts to this retelling. What is remarkable about this narrative is that it tells you as much about the narrator as our Fausus himself. The narrator, Dr. Serenus Zeitblom, is just as central to this tale. His relation to our Faustian composer provides much of the dramatic tension as well as a human element in the esoteric wars over the nature of artistic power. Mann is among the greatest novelists of our century, and this is an unflinching novel that strives for meaning while within the echo of the Nazi guns that are the testament to the power of Faust and the darkness that the human soul must resist."},{"Title":"Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkuhn As Told by a Friend","review":"Forget preconceptions about this book. This is not a dry, stylistic, modernist retelling of the Faust story, but rather, and more effectively it is an investigation of evil, how it seems to strike everywhere and when least expected, from the minor deceptions committed daily to a country being led to ruin by a megalomanical leader, and how evil is often inexplicible, random, hardly satanic at all. Mann is an author of ideas but he is also a master of description. The novel is filled with wonderful, dark, and thought provoking images and scenes. And although the devil seems to abound, a sense of hope rings throughout Dr. Faustus. Reading this book gives insight into the seduction of evil as well as the need for evil to be explained. A difficult book with great rewards, many of its images will remain long after the last page. An astonishing creation"},{"Title":"Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkuhn As Told by a Friend","review":"In Doctor Faustus, arguably his greatest book if not the greatest book ever, all of Mann's formidable gifts come together. Lying at the heart of Mann's concern is the central figure of Adrian Leverkuhn, theologian turned composer. In him all the warring impulses, all the contradictions of our age are focused. \\"Cold\\" by nature, inclined to mathematics and to \\"speculate the elements\\" as scientists do, he yet craves the freedom and unrestraint of art, specifically music, the most demonic of the arts. But the fearful complexities of modern composition and his own innate coldness form an insuperable barrier, he needs something to kindle him to his destiny as a great composer. This turns out to be the Devil, who in a memorable interview heavy with fate offers him a quick way out of his difficulties.The book teems with unforgettable images. To pick a few at random: the extended description of Adrian's sojourn in the Italian countryside, where he meets the Devil and his fate is sealed; the wintry excursion to the Bavarian Alps; the vision of the children in the choir singing a motet to Adrian, bedecked with rubies on their fat hands while little yellow worms crawl from their nostrils down into their chests in the finest diabolic style. The density and vividness of Mann's imagery, its capacity to fill the mind and linger there, is Shakespearean.Mann's treatment of his characters is sensitive, fine-grained, subtly ironic, and humanly engaging, with much wry humor. The amazing chapters dealing with Schwerdtfeger's vicarious wooing of Marie Godeau for Adrian, the piling up of layers of meaning and subcontext (including the latent homosexuality that runs like a provocative thread throughout Mann's writings), amount to a virtuoso performance whose incredible, sustained brilliance is rivaled only by Joseph's interview with Pharaoh in Joseph and His Brothers, also by Mann. Those readers who complain that the narrator Serenus Zeitblom is a tedious boor, that the other characters are lifeless cardboard cutouts, and that nothing ever happens, simply haven't gotten to first base with this novel.What then is the problem? It is one that Mann himself wrestled with and which for a time led him to consider the work a failure, although he was determined to finish it. The problem is that the story cannot just unfold naturally and tell itself. A certain amount of history, of context, is needed to motivate the character of Adrian Leverkuhn; readers must be made to understand why the problems he wrestled with are not peculiar to him but arise inevitably and are universal -- in short, our problems as well. This context-building necessitates a rather long, abstract, and careful development. With his daughter Erika's help, the original manuscript was cut extensively to leave only the most essential material, but even so this development occupies the first third of the book. Anyone interested in Western history will find it fascinating, while those who aren't will be richly rewarded for persisting, for the narrative pace, at first imperceptible, does pick up and toward the end becomes irresistible, like the final running out of the sand in Adrian's hourglass.Given that Adrian's concerns are ours as well, what are we to do about them in our own very different age? What meaning does the concluding high G on the cello in Adrian's final work, that abides like a light in the night, hold for us? When we strip away all the inanity, futility, and trash of our era, what is left? Not art, alas, for art is a finite store that has been exhausted. But there is science, which is unlimited and inexhaustible, and it is specifically the scientific aspect of Adrian's nature, his tendency to \\"speculate the elements\\", that is meaningful for us. Modern biology now offers the prospect of understanding and manipulating the essence of life itself. Will it just be more \\"devil's juggling\\", more falling down in the dust to worship the quintillions, from which Zeitblom protested nothing human can ever emerge? Can man be trusted to resist temptation in carrying out such a program? Can the devil and the humane even be separated from this vital substance? No one can tell us, yet the essence of the problem is already fully present in symbolic form in Doctor Faustus. This is the triumph of Mann's representative art, of the Artist way. As we continue on the precarious, ever-changing path of self- and world-discovery, Mann's book stands as a guidepost and a warning. This is the enduring significance of Doctor Faustus and the reason why it will always be with us for as long as we remain recognizable as a species."},{"Title":"Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkuhn As Told by a Friend","review":"Thomas Mann was one of the greatest writers of the 20th century and this was his last and perhaps his greatest novel. Reading it is a daunting challenge as it merges history with philosophy and religion with music history and composition. This novel requires great concentration. Sustained reading is however greatly rewarded. I am still mulling over much that is in this novel. Written and presented against the backdrop of the closing years of World War II and the horrors of Nazi Germany, the novel is also clearly a statement against Hitler and the Nazis, and Mann from exile was a determined opponent of the Nazis.

This is a complex and time consuming read from the great writers and a Nobel laureate: Paul Thomas Mann (1875-1955), German novelist, short story writer, and social commentator. If you expect to finish this book and understand it, be prepared for a test of will power: you versus the author. It took me over two weeks to read it, maybe three. Was it worth it? I am still not certain, but it was an interesting novel. The book is very complicated, so complicated in fact, that Mann has second book out in which he describes the ideas he had in writing Dr. Faustus.To quote another source, the following is a short description of the overall theme:\\"The novel is a re-shaping of the Faust legend in the context of the first half of the twentieth century and the intellectual, moral and spiritual destiny of Germany and Europe in that period.\\"This is one of Mann's deeper works. For example, it is far more complicated than Magic Mountain. Here he uses ideas of of Goethe, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer, then makes a fictional story based on the life of a composer, Adrian Leverk&uuml;hn. He uses this vehicle to describe the downfall of German culture in the twentieth century - to the time of the writing of the book in the 1940s. He intertwines politics, religion, morality, and music.The story is about a fictional German composer named Adrian Leverk&uuml;hn as told by Serenus Zeitblom. Leverk&uuml;hn has a complicated career as a composer including an unfortunate early infection with a venereal disease, and then a brilliant career followed by eventual destruction. How does he do it and what does it all mean? You will have to read it to understand the story and what Mann is trying to tell us.The book is set in southern Germany, south of Munich, but has a different feel and a very different set of characters than Magic Mountain. Also, there is a high degree of complexity and sophistication in Mann's detailed descriptions of the composer's music.An monumental work but not for the casual reader: 5 stars."},{"Title":"Doctor Faustus: The Life of the German Composer Adrian Leverkuhn As Told by a Friend","review":"In the showing the life of composer Adrian Leverkuhn, Mann himself composes a symphony of Germany in the first half of this century.

So that may well colour what you feel about this review.This book probably has a limited readership. Austen is still a popular author today - the string of recent movie adaptations and their wild popularity has proven that. It helps too that Austen's books can still be read these days and enjoyed without any help - after all language-wise there isn't slang and metre that puts people off Shakespeare - and her themes of love and marriage are pertinent to any age.Yet a companion like this is really useful for there were still little in-jokes which Austen uses - her contemporary readers would have understood these without further explanation, but for us we can do with a bit more background to the times she was living in. The most useful chapters for this are 7, 8 and 9 which deal with class, money and Religion and Politics. You don't need to read to understand, but if you want to enjoy Austen's irony in greater depth they make very useful reading.This is a neat little book if you are not sure if you want to read more on Austen either in Critical literature or biographically. It has 12 chapters in all which offer subjects ranging from the chronology of her life and work, to a good essay on her letters and style. I didn't much enjoy the chapter on Style but I was put off by the graphs in that one (don't ask!). You will pleased to know that this doesn't lack for academic credentials, but it isn't too forcefully academic. I don't think you would enjoy this book at all if you haven't read all of Austen's works, and some idea of their various characters.So, if you are looking for a handy little volume and a quick read on Austen, her life and times then this is very worthwhile indeed. Other books on Austen that might you enjoy are Claire Tomalin's biography 'Jane Austen - a life' which is excellent. Amanda Vickery's book &quot;The Gentleman's Daughters&quot; is a beautifully researched and written piece on woman's lives in Austen's time and of Austen's class (even using some of her letters)."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","review":"I used this book when I was writing a thesis on Austen.

Jan Fegus describes the publishing process of the day and narrates Austen's struggle to get her books into print. In the process, she details just how little money Jane Austen realized from her writing in her own lifetime.Carol Houlihan Flynn goes behind the obvious content of Jane Austen's letters to discover a woman determined to apply her rather subversive intellect to the mundane task of communicating with family and friends. The often wickedly observant Austen of the letters bears a close resemblance to the young and unorthodox author that Margaret Anne Doody finds in her essay on \\"The Short Fiction\\". Isobel Grundy, in \\"Jane Austen and literary traditions\\", finds that her unsystematic education caused her to find much of her own way in her writing style.\\"The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen\\" may be a bit dry for the general reader.

It also reveals the strategies adopted by the police to undermine or subvert this voluntary service, while at the same time asserting their support for it and claiming to be operating according to equal opportunities directives.\\"The author reports on the ways that volunteers from diverse backgrounds were able to co-operate in the voluntary services they provided, notwithstanding the practical and analytical difficulties inherent in using the term 'black' to embrace any racialised group. The book provides valuable models to other voluntary organisations, while demonstrating the far-reaching consequences of race in sustaining key social divisions.

The problem I find with so many of the other books in this venue, granted, classics in their own way, is the numbing recitation of desperate battles, especially if the author served on the Eastern Front. You can only absorb so many attacks and retreats before those events begin to blend together. Georg Grossjohann's is really a very personal account of his wartime service during which he saw some very close combat, but the Historical Commentary by Keith Bonn and Wolf Zoepf and the excellent maps supplied by the publisher suffice for the background and do not get in the way of Grossjohann's lively reminiscences of the men he served with in peace and war. Grossjohann was in the Reichswehr before Hitler came to power and the stories he tells about his garrison service are worthy of a book by themselves (which I understand Aegis is planning on publishing). Erwin the Only is but one, if perhaps the most memorable of the colorful, finely drawn characters Grossjohann remembers with a wry sense of humor throughout this book.

The authour has the rare privilage of fighting on 4 of the major fronts of the war and has a few useful stories both humorous and sad.The book ends w/ the authour surviving the war and avoiding capture until he is betrayed.

I found most interesting the social structure of the German officer corps, the talent of the commanders, the stoic attitude of the low ranks and the magnificent discipline which Wehrmacht troops show, even in adversity.

He saw and survived his share of combat. As is somewhat common in German memours, he talks of what happens between battles, but not of the battles.The book has merit if you wish to experience a little of how the German army worked. He was a member of several infantry units - in the early war years Germany created cadres for new divisions by splitting existing formations; later he was moved around to support ad hoc reactions to Allied victories. He always managed to get wounded or transferred in time to avoid destruction.The most interesting portion of the book, in my opinion, is when his unit is pretty much wiped out and he becomes available for other duties. I never realized there were &quot;bridge commanders&quot; or &quot;town commanders&quot;. Now I know.In summary, the book is thin on combat but has good info on the various duties and experiences of a combat offocer."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Herr Grossjohann is a very lucky man who survived the end the of the war. During the war he fought on both Eastern and Western fronts, in various outfits. He displays courage, intelligence and bluntness in his endovours. He gives the reader a somewhat summerized picture of his time during the war.This is a fine book, at the same time though, it depends on who is reading it and the depth of which that reader wishes to engage his mind. Their are few details in this book of the fighting, of strategic formations and the overall mood of his men. There are some parts which are noteworthy, mainly the way he talks about his superiors, their actions but nothing much beyond that. This is basically a very short version of what was his life during the war. Lacks in many details which in the book he says cannot say because they would take too long to explain. I am sure the author has his reasons as to why.Over all this is a fine book if you are a High school Student trying to write a paper on the Western front and especially the the months after Operation Overlord and the German Operation Norhtwind. Serious readers, who have a lot of knowledge already, should only pick up this book for curiosity, since it's a very quick read. I don't believe this book adds much to the other great War Diaries of the war. If you are interested in more in depth reading, check out: \\"German Boy\\" by Wolfgang Samuel and \\"Soldat\\" by Siegfried Knappe, are a few of my favorite books.I hasitate to say that this book should be overlooked becuse it does have a good story to tell but it is just told in a manner too summarized to get too involved with the writer and his struggles."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Outstanding book. Gives an enlightening view of German soldiers and their leaders when the &quot;accepted&quot; standard of their operations and conduct is something much more sinister. One who has not worn the boots may opine but not know the miles walked. Another review conerned more with book titles and wine speaks for itself -- alone."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"FIVE YEARS, FOUR FRONTS is a valuable book on several levels. First, it provides a rare look at what everyday life was like in the German army, under both the Weimar and National Socialist governments. Second, it reveals in great detail the character of the typical Prussian soldier during the Hitler period - someone who was brimming with doubts and discontent as to the nature of the regime but unwilling, by virtue of his traditions, to go against it. Third, it provides a platform for its subject, Georg Grossjohan, to vent his feelings about post-WW 2 books like CROSS OF IRON, which attack the German officer corps without mercy or honesty and which he describes as \\"cheap, trite, gushingly sentimental, and absolutely unrealistic trash written by entertainers.\\"As the title suggests, Grossjohan served throughout virtually the whole of WW 2 - in France, Russia, Italy and again in France during the closing stages of the war. The book, however, never struck me as a \\"war\\" memior so much as a discussion of Army life, a subject about which he knows a hell of a lot - he served 18 years in the German army, starting as a private in the elite 100,000 man army his country was permitted under the Treaty of Versailles, and ending it in 1945 as a major who held the Knight's Cross. Indeed, few if any books have given me such a clear picture of what it meant to be a soldier for Germany - the resplendant uniforms, the merciless discipline, the quiet sense of superiority and pride, the elaborate rituals and traditions, the suffocating bureacracy, the official-unofficial caste system, the fierce personal rivalries, and - near the end - a sense that the Supreme Command was run by authentic lunatics and that the people \\"up top\\" were more dangerous than the enemy. In addition, the Herr Major has a wonderfully earthy and cynical wit which he unleashes at every opportunity - many of the passages demonstrating that neither Prussian reserve nor Nazi discipline couldn't crush this soldier's sense of humor.A Prussain to his roots, Grossjohan has no love for the Nazis but repeatedly picks up his sword in defence of German officers, who he feels were scapegoated and sterotyped after the war in a flood of cynical literature. He writes: \\"The recipe for an antiofficer novel is simple. The cast of characters would typically include a brutal general, thirsy for glory at any price; stupid, incapable officers; a bunch of helpless, gentle, and sensitive soldiers; and some girls with whom the soldiers can engage in a bit of sex while on home leave. Now for the plot: during a surprise breakthrough by the enemy, the officers naturally fail completely. After having puked the stolen French wine, the drunken general is killed by brave Red Army soldiers. Only a young sergeant keeps a clear head. He gathers his scattered Landsers and leads them back to the saftey of his own lines. Throw in a hideous war crime or two and some anti-Hitler jokes by the enlisted men, and you've got a winner every time.\\" Grossjohan points out that 257 German generals were killed in battle or under combat conditions during the war, far more than died under the British or American flags, and that the standards for commission in the Wehrmacht were much higher than in any of the Allied armies. He wants the reader to get a fair picture of what the German officer was really like - good qualities and bad - and I think he succeeds.Where the book falls down is in its description of battle - Grossjohan doesn't seem capable of communicating most of his battle experiences, which were numerous, with any real sense of clarity or immediacy - and in the frequent interruptions by the narrator, a retired U.S. Army general who begins each chapter with a very military overview of the situation Grossjohan was in at the time. These interruptions were annoying becauseI got the sense that this book has been radically cut in length for the English-speaking market, and I wanted such pages as survived the editing process to be from Grossjohan's POV and not the narrator's.In sum, if you are looking for a red-hot combat memior with lead flying on every page, FIVE YEARS, FOUR FRONTS is not for you; if you want a clearer understanding of the life and mind-set of a German officer in and out of battle, I would strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"This is a very good and serious book because of its uniqueness. Also, it is well written and blends history with an interesting personal account.This engaging, introspective memoir offers insight into the thinking and attitudes of a Wehrmacht officer and also gives real insight into the way the German Army operated on different fronts under (quite) different conditions (Poland, France 1940, Russia and Western Front 1944). Five years of frontline life out of 17 years of military career.As is the case with many German authors, the main part of the book deals with the campaign and fierce battles on the Eastern Front (\\"the Real War\\", to quote Grossjohann) where the flower of the Wehrmacht perished.In some cases (Chapter 11) the author wrote some accounts about Germany's Allies and the situation in Romania 1944 (page 88-93).The final chapter deals with Grossjohann's sad \\"Discharge from the Army\\" while the Epilogue described the bitter conditions in the postwar Germany.There are 6 pages of B&W; photos and 28 simple maps, together with two comprehensive appendices and an index.Overall, this book, aside from being a fascinating look into pre and wartime Germany, it is very well written and very readable.I'd recommend this book for anyone who's fascinated by what really happened in World War II from a German point of view."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"I thought the book was very insightful, but I would liked to have a better feeling of how his units conflicts and battles fit into the larger picture"},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"\\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" by Georg Grossjohann is a solid four stars. A better book is \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\", but that book is about a simple drafted soldier. Major Grossjohann is a \\"lifer\\" in the Deutsche Heer.Personally, I really liked his recollections of the days of the pre-WWII German Army. It's quite like the US Army but it's different on a few levels. Note, a sergeant goes around stabbing privates in the butt with his thumb. He is trying to catch soldiers not standing at attention correctly. \\"Keep that coffee bean tight he screams at his soldiers!\\" This just sounds weird to modern readers but gives a good view into the mind of that generation.Major Grossjohann starts his military career as a simple private in the German Army. After a while he is trained to higher levels in the Heer and eventually gets a commission in the German Army. Grossjohann has the misfortune of having a commanding officer who does not like him. So, he can't get promoted with his peers. A result is he has the doubious honor of being the highest date-of-rank captain in the German Army in 1940 after a near 15 years of service. A note to new US Army Lieutenants: don't tell your commander what an idiot he is during field exercises.Grossjohann is in the Polish campaign. He sees action against the French Army and their fort system works as designed when attacked at strong points. Indeed, if the French had extended the line from the English Channel to past the Ardennes it's doubtful Germany could have cracked that tough nut.The book is very readable. I gave it to a friend and he finished the book in less than two days in his part time reading.One way that the military experences of Grossjohann is like a regular US Army officer is he spends the time of March to the end-of-the-war in a military professional development course. He was being groomed by the German Army to be a full colonel and a regimental commander.This is a good book. I recommend it because it will show a good company commander in action."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Another first person account that is no longer in my collection of German soldier memior's. A very boring book that lack's any kind of specific detail.A book of small overview's is all it is. Beter off buying book's like Infantry Ace's or Forgotten Soldier."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Georg Grosjohann's slim memoir really adds very little to the plethora of first-hand accounts by German soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought in WWII. It is pedestrian in style and tone (or at least the English translation is), and actually very limited in scope. The author, who already had 12 years' experience as a German soldier before Germany invaded Poland, surprisingly has comparatively few battle experiences to tell when compared with some of the more well-known soldier-authors.In addiiton, if one hopes to find clues as to how German soldiers may have slowly changed in their attiudes about Hitler as the war progressed, they won't be found in Grossjohann's book. He remains here a supporter of Der Fuhrer, and has nohing but disdain for those who withdrew their support from the German leader later in or after the war. Grosshohann wryly notes how the numbers of Germans who actively opposed Hitler seemed to magically grow for years after the war's end, and mockingly asks how in the world Hitler ever came to power in the first place with so many claining to have opposed him. But Grossjohann seems more angry and bitter at the weakness of disloyal Nazis than amused at the human weakness displayed in their dishonesty and self-interestAs for the book itself, far more enlightening, interesting and well-written are the accounts of Guy Sajer, Siegfried Knappe and Hans von Luck, just to name a few. Each has far more combat experiences to share than Grossjohann; each is a more lively and engaging writer; and none is burdened with the inabilty to honestly recount and assess the actions of Nazi Germany and the men who fought for it."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"\\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" by Georg Grossjohann is a fabulous look into the life of a young Wehrmacht officer from his time before the outbreak of WWII to its end. Unlike many books that are similarly dedicated to the views from a single soldier, those of Grossjohann are steeped in broad vision. For example, while individual battles are discussed Grossjohann places them squarely within the context of the overall theatre of operations, making them more than personal snippets of information. Amazingly, despite this broad perspective, Grossjohann does not get trapped into the position of defending or apologizing for actions of the whole German war machine. This is a refreshing change from the plethora of recent Axis biographies that have emerged in recent years. A reader can enjoy Grossjohann's journey in proper context without feeling disgust, anger or pity. Rather one can walk away feeling one has gotten a rare glimpse into the life of a truly honest and fair soldier who fought bravely for his country - in this case a German rather than Allied soldier. Quite an amazing experience actually!While \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" does in fact cover (at least) five years and four fronts (as Grossjohann traverses back and forth across Euro-Asia moving from command to command and up through the lower ranks of the Wehrmacht) readers will not get an in-depth look at a large number of battles spanning the entire war. Rather the reader sees how a good lower-level officer can be move from one situation to the next as needed and how that officer (Grossjohann) perceived his place in this opera. The combat discussions are in fact quite good but not numerous, so if this is what you are looking for this may not be your cup of tea. However, if you want more in your personal historical accounts (as I did) \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" soundly delivers.As is typical of so many other Aberjona Press books, it is the extra detail that pushes the book into a \\"must have/must read\\" category. The Preface provided by T.C. Mataxis, Brigadier General, US Army (retired), sets the stage for a book that is MORE than just another German soldier's story, but rather the story of a warrior demanding respect from peers of all nationalities. The Historical Commentaries at the beginning of each chapter further set Grossjohann's text within the larger context of the war (spatially and temporally). These facts together with Grossjohann's style and Aberjona editing make \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" a solid 4.5 star book - easy to pick up and read but hard to put down!!"},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Five Years, Four Fronts, The War Years of Georg Grossjohann, Major, German Army (Retired), Aegis, 1999. Forward by Theodore C. Mataxis, BG, USA (Ret).It has long interested me to hear veterans speak, especially to and about former enemies. Ted Mataxis was with Task Force Herren, a scratch force comprised primarily of the first arrivals in France of our 70th ID. General Mataxis was asked by Keith Bonn, editor of Aberjona Press (Aegis) to write the intro to Five Years... Both men (and Bonn for that matter) had been career army. But unlike Seven Days in January, with the 6th SS-Mountain Division in Operation NORDWIND, for which Ted M. also wrote the intro, he had not fought against Grossjohann's outfits. But still, these men had a lot in common, e.g., having to suddenly cobble together bunches of untrained men and try to teach them how to survive the battlefield. Our 70th was filled with former army air corps crew members, anti-aircraft gunners, and former students from the Army Specialized Training Program. What was needed by the fall of 1944 was more infantrymen. Everyone knew the war would soon be over so there would be no point in having all these highly educated technicians just sitting around, now was there?? (To read about the Battle of Wingen sur Moder and other, later 70 ID garden spots such as Forbach, go to the Trailbazers website, and click on the 276th Regiment).Major Grossjohann's story is very interesting and importantly, he's not apologizing for anything. He's particularly irked at the rash of books decrying poor officer leadership, noting for example, in WWII, 287 German generals were killed in the front lines. \\"Between 22 June and 31 October 1941, my division (the 198th ID) lost about fifty-one percent of its officers versus thirty-eight of its NCOs and troops. It is obvious that relatively few of our combat officers indulged in fanatical self-preservation. Incidentally, in the German Army, the vast majority of officers had once served as soldiers...\\" Grossjohann joined the army in 1928 as a Zwolfender, \\"so called after a twelve-point buck, because under the provisions of Versailles, the minimum enlistment in the Reichswehr was twelve years.\\" When the war began he was w/in five months of discharge. He was picked up as an Officer Aspirant after the invasion of France.When in France awaiting SEALION (the invasion of England), \\"the regimental staff was quartered in the chateau of the manufacturer of fine liqueurs whose products are world-famous. The relationship between the owner of the chateau and his family and our soldiers was friendly and congenial, and I mean that for both sides. This was the case almost all over France, but was especially evident in Normandy, for historical reasons, the people there were not very fond of the English, so we had a common antagonist.\\" (Editor's note, I had the same experience when I lived in Normandy in the 1950s. The people I knew were fonder of the Germans than les anglais..).When G. then went to the Soviet Union to participate in BARBAROSSA, interestingly he had a similar experience. Now a company commander and therefore with \\"quarters in a cottage, situated directly next to the company orderly room.... My Russian, or more precisely Ukrainian hosts, were as nice and friendly as the French had been during my time in Normandy. I was always given a sofa covered with a black wax-coated sheet cloth to sleep on, while the whole family retired to sleep on the giant stove. Unfortunately, my sofa was so full of bugs that in the morning I always looked as if I had the measles. My hosts, who seemed to be completely immune to bedbugs, were always greatly amused when I got up in the morning swollen from stings and bites. But their harmless glee in my misfortune was certainly not intended.\\" Despite Himmler and Hitler, apparently not all Germans considered Slavs untermenchen...Five Years... is a well balanced work. In addition the editor's historical commentary which is solid enough to serve as a text as World War II history courses, the author discusses tactics, leadership and military/political as well as cultural realities. There's an excellent description of his regiment's egress from the Cherkassy Pocket and nearly being again cut off by the Soviets at Uman. Grossjohann early on notes that he had no particular problem fighting for Adolph Hitler since as a soldier he was initially not permitted to get into politics. After the war began, he was too busy to care about politics. However, \\"it was unimaginable and simply irreplaceable considering the men and material we lost by stubbornly sustaining positions and so-called 'strongholds' since Stalingrad.\\" Hitler had abandoned the very able German 'mobile defense' and thus subjected his troops to envelopments which had been the Wehrmacht's speciality early on.After Operation Bagration, his regiment, now a shadow of the original, was assigned to southwestern France for refitting. After 15 August 1944 and the American invasion of southern France, they became part of the German 19th Army's withdrawal up the Rhone Valley. conducting rear guard activity in hot spots such as Montelimar. While fighting in the High Vosges, initially against U.S. and then against French colonial troops, Grossjohann was assigned as provisional regimental commander of another outfit. Regardless that everyone knew the war was all but over, but not surprising due to German administrative/bureaucratic thoroughness, when his war ended the author had just reported to the course for new regimental commanders... And most Soldaten just fought on...He entered U.S. Army captivity in May, 1945.Awards: Iron Cross 2nd Class, June 1940; Iron Cross 1st Class, July 1942; Wound Badge in Black, August 1942; German Cross in Gold, October, 1944; Wounds Badge in Silver, December, 1944; Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, December, 1944."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Georg Grossjohann fits an image that historically curious readers today might have of a \\"typical Wehrmacht officer\\" -- Prussian background, long pre-1939 service, and campaign experiences on both the Eastern and Western Fronts during the war. Where his book \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" excels, is in presenting a ground-level view of the World War II German Army through the eyes of such an officer, who commanded troops close enough to the front to convey the day-to-day details of battle and the lives of officers and men, but at the same time far enough away that his perceptions of what took place were not limited by the horizon of an individual fighting position or armored vehicle.Some of the most interesting material in this book involves the attitudes of Wehrmacht officers and men toward their chain of command, which, Grossjohann relates, were not always as rigid and \\"Prussian\\" as persisting stereotypes still suggest. There are revealing descriptions of the foibles of leadership figures ranging from a master sergeant at Grossjohann's old prewar regiment, to Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler as he took amateurish charge of German forces on the Upper Rhine late in the war. Also, Grossjohann details such dynamics of front-line action as the agreement between his regiment and the mayor of a French town to let civilians evacuate during a pause in combat.Overall, \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" gives insight into the daily culture of the Wehrmacht service as well as laying out full-fleshed and detailed accounts of events in lesser-known war theaters such as the Rhone Valley and the Vosges Mountains of France. It is substantial historical work which also reads engagingly enough to keep the reader interested throughout."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"In Five Years, Four Fronts, Georg Grossjohann provides an account of his wartime military career. What the thoughtful reader will learn is that this man was an exceptional professional soldier and a humble human being.This book is based on Grossjohann's highly personal and private papers, which were not written with intent to publish and which were printed posthumously. To make up the gaps the editor offers the historical context which Grossjohann could no longer provide.We read of Grossjohann's participation in many actions, from the fruitless and costly assault on Fortress Fermont in the Maginot Line, to numerous vicious battles in the Soviet Union such as those at the Mius River, Cherkassy, and Uman, and eventually to the withdrawal from the beaches of southern France to the ideal defensive terrain of the Vosges Mountains. If the narrative is not lurid it is because Grossjohann was not the type of man to self-aggrandize or belittle the sacrifices made by the soldiers of either side. We see him constantly doing his duty and always thinking of his men and-because of his basic humanity-the circumstances of the enemy as well. One example of this is his attempts at Hohneck in the Vosges to convince the surrounded French to pull out rather than experience their own destruction. Typically, Grossjohann ends this account by correcting the existing historical record. A booklet on the combat in the Vosges Mountains mistakenly credits him with commanding the difficult final assault on Hohneck.His accounts of dealing with pencil-pushers, puffed-up superiors, and incompetents remind the reader that armies are bureaucracies and regardless of the situation or crisis at hand continue to operate as such. How else could one explain why in March 1945, Grossjohann, who by then had commanded three different regiments in combat, was transferred from the front to attend a course for regimental commanders?The foreword by General Ted Mataxis is a valuable introduction to anyone interested in understanding military history. It demonstrates, through the school of his hard experience in combat in three wars, that soldiers of belligerent armies have much in common. He suggests that, at its core, combat has immutable elements which bridge time and space. Lastly, this is a handsome and well-made book."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Thrilling, breathtaking, and inspiring to say the least. Georg Grossjohann draws from his five years of bitter fighting during the Second World War to give the readers a real taste of what it was like to experience fighting from 1939-1945. The book covers some of his training right before the war and then begins the story of Major Grossjohann's ordeal covering five years of combat and four fronts(Poland 1939, France 1940, Russia 1941-1944, France 1944-1945, with little stints of leave throughout the German territories during WWII). The book is so real, colorful, and descriptive one can picture themselves actually on the front with Major Grossjohann. The stories of battle are very vivid and real, leaving a very detailed image/picture in the head of the reader.This book is not like many other books that are written by generals and seem to go on forever without saying anything....this book teaches the reader so much from start to finish. Instead, the book is written by a field grade officer who was in the thick of the fighting and has lead more counterattacks, attacks, and defenses than any of us can imagine. He teaches the reader more about human bravery, kindness, honor, professonalism, death, and personal loss than many books out there.I suggest this (and any other book from the same company) for any person wishing to learn about World War II or how to be a leader (for those who aspire to be officers in the military) or for to anyone who just wishes to know what it was like to be an officer on four fronts during a conflict. It would behoove readers to pay close attention to what Major Grossjohan says as the book has so many invaluable lessons to convey to its readers."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Five Years, Four Fronts is a classic, not only of WWII history, but of military literature. Major Grossjohann's recollections are the carefully selected reminiscences of a professional soldier, not the lurid \\"war [...]\\" that some other authors have opportunistically used to titillate a certain type of reader. Grossjohann's candor about his superiors and his peers-with anecdotes that run the range from searing criticism to amusing storytelling to profound praise-is unusual and refreshing, especially coming from a field grade officer...of any army. His unstinting praise and respect for his subordinates not only mark the author as a first class leader of men, but as a paragon of what every officer should be.Five Years, Four Fronts is packed with unusual and fascinating details. Many of them are unique to this book, in fact. The process by which enlisted men from the interwar Reichswehr became the commissioned backbone of the wartime Wehrmacht, for example, are enlightening and thought-provoking. Grossjohann's use of detailed flashbacks to his earlier years as a junior enlisted man are a fascinating and sometimes humorous device that lends special life and allows great insights into this process in particular. The heavy demands that a lengthy war against a combination of enemies exerted on an officer are also abundantly illustrated in this book. The book abounds with accounts of not only commanding platoons, companies, battalions, and regiments in fierce combat, but of the unusual assignments officers often draw. These include (and this is only a partial list) service as the commandant for a key river crossing site; negotiating a surrender of an enemy garrison; training recruits and garrison duty while recovering from wounds; or commanding a unit of soldiers who did not speak the same language as the chain of command.This book also avoids the pitfalls of so many WWII memoirs. There is very little sentimentality; absolutely no attempt to apologize or rationalize political events beyond the author's control or understanding; no quotation of mundane letters from home; no whining about Allied or Soviet numerical superiority. It does not even seem to have occurred to Grossjohann to brag about his numerous important decorations for valor, up to and including the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross! Indeed, the only thing about which the author does seem to express more than understated professional pride in is his intimate familiarity with the nature of the ladies of the regions in which he fought. This is not done as braggadocio or boorishness, however, but rather, as a matter of being something of a connoisseur, with a light-hearted and funny tone.The professionally crafted maps are also noteworthy. Readers can follow the action with ease, and understand how the course of combat in every significant battle in which the author participated. Few military memoirs have anything like enough maps, but this one is strongly supported by over two dozen of them.Five Years, Four Fronts compares favorably with any other German officer's memoir I have ever read; I honestly believe it is the best memoir ever written by a German infantry officer. Strongly recommended for anyone who wants to understand the German Army during World War II or military leadership in general."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"This is a book about everyday life and combat in the backbone of the Wehrmacht-the common infantry division. At a time when there is a growing stack of memoirs, monographs and photo books about parachute, panzer, and both famous and obscure Waffen-SS units, Georg Grossjohann's Five Years, Four Fronts is a refreshing and important look at the wartime experiences of that vast majority of combat soldiers and tactical commanders who served in the hundreds of infantry divisions that bore the overwhelming brunt of the fighting for the Germans in World War II. Beginning with his service in the invasion of Poland and ending with his release from rather brief American captivity, this is a book by a professional soldier that is especially long on military reminiscences and mercifully brief on personal details about pre- or post-war life.Although there is a great deal about combat in this book, there is not a lot of &quot;blood and guts.&quot; With most of his combat experience as a commander at the company, battalion, and regimental levels, such was not the author's focus. However, readers should be aware that the author was rather highly decorated, earning the Iron Crosses, 2nd and 1st Classes, the German Cross in Gold, and the prestigious Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (there are even photos of the certificates for the latter two included in the book-a nice touch in an era when there are so many phonies, from all armies, publishing their &quot;memoirs.&quot;). Major Grossjohann was also wounded in combat twice, and a photo of the certificate for his Wounds Badge in Silver is also included in the book.The engrossing narrative is written in a straightforward and sometimes wry fashion, and includes numerous flashbacks to the author's earlier service as a enlisted man before the war and even before the Nazi era. These help build a 3-dimensional protagonist, and also provide rare insights into the little-understood processes by which so many non-commissioned members of the pre-war German Army were developed into the officers who led German soldiers into combat from 1939 on.This book features introductions to each chapter written by an American professional historian with the assistance of another WWII German officer to doubly ensure objectivity. These introductions provide historical overviews of the fighting at the strategic and operational levels, and really help make the author's micro-historical, personal views much more meaningful for most readers.Supported by a couple of dozen photos from the author's private collection and an unusually large number of tactical maps to allow the reader to follow the action, this is a superb book that is indispensable for understanding the German Army in World War II."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"To me this book is above all a fine collection of portraits of different characters within the German army, and especially within the German NCO and officer corps. I also learnt more about the regional identities in the German armed forces. &quot;Germans&quot; were actually East Prussians, Rhinelanders, Swabians, Austrians etc and Georg Grossjohann shows how this mattered. This lesson can by the way easily be applied in today's conflicts were all too often regional differences are ignored.If you are interested in one of the many less-known battlefields on which Knight's Cross recipient Grossjohann fought, e.g. in Southern France and the High Vosges you will be richly rewarded by this book as the text and clear maps will give you a good understanding of both larger (divisional) and some smaller actions, but personally I was more fascinated by his time in the Ukraine and especially the amiable relationship between the Ukranians and the Germans and why it ended. Grossjohann seems to fully understand why his hosts eventuallly turned against him.It is amusing, and probably useful too, not only to read about good leaders but also about how NOT to lead. Indeed, this book is one of the more charming but still believable German memoirs that I have read. Grossjohann's analysis of why the excellent German armed forces were defeated is also well worth reading.Its interesting to see his army documents, photos and even his military CV."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"Here is a soldier who saw it all. From private to major on four fronts is quite a journey and the author makes it an interesting one. There is no 'puffing' here, just the facts. I was intrigued with his depiction of other officers, those who could 'cut it' and those who talked a good game.The class distinctions, regional differences and the varied reactions to the stress of combat were revealing. Grossjohann is a fine example of leadership."},{"Title":"Five Years, Four Fronts: The War Years of Georg Grossjohann","review":"This book clearly conveyed what it was like for a front line infantry officer serving on the German side of WWII. I find it thoroughly refreshing that the author kept to his main premise of the novel: that most of the German fighting men were tough adversaries that were often not fighting for a form of government they preferred, or for a dream of conquest, but rather for the man next to them in the foxhole.Another point that distinguishes this work over many others is the fact that Mr. Grossjohann served in the German Army for nearly 12 years before the war began in 1939, and was a professional soldier, not a conscripted draftee as many surviving German authors were. This provides the insight of someone who knew the 'bigger picture' above and beyond most of the conscript soldiers that comprised the bulk of the German Wehrmacht, but was not above their common shared misery, as was the case with many generals who wrote their memoirs after the warHighly recommended for those looking for another point of view to WWII history."},{"Title":"Seasons In Fern Hollow","review":"This is a wonderful book that should be part of every child's personal collection.

There was an old lady who he didn't like because allitle before the murder, she hit him with a broom.His parents never beileved him, until they went outside and saw her hanging on the tree. To find out the who the murderer is must read this book. I suggest you read this book because it is very suspensful when the murderer is after Rob because he saw him push her out. If you find out the murderer before somebody, maybe if your friend is reading it with you don't tell him. It is kind of fun to know who the murderer is before your friend."},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"I loved The View From the Cherry Tree!!!

However, it manages to build into a heart-pounding thriller by the end. Kids will enjoy the secrecy of the cherry tree perch, and will identify with not being listened to by adults."},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"Boy o, boy would you ever see the day when you witnessed your neighbor get assassinated, and see it from a little perch in a cherry tree in front of your own eyes? Well Rob Mallory has and everyone he manages to tell is too busy to listens to him except one person the murder. As Rob see more and more of the murder he gets an ideal that he just made a new friend. When you start to read this realistic book The View From the Cherry Tree you will know something more surprising is going to happen, his older sister Darcy is going to have a wedding. Wow, now to top that off with what he just saw, that's gong to be tough.Now although Willo Davis Roberts is not a very well known author, but she as written a lot of good books like Nightmare; What Could Go Wrong; and Don't Hurt Laurie. Willo seems to connect with his readers by getting them to wonder what is going to happen, or give them some sort of suspense in the book. I think the weak points are when the book just sometimes has one thing and the other part doesn't go along with the story. But however The View From the Cherry Tree is a Mystery book I would recommend this book to all ages because it has a lot of strong points like a few sad moments, happy moments, and just weird moments that will just make you cry, laugh, and say eww. It also has a lot of details like S.O.B crouched at the end of the Limb, his tail, twitching then still. The muscles, bunched under the black pelt as he prepared to attack Miss Calloway's curtains. Many people who read this book may not like it because it doesn't catch their interest but I encourage you to read on because at some point of the story it will just grab you and say keep reading. But as you know The View From the Cherry Tree did not win a Newberry Medal, it is on my favorite Mystery book. This book is filled with a lot of surprises. So what will you do when you have witness your neighbors murder?"},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"I loved this book. Willo Davis Roberts did an beyond splendid job on this book.

The book is filled with curses, graphic murders, and at the end when the boy discovers who the murder was, an intense chase scene where the person is chasing Robby through a house trying to kill him.

Recently, she told me her concerns about the book. Looking it up, I learned that its target audience is 9 to 11 year olds. Then I read it. Although I would agree that reading level of the book, published in 1975, IS about right for its target age, the content is not. The rest of this review contains spoilers, read on knowing so.The View from the Cherry Tree goes something like this. Bored with all the hubbub surrounding his sister's upcoming wedding, 11-year-old Rob Malloy spends much of his time perched in a cherry tree near his house, where he can keep track of what is going on at the home of his elderly neighbor, Mrs. Calloway, as well as his own. After an incident intended to show what an evil \\"witch\\" the woman is (readers later learn that she \\"was getting senile\\" and appears to have been a hoarder), Robbie overhears an argument between Mrs. Calloway and a man, then witnesses her being pushed out of the window, and strangling to death after the strap of the binoculars she always wears around her neck (to peer at neighborhood goings-on) catches on a tree branch. The authorities believe it to have been an accident. Robbie knows the truth, but between his hesitancy to stir things up in light of the wedding, and his less than stellar past behaviors that have decreased his credibility, he says nothing. When he finally tries to explain what really happened, nobody will listen. He (correctly) theorizes who the killer might be and suspects that this person might be trying to kill him after two cats are injured, one by a weapon being discharged and another by poisoning (methinks the author must be a dog person), both, he thinks, intended for him. Eventually, he encounters the killer in Mrs. Calloway's home, learns the motive behind the murder (heroin), and escapes.If that isn't convincing enough, here are some excerpts of specific sections (sorry for the unconventional formatting): The cat's name is S.O.B., (p 4) \\"The initials meant just what you'd think they meant. Darcy had named him Sonny, but Dad kept referring to him as \\"that son of a bitching cat\\" and pretty soon he was S.O.B.;\\" characters in the story discussing Mrs. Calloway, (p 10) \\"Too bad [S.O.B.'d] had his shots; Old Lady Calloway deserved rabies or something,\\" \\"I wonder how much that old bag thinks her hose was worth?\\" \\"How old do you have to be before you drop dead of old age?\\" and \\"Older than that crone, I'm afraid. Although she's mean enough to poison herself on her own spit;\\" Robbie upset about the way his father insults his nephew, saying Robbie has better sense, (p 27) \\"Why even Robbie, as if an eleven year old was a retardo, or something?\\" Mrs. Calloway's behavior towards Rob after catching him hiding on her porch, (p 30) \\"She pounced with a triumphant cry, and the broom crashed down on Rob's head. It scratched the side of his face, and then was lifted and brought down again and again, slashing at him, pounding, jabbing, and all the while she was yelling and screaming at him...\\"That'll teach you to stay off my property, you nasty little wretch! You and your confounded dirty cat!\\"...She spat at him, and the spittle struck him on the cheek, and then she brought the upended broom down one more time; he rolled aside, or she might have stuck it right through him;\\" the groom-to-be, Darcy, addressing his fianc&eacute;, (p 33) \\"Darling, shut up. You hear me? Shut up;\\" Mr. Malloy's reaction to Robbie trying to prank Mrs. Calloway (by acting like he was badly hurt) and his future son-in-law, Darcy, who was fooled (p 42), \`\\"Rob, what's got into you!\\" His father jerked him to his feet, propelling him toward the house. \\"Get back inside! All of you, and Darcy, stop that racket before I smack you!\\"' Mrs. Calloway's murder, (p 54) \\"...while Mrs. Calloway was falling, flailing with her arms and legs, and then she gave a gurgling choked cry and was silent. Rob stared down at her face, which was looking straight up at him and slowly turning blue. The leather strap of the binoculars had twisted about her neck and as she fell had caught around a big branch...Her eyes, up close, were a pale blue; they bulged as if they were being squeezed out of her, and her mouth gaped, working soundlessly, then not at all...The bulging eyes continued to stare up at him, sightless now...The small body swung gently, turning a little, on the leather strap;\\" Mrs. Malloy upset with Rob after he pulls a model away from a visiting child who has ruined it, injuring the child, and then tries to tell her about the murder (p 104), \\"This has been one of the worst days I can remember, and if you don't shut up right this minute, I'm going to lose my temper and slap you!...He thought she was really going to hit him. Her hand started to move in the beginning motions, and then she spoke with a deadly coldness he had never known in her before...;\\" The murderer, a former suitor of Rob's sister, talking to Rob after he's figured things out, (p 147) \\"That blasted cat! I'll kill it too, you little bastard!\\" and (p 153) \\"I'll strangle you before you get out a second yell!...I've wanted to throttle you for years, you know...Nosy little bastard;\\" and, last but not least, Rob's last act while perched in the tree after his escape from the murder (p 180) \\"Rob sat a moment longer, relieving himself into Mrs. Calloway's flower bed.\\"Come on, admit it. You wouldn't want your 9 to 11 year old to have this book read to him or her in school. The View from the Cherry Tree is one of those Catch-22 type books, the writing style is 4th to 5th grade, but the content is better suited for an older audience, like 13 and up. For 9 to 11 year olds, skip this in favor of: The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place: The Mysterious Howling by Maryrose Wood (performed by Katherine Kellgren), School of Fear by Gitty Daneshvari (performed by Scott Brick) and The Bunnicula Collection Books 1-3 by James and Deborah Howe (performed by Victor Garber), all three are best on audiobook."},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"Life around the Mallory home is hectic with the upcoming wedding of Rob's sister, Darci. So hectic that no one pays much attention to Rob - except when he gets in trouble. So, while sitting in the cherry tree he hears mean old Mrs. Calloway arguing with someone right before she gets pushed out the window, the strap on the binoculars around her neck catching on a tree branch, hanging her right in front of him. The problem is that no one belives him when he tells them she was murdered. No one, except the murderer.A favorite from my childhood, my 10 year old son and I recently read this and we both loved it. The mystery is tense and enough to keep even reluctant readers interested and reading right to the end."},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"This book is written as a murder/mystery for ages 9-11 and is definetly not fit for this age group. It has no good theme or moral to it. In the beginning, p.4 it uses the words \\"son of a b***in cat\\" which leads to the name of the cat being called \\"S.O.B.\\" throughout the entire book. There is a murder description that begins on p. 53 that is very descript and disturbing. At one point the main character is offered casually a beer. The murder takes place because of a bag of heroine that is hidden in the woman's house and she will not give it to a young adult man. All the adults in this story are depicted as insensitive and disrespectful to the boy (main character), even the police when he goes to them for help. This book was given my 5th grade child as a class read, and I was very disturbed that it was considered \\"approved material\\" for elementary age. This is the first children's book written by the author who normally writes gothic, adult murder mystery and medical mystery fiction. Would we let our young children read the first children's book written by Steven King? Probably not. The actual book was only an \\"okay\\" read for entertainment in my opinion for anyone. There are much better choices."},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"I first read this book many many years ago, in 5th grade. I loved it then, and I still love it today. I would recommend it to any child, as long as they can handle murder and some language. The reason why I started think about this book again is that it is actually #97 on The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000 at the American Library Association's website. I am guessing that it is challenged for the murder and language, which shows that some may have troubles with the content. My little brother, who is now in 5th grade has just started it and really enjoys it too. So if you feel like you can handle it, this is an AMAZING book that is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"This book is a really good book by Willo Davis Roberts.

The book starts out with a boy named Rob and his sister is getting married. Many people are stopping by his house to help or to visit every day. The regular meals are not served all the time and things are really out of order. Rob gets no attention and he is waiting for things to get back to normal. Rob often sits in a cherry tree where he can see his neighbors' house. The old lady that lives next door is not liked by any one in the neighborhood, because she is extremely mean. One evening, Rob climbs into the tree to relax away from the family and he sees the mean lady in her house. All of a sudden as she leans out to get rid of a cat, she is pushed out by two hands that Rob can not identify. Rob tells a few people that he actually saw a murder while most people think it was an accident, including the police. Soon a pot almost hits him, then he is shot at, and then his food is poisoned. There was a murder and the person knows that Rob has seen the crime and he is after him.I liked this book because it was interesting to read. The back of the book made me interested in the book and while I read, I looked forward to the exciting part. \\"Something hit the step between his feet with that a sharp splintering sound. Rob glanced down, frowning, and saw that a bit of the wood had been torn away.\\" This part of the book was when Rob was being shot at, but luckily didn't get hit. In the book, Rob tries to re-create the scene in his mind and find out who the killer is. The problem is that he has made up other stories before that no one will believe him now. Also his family is caught up in the wedding, so that Rob has to find the killer himself.There was really no reason why I disliked the book, because it was interesting and the story flowed fast enough. Overall I really liked this book and it one that I recommend. As Rob gets closer to the killer, more things seem to happen and he gets desperate to tell someone about what he has seen. He tries to call the police, but even they don't listen, because they think it's a fake call. It kept me reading, because I was wondering how Rob was going to make people listen to him and find the killer before he was killed himself.My favorite part is in the end where everything is revealed and he is in the ladies house with the murderer. He is trapped in the highest point of the house and the killer is blocking the door. Rob remembers that he has a jar full of spiders in his pocket and he throws it at the man. The man is very scared, but the jar doesn't break and the spiders don't come out. So the jar is kicked aside and the murderer comes closer as Rob backs up to the window. Then Rob picks up a huge black widow from the window sill and throws it at the man. Terrified the man tries to get it off him and Rob runs away as the police arrive to arrest the killer."},{"Title":"The View From the Cherry Tree","review":"The View from the Cherry Tree was a great book.

She is then pushed out of her window and dies! Rob then, being the only one who knows it was murder and not an accident. He then is almost killed, almost getting shot and a pot falling on him. The murderer knows Rob saw him/her kill her and Rob knows he's next to die. I think this is a good book because it is suspenseful. It is although quite a short book and is very easy to read for me.

The author and artists have created a beautifully balanced and consistant presentation of this magical world -- that is rational in the fullest sense via harmonic ratios between the various aspects of Eldoria. Mostly overtly a fanstastical setting, Eldoria is even adaptable to science fictional gaming -- due to some covertly implied ancient and current technology and artifacts -- as well as the just remarked upon rational harmony.\\"Encyclopedia Eldoria\\" is so well crafted that it is almost like a quality academic concise summary of the world and magic of Eldoria -- except in being much more artistically enhanced than usual. These are well presented via four main sections concerning religion, history, geography and miscellany. The various races, beings and creatures complement one another well. Explanation of the aspects of Eldorian magic is the best I have seen -- based on the Arcane Science of Tas [\\"The Force\\"]. Yet such Tas-based magic is well moderated via other ways of venturing and adventuring such as warrior and seafaring skills and items -- as well as ancient and current cultural and natural limitation. Religion, wizardry, sorcery and druidry are in mutual balance with various factions in intrigue. Local history, current events and persons of interest complete Eldorian manifold natural role play game hooks. The world of Eldoria is wonderful to venture into via this work of Eldoria +++"},{"Title":"Introduction to Biotechnology: An Agricultural Revolution","review":"I am using this book as a textbook for the biotechnology freshman class at a vocational highschool. To make it short, the book is horrible. The images are from a stock photography agency, with little relevance to the text and are often pointless. The picture of one scientist working on a 96-well plate dispenser shows up as somebody working to wipe out the cotton weevil and as a scientist sequencing the bovine genome. Punnett squares are done wrong, and images of cells in interphase stained to visualize the Barr bodies are supposed to show the Y-chromosome. There is at least one factual mistake on almost every page, and the writing does not raise any questions that may arise with the use of genetic engineering in agriculture.Very little thought and discussion seem to have gone into the writing of this book, and I would not spend the money on it again"},{"Title":"Engendering Judaism : An Inclusive Theology and Ethics","review":"I assigned this book as one of the seminar readings for my Jewish Studies class at the Evergreen State College. While the book was suitably demanding of my undergraduate readers due to its erudition and scholarship, it rewarded them with well argued, respectful and deeply engaging feminist solutions to the challenges of looking at Jewish beliefs, texts, and traditions, from a contemporary point of view. The author begins with a beautifully structured critical look at the patriarchal impact on Jewish culture and religion. It follows with useful and well researched arguments for re-engaging an ancient tradition in the building of inclusive, egalitarian and relevant Jewish communities. It is a breath of fresh air and possibly the best book on Judaism you will read on worthwhile contemporary issues. It addresses feminist concerns, queer issues and other important questions, and offers scholarly, wise, and compasionate tools to re-evaluate how to build the Judaism of the future . My students (Jewish and non-Jewish) loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Engendering Judaism : An Inclusive Theology and Ethics","review":"Scholarly, yet readable, this book marks a promising beginning for those who wish to create a Jewish feminist theology and identity without compromising Jewish or feminist values.

By far the very best work of any Jewish feminist to date, and easily stands beside any of the great and venerable works of modern Jewish thought, feminist or not.

Several moms would ask me where I got the ideas for a lesson plan, for instance, insects. I mentioned this book. These books are large, oversized books.

Hereward, Fulk Fitzwain, Eustace the Monk, William Wallace, and Gamelyn are all covered with at least one chapter dedicated to each. Outlaws of Medieval Legend also looks into the possibility of Robin Hood being a real living person, even if their reality differed from that of the Robin Hood Stories. Besides that it explores the sociological reasons that the Robin Hood and other British outlaw legends and historical figures were so popular during the middle ages and continue to be so to this day. I highly recomend this book to anyone with any sort of interest in the subject matter.Personally I always liked to think of Robin Hood as a just and righteous Anglo Saxon Thegn that had lost everything after the Normans took over England in 1066 and was fighting a guerella war against the oppressive Normans. I also always liked the idea of Robin Hood being a heathen that would rob the corrupt greedy Christian church and political figures."},{"Title":"The Outlaws of Medieval Legend","review":"Even though Keen's book is not the most recent book on the topic, he still has some very good things to say. This edition republishes all his original material from the 1960's with a new introduction, explaining how some of his ideas have changed due to recent scholarship. This book is not a revision, just a reprinting. He has a chapter on outlaw ballads as an expression of peasant discontent, but has stated that he may have overstretched his conclusions.However, his book is still good to read in order to gain a broad understanding of English outlaws, he focuses on Robin Hood, but mentioned several other outlaw poems as well. For me personally this was the first time I read an overview of the life of Hereward and the tales of Gamelyn. I've heard of William Wallace, but didn't really know anything about him. Keen also has a chapter on Eustace the Monk, one of the outlaws who can be tracked down and pinpointed to exact dates. These other outlaws received a chapter or two and Keen explored both the overlapping themes among them and explores the historical background which produced the tales.His chapters on Robin Hood outline the fictional character and overview a few of the ballads. He notes how tough it is to try and find a historical Robin, and states that it may never be done. A few candidates have been put forward but they are all on shaky foundations and speculations. We know the rough century/century and a half in which the stories first began, so the original figure or figures who inspired them must have lived in the same period. Overall a good book if a little outdated by more recent scholarship. A good introduction to outlaw literature."},{"Title":"The Outlaws of Medieval Legend","review":"This book dedicates each chapter to a different medieval outlaw and describes their exploits. I wish it went into more detail the villans described are Fulk Fitzwarren, William Wallace, Gamelyn, Robin Hood, Eustace the Monk, Hereward of Wake, and describes the detail of peasant discontent relating to ballads. It could have been longer and more detailed and had more heroes such as Janosik . A decent read but short."},{"Title":"The D.A. Calls It Murder","review":"The D.A.

Calls It Murder","review":"This murder mystery is quite different in plot from the stories by Gardner involving his main characters Perry Mason and Bertha Cool/ Donald Lam. While the police are still portrayed as being very heavy-handed and a bit dim-witted, the main character is very much a mystery man, although his tactics will remind you of Donald Lam.Terry Clane is an American that spent several years in China, living as a recluse among Chinese religious figures; he knows the language and culture very well. Clane is now back in the United States, living a life largely of leisure with a Chinese servant. Jacob Mandra is a gangster, heavily involved in extortion and blackmail, very successful, right up to the point where he gets killed. The murder weapon was a Chinese sleeve gun, a small spring-loaded device that can fit in your sleeve and surreptitiously fired. The projectile is a deadly dart and Clane owns such a gun so he is the first suspect interviewed by the D. A. after the murder is discovered.This begins a convoluted tale with multiple suspects, a complicated dance in search of the truth and the police constantly accusing Clane of being uncooperative, a Gardner plot trademark. Clane manages to keep one step ahead of the law as he carries out his own investigation of the crime. This takes him back-and-forth between the local Chinese community as well as the surrounding American culture, one that he is still in the process of rejoining. References to Chinese cultural mores and traditions are made throughout the book, although Gardner seems to prefer maintaining the clich&eacute; of \\"the inscrutable Asian.\\"Unlike most of the Gardner books, there is no dramatic \\"aha you villain\\" ending, the murderer is uncovered, but rather quietly and without a great deal of buildup. If you are a fan of Erle Stanley Gardner and know something about the historical context when the book was written, then you will probably enjoy it. However, if you need the dramatic flourish at the end or don't really understand how Asians were perceived in America in the 1930's, then you may struggle to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The D.A.

I have read all the others in her series that have been published in English and this was a good addition. what struck me the most about this book is the author's ability to really let you see what going on a medieval pilgrimage was like. The pilgrims in the book are going to Santiago de Compostela, a very famous medieval pilgrimage site. The terrible hardships they endure are vividly recreated. You really felt how difficult it was to accomplish and it gives you new respect for those that completed the pilgrimage.I gave the book four stars because I think the mystery's solution was a bit weak.

Everyone believes she murdered James. James's brother, renowned US Marshal Lucas McKenna, plans to bring the slut to justice. Adding fuel to his hatred of &quot;Lady&quot; Antoinette is observing his nephew and niece mourning the loss of their beloved father.Lucas catches up with Annie in Colorado where she is recovering from a miscarriage. He arrests her after she tries to escape, breaking her ribs in the process. To his shock, the townsfolk rally around the whore. Even worse, Lucas finds himself very attracted to the vulnerable woman, who behaves entirely differently than he expected. As she heals from her broken ribs, the lawman and the kept woman of his deceased brother fall in love. Still, the memory of his weeping family reminds him that he must keep his distance.INTO THE SUNSET is an angst-laden western romance that showcases the talents of super Shelly Thacker. The complex story line builds it energy around Annie,s murder of James and the growing passion between her and her adversary. The lead characters are fun, but it is the various support cast that brings depth and color to a novel that sub-genre fans will relish for years to come.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"If you can get past the fact that Annie was first the mistress of Lucas' brother James and then fell for him (Lucas), then you are golden. Annie running from the law after killing James is being pursued by Lucas, James' brother who is also a Marshall. He catches up with her in a small town where many have secrets but who seem to accept Annie as one of their own (well most of them anyway), even after they learn her painful secrets. James sets up a jail in the town to await the end of the snow and keeps her his prisoner. Much to his dismay he finds himself wildly attracted to this brother killer. It's a great story with a great ending. At first I didn't think there was any way this young lady was going to be able to explain what happened and still be innocent but that's probably why I'm not the writer... A must read for anyone who likes Marshalls in small towns and the woman they try to protect."},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"One of the greatest pleasures in reading is finding a new author who simply oozes talent. Shelly Thacker's INTO THE SUNSET is captivating from start to finish and if this is any indication of this author's storytelling ability, then I plan to read a great deal of Ms. Thacker!Mini Synopsis:The Heroine - Annie Sutton is a genuinely good person. She readily offers a quick smile and a tender heart. Which is remarkable, because throughout most of her life, Annie has felt like a fish out of water, but now the people of Eminence, Colorado are offering friendship and protection. And for the first time, Annie begins to feel at home! Difficult to understand? Not really! For Annie Sutton is a generous, admirable and caring person. Still, the question remains: has this former rich man's mistress found true acceptance or will the good people of Eminence turn their backs once they learn of her devastating background?The Hero - U.S. Marshall Lucas McKenna is a dangerous man who chafes under the prejudice the good folks of Eminence show toward him. Yet, much more annoying are the unfamiliar sensations Antoinette Sutton pulls from him! For the first time in his life, Lucas McKenna is experiencing troubling feelings toward a prisoner! What is wrong with him? What has happened to his judgment? The woman HAS confessed! She has confessed to shooting his brother; she has confused to stealing his brother's money; she has even confessed to a baby - his brother's baby! In Lucas' mind, there is no doubt, Antoinette Sutton is immoral, contemptible and guilty, yet in Lucas' heart, Annie Sutton is courageous, honorable, and very innocent!Reviewer's Comments:There are many, many good things in Shelly Thacker's book. First of all, Lucas and Annie are two very enjoyable characters. Annie jumps from the pages as a lovely young woman, who is genuinely distressed over the mayhem her former lifestyle packs. And U.S. Marshal Lucas McKenna appears to be a good lawman, a lawman who doesn't know quite what to do with his prisoner or with his growing masculine feelings! Some good sexual tension crackles between the two, further heightened by the occasional reference to Annie's 'fancy woman' background. And this makes for delightful reading!So why the slip from this reviewer's PERFECT grade? Although Thacker's dramatic climax is wonderful, it played out a little too tidy or maybe a little too forced! Still in the end, every character got their just dues and for that I was in total agreement! Conclusion: INTO THE SUNSET is a fabulous romance that's as captivating as it is tender. If you find a copy, do buy it, and read it . . . allow Shelly Thacker to steal your heart.Status: Worth Reading AgainGrade: A-Sensuality: TenderMaryGrace Meloche."},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"Ms. Thacker handles this, her first western, with amazing expertise.

A truly fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"From the back cover:Into his arms...The moment she saw him she ran, desperate to escape. But he found her. U.S. Marshal Lucas McKenna made it clear his interest in Annie Sutton was very personal: he'd come to arrest her for the murder of his brother. Annie was at his mercy, trapped in a snowbound Colorado town, imprisoned in a makeshift jail until he could take her back to justice. She never expected to find love in the arms of a lawman determined to see her hang...Into his heart...Lucas McKenna, the msot feared lawman in the West, finally captured his brother's killer--only to feel trapped himself, tormented by her nearness, the feel of her in his arms, the scent of her hair. She said the killing was an accident. He couldn't afford to believe her. Yet as the winter passed, she slowly got under his skin, make him know her, set his heart afire. Until he had to decide: to lose his reputation and let her escape, or bring her to justice and risk losing her for good...And my review:This was a very enjoyable book. While it wasn't a can't-put-it-down, I still recommend it.Thacker has a talent for creating loveable characters. They are true-to-life, honorable people, yet still somewhat flawed. They're human. Not gods, and not unlikeable, either. They're people you can relate to. I expected not to like Annie, given the fact that she had lived for three years as a married man's mistress. I should have hated her, yet somehow that was impossible. I couldn't help but love her.The small-town thing was also well done in this book. This story had so many loveable characters in it. The townspeople were not paragons of saintly virtue, just real, human people that you would be happy to know.The romance in this book was well done, and left me with that \\"warm glow\\" that romance readers crave. Yes, this book had its dark moments, but they never overwhelmed the story. And I really like the fact that the attraction between the characters was based on something more substantial than sexual chemistry. That is so rare in the lust-soaked world of romance today. Not that the hero and heroine weren't physically attracted to each other. They were, but it was in its proper place. The love came first, and the sexual attraction was an added bonus. That's just as it should be.This story never got boring, yet it didn't feel like it was all plot, either. Fans of western romance (and even those who might not like it as much as other historical periods) will enjoy this book. I don't recommend many books (I consider myself a very hard sell), but I would recommend INTO THE SUNSET to all romance readers. I would also recommend the book HIS FORBIDDEN TOUCH by the same author, which is a five-star read."},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"Its an enjoyable story about a women(mistress) who kills her lover and his marshall brother who chases her down. The heroine of the piece comes from a less than ladylike background and bemoans the &quot;i'm nothing, nobody likes me&quot; line much longer than I cared for. In all fairness she is a goodhearted soul who proves to have backbone and eventually stands up for herself.Lucas, our hero, is full of the &quot;I am god&quot; syndrome.......he gets to know annie and eventually sees thru her goodness that she must be innocent. He than puts hit macho determined &quot;bring her to justice&quot; attitude into the same effort to save her. The cute little town of eminence, col with all its good hearted busybodies is a delight. The 2-3 loves scenes were pretty brief and superficial. I rate a book according to whether I would read it a second time. I had to rate this low because although I enjoyed it, once was enough."},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"I have just finished reading INTO THE SUNSET and found it a book hard to put down. The plot-story line is so different than the &quot;usual&quot; historical romance a refreshing change! I highly recommend this book.It is my first book written by Ms. Thacker, needless to say, I am ceertainly going to read more of her writings."},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"Shelly Thacker's new book, Into the Sunset, is her best yet. A wonderfully suspensful and romantic read about two people who really pull at the heartstrings as they try to do the &quot;right thing&quot;. Lucas McKenna a lawman, and Annie Sutton the woman who pulled the trigger on the gun that killed his brother become caught up in events that are beyond their control.They swiftly become people that you care about and you're cheering all the way for both of them."},{"Title":"Into the Sunset","review":"Having read all of Shelly's books I was estatic to see a new one on the shelves. And once again she has produced a definite page-turner. From the moment I was &quot;introduced&quot; to Annie Sutton and Lucas McKenna I couldn't put this book down. Shelly has a way of drawing you into the story, from Annie's first bumpy moments on a stagecoach to her first meeting with Lucas, through &quot;trials&quot; and tribulations. I laughed and cried and I couldn't imagine how ever in the world Shelly would be able to get her hero and heroine to an ending that I would be happy with. But I should never have doubted her for a moment. So, once more, Shelly has delighted me with a story I have taken to my heart. Now I am patiently impatient for the next book by a truly unique and delightful author."},{"Title":"An Anthology of Irish Literature (Modern Library, 288.1)","review":"This is the only anthology of Irish Literature that I'm aware of that encompasses the scope of Irish writing from its earliest to its most recent. It is an outstanding collection that will give a reader a taste of the quality of Irish writing through the centuries. It is also an excellent text for a survey course in Irish Literature. It went out of print, but I'm glad it's back and NYU should be congratlated for bringing it back."},{"Title":"Doing Internet Research: Critical Issues and Methods for Examining the Net","review":"This is one of the best books you can find about doing social research on the Internet. There are thirteen contributors of the edited book and each offers some original responses to the fast growing Internet and the social processes related to it. One of the major themes that concern all the contributors is: How do we study the Internet? While the Internet has changed many aspects of our lives from the way we work, to the way we shop, to the way we socialize, the Internet is still a fairly new subject for social scientists to grapple with. The book offers some explorative strategies for the readers to get some general ideas about how to examining the social aspects of Internet.Both quantitative and qualitative researchers will get some insights from this edited book. The editor, Steve Jones, chose the articles from a wide range of social research approaches. Most contributors are from communication studies, but there are also people from computer science, sociology, and English departments. I think one of the most intriguing chapters is chapter 12 where Barbara Sharf talks about the ethics problems of doing naturalistic discourse research on the Internet. Chapter 13 is also an inspiring piece because it bridges the field of cultural studies with that of Internet communications.Compared to &iexcl;CyberSociety 2.0&iexcl; and &iexcl;Virtual Culture: Identity and Communication in Cyberspace&iexcl; both of which are edited by Steve Jones, this book is more focused on the doing aspect, which is Internet research methodology. I think it is a very practical and thought-provoking book for those who are consider doing or are now doing research on the Internet."},{"Title":"Milet Picture Dictionary: English-Arabic","review":"We had the smaller milet books, and for our daughter's birthday she received this book in both of our native languages (Polish and Arabic).Just like with the small milet book; Dad sits on one side, and I sit on the other side. Our daughter would point out to a picture and he says the Polish word, then I say the Arabic word. With time, this book helped our daughter associate the picture to the word in both languages; associate each language to each parent and later she would read it with either one of us and fill in the words in the language of the missing parent. It was awesome!"},{"Title":"Milet Picture Dictionary: English-Arabic","review":"The art and subjects are great. HOWEVER, I am teaching a 7 year old who just arrived from Libya.

Think of Mutiny on the Bounty, Nordhoff and Hall as an example, the works of Eiseley or Bradbury or Joyce. But those are works of mere fiction.Harry Partch was nothing if non-fiction. He was a scientist of musical theory. I knew the man, knew his instruments and his work. Only later, after he died, did I try to understand his masterwork, Genesis of a Music, and I'm still trying to.Partch is a Titan in a world that went for Pop. Partch is the Steve Jobs to Bill Gates. His music theory was the genesis for the work of Phillip Glass and John Cage, an attempt, like the masters of old, Kepler and Galileo, to set down a definitive tome on the theory of what music really IS, in the sense of its intervals and temperaments, what is mere dissonance, and what is the voice of god.Any serious musician who hasn't studied Genesis of a Music is missing the calculus of his art, the holy grail of his study.This one book defines the universe of melodic and inspirational sound that we call music. If ever there was a work with some meat on its bones, Genesis of a Music is it. You must carry it with you night and day, and only take it out late at night, in your study carel in some dark library, sneaking passages like a secret compact, a cipher schrivened on the papyrus of Isis.Then if you're lucky enough to find one of his old vinyls, you can say you've heard the bells pealing from heaven above."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"I read this book over 30 years ago and was fascinated with it. It gave a detailed look at one of our most obscure presidents. I've been interested in him ever since. Perhaps the only flaw of the book was the forced omissions of the letters between Mr.Harding and his mistress in Marion, Ohio. This tragic presidency was brought to life with the fascinating writing of Mr. Russell."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"I discovered this book in high school. Required to research a President &quot;off the beaten track,&quot; I chose Harding. Even more so than Richard Nixon, Harding's reputation has been tarnished since his death, and historians have seldom gone back to re-examine the man's life. Francis Russell's book, currently out-of-print, remains a fascinating study of a man who made no bones about being from an obscure hometown, a man who, although a successful newspaper editor, often misused the English language, and (last but not least) someone who had advanced in the rough and tumble world of Ohio politics not through being a shrewd policy-maker or a great statesman, but rather a good-looking public speaker and partygoing back-slapper. He had other faults as well, namely his roving eye regarding the fairer sex. One of the most interesting sections of the book concerns his decade-long affair with a married woman. They wrote many love letters back and forth, but excerpts from these letters were suppressed; dashes (---) appear in Russell's book instead of the expected prose. Perhaps someday these letters will be published, and with them an unexpurgated version of this otherwise wholly satisfactory Presidential biography."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"Harding often makes the list of the worst presidents in US history and this book explores the reasons behind this judgement. Never a statesman, deeply flawed and ultimately tragic, shows what happens when a person whose only qualifications for the job was that he was good natured back slapper above controversy is elected to the presidency. He was from an important state which helped as well, but these should never be considered as qualifcations for the highest office in the land.Harding was scandal prone from his early days. There was a rather nasty rumor that, given the circumstances of the time significant. This was that his family was part African American. In some ways this was the transformation of the old Democratic civil war \\"bloody shirt\\" strategy that dated back to Reconstruction. The Republicans were accused even after they had abandoned Civil Rights (in 1876) of somehow attempting to promote African American interests at the expense of white Americans. This issue continued to pop up throughout Harding's career.Then there are the women. Harding was married to a woman who appears to have been a bit of a shrew. He sought comfort elsewhere and from a variety of sources. His primary mistress was a political liabilty for more than obvious reasons. Carrie Phillips was pro-German and after the end of their affair was a thorn in Harding's flesh. Unfortunately, the letters between the two are surpressed in this book due to the legal efforts of Harding's nephew, George T. Harding. Given Harding's reputation, it is unclear what he was trying to protect by doing so. I suppose, given Harding's questionable fluency in English, the letters might make for a further negative reassessment. After all when one is the second worst president, one has to fight tooth and nail anything that would put one below James Buchanan even a collection of letters which may express certain needs in a less than eloquent manner.There is also Nan Britton, who was kind of the Monica Lewinsky of her day. Fortunately for Harding, this story of their affair and daughter did not come to public notice until after he died.Sex scandals were only part of Harding's presidency. The people he selected for high office were the worst kind of cronies, who saw public service as the means to make a raid on the treasury and public property. The worst of these was the Teapot Dome scandal in which national oil reserves were sold to private companies below what would be considered fair market price (in exchange for bribes). This was not Harding's finest hour, but again luckily he was dead when most of these revelations became public. By then stories of bootlegged liquor in the White House, Little Houses on K Street and stock market tips (which proved to be bad ones) had destroyed Harding's reputation forever. This is why Harding is remembered as one of our worst presidents. Long term relationships with near treasonous mistresses and out-of-wedlock children are really just local colour.Harding's presidency was not quite the disaster it might have been, due to the lack of any great national crisis during his presidency. It is fortunate that this mediocre figure was not in power during a war or economic recession. His role could only have been negative as Russell frequently demonstrates. Theodore Roosevelt privately felt that he had had it too easy during his presidency and that had he lived through more trying times as Lincoln did he might have achieved even greater things. Harding is the inverse, had he been really tested, he might have destroyed the republic in the most amiable of fashions.Though the subject of Russell's book is not an important figute, it does serve as a cautionary tale of what can go wrong in the selection of presidents. In 1920, the Republicans would have been better served by nominating Leonard Wood (an associate of Theodore Roosevelt). Russell is a fan of Wood's who is far a more compelling figure. If anything this proves that the reputation of Harding is beyond all hope."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"Forty two men have occupied the oval office as of this writing, and in my opinion, the Harding administration may be the most interesting of all. There is seduction, intrigue, deceit, and dark corruption.Warren Harding was our last true \\"dark horse\\" candidate. Propped to the forefront by the \\"Ohio Gang\\" of Harry Daugherty, Jesse Smith and others, Harding was a friendly, likable and naive one term senator, with a stentorian voice, and the good looks of a Roman praetorian.His story serves as a cautionary tale, and watching the Obama campaign, serves notice that the campaign process, which Harding skipped, toughens up a candidate for the difficulty of the job ahead.Harding was a very popular president to the day he died (in office), but his decline in the estimation of the American public, and in the historians view, was precipitous.Within weeks of his death, stories of corruption emanating from his cabinet hit the newspaper. Harding was not around to defend himself, or to mitigate the damages.Francis Russell wrote this biography in 1968, and it must be called the definitive biography of the 29th president. Russell thoroughly researched and intimately came to know and understand his subject. He sees Harding as a simple man, who rose to a position that was over his limited abilities.There has been little written of Harding, who until recently has been dismissed by most historians as one of our worst presidents. He was a reluctant leader, and surrounded himself with some poor cabinet members. He also had some first rate minds in his midst, including Herbert Hoover, who was considered a wunderkind before his ill-fated presidency, and Andrew Mellon.John Dean wrote a revisionist biography of Harding, and made a compelling case for re-evaluation. However, Dean's words are forever tainted as many remember his involvement with another ill-fated administration.This is a thoughtful, comprehensive and informative biography for any history buff who wants to learn the significance of the Harding character, and the legacy of his presidency."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"Over the last several years I have read around 30 presidential biographies, usually using Amazon readers as my guide to find the best available book. This is certainly my favorite biography of a failed presidency. Many presidents are \\"in over their heads\\" once they become president. Harding was over his head as a senator , if not before. He was a fairly successful small town newspaper publisher and a gregarious glad-hander. Shadow of Blooming Grove lays out all of the sordid details in a highly readable way, connecting the reader to the times. Covered are the rumors of Harding being a mulatto, his marriage to a difficult woman, Ohio politics (which managed to produce about every other president for 60 years), the smoke filled room convention, the cronyism and party life in Washington D.C. , the almost complete involvement of Harding's cabinet in one shady deal after another, and Harding's affairs and his illegitimate child. Amazingly, Harding remained popular with the people as so little of the scandals made it into the press while he is alive.Reading reviews of other Harding books on Amazon and finding that John Dean tries to rehabilitate Harding's reputation is laughable. Personally, Harding is a disaster. As a president he was incompetent, and his administration was rife with corruption.My edition of Shadow of Blooming Grove has a few quotes and half-pages from Harding's love letters to a mistress censored out due to threats of a lawsuit. Even 40 years after his death, his family tried to hang onto to some decency. The censorship just adds to the fun.I highly recommend Shadow of Blooming Grove, a top ten presidential biography."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"The worst of our presidents? That's the usual judgment, but it's hard to say because nothing of real consequence occurred during Harding's two years in office that would have tested his mettle: calling the Washington Conference in 1921 to limit naval armaments, perhaps his biggest (positive) accomplishment, doesn't exactly go down in history as memorable. His reputation, though, much of it hidden from the public until long after his death, is horrendous. He would rather play poker than do anything else, and he revelled in his own pomposity. He fathered a child out of wedlock as a Senator and had other affairs as well. His presidency was one of the most corrupt in history: many of his cabinet cronies were involved in one scandal after another, the biggest being the Teapot Dome affair, which was all about selling off the government's oil reserve to the highest bidders behind everyone's back. Not much to admire, and Russell pulls no punches in expressing his disdain for his subject. The book is solidly written, though it is overly long, especially where Russell goes into Harding's death (food poisoning?) in California. One of the better Presidential biographies out there, however. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times","review":"This is an excellent, detailed, biography, which is very readable.

Harding in His Times","review":"I did not plan to read an entire 650 page book on Harding, but Russell writes so well that I could not stop. It is chock full of very specific insights and details.My favorite part was the nomination process at the deadlocked convention. The bosses decided on Harding, then a senator, as a compromise canidate to break the deadlock and get everyone out of the 95 degree Chicago summer heat. But first, they came to Harding and asked a very modern-sounding question: \\"Is there anything in your background that might embarass the Republican Party?\\" Harding was stunned by the question and asked for some time to think about it. At that time, Harding was having 2 affairs. One was 30 years younger than him and just had his baby which she brought to the Chicago convention to meet her dad. The other, the wife of a friend, was being investigated for spying due to her support for Germany in WWI. And, of course, there were persistent rumors that Harding had Black ancestors. After contemplating his catalog of potential embarassments for 10 minutes, Harding returned and confirmed that his past was clean.His campaign ended up sending his married girlfriend (and her husband) on an all-expenses-paid trip to Japan after the reporters saw Harding's wife throw a waste basket at her. And a secret service agent was assigned to the full-time duty of delivering envelopes of cash to the younger one.Harding was not power hungry and really did not want to be President. He was quite happy with his Senate position, his girl friends, and his drinking buddies. But, the policies that he put in place helped create the Roaring Twenties, even though Calvin Coolidge gets more of the credit. I did not know much about Harding but now I see him fondly as a human who found himself in a position that he never really sought."},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G.

Harding in His Times","review":"With few exceptions, Warren G Harding is always referred to as America's \\"worst president\\" and this book goes to great depths to find out just exactly why.It's no secret now that Warren G. Harding was the William Jefferson Clinton of his day when it came to an eye for the opposite sex. The difference between the two in this regard (which in no way compares their presidencies) is that in Harding's day, no one talked about it, and if they did, absolutely no one wrote about it.Harding was one of the most notorious (and last) of America's \\"selected\\" Presidents, where party bosses met in \\"smokey back rooms\\" and arrived at reasonable compromises. In fact, the author is sympathetic to the reasoning that Harding never had any aspirations on being President and probably could have cared less if he had lost. (It's hard to say he showed any passion in campaigning for the job)Harding was faced with many obstacles besides an inability to keep his zipper up. He doesn't seem to have made the wisest choice in his choosing of a mate, in fact, according to the author, she appears to be the one who had true aspirations for the presidency.Harding was dogged throughout the campaign by rumors that he was of African-American descent, something that his relatives still seem intent on fighting to this day. What does appear to be true is the fact that the family were devout abolitionists and served on the Underground Railroad.Harding's most prominent flaw seems to be his affability, something that many had assumed at the time to be his dominant strength. His inability to call his friends to task, allowed them to run free with the power of the Federal government.His death will be controversial for years to come, and the author does little to truly answer the question of murder vs. food poisioning, but his presidency remains notorious. If simply for the fact that is considered \\"the worst.\\""},{"Title":"The Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G.

Not so - a comprehensive review of the man, the character and the foibles are well presented. Excellent weave of the inscrutable strands of political fate that lead such an ordinary individual to presidential office.

The name &quot;shadow of blooming grove&quot; apparently refers to a rumour that he had black ancestors, if this is true then Jesse Jackson can sit down because we have had a black president.Harding has been sighted as the worst of American presidents. he was currupt(teapot dome) and he cheated on his wife and he was not interested in foriegn policy and the country suffered internal strife during his administration(the communists were on the loose).Now this book helps bring Harding to life, to let us understand his roots, the bigotry against him and his presidency.

This was practically the opportunity of the first park rangers to live at the canyon. Famous explorers and scientists had come and gone from the Grand Canyon and written their reports, but they seldomed stayed there any length of time. The rangers who came with the establishment of Grand Canyon National Park in 1919 were the first naturalists to live their lives there, and there was still plenty to explore, plenty of unknown geology, biology, and botany. Within a few years after 1919 these rangers were writing down their discoveries and experiences at the canyon, basically figuring out what this place was all about and how visitors could best experience it. 1919 was also much closer to the age of Humboldt and Muir, when natural historians were adventurers and heroes and seers, expected to speak both science and poetry.

He has focused on the lives of saints in the past and he does so once more in this imagined tale of Pascual, the patron saint of cooks and the kitchen.Beginning with Pascual's birth when angels sang his mother and father regarded their son with both pride and awe. At first, his father thought the boy might grow up to be a shepherd because of the tender care he took of sheep. But when he reached young manhood Pascual announced that he wanted &quot;to be a friar and help feed people who are hungry.&quot;So, his parents sent him to the monastery of Saint Francis. Imagine Pascual's surprise when the friars asked him to prepare dinner. Why, he didn't even know how to boil water! One thing Pascual did know how to do was pray. Amazing things began to happen when Pascual closed his eyes and knelt on the kitchen floor.Young readers will relate to Pascual and to the cheery art panels that bring the tale to life.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Pascual and the Kitchen Angels","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

McDougall. She also contributes an introduction and a preface. McDougall notes that Bei Dao is the pen name of Zhao Zhenkai, who was born in Beijing in 1949. McDougall adds that he was one of China's \\"underground poets of the seventies,\\" and that he was \\"in involuntary exile abroad\\" at the time she wrote her preface (1989). I found this to be a compelling volume of poetry. Bei Dao's work is often quite sad and haunting, and at times very passionate and beautiful. Particularly interesting is his use of parallel structures in his poems. He uses a rich variety of different parallel forms; this structural diversity brings a continual freshness and vitality to the book as a whole.Bei Dao makes frequent use of nature imagery--a mountain range, a snowflake, lightning, wild geese, the \\"rustle of wind through the grass,\\" etc. At times his work has a haiku-like quality. But he also uses very concrete phenomena from the human world in his poems: a lavatory wall, the wail of a fire engine, \\"a silent cigarette.\\" His voice in some poems sounds like that of an iconoclastic prophet--a tragic outsider who remains engaged with humanity and who challenges us to look at the world with a fresh new perspective. His imagery is often quite startling; consider such lines as \\"a baked fish dreaming of the sea\\" and \\"piles of endlessly bickering books.\\"Some standout poems in the collection are as follows. \\"Hello, Baihua Mountain\\": an invigorating poem with great nature imagery. \\"You Said\\": interesting use of dialogue within one of his parallel structures. \\"The Artist's Life\\": beginning with the line \\"Go and buy a radish,\\" this poem has a satiric, even absurdist flavor. \\"Resume\\": another poem with a strong satiric flavor. \\"Language\\": a critique of language and rational thought. \\"Smiles, Snowflakes, Tears\\": evoking a sense of wonder and beauty, this poem reminded me of Pablo Neruda's \\"Book of Questions.\\" But my favorite poem in the collecton is definitely \\"The Orange is Ripe.\\" With a particularly well-crafted parallel structure, this poem appeals to both the senses and the emotions."},{"Title":"The August Sleepwalker","review":"dao's poetry may be difficult for the reader of conventional poetry to comprehend at first, but any sustained concentration on his verse reveals what he is really doing: rather than creating poetic stories or boring political drivel, he is creating images and sensations of the imagination, things that can only 'be' because of the word. if one were to categorize him permanently, which i would be hesitant to do, he would fall into the surrealist camp. he is a poet of the inner world rather the outer. there is a pessimism in his poems that some will find repulsive, others attractive. great stuff"},{"Title":"Bulletin boards that communicate: Creative ideas for the congregation","review":"This book is very complete in providing from start to finish all the aspects of creating something special with a bulletin board rather than just filling space. It walks you through the beginning thoughts and ideas you should consider before actually beginning. It addresses all different types of backgrounds - encouraging the reader to think of even more. The book then delves into creating the borders so that there again, they are not just outlining the bulletin board, they enhance the overall message - they frame it in a truly appealing way that compliments and draws attention to the entire board. Don't stop now; the book discusses all types of lettering and how/when to utilize it. Last but not least, the reader is encouraged to expound on the ideas provided for capturing passer-by's attention with a vast amount of ideas to use rather than always just construction paper. The remainder of the book has full bulletin board ideas for all areas to be covered while dressing a bulletin board through seasons and activities within the church, as well as enhancing normal week-to-week, month-to-month functions. For me, relatively new to bulletin board dressing, this book has been very helpful! I would recommend it to novice board dressers at a minimum. Anyone would glean helpful information from this!"},{"Title":"The Plains Indians (Elma Dill Russell Spencer Series in the West and Southwest)","review":"Completely enjoyed this book, well written, thoughtful, easy to read, concise, without boring you with tedious detail, a overview of the plains Indians, who they were, how they lived, many interesting facts, stories, and loads of great history.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Secrets Of Vesuvius (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Roman Mysteries (Prebound))","review":"Thefirst bookof Caroline Lawrence's \\"Roman Mysteries\\" series ended with a brilliant sequel hook: a scene in which the characters make plans to spend the summer in Pompeii. Keeping in mind that the year is 79AD, and that the village in which they intend to stay is at the base of Mount Vesuvius, it didn't take a genius to figure out what historical event would make up the crux of \\"The Secrets of Vesuvius.\\"Our four young protagonists (Roman Flavia, Jewish Jonathan, African Nubian and tongue-less, runaway Lupus) sail across the Bay of Naples to Flavia's uncle's farmhouse, along with various parents, siblings and servants. But before they leave, the quartet assist an elderly man in an overturned rowboat off the coast of Ostia, and find to Flavia's delight that he's none other than the famed Admiral Pliny.Grateful for their help, and hearing that they're about to depart for Pompeii, Pliny shares a story and a riddle with the children. Last time he was in Pompeii he noticed the riddle on the wall of a blacksmith's shop, and the blacksmith himself promised Pliny a great treasure should he be able to solve it. The children are naturally excited by the news, and on their arrival in Pompeii they immediately set about trying to crack the riddle and find the mysterious blacksmith - known only as Vulcan.Vulcan's life mirrors that of the Roman god from whom his nick-name is derived, right down to his mysterious parentage and his deformed feet. As opposed to the singular whodunit of the previous book, the mystery at work in \\"The Secrets of Vesuvius\\" keeps changing. Faced with the dual task of understanding the riddle and helping Vulcan find his true parents, Lawrence also throws in a secret admirer for Jonathan's sister Miriam. Most of the book is concerned with the interplay of these mini-mysteries, and although there are a few unexpected twists in regards to their resolutions, they don't provide the feeling of satisfaction that one gets on completing a mystery well-told. The riddle in particular is the least interesting part of the book, and has very little bearing on the rest of the story.It is the subject of the volcano that really picks up the quality of the book. The characters are acutely aware of the signs and portends occurring all around them: earthquakes, dying birds, mad dogs, ominous dreams, but it's not until the volcano itself begins to erupt that they are all caught in a race to flee the city before it's too late. Suspenseful and terrifying, in which the core group must separate in order to seek out help and rescue others, these chapters are what make the book worth the read.As always, Lawrence's research is both accurate and integrated into the text in such a way that it feels natural to the story instead of just swaths of exposition. In particular, the characterization of the historical Pliny and the effects of the volcano are rendered in such a way that you're pulled directly into the action, atmosphere, and panic of those involved in the disaster. Lawrence has a firm grasp on her characters and the ways in which they interact with one another, whether it be Flavia's appreciation of beauty, Nubia's quiet wisdom, Jonathan's skeptical intellect or Lupus's foolhardy bravery. Once you can get past the unlikelihood of a friendship existing between a slave/master/girl/boy, the bond that these characters share and the way in which they bounce off each other's strengths and weaknesses is immensely rewarding.Ending on more of a cliff-hanger than is usual for this series, with plenty of characters unaccounted for, readers will definitely want the next in the series (The Pirates of Pompeii) nearby."},{"Title":"The Secrets Of Vesuvius (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Roman Mysteries (Prebound))","review":"Sequel to Thieves of Ostia: A Roman Mystery.

The four friends find themselves trying to solve a riddle but strange things are going on. Birds are dropping to the ground dead. Dogs are howling and barking for no apparent reason. And people are going mad.I liked this book because it is filled with action on every page. When Mt. Vesuvius erupts Flavia and her friends have to get help... Flavia sends two of her friends to get help, but they encounter a problem. One of the friends is knocked out cold, so it is up to the other friend to swim a great distance to get help. All the while Flavia, Jonathan and Nubia are trying to stay alive until they are saved.If you like action, adventure, suspense with a little history throw in, this second book in the series will keep you reading ten pages every night.

She resolves to discover why. Soon, she and her friends are cast deep into a web of decit, love, and misplaced loyalties.Flavia and Johnathan find out where the children are, as they too are kidnapped, and must find a way to escape before they are sold as slaves. The story also brings you closer to finding out the secret of Lupus' past."},{"Title":"The Secrets Of Vesuvius (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Roman Mysteries (Prebound))","review":"The Secrets of Vesuvius (I will be deliberately vague in order not to give away the plot of the book) picks up where The Thieves of Ostia left off, transporting us to Pompeii in the middle of August 79 C.E. The mystery is rather subtle this time - a riddle that leads to treasure but something of a different kind than Flavia Gemina anticipates. Actually, there is an additional mystery concerning the identity of a new character to the story.The real joy of this book for me is the Elder Pliny being fleshed out as the inquisitive and curious person that he undoubtedly was. We meet him on several occasions and the children interact with him at great deal.Caroline Lawrence provides a marvelous tour of Pompeii and her attention to the details of everyday life is engaging as always. I have read Robert Harris' novel about Pompeii (which I highly recommend) with its meticulous information about Mount Vesuvius. We have a different vantage point in this book as the characters discover from environmental changes and historic accounts that Vesuvius is about to erupt. The course of the eruption itself is nicely told as some of the characters stay at the Gemina farm and some travel across Pompeii in an attempt to save friends and warn the people in general. We get an excellent perspective on how terrible the eruption of Vesuvius was, the kind of hazards people ran attempting to escape and what their options were to get away from danger. All of the characters in the book are profoundly affected by the tragedy and a few require the services of Doctor Mordecai.To sum up, The Secrets of Vesuvius is a mystery novel that adults and children can equally share and learn about Pompeii and life for the ancient Romans. Certainly after reading this book you will be eager for the next installment."},{"Title":"The Secrets Of Vesuvius (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Roman Mysteries (Prebound))","review":"In The Secret's of Vesuvius, the second in Lawrence's Roman Mysteries Series, we rejoin Flavia, Nubia, Jonathan, and Lupus as they travel from Ostia to the Bay of Naples to spend the summer with Flavia's uncle (who just happens to live near Pompeii). This volume is also set in the first century, 79 A.D. and as the story starts, they rescue Admeral Pliny whose boat sank while he was out working on a new scroll. He gives them a \\"mystery riddle\\" to solve (which in fact is the least interesting part of the book) and then they head off to the uncle's farm (picture given of the farm grounds in the front of the book, excellent detail about life in Rome...a big plus for the book). The character lineup (outside of the main characters) include:Uncle Gaius - Flavia's uncle and twin to her fatherAristo - Falvia's Greek TutorVulcan - Roman God of the Forge (and volcano's), also character in story, traveling blacksmith whose life mirrors the story of the God, he is looking for his real parentsMiriam - Sister of Jonathan and daughter of MordecaiFerox - Uncle Gaius favorite dogClio - New friend and one of the nine (adopted) daughters (named after the 9 muses) of Titus Tascius Pomponianus of the Villa PomponianaMordecai - Jonathan's fatherXanthus, the farm manager and freedman of Uncle GaiusRectina - Titus' wife and adoptive mother of ClioHighlights of The Secret's of Vesuvius include a tour of the Forum, struggles and suspicion between Roman's and Christians...in this book it is discussed several times about how the Christian religion is banned and illegal and we see people practicing it and meeting in secret (which readers will get to witness \\"first hand\\" later in the book; the use of Asine (jackass) a code word used by Christians to identify other Christians; and most importantly, an adventure where tremors shake the ground, animals behave strangely, and the people dream of impending doom! Our intrepid adventurers get to explore vineyards, celebrate the Roman festival of Vulcanalia, travel on a merchant ship, and try to escape the eruption of Vesuvius.Overall, this was a highly enjoyable mystery/thriller/adventure book for young readers that is heavy on the details of Roman daily life (this time of farm and country life as opposed to city life in the last book), is highly descriptive with likable and believable characters (for the most part). This time around, the mystery is less intriguing and very easy to figure out...that is with regards to the \\"riddle,\\" the larger \\"mystery\\" of the blacksmith and Titus/Rectina. My only \\"complaints\\" would be the heavy handed Christian message that comes through, while not so bad that it makes for unpleasant reading, it is something to be aware of. This combined with the forced equality between Nubia, Flavia, the beggar boy and Jonathan makes the whole thing just slightly cringe worthy...however, I still feel it's a good read and something I think most kids will get a kick out of, I certainly did. I give it four stars, The Secret's of Vesuvius strength is in details, particularly about how the farm is run and the eruption of the volcano. Overall, it is a light and entertaining read despite its flaws."},{"Title":"The Secrets Of Vesuvius (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Roman Mysteries (Prebound))","review":"The secret of vesuvius:the roman mysteries is an exellent book if you like mysteries its really good.

I found myself caring about what happened to each of them throughout the book, concerned for their safety and well-being during the dangerous moments. After becoming aquianted with these characters in Ms. Lawrence's first book\\" The Thieves of Ostia\\", I was already aware of how addicting her stories can become. I found myself continuing to read just to find out how a character got out of a situation or to see if my summation of the mystery was correct. My ten-year old son was reading \\"The Thieves of Ostia\\" while I was finishing up \\" The Secrets of Vesuvius\\", and my husband couldn't talk to either of us until we were finished with a chapter! \\"The Secrets of Vesuvius\\" enchants with romance, thrills with danger and illustrates the miracles of friendship.

But a pleasant visit to her uncle outside Pompeii finds them all in danger from a supposedly dormant volcano.Apart from the improbabilities common in juvenile fiction, such as Flavia conveniently having three friends representing different races, religions, and social statuses, this started as an enjoyable story. I was appalled to read about a young woman wearing an engagement ring and wondered where Lawrence acquired her reputation for historical accuracy. Guess what? Romans did use engagement rings. More serious was the lack of a satisfying ending. I was not surprised that Lawrence didn't manage a happy ending to a story set around the destruction of Pompeii, but the failure of the \\"heroes\\" to rescue everyone is more complex emotionally than is suitable for a juvenile audience. Nor does the soap-opera who-is-the-real-father plot reflect values I would have wanted my children reading about at that age. I don't understand why authors like to pull real people into fictional stories; wondering how accurate or fanciful the portrayal is distracts me from the story. The title bears little relationship to the plot. The only overall praise I can give this book is that it is historically accurate and it kept me reading all the way to the vague and unsatisfying end."},{"Title":"The Secrets Of Vesuvius (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Roman Mysteries (Prebound))","review":"My family has read every book in this Roman Mysteries series.

I've never had any complaints about Dover's coloring books, and this one is no exception. The artist, Christy Shaffer, has an amazing imagination.

Matsumoto convincingly analyse a gap in Japanese noun-modifying clauses, since Japanese makes extensive use argues that, contrary to relative clauses in European languages, there is no need to of zero anaphora. In Japanese, a clause can still be grammatical, even if no noun phrase at all is expressed in it.Also contrary to relative clauses in European languages, is the fact that the interpretation of Japanese noun-modifying clauses is not restricted by syntactic constraints. The same noun-modifying clause constructions can be interpreted differently according to different contexts in which they are uttered. Sometimes a noun-modifying clause can only be interpreted successfully by a hearer, if the hearer shares the same knowledge about the world as the speaker.In this book, Matsumoto presents a framework that explains very clearly how listeners are able to interpret utterances containing noun-modifying constructions in Japanese. Matsumoto divides Japanese noun-modifying clause constructions into three types, depending on which part of the construction plays the role of host in its construal. In The first type the modifying clause construction the clause is the host, i.e. it provides the key semantic information to interpret the construction. In the second type, the modified noun is the host, and in the third type, the clause and the noun are both the host."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Chaucer (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","review":"First of all, some of the companions have contained rather insightful and interesting essays--the companion to Plato's Republic was quite good. I was disappointed in the Chaucer companion (as I am with the Spenser) in that it attempts too wide a breadth in approaching the literature--some of the essays felt like summaries, while others seem to draw counter-intuitive or otherwise irritating conclusions concerning \\"meaning\\" of the texts. A good deal of attention is paid to historicist criticism which, unfortunately, is the current academic trend. Perhaps if Cambridge and the editors (Boitani's essay on the Parliament of Fowls was particularly uninspired) did not object to the morally questionable act of publishing a book full of summaries and historical essays (and doing this for the majority of canonical authors) they would spend time producing solid works of criticism and collating these into respectable collections. If you want information on Chaucer, seek out the Chaucer Bibliography Online and locate the books through your school library. If the Cambridge Companion is your only feasible option for secondary criticism, take it with a grain of salt. These books should not be assigned to anyone doing graduate or post-graduate study."},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to Chaucer (Cambridge Companions to Literature)","review":"Great book that I am using now. It is very beneficial to literature classes."},{"Title":"Different Hours: Poems","review":"For a couple of decades Stephen Dunn's poems have been a source of insight and solace best described by the title of one of his books, &quot;Local Time.&quot;His focus is often the complex and absorbing relationships between lovers, family members, friends, opponents - how art/nature are both incidental and intrinsic to the lives we lead.This book is a masterful rendering of time - imagined and compelling in each gesture. To read &quot;Different Hours&quot; as philosophy is to miss the artful storytelling. And yet it is not without a subtle nod to philosophy with its tough-minded admissions, its gentle refusals.Like the great Stanley Kunitz, Dunn's music is pianissimo, say along the lines of an astringent Schumann opus - a pared-down Scriabin etude.Read the book for its many rewards. It is simply exquisite."},{"Title":"Different Hours: Poems","review":"Few poets achieve such a plainspoken poignancy as Mr. Dunn. I think of Cavafy, C.K. Williams, Philip Larkin, Horace -- masters of the craft gifted with the knack for discovering scraps of truth within the simplest words. \\"You might as well be a clown/big silly clothes, no evidence of desire,\\" Dunn suggests in the book's opening poem. This is the language that gets you clawing through the pages to get to the lines that know you, that approve of some private cowardice or failure you wouldn't dare confess even to the closest friend.But there is a kind of trust Dunn builds with the reader here, a wisdom so simple yet complicated enough that you could not quite have put your finger on it as quickly or accurately as he. I mean how his poems know that \\"as we fall in love/we are already falling out of it.\\" How they resist self-pity in the face of fate: \\"Because in my family the heart goes first/and hardly anybody makes it out of his fifties/I think I'll stay up late with a few bandits of my choice and resist good advice.\\" It is the sort of statement that gets me flying out of my chair pumping my fist as though I'm cherring on the home team at a high school football game. I am happy for the speaker of these poems the way I was happy for Hulk Hogan as a kid. Dave Smith writes that Dunn may not be correct, but he is never wrong. Mr. Smith, himself a phenomenal and overlooked American poet, is exactly right: Dunn's voice is unafraid, skeptical, warm, consoling, bitter, celebratory and -- most of all -- accurate.Books like \\"Different Hours\\" become \\"tombstones on our lives\\" as James Merrill says of love. I know that is true of my own experience with it. I was in a Virgin Records, still reeling from an atrocious break-up whose pain refused to leave me. The book collection upstairs was as miserable as I was at the moment; shelves so poorly stacked that it seemed the store was about to do away with selling books altogether. But then a dark and vibrant cover caught my eye; a book by someone named Stephen Dunn whom I had not only never heard of but who also happened to have won the Pulitzer. In the terrible frame of mine I was in that afternoon, I needed nothing more than to listen to what these poems had to say:Those Trotskys of relationships,perpetual revolution their motto,their impatient heartsdangerous to all that's complacent,I understand them perfectlyand also why someone they've left behindmight travel all the way to Mexicowith a pickaxe to put an end to things.Coming across these poems for the first time, it felt as though they were spoken from somewhere inside of me, scratched into my skin; lines that were extended hands strong enough to pull me out of the dark. If angels are not physical presences, then they are actions. They are moments like these in which you hear your name called from a poorly stocked bookshelf in a record store and stumble upon the road that takes you to who you are. Though I am no longer a captive of the bitter junkyard that was my heart at that time, I have never stopped enjoying these poems. I read over \\"Different Hours\\" as well as Dunn's \\"Loosestrife\\" and \\"Selected Poems\\" to this day. Taken as a whole, Dunn's work is one of the most reliable and compassionate friends I have ever had."},{"Title":"Different Hours: Poems","review":"I first picked this book up before a class where we studied the Odyssey and while at the Columbia Bookstore I randomly opened the book up to 'Odysseus's Secret,' a poem that takes the Odysseus story and makes it applicable to the way with which we live our lives, moving with and dealing with the twists and turns that make us who we are. Suffice it to say after reading that I bought it immediately. After reading some of the other poems, most especially 'The Reverse Side,' I fell in love with this and can see why it was chosen to win the Pulitzer. The poetry uses such sparse language, yet conveys and addresses some of the major hurdles we deal with in life.

I've read many of Dunn's other collections, and have not been as impressed. This has nothing to do with the little gold stamp on the corner of the cover, either. The poems are well-balanced, and make you feel like Dunn has revealed something about his subject that is just under the surface - whether it be aging, weather, or nostalgic memories. The feeling is similar to being around someone with a skill not your own, like playing basketball with someone who, unlike you, can dunk. Unlike myself, and many writers I've read, Dunn is skilled in explaining feelings and observations in ways that actually make you feel like you've learned something about yourself.Quite simply, reading poems like Zero Hour, Dog Weather, and others, will cause you to experience the ordinary in a new way that is both foreign and addictive."},{"Title":"Different Hours: Poems","review":"Stephen Dunn won the Pulitzer in 2001 for his collection of poetry, Different Hours.

His poetry offers little for those searching for the next step but he seems to say there is no next step. For Dunn the truth is bland, ordinary, and frightenly hopeless. Dunn suggests we are all heading towards an abysmal oblivion. Some say he has the courage to look at reality. I know him and I say he could use some prozac or a good dose of the real truth; the eternal peace within all of us. But hey, it's like finding a needle in a hey stack.

The author hear divides underemployment into four parts: those with no job, those with a job beneath their qualifications, those working part-time who could work full-time, and those getting paid unconscionable salaries and then asks how this affects three Asian-American groups: Indians, Filipinos, and the Vietnamese.The author is diverse in choosing these groups, they are both yellow and brown, South Asian and Southeast Asian. The groups came to the United States at differing times, in differing numbers, and for differing reasons. The author also looks at how gender, years in the US, college education, and other factors affect this data. Her point is that Asian Americans are not in better positions than European Americans as some falsely argue.While I loved this book's subject, the actual reading was painful. Only number crunchers would enjoy this book. She could have been discussing issues about which I don't care as boring as most of this read. I also wonder if the Census Bureau now has computer programs that could generate this info in a few minutes compared to someone actually getting a Ph.D. through presenting this info. This book felt so impersonal. Firstly, the author describes Asian immigration in terms that I don't think underscored the racism and imperialism that these groups faced. Second, when Apu spoke of being the top of his graduate class but still working at the Quik-E-Mart, I related more to a cartoon character than the dull info presented here.This topic is timely and important. However, this book is only for hardcore statisticians, not for round-the-way anti-racist activists, readers, and thinkers."},{"Title":"Meaning in English : An Introduction to Language Study","review":"This is well meaning, but unfortunately a bit dull.

Her parents had read it to her as a child, she thought it was the most wonderful story she had ever heard. Now that I am a homeschooling parent I have to agree with my friend. The book was written in the mid 1930's by the headmaster of Calvert School, V.M. Hillyer.It has been updated over the decades so its contents are current. Throughout the book there are illustrations which in my opinion are works of art which add to the story. We are currently reading this story to our 5 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it! I would highly recommend this book as a read aloud for family reading or for your own personal enrichment."},{"Title":"A Child's History of the World","review":"I first encountered this gem of a book when I decided to home educate my children for a few years, and it came with my daughter's fourth grade Calvert School kit. Yes, it is European ethnocentric and there are the references to god, but our family was and remains enlightened enough and able to explain *context* even to children.Whether you are a bible thumper or dedicated atheist, or somewhere in between, don't discount this book just because of your beliefs! There is much that is amazing and simply golden in this book. As a historian, I cannot think of a better way to introduce Western Civilization to a child. The storybook format is a real winner with kids, and if you're reading it to them aloud, as I did, well, play editor as you go along! Or take the time to explain the context of the times in which it was written.I will be ordering another copy of this book, as my original copy was stolen by some rather sneaky and acquisitive ex-inlaws (you know who you are!).This book is a don't miss.

Although God is mentioned as having existed before the world was in existence, God is not mentioned in the formation of the earth or creation of plants, animals, people. Instead, the author gives an account which sounds a lot like evolution even though the author doesn't use this terminology.

It encompasses the history of the entire planet, and in the process creates a sense of respect for the tribulations and achievements of all cultures. So, this book was, and is, way ahead of its time.I first read (and reread) \\"A Child's History of the World\\" when I was a child. Ever since, through the decades of my adult life, it has (in distinct excerpts that were pertinent to the given circumstances) floated through my mind as I encountered real-life situations that might not have been resolved as constructively, if at all, without Hillyer's lessons-by-example from the way things were not all that long ago.For example, there must have been reasons why Alfred the Great was a uniquely successful king under very trying circumstances. Hillyer suggests the answer in a way you remember the rest of your life.Through this book, you can discover remarkable achievements in virtually every substantive culture world-wide, and realize that common ground is there for anyone interested in seeking (and sharing) it.If you have an interest in resolving the challenges of this world, here is a good place to start.Thank you, posthumously, Mr. Hillyer, for a life-time reward in the form of a remarkable children's book."},{"Title":"A Child's History of the World","review":"I wish the other 2 reviewers had mentioned that this is not a secular book.Pg. 56 - \\"Now Abraham believed in one God, as we do, while his neighbors, the Babylonians, worshiped many gods and the heavenly bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, as I have just said.\\"Pg. 65 - \\"The Greeks believed in many gods, not in one God, as we do and as the Jews do, and their gods were more like people in fairy tales than like divine beings.\\"Pg. 255 - \\"A that time some English slaves were being sold in the slave-market in Rome.

I decided to pre-read it to see how it was, because a lot of people had mentioned problems with it.Boy, were they right!You can't read a single chapter without finding an inaccuracy. The tone of the book is condescending. The viewpoint is emphatically Christian. I know some Christian home-schoolers have complained that the book isn't Christian enough, but what they seem to mean is that it doesn't hold to their anti-evolutionary ideas. I have the most recent edition and much of the racism in the prior editions has been removed, but this is absolutely not a secular resource, not can it be easily secularized. Later in the book, as it gets into modern times, the text is not longer the story of history but rather a litany of atrocities.

It is because the Calvert curriculum is superior in every other subject (math, science, literature) that the history book sticks out like a sore thumb.\\"A Child's History of the World\\" is as bad (or perhaps worse) than the \\"history\\" my daughter endured from Calvert in 3rd grade. Here is an example from page 5: \\"...before this, there was a time when there was NO WORLD AT ALL! No world at all! Only the stars, and God, who made the stars.\\"You've got to be kidding me. If you're trying to market your Calvert Homsechooling program as non-religious (which they do), you're going to want to take the references to God out of the history book and put it in a religion book where it belongs. Also, they might want to think about removing the cross next to Christ's notation from the timeline on page xxi. It's a bit Christo-centric, especially since I don't see any other world religious figures on the timeline with their religious symbol next to their names (i.e. Mohammad, Siddhartha Gautama, etc.)My other strong objection is the Euro-centric focus of this book. A child reading this book would think that nothing ever happened in any other part of the world except Europe since the beginning of time. I noticed this bias in last year's \\"history\\" as well. Where are the underground terra cotta armies of the Shang dynasty? Where is the contribution of Arabic mathematicians of the concept of zero?

I didn't find it to be either pro-Christianity or anti-Christianity."},{"Title":"A Child's History of the World","review":"Harsh as it sounds, I would like to make the argument that no matter how much children enjoy it, this book is still a very bad idea. The biggest problem with it is its overtly racist framework, something that may have seemed perfectly all right when it was first written in the 1920's, but that is quite shocking today. The author is very clear at the outset about who \\"we\\" are: white Christians of European descent. And the word he uses - which even the 1947 revision does not cut - is \\"Aryan\\", an imaginary racial category that reached its peak of popularity in Nazi Germany.The author carefully explains that there were \\"just three different white families, and from these families all the white people in the world are descended\\". Although the book does not explicitly say so, these three families, the Aryans, the Semites, and the Hamites, are presumably descended from the three sons of Noah. (For the discredited 19th-century racist origins of this theory, see [..].) The paragraph that has stayed in my mind since I first found a copy of this book 20 years ago runs:\\"If your name is Henry or Charles or Wiliam, you are probably an Aryan.\\"If it is Moses or Solomon, you are probably a Semite.\\"If it is Shufu or Rameses, you are probably a Hamite.\\"According to Mr. Hillyer, all the major civilizations of the world have been created by white people (the inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent are helpfully identified as white). Although Confucius and the Buddha get respectful nods, the civilizations of Asia are not worth mentioning. When Asians do come into the story, they appear as \\"tribes of yellow people\\" led by \\"terrible fighters\\" like Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan, who wanted to \\"wipe off the face of the earth all white people and everything that white people had ever built.\\" Russians, indeed, are suspect, because \\"although they were white people, they were living so close to the yellow people in China that they had become much like them in many of their ways.\\" And astonishingly, for a book that was written in Baltimore in the twentieth century, people of African descent simply do not exist. The author muses that \\"we don't know how nor when nor where colored people first lived, though it is interesting to guess,\\" and that's the end of it.Racism aside, the other main problem with the book is gross inaccuracy. According to the author, humans did not discover fire until long after they had been hunting with stone spears and painting magnificent pictures on cave walls (with charcoal among other things.) And almost immediately after the discovery of fire, they discovered copper and tin and the Bronze Age began. But only in the Tigris and Euphrates valley and along the Nile (where the white people lived); everyone else was still living in caves.Things get better as the book goes along, but there are still plenty of instances in which myth is presented as historical fact. (I leave out the chapters in which the Old Testament is treated as literal history, since I know that many readers of this review will not share my views on that issue.) People in Columbus' time did not actually believe the world was flat. George Washington did not actually chop down the cherry tree. And printing and gunpowder were not actually invented in Europe, but were known in China hundreds of years earlier. But all of these tales are treated as fact. The chapter on Gutenberg starts out with the sentence, \\"Up to this time there was not a printed book in the whole world\\" - although this month's National Geographic contains a picture of a printed Chinese book from the ninth century. In addition, both the Reformation and the American Revolution were apparently due entirely to resentment over taxes. The great ideals of human freedom and equality and democratic self-government - certainly the most inspiring parts of the American story that I told my children - are considered too advanced for the readers of this book.True, children love stories about people, and the stories in this book are charmingly told, if your children don't mind the condescending tone. And true, they stick in your brain. Many years ago I had a children's history book rather similar to this one, and what sticks in my brain about Elizabeth I of England - arguably the greatest ruler in European history - is that she was very vain and had lots of dresses. Hillyer improves on this picture, but only very slightly. His Elizabeth is still vain, and has lots of lovers (!), but she does manage to defeat the Spanish Armada. Hillyer is so impressed by this that he considers her \\"more man than woman\\", and jokingly calls her \\"King Elizabeth.\\" Is there some reason that we are still sending this message to our daughters?I'll grant you that it's a good thing for children to have heard of Pericles, Louis XIV and Peter the Great. The Italian Renaissance gets a chapter, there is commendable attention to the contributions of the Muslim civilization of the Middle Ages, and there is at least one hint that not all the motives of the Crusaders were entirely admirable. But in general, most \\"world history\\" happened in Europe, and after the Renaissance it generally involved English-speaking people. Among the missing pieces are the era of European colonization, slavery, the Industrial Revolution, the continent of South America both before and after the Spanish conquest, and the entire history of Native Americans.I would argue that even for small children, a view of \\"the world\\" that completely leaves out the voices and experiences of non-white and non-English-speaking people, that in fact treats most of them as if they are either strange \\"yellow races\\" or just not worth noticing, is potentially crippling in the twenty-first century. It conditions its readers to see people who are not just like them as alien, incomprehensible, and vaguely frightening - \\"them\\" rather than \\"us\\". Attention, homeschoolers: your children will be growing up into a world, and a country, full of people not just like them. In order to function in that world they will need some understanding of, and respect for, the different experiences of those people.

It seemed to me as if I had written the book myself in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience.\\"-Emerson in his journalI use the above quote from Emerson because it describes exactly how I felt when I opened this little book. Despite what other reviewers have claimed, the editor does make it explicit in his introduction that these selections are edited down for ease of reading:\\"I realized that an abridged edition of his essays could introduce Emerson, and make his down-to-earth wisdom accessible to a readership that might otherwise be put off by his sometimes long, difficult, and overwritten passages.\\"This approach was perfect for me. If I had been exposed to Emerson's writing in its full strength, it may have been too much. Emerson's work does not lend itself to casual reading. Not only because the depth of his ideas but the vernacular he uses to explain them. Do not be disheartened though if you find his work abstruse. Many of his contemporaries who heard his lectures, which he later distilled into his written essays, had difficulty understanding him too.In my case, this little book fulfilled the editor's stated goal. It won me over instantly and I have been an adherent of Emerson ever since.If one is seeking to read Emerson unedited be sure to check out the Library of America collection of his works.Emerson: Essays and Lectures: Nature: Addresses and Lectures / Essays: First and Second Series / Representative Men / English Traits / The Conduct of Life (Library of America)Also, Harvard University Press is publishing an annotated collection of his essays which drops in February 2012. This is one I am really looking forward to adding to my Emerson collection.The Annotated Emerson"},{"Title":"Self-Reliance: The Wisdom of Ralph Waldo Emerson as Inspiration for Daily Living","review":"This is an excellent book for use as a daily meditation. I understand how he has inspired great thinkers throughout time. It takes Emerson's work and does not change the essence but brings the language up to date. What a wonderful addition to anyone's daily readings. I have adapted one of his ideals as my yearly mantra \\" Adopt the pace of nature, her secret is patience.\\" Emerson is a profound thinker who brought us to where we are today. It is sad that so many are immersed in ignorance. He addresses that too. Wish it were available in hard back. It's a keeper."},{"Title":"Self-Reliance: The Wisdom of Ralph Waldo Emerson as Inspiration for Daily Living","review":"when i was in college, RWE literally saved my life. when i thought i was crazy for the ideas swimming around in my head, he showed me i was just connected into something greater than just my immediate surroundings. now that i am 45 years old, it was nice to reconnect with the words that changed my outlook on the world. this book was like sitting down and having conversations with an old friend. the book is broken into 1/2-page and 1-page chunks. it is very easy to grab the book, spend 10 or 20 minutes, and reenter this crazy world with a fresh and enlightened face. keep it in your car, your purse, your briefcase, your backpack, or next to your bed. you'll reach for it often."},{"Title":"Self-Reliance: The Wisdom of Ralph Waldo Emerson as Inspiration for Daily Living","review":"Didn't realize this was written by someone other than Emerson. I wanted his writings, not somebody else's interpretation of them."},{"Title":"Self-Reliance: The Wisdom of Ralph Waldo Emerson as Inspiration for Daily Living","review":"I note one of the descriptions provided by Amazon reviews mentions something like \\"[By providing just the most inspiring passages from each essay, the author makes Emerson more accessible and inspiring to the reader.\\" Emerson is often quoted as he did come with some beautiful language. But, to really judge Emerson, I think it is crucial to read, for example, the entire essay \\"Self-Reliance\\" and \\"Love\\". These essays are short, and quite passionately written. Amazingly, Emerson's \\"Transcendentalism\\" is exactly the same as \\"The Secret\\" and the Law of Attraction, and also Carl Jung's concepts of Universal Spirit / Collective Consciousness. The problem is that Emerson's views expressed in essays such as \\"Self Reliance\\" and \\"Love\\" are incredibly inconsistent, and they are greatly inconsistent, over and over again, when compared to other famous speeches he gave such as \\"The Nature of Man\\", I believe. Emerson is famous for having written, in \\"Self Reliance\\", \\"Inconsistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\\", in other words, don't be afraid to be inconsistent as that is what \\"Great Men\\", as he calls them, must do. Many people glorify this aspect of Emerson as meaning he provides us with paradoxes. For you to judge his value as a spiritual or life guidepost, you just cannot rely only on excerpts; which, probably have been selected because they are beautifully written but, by only selecting certain excerpts, this author can avoid revealing Emerson's fatal inconsistencies. Emerson's inconsistent views seem to come from insecure, egotist who simply has a need to always be provocative (scholarly reviewers all point to the fact that Emerson was, indeed, greatly insecure due to his failures as both a Harvard professor and a Unitarian minister, as well as in his very unhappy marriage. These scholars say that he had no choice but to retreat into the wilds because he had no way to make a living! Emerson's views are also just wrong. For example, just like all these New Thought movements, he dismisses rational thought as worthless and destructive to your decisions and actions. He falsely romanticizes the, according to Emerson, impulsive, non-rational thinking patters of \\"laborers\\"; \\"youths\\" \\"[who act quickly and taking no need of any other or any societal norm\\"]; and of primitive and aboriginal peoples, who somehow (just as Jung believed) were all so in touch with the Universal Spirit that they were wise enough to act quickly just on pure instinct. Each person is divine. Each person can tap into the Universal Mind, and when you do, any thought, emotion, or feeling because it comes both from God, who lives inside each of us and from the divine Universal Spirit. This is exactly what \\"The Secret\\" / Law of Attraction teach. In my opinion, it is a very dangerous fact that so many intelligent, college graduates, guided by Oprah, are so fully committed to such anti-intellectual, anti-rational thought movements. While these thinking views all have some good ideas similar to \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\"; they, also, absurdly all claim to be \\"scientifically proven\\" based on the mysterious, strange movements made by electrons in quantum mechanics physics. What non of them tell you is that the mathematical equations describing the behavior of electrons in quantum mechanics, ONLY applies to extremely tiny particles such as a single electron or, possibly, an atom. They have no effect on the matter that we live with such as toaster ovens, trees, human beings, mountains, etc. You can not prove that you can \\"attract\\" or \\"manifest\\" a Rolls Royce, which is the example they all use, by using the laws of quantum mechanics physics. This disturbs me greatly because, again, it is so ant-intellectual. The fact that so many educated people fall for this \\"scientific\\" nonsense just because they watch one or two sell-out charlatan physicists claims that the Law of Attraction has been \\"scientifically proven\\", makes me realize why, as one example, we seem to have no hope getting people to accept the true dangers facing human civilization, over the next 100 years or so, by global warming. No one who does not believe in global warming will change their behaviors if they refuse to do any simple basic research and make an informed independent judgement.Read the whole of a few of Emerson's essay's and be prepared to enjoy his language but to need to study them carefully and flip the pages back and forth as you see his inconsistencies. Then, you can, I think, make a fair judgement on his true worth you you and to society as a spiritual or philosophy of life guidepost! Whether you come out with me or come to the opposite conclusion, you will enjoy reading the often beautiful language used by Emerson. Have fun with it! I would enjoy reading any and all Replies, of any opinion, to any or all portions of this lengthy comment. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Self-Reliance: The Wisdom of Ralph Waldo Emerson as Inspiration for Daily Living","review":"This book contains edited essays of Emerson written in the 1800's. They seem to me like the sermons of a minister, which he was. They are often incomprehensible -- maybe 10% inspirational, using words as ministers did at that time.

This one is at least comprehensive and well organised.On the other hand, it has instances of language so obsolete that no Poles use it at all and many Poles do not even know about it (e.g. 'mi'). It's clear the author has relied too much on written sources and lacks an intimate knowledge of the language, which is a pity, considering the reputation of the university she works for.Worst of all is the contextualisation of the grammar. 'There are no trees in this forest'. So where's the forest then? It was proven decades ago in the English language teaching industry that poorly contextualised examples hinder the acquisition of language.

The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. The author, Douglas Niles, has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and RA Salvatore's The Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies, and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies.

Book 2 really feels like D&D.;Worth a read if only to see how the Forgotten Realms mythos is starting to open up wide. Planes of existence and the vastness of the continent of Faerun are hinted at. Kazgaroth was actually a minion of Bhaal(The God of the act of death) who lives on the plane of Gehenna. The EarthMother is an aspect of Chauntea(Goddess of agriculture and growth). The black wizards Cyndre and Alexei were trained in Thay. The assassins of Calimshan. It will be interesting to read the subsequent changes to the Realms as the game series transitions from v2 to v3. The sahuagin here worship Bhaal. By the time of Mel Odom's Threat from the Sea they all worship Sekolah.The evil wizards here are truly evil. All parts with them were highlights for me. One is even a sado/nymphomaniac. Hobarth the cleric is pretty bad ass. The zombie/druid battle for the grove is worthy too.Monsters aplenty! We have a half orc, duergar, zombies, skeletons, ogres, sahuagin, the invisible servant and earth elementals. There's a wood sprite too. Really? Re-really(annoying).My only real complaint is some of the setup in the book is way too forced or just doesn't make much sense. For example, when the Prince and Daryth lose their weapons at sea only to have them magically returned in Caer Allisynn I face palmed at the lameness of it all. Pontswain was there too btw.

It does a good job of indtroducing a new country in the Forgotten Realms, hte Moonshaes, which resemble Celtic and Welsh mythology. It's an interesting plot, and the descritions and battle scenses are more than half-decent. The characters though need some work. I for one don't like heroes to be overpowered, they are mortals after all. I don't like books with \\"Against overwhelming odds, everything works out all right and everything is back to normal with no loses and everyone lives happily ever after.\\" Those are mostly children stories. The main character in this book, Tristan, and other characters are quite lacking and need some more depth.First of all Tristan is one of those stuck-up, everything always works out for him, spoiled, pompous nobles. His character is annoying, and personality definately not deserving of being the chosen hero. Tristan is chosen to be the wielder of this sword that will save the Moonshaes. The prophecy of the chosen one is corny and fits several other characters in the book. The battle desriptions where Tristan fights are some of the worst I've ever seen. Here he makes terrible attacks, like a swing that takes him in a full circle, and just ordinary slashes. Somehow, these pitiful attacks always make critical hits and he survives the fight, being a great swordsman. Any person that has actually fought with a sword before, like me, knows that these attacks couldn'r hold up in a real batle.The ending of this book was horrible. Baal comes to the Moonshaesby a mystic cord that gets severed by the fairy dragon taking Tristan's sword and dropping it in the well, where Ball is supposed to be. That's not how Forgotten Realms works. The dieties in Forgoteen Realms can take an avatar, or several, any time they wish on any place. And somehow Tristan uses his sword to fight a giant avatar of a god off that much much much bigger than he is. The only swordd that can harm a diety in Forgotten Realms was Godsbane, and now it's destroyed.The ending plot was really bad too, the main villian of the first book is defeated jsut at the right moment even though it could have attacked long ago. The book really isn't as plausible even in the fantasy set, and although there are some good parts, the parts that are poorly written just ruin the book. R.A.

Abby Shaw is doing her best to carry on the tradition. As the new owner of the candy shop Divinity, it is her responsibility to run the weekend. Things are running okay until Savannah Horne arrives.Savannah hasn't been in town since high school, but memories are long in Paradise. When she was here, she made life miserable for everyone. Twenty years later, Abby thinks that Savannah might have changed, but the rest of the town isn't ready to forgive.When Savannah wins the first night of the contest, Evie Rice is furious. The two women used to fight over everything in high school, and neither is quite ready to let the old rivalry go.The next morning, however, Savannah disappears. After a day of searching, Abby finds her body. The list of suspects is long, including the obvious like Evie and Savannah's sister, who is hardly upset at her sibling's death.Also on the suspect list is Abby's cousin Karen. Karen has been acting rather strange since Savannah showed up the first night and the evidence seems to keep pointing to her. While Abby had no intention of getting involved, she quickly determines that she will have to find the real killer to keep her cousin out of jail. Abby's resolve is only reinforced when the case takes a very personal turn.Meanwhile, tensions in the family are brewing over Divinity. Abby inherited the shop from her aunt, and some of the cousins think they had more of a right to own the shop. Can Abby keep the peace and the store?This is the second book in the series, and another good light read. The plot did seem to bog down a little during the search for Savannah phase since it's obvious to the reader what the outcome will be. But once the body is found, things kick into high gear. The story weaves all over the place with one red herring after another until Abby finally puts everything together. While at first I thought the ending was great, the more I've thought about it, there are several loose ends that were left unresolved in the rush to finish things.In the first book, Abby was struggling with her recent divorce and seemed a bit harsh at times. She's really smoothed out here and is a very likable heroine. The family story lines are interesting and add depth to the story and Abby. I'm interested to see where the author goes with these plot lines.My biggest gripe is a matter of timing. There are several times when Abby seems to live through the same time twice, having left the shop in late afternoon then suddenly doing something at 2 PM, for example. This is something that really bugs me, and it happened several times. It doesn't affect the timeline of the story, but it did pull me out of an otherwise well written book.The inclusion of six recipes will just be icing on the cake for readers with a sweet tooth.While not perfect, this book is still enjoyable."},{"Title":"Chocolate Dipped Death (A Candy Shop Mystery)","review":"I didn't read Sammi Cater's first book, \\"Candy Apple Dead,\\" but was delighted to feel that maybe I hadn't missed much in this second book. It was a fast moving read from the beginning which I really enjoy. I think most of us have gone to school with someone similar to Savannah Vance Horne.....no surprise she ends up dead. Abby Shaw, our heroine, has the right amount of spunk to deal with the whole situation, but I did find her cousin Karen MORE than annoying and nasty about a situation she should have let her husband explain, instead of going off on a rampage like a lunatic for most of the book. I have no idea why Abby would even want her back to work in the store! I'm sort of use to the fact that all mystery writers seem to have their leading lady fall for the sheriff..... no exception here, but I am rooting for her. One thing....where does Abby find time to make all the candy that she needs to sell in the shop when she is hardly ever there? Also, I believe Ms. Carter needs to follow through with the ending. A few questions were left unanswered and it leaves the reader wanting more info which is not forthcoming. I know we would like to know more about who Jason was and who Miles really was, BUT the big question that I felt should have been answered earlier on ....'was Savannah making her own candy for the contest or having it made and if she was, where was it being made since she was living in a hotel!' Was I the only one who wondered about that since Evie and others had asked a few times to have it looked into? That would have been nice to know.

Town pariah, Savannah Horne, has returned to enter Divinity candy shop's annual contest. When she comes in first place in the semi-final round, more than a few feathers are ruffled. It seems that Savannah is widely despised for cheating with several \\"attached\\" men, and her general attitude of nastiness hasn't earned her many friends. Most people in town are eager to see her leave, and when she ends up dead, the list of suspects keeps growing by the minute. Topping the list is Abby's cousin, Karen, who found her husband having drinks with Savannah at a local bar. Karen has been acting strangely lately, and Abby fears that Karen has murdered Savannah over an event in their past. Abby begins to investigate, hoping to clear her cousin's name, and hopes to find the real murderer in the process.This series is a light, fun read. I enjoy reading about the aspects of running a candy shop, and missed a bit of that from the previous book. More of this book was spent outside the actual shop, and I missed some of the information regarding making the candy and running a business. Beyond that, the mystery was good. I do agree with a previous reviewer that thought the ending was rushed, and what information \\"Jason\\" knew was not fully explained at the end.

By her own admission, she didn't like this person...so it just didn't sit right how much she seemed to mourn this person after she was killed.It's a cute series though, so hopefully it'll continue to improve."},{"Title":"Chocolate Dipped Death (A Candy Shop Mystery)","review":"This second book in the Candy Shop series by Sammi Carter was even better than the first. I like the little town of Paradise where Abby has inherited Divinity, the candy shop her Aunt left to her. We are becoming more familiar with the citizens of Paradise and the town in this second installment of the series.The story is about Savannah who comes back to Paradise with her husband after being away for many years. Savannah is not remembered fondly by the people in Paradise, because of her pranks and behavior when she lived there. Since Abby has also been away for years before coming back to run Divinity, she relates to Savannah. After winning a candy contest, Savannah disappears. Abby organizes a search for her. The story is well written and makes you want to continue to read late into the night. My only problem was the ending. We are left knowing what happened, but we don't know why. Many loose ends are tied up by Abby saying we will never know what really happened. The unanswered questions kept me from giving this book five stars, but I did enjoy it and plan to continue with the series. This is a light cozy read that cozy lovers will enjoy."},{"Title":"Chocolate Dipped Death (A Candy Shop Mystery)","review":"Okay, as a dog owner and lover of dogs I have some issues of the depiction of Abby's dog. We NEVER got a physical description of the dog other than 'he wagged his stubby tail'. So I never knew what breed he was. From checking a few reviews here I figured out he is a Dobie. Emphasing that would have helped the story line-for ex. when Abby regretted not taking him with her when she was confronted by the murderer. All dogs are individuals-I never got the sense of this dog's personality or at least quirks. Abby neglects this dog. In my opinion the neglect borders on abusive. He RARELY gets out of the small apartment except to go the bathroom. He is destructive because he is not excercised regularly and he is not an intregal part of Abby's life. The writer acts like this is okay because Abby doesn't get mad when he destroys things!It was obvious who the murderer was from page one but that didn't particuliarly bother me. I was bothered that we did not get a satisfying denouncement. All we got was \\"I wasn't sure we'd ever know the whole truth\\". What the....! That's why I read mysteries; so eventually I will know the whole truth. To me, that's just lazy writing. The writer had such a great opportunity for characterization but she never explored the characters in depth. Abby's relationship with her brother was not developed and so it seemed unrealistic when he so staunchly came to her aid. The tension of similarities and differences of these two characters could have made this story so much richer.Abby's personality didn't make sense to me. Do people really tell relatives off like that?-Especially when you are dependent on their help? Abby did not validate the feelings that the other characters had when Samantha did cruel things to them. The writer tried, slightly, and failed to make Samantha mult-dimensional.This could have been a great story if the writer had given 100%."},{"Title":"Chocolate Dipped Death (A Candy Shop Mystery)","review":"I liked this cozy. Sammi Carter has a dry sense of humor that shines through this book. There were suspect aplenty but I did guess the murderer fairly early. There were great recipes in the back of the book but I would have liked more glimpses into chocolate candy making.I loved the main character, Abby Shaw. When questioned why she would give up being a corporate attorney to run a candy shop, I loved her answer. You will need to read the book to find out what her retort was. There seemed a little too many suspects but that's OK."},{"Title":"Chocolate Dipped Death (A Candy Shop Mystery)","review":"This is such a good follow up to Candy Apple Dead. It was good seeing all of the characters, and someone ones as well.In this go around, Abby is still running the candy shop that her Aunt Grace had left her. She has to be part of a candy contest, just to make sure things run smoothly. When Savannah wins the first day of the contest, others are really mad, I mean steaming. It seems that nobody like Savannah, at all. It's fair to say that most of the town hates her. She left town just after High School, and nobody liked her back then for what she did (you have to read the book to find out). When she came back, nobody likes her and most of the town still holds grudges. She wins day one of the contest, and someone said that Savannah is cheating, she disappears, and is found dead. It's up to Abby to find out who killed her and why.This is such a charming read. Usually, my complaints with cozy Mysteries is that all of them are the same. One can be substituted for another. I'm glad to say that this is not the case with this series. There isn't any over the top romance, and not that much fluff to it, like most cozy Mysteries are. This series actually has substance and depth to it.I really like Carter's writing style. It flows at an even and realistic pace. There are not a lot of plot twists, but for this series, you don't really need it. Carter has the ability to hold your attention to the very last page. I also liked how we are able to get into Abby's thoughts. At one point we have access to Abby's memory and learn how she and her Aunt Grace made candy together. That was a nice, down home feeling.This is such a good series. If you like cozy mysteries that have actual depth, and are a fun read, then you must start this series and enjoy the ride, I know I am."},{"Title":"Climbing Jacob's Ladder: The Enduring Legacy of African-American Families","review":"i wish they had other shipping options available because it took a little long for my book to come, but it came in brand new, like the description said, very satisfied! and i will be ordering from them again."},{"Title":"Climbing Jacob's Ladder: The Enduring Legacy of African-American Families","review":"At the time he wrote this 1992 book, Andrew Billingsley was Professor and Chair, Department of Family and Community Development at the University of Maryland.\\"He wrote in the Introduction, \\"But to say that black families are alive is not to say that they are all faring well...

It can continually renew and sustain this vital sector of American society in the years ahead.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"It is perhaps the height of irony that while social scientists were describing black families as being characterized by a tendency toward female-headed families with children born out of wedlock, they were also assuring the public that blacks rejected these children. At the very same time the transracial adoption movement was being championed as a solution to the problem, blood relatives accepted a majority of these children into their families. This is still the case today.\\" (Pg. 29)\\"In short, the common misconception that African-American families are characterized by single-parent, female-headed structures is as misleading as is the widespread assumption that they got that way because of factors internal to their culture.\\" (Pg. 35)\\"Consequently, we argued that by changing the structure of social institutions so that they would function as well for blacks as they do for whites, and as well for female-headed families as they do for male-headed families, and as well for poor families as they do for more priviliged families, both family stability and more effective family functioning would follow.\\" (Pg. 79)\\"(T)he African-American family.

Quite a few of my favourite genres feel especially dead at the moment. Books sit unfinished as I ponder what the disconnect is. The usual boxes are ticked. Great cover, interesting blurb, strong beginning and then. Nothing.You find yourself washing the dishes.Not good.It's enough to make a girl dig up her Spiderman comics and read about the endless troubles that plague Peter Parker............Then along came this little gem. Dry, convoluted and peopled with all sorts of demented bureaucratic types although I am rather fascinated with a couple of the hero's later bosses. Not my usual type of read at all.It started innocuously enough and pulled me straight into a deeper appreciation of the intricacies of computers and their esoteric possibilities than anything I have read so far.The hero is very flawed and packs a sense of humour crueller and drier than the Sahara desert.He is also very smart when he gets out of his own way, or his superiors and Human Resources managers do. Add crazy ex-girlfriends and flatmates messing with the more apocalyptic laws of physics in their flat to the mix and you can see why Bob surfs a wave of annoyed frustrated resignation through most of this tale. He has a conscience which means he gets pretzelled into some weird emotional configurations a lot as he obeys difficult orders, but he wings it quite well.He works in a covert government department called the Laundry which handles strange mystical threats to an unsuspecting humanity. Its workers are in for life, or death if you count the poor bloke who gets killed in action and is frugally resurrected into a new job as zombie security. No rest in peace here.These guys own you.I could hear the bureaucracy groaning under its own weight as Bob is drawn into endless meetings and departmental office politics while he chips away at solving the truly atrocious mystery at the heart of this story.It scored 10/10 for the horror aspect it stirred up in me. Lots of books are setting their stories against major historical events and reexperiencing them through their (usually) paranormal characters' eyes.Bob sees it as a human and it's no less horrifying. There *are* critters here folks, and they range from mythological to straight out Cthulu. But even they haven't a hope against the evil packed by some of the humans in this universe.I was amazed.He saved the girl, saved the day and figured things out as he rubbed shoulders with overworked clean up crews, off world military teams, British police and even got a trip to Amsterdam.People like Bob and the world they live in make it a good idea to keep your head down, notice nothing and absolutely not ask for explanations when weird things are happening.They do make for a great book reading experience though.I am desolated to say this book reminded me I have forgotten most of my uni science as I furiously googled all the different theorems and IT terms that relentlessly poured off the page.Worth the aggravation but it left me with that feeling you get when you haven't studied enough for an important exam. Anxious, relieved it's over and maybe you winged it and are a \\"clever trousers\\" after all.I'm left wanting to read more about Bob's adventures and have acquired a new phobia of my computer, security clearances (and what one has to do to earn them), extremely unexpected results arising from unfortunate positionings of certain brain tumours and desktop knicknacks.Like those silver balls hanging on a string that bang into one another sideways endlessly for example................"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"If you have ever wondered what would happen if you combined of H.P.

Bob Howard's job seems simple - keep the world from being destroyed. The problem is that something like that could be caused by a person just doing the math wrong or an enemy doing the math right. Monsters, aliens, governments, shadow organizations, terrorists, and, yes, Nazis. Well, you know they are always going to pop up. This is the first book by Mr. Charles Stross I have had the pleasure to read, but as I have a small stock pile of his books in my library, it will not be the last! If you liked this may I also suggestDelta Green: Denied to the Enemy (A Call of Cthulhu Mythos Novel of World War II)."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"In The Atrocity Archives, Charles Stross perfectly blends Lovecraftian horror into a spy thriller. But don't think James Bond, though they have their own special gadgets, think bureaucrats mired in office politics and meetings who must battle bean counters as often as monsters.Stross' protagonist, Bob Howard, is a Gen X hacker who gets drafted into the Laundry, the code name for the UK government agency which protects England from nasty beasties from beyond. It turns out all that complex math that fried my brain in college (like second order, linear, non-homogeneous differential equations) can be used to open portals to other dimensions where cerebellum sucking slugs are just itching for an invitation to our world. Bob starts out in tech support but his skills earn him his first field assignment. While it's clear he's not suited for dealing either with the harpies from accounting or the things that should not be, Stross has fun playing the anti-hero card with Bob, letting his wit and resourcefulness survive the cards he's dealt.The book contains the short novel, \\"The Atrocity Archives,\\" and the Hugo Award winning novella, \\"The Concrete Jungle.\\" The former serves as an introduction to this twisted universe Stross has hatched. Bob is forced to deal with rival spies, terrorists and the twisted remnants of the Nazi occult fetish. In the latter, office politics come to a head while someone figures out how to weaponize a gorgon's stare. You remember gorgons, right? Medusa is the most well known of this crowd. \\"The Concrete Jungle\\" may have won the Hugo, but I liked \\"The Atrocity Archives\\" a lot more. I felt that it flowed better and the drama was more intense.I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the others in this series."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"I'm not going to add much to the already cogent praise on this site. This is a sheer cyberpunk romp, very cleverly written. Your appreciation will be enhanced if you have some background in espionage, World War II, computers and their history, and Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos. If you don't recognize the references to James Angleton, Alan Turing or Shub-Niggurath, you'll get less out of it -- but you'll still enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"The Atrocity Archives is a highly original mix of magic, math, physics and espionage. It is also incredibly funny. I don't just mean amusing, I mean laugh-out-loud funny. It's difficult to pull off so many one-liners without becoming farcical, but Stross does it with ease.The hero is Bob Howard (the name is itself an homage to the master of pulp fiction and creator of Kull the Conqueror and Conan the Barbarian, and longtime member of H.P. Lovecraft's inner circle). Bob works for the Laundry, a kind of occult MI5 or FBI. In Stross's universe, higher math is the key to quantum manipulation of matter and space-time, and the gateway to an infinity of other universes in which dwell all the monsters of the Chthulu Mythos as well as the occasional gorgon, lamia, demon and other stuff too horrible to contemplate. Bob and the Laundry are charged with keeping the rest of humanity, blissfully unaware of the horrors that surround them at every turn, safe from all the occult baddies trying to invade from other universes, as well as from evil humans bent on using black mathemagic to further their own nefarious ends.This is really a genre buster. From my description (as accurate and to the point as I could make it), this probably sounds like out and out fantasy. To be sure there are all sorts of references to Lovecraftian demons and creations, but to my thinking, The Atrocity Archives is clearly science fiction, and hard science fiction at that. In between all the jokes and ichor-spewing tentacled monsters there are several references to modern cosmology and quantum physics that are spot on. And, I suppose, it is also a spy novel, sharing, as has been suggested by others, similarities to the James Bond novels. Only our hero packs a Hand of Glory instead of a Walther PPK, and despite being quite competent at the computer and thaumaturgical end of things, is decidedly more geeky than Bond and considerably less a ladies' man than Bond.The writing is fast and funny without being silly and the book is filled with wry and dry inside jokes about computer geeks, Microsoft, mindless bureaucracy, accountants, Lovecraft and the military. Nothing is sacred and everything get skewered. Some of these elements remind me of Neal Stephenson and Tim Powers, two other authors that I think are great, but Charlie Stross's spin is very clearly totally original. I can't wait until the sequels arrive in the mail.J.M.

If, on top of that, you enjoy James Bond, well, you've got a great new genre: H.P. Lovecraft-style horror (math-based, so it's completely believable (!)) meets spy novel.Beyond that, there's the whole bureaucrat aspect of the book. If you've read Berlin Game/Mexico Set/London Match, you'll get again the feel of a guy having to cross national boundaries, deal with other governments, to get to the bottom line.This is a really brilliant piece of work."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"In THE ATROCITY ARCHIVES Stross does for WWII spy agencies, ISO 9000, and Unix hackers what he attempted to do for MMORPGs and venture capitalists in HALTING STATE.Protagonist Bob Howard works for \\"the Laundry,\\" a British spook operation that keeps computer scientists, physicists, cryptographers and others from accidentally unleashing people-eating demons from adjacent alternate universes. As noted elsewhere, THE ATROCITY ARCHIVES is a short novel packaged with a related novella. In the novel (The Atrocity Archive), Bob is supposed to rescue a philosophy professor who is on the verge of digging too deeply into the Laundry's intellectual territory. That humble operation quickly morphs into a mission to save the world from what might be al Qaeda-linked Nazis from another dimension ... or might not. In the novella (The Concrete Jungle), somebody is hijacking traffic cameras that the Laundry happened to equip with the ability to turn people into pillars of salt. Bob has to figure out who it is and how to stop them.Throughout, Stross to turns hacker culture, classic video games, bureaucracy -- the Laundry's managers count paperclips and want everything documented in quadruplicate -- and sci-fi, horror, and spy novel tropes and cliches for humor. Cognoscenti will probably enjoy this a great deal, but others may well find the insider humor smug and tiresome. Nevertheless, Stross is witty and inventive and THE ATROCITY ARCHIVES is not bad at all.By the way, the Atrocity Archive of the novel's title is a secret store of materials used by WWII Nazis in their cruel medical \\"experiments\\" on Jews, \\"defectives,\\" and others. In Stross' world, the suffering caused by Nazi atrocities was used to power occult spells. Like the Indiana Jones movies and THE ILLUMINATUS! TRILOGY, Stross draws on historical linkages between the Nazi movement and the occult, adding his own unique twists ... and frankly contributing to the unfortunate elevation of Nazi barbarism to the level of supernatural evil. What the Nazis did was terrible, but it was all too human."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"What if Alan Turing solved one more problem and completed one last theorem? And suddenly higher mathematics was awash in spells, summonings, and alternate dimensions where forces lived that would like nothing better than to munch on your brain. Thanks to the Turing-Lovecraft theorem magic happens, almost inevitably for the worst.The British Secret Service (MI-6, the anti-spell branch) has a unique way of dealing with theoreticians who trip over the right formulae - they hire them into The Laundry and retire them to meaningless desk jobs. Bob Howard, however, is a little to itchy for the passive life. After a lot of trying he manages to get into field work. Now, as a relief from an irritating boss who counts paperclips and takes regular attendance, Bob gets to deal with dark forces and demonic possession.There are two tales in this book. The first is The Atrocity Archives, which was Charles Stross's initial effort. Told as one long computer geek in-joke, the story introduces us to Bob and follows him through his first set of assignments and nervous breakdowns, while a series of ever more peculiar administrators keep telling him what a good job he's doing.And he is doing a good job. Spotting mathematicians who have crossed the line, saving workshop attendees from being munched, and getting thrown out of the States for poking too far into the badness on what should have been a routine extraction. But even good agents have bad days and our wisecracking hero finds himself going through a portal to rescue a very attractive scientist from a very dead earth.The second story Concrete Jungle mixes interdepartmental politics, electronic basilisks, and fears about the end of the world in a story of one too many cows.Intrigued? If you are comfortable with computers, or at least have a handle on geek speak and enjoy twisted, funny writers whose imaginations have run wild, this is something you will want to read. Despite a large serving of sarcasm and irony, Stross also manages to deliver a genuinely interesting plot with as much action as there is esoteric muttering. By all means check this out. I'm going to order everything else he's written."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Charlie Stross has been making a name for himself over recent years for his extraordinary &quot;Accelerando&quot; stories, chronicling human and post-human civilisation towards and past the Singularity event at which technology becomes sentient and near-godlike. Another future world is being explored in the novel Singularity Sky and sundry short stories/future novels - also post-Singularity, and imbued with a pervading humour even through some quite horrifying passages.The Atrocity Archives is best read with this in mind: despite looking a bit like horror, this is really hard science fiction with a lot of humour and a very weird Lovecraftian twist regarding the nature of the world. It's geeky but cool, a clever take on the spy thriller, and the only connection it has with &quot;A Colder War&quot; is that it's Lovecraft-inspired spy fiction by the same author. (Indeed, other even sillier Lovecraft homages appear in his short story collection &quot;Toast&quot;).The one-star review below should be taken with a grain of salt: don't come to any book with brittle expectations and then complain that it's the book's fault when your expectations are dashed!The Atrocity Archives is quite unlike anything else out there at the moment, but those familiar with Stross, Cory Doctorow, or various other contemporary sf authors' up-to-the-minute genre-busting fiction will eat it up with gusto.And the beginning passage, in which a succession of everyday events (such a pager going off in our hero's pocket) are made ominous by horror-inflected prose, is pure gold."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"These two droll, amazing and entertaining stories hopefully herald the start of a cycle of &quot;Laundry&quot; tales. Stross' obsession with science, computers, internet technology, office management structures (!), occult history and HP Lovecraft meshes into a dizzyingly fun reading experience. Somehow, massive exposure to all this information - cleverly turned on its head to meet the demands of the stories - causes synapses to sizzle and crackle, giving rise to an illusory boost of one's own intelligence. Yes, Virginia, reading Stross makes you feel smarter, as others have observed....This is Must Read stuff for Lovecraft fans, but if you like the work of Alan Moore, Warren Ellis, or Grant Morrison's THE INVISIBLES, then this is more or less guaranteed to flip your wig."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"I'm about halfway through the book and totally disagree with Mayhew's review. He panned the book because it's not a sequel to another story he read.Since I never particularly got into Lovecraft, or horror, I'm enjoying the book even more than I expected to. I find it a wonderful twist on the whole cyberpunk genre. The protagonist is a geek that talks and acts like a real geek. He even gets the slang right.As I said in my title, the book is a fun read."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"The novel and novella in this book are clever adaptations of prior themes. Stross places his characters in a world where magic is real but actually the result of complex mathematics/logical systems that can open portals to scary, alternative dimensions. This is a relatively old idea, to my knowledge used first by Pratt and de Camp in the 1950s. He has used this idea to adapt a Lovecraftian world and combines his plotting with satire of bureaucratic/corporate life. The third crucial element in constructing this story is a adaptation of Cold War thrillers, specifically the work of Len Deighton. Stross does a nice job of combining these elements and the plotting is imaginative with reasonably effective satire. Entertaining reading though perhaps too much of an in joke."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"It's difficult to review this book without comparing it to other authors, simply because they share certain common moods. The actual story concept is original, a fusion of espionage, horror, and SF that won't necessarily appeal to readers who are purists in any one of these genres, but is hugely enjoyable if you can take it all in.Briefly, the story revolves around agents for a British intelligence organisation tasked with suppressing certain mathematical concepts; the ones that are the keys to other dimensions, most of them containing entities implacably hostile to mankind. The trouble is that they happen to be very interesting mathematical concepts, the ones that are close to the cutting edge of computer research, and there are a lot of people out there that are working on them. In the past it took thousands of man-hours to screw up reality, today a laptop can do it in sceonds. This can result in horrific accidents and is potentially the ultimate terrorist weapon. There is an uneasy peace between the world's intelligence agencies, which pool resources to counter this threat, but things haven't always been that way. The ultimate threat of the book is a remnant of Nazi research from the second world war, and turns out to be much nastier than expected.I enjoyed everything in this book, from the home-life of the hacker/agent hero to its final apocalyptic scenes on a dying alien world. Thoroughly recommended.I wrote this before seeing the publisher's description, and it's interesting to see how similar it is. That possibly means it's unnecessary, but that's life..."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"For those of you who have read the Bastard Operator From Hell series and are sysadmins this book will be a completely fantastic read, for the rest of you it will just be fantastic. Bob Howard is nothing like the American author who wrote the Conan tales, he's a systems geek for a very dreary agency of the British government where paperclips are counted and where you'd get reprimanded for not putting a cover sheet on your TPS reports. One day Bob is asked to help out with a field operation, and that, and some quick thinking during a departmental training course, get him transferred from systems administration to occult field operations. From there things just get worse as he is sucked into a conspiracy to open a portal to an alternate universe to let in one of the elder gods or into an interdepartmental conspiracy to eliminate his department. Incredibly fun, there are lots of ideas in here that are just fun to play with after you put the book down."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"A good idea does not necessarily lead to a good novel. The universe of the Atrocity Archives is a good idea, or a great idea, even. Unfortunately, the Atrocity Archives is not a very good book.This novel came highly recommended to me. I am a great fan of Lovecraft, science fiction, spy fiction, and have worked in a government agency long enough to appreciate the lunacy of such places. When somebody told me the premise of the Atrocity Archives and Charles Stross's \\"Laundry\\" universe, I thought it was the most brilliant idea in the world.The premise behind the story is this. There is an unseen world of occult, alien horror beneath the veneer of our mundane universe, and one gateway to that unseen world is computers and technology. To guard against this terrifying other-world, shadowy government agencies have sprung up. The Laundry is one such clandestine government agency. Its agents are an odd blend of tech geeks andIf you are into this kind of thing, this is a fantastic premise. But a premise is not a story. It only lays out the setting for a story. In science fiction like this, it promises a universe of opportunities for great stories. Sadly, despite the great premise, the Atrocity Archives is not a very interesting story. More importantly, the story was poorly told.Despite Mr. Stross's fertile imagination, he is just not a very good storyteller. The story is told through a first person perspective, narrated by a Laundry agent named Bob. Bob seems like an obnoxious guy. He tells the story with a bunch of asides, obscure geek references, and digressions. He seems like the sort of guy who thinks he is quite clever and witty, but is not really. He seems like the sort of guy who you might run into at a party, and you would want to get away from because he loves to drop names and make himself seem smart. He would tell stories where he never seems to get to the point because he is too busy dazzling you along the way with how much he knows. And he whines...he always seem to be vaguely contemptuous of everybody and dissatisfied with the people around him. Bob is almost like a sociopath, he never displays any affection for any of the characters we come across in the book, or care about what's going on with them beyond how it relates to Bob. To Bob, everyone else seems to be an annoyance.On top of it all, Bob's narration is delivered in a weird Micky Spilane over-the-top pulp style that's just too much.So it goes with Bob's story, which is the subject of the book. Bob is supposed to be a tech geek and a bit of a bureaucratic drone, but he spends pages making references to geeky things like \\"The theorem is a hack on discrete number theory that simultaneously disproves the Church-Turing hypothesis (wave if you understood that) and worse, permits NP-complete problems to be converted into P-complete ones. This has several consequences, starting with screwing over most cryptography algorithms - translation: all your bank account are belong to us - and ending with the ability to computationally generate a Dho-Nha geometry curve in real time.\\" Heavy exposition like this can go on for paragraphs and seem to litter every other page. The problem with exposition is that it is not story - things do not happen in expositions. So when a novel is so exposition heavy, it is not much fun to read.I think these flaws could have together formed an asset for the novel had there been a detectable sense of humour behind it - if I could see Mr. Stross winking behind Bob's obnoxious narration. But I don't. Mr. Stross's attempt at humour mostly comes from flat cardboard characters meant to represent various office drone stereotypes that we should laugh at - like Bob's ineffectual but nitpicky boss, or some jockish dullard who sits with Bob at an arcane tech seminar but summoning entities from beyond with electronic circuits. These jokes aren't funny because they've done before and done better. These 1-dimensional figures of fun are dropped into the story at poorly timed intervals. We never get treated to any situations where would could have a bit of a laugh at Bob, or when Bob is portrayed with any kind of charm.I really wanted to like the Atrocity Archives, so much that when I bought the book I bought the next novel in the series with it. Unfortunately, Mr. Stross is just not a very good storyteller. Bad writing like this just wears me down."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Charles Stross has received a lot of well-deserved attention for his several novels including the current Hugo nominee Accelerando.

Add aspects of spy thrillers and Dilbertian office comedy, and throw in Nazis and nasty Islamists and a very secret branch of British Intelligence. It's told very wittily, though the central horrors are still pretty scary. The overall tone is snarky and fun, not horrific.Bob Howard is working on a desk job for the \\"Laundry\\", but he's bucking for field service. We meet him on his first trial, breaking into an industrial building to destroy the traces of a dangerous discovery a young mathematician has made. It turns out that certain kinds of math knowledge lead to the ability to summon demons from other universes -- the sort of thing once done with chalked pentagrams, but much more efficiently achieved with lasers instead of chalk, and with computers to keep track of the summoning rituals. It's the job of the Laundry to keep such knowledge under wraps.But aside from the dangerous job, the Laundry is just another Dilbertian government job environment. So the first few chapters show Bob dealing with bureaucratic hassles: stupid bosses demanding silly paperwork, dumb training classes, computer problems, etc. It's all very funny stuff. He's also dealing with his crazy sometime girlfriend, and his weird roommates. Then he gets sent to California to try to pry a beautiful redheaded Irish scientist from the clutches of the US -- it seems she might be studying some dangerous stuff. But his mission turns bad when she is kidnapped by some Islamists who may have bitten off more than they can chew. Before long, Bob is posted to a more curious part of the Laundry, with a boss straight out of classic spy fiction, and it looks like they might be dealing with a secret Nazi project -- or something even scarier...The Atrocity Archives is a very breezy, fun, and imaginative novel. Structurally there are a couple of problems -- basically, the opening, though always entertaining, drags on too long. The novel proper doesn't start until about a third of the way through. But that's a minor issue -- overall, this is great fun.The added novella is called \\"The Concrete Jungle\\". It is a separate work, not an expansion of the novel. It still features Bob Howard, this time investigating the sudden appearance of a bunch of concrete cows in Milton Keynes. The cows may once have been real -- thus a case of \\"gorgonism\\" is suspected. Worse, there is a possibility that someone has figured out a way to automate the basilisk effect that turns flesh to stone. Howard and a new, unwilling helper brave great danger in tracking down the eventual villains. There is more bureaucratic satire here as well, and it's snappily written and clever throughout. Still, though I enjoyed it the story doesn't have quite the impact of the novel -- perhaps a matter of length, or simply that the novel was first to present the ideas. There is also an introduction by Ken MacLeod and a smart afterword by Stross that compares the spy thriller and horror genres. The Atrocity Archives as a whole is definitely to be recommended."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"(Charles Stross says read them in this order)* The Atrocity Archive -- short novel, in which Bob and various other major characters are introduced.* The Concrete Jungle -- novella, set around 6 months after The Atrocity Archives(These are collected in The Atrocity Archives)* The Jennifer Morgue -- a novel, set around 3 years after The Concrete Jungle* Pimpf -- interstitial short story set within a year of The Jennifer Morgue(These are collected in The Jennifer Morgue)* Down on the Farm -- novelette, set approximately 2 years after Pimpf.

The agency employs a variety of employees, but perhaps at the lowest rung is Bob, a computer repairman. However, Bob stops what could have been a nasty incident occurring during a demonstration. His reward is a leap into the cold to save the world from devastation from beyond that plans to snack on the universe once this essence pierces the once thought of impregnable barrier.\\"The Concrete Jungle\\". The country starting with the Laundry is in trouble as some big shot plans to change agents into zombies so that he can take over the country and ultimately the world. Only Agent Bob and local police officer Josephine stand in the way of stopping the zombie attack, but first he must explain why he failed to follow standard operating procedures when he called for backup during a deadly confrontation in which he failed to fill out the proper form and going through the chain of command. Saving the world does not stop a written reprimand and counseling as follow the rules not logic prevails.Taking Get Smart into a technological paranormal world is what the novel (The Atrocity Archives) and the novella (The Concrete Jungle) is all about as Bob battles supernatural combatants and the bureaucracy with differing but always humorous results. Both tales are satirical fun as the espionage thriller goes through the rinse cycle as only officious government regulations would expect. Charles Stross writes a wild zany pair of occult spy escapades.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"The author adds a very lengthy explanation of what this book is about as an after word. He compares himself to other authors and other genres in what seems to be a justification for this book. It doesn't work for me. I found the book, which is really a blotted novella attached to a short story, disjointed and confusing. The basic idea is not especially new, although the author would have you believe it is, in that certain aspects of magic are really just extensions of quantum mechanics and multiverse theory. I think you can find this theme in SciFi from the 1950s and it is basically what Phillip Pullman does in 'His Dark Materials' trilogy; only Pullman does a good job of it. This is probably worth your money if you are really into very light Scifi, but if you are looking for something more serious I'd advise avoiding it."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"This book was fun and definitely set in the sci-fi classifications of books, if not the fantasy world itself, due to its use of the occult.

The mundane office politics overwhelm the occult and the incessant expository dialog is a slog. Just call it a gun, don't give us all the statistics. Most of the part I read was either mundane office stuff (which I get plenty of at work) or people talking at length ABOUT summoning technology with plenty of long words that are meaningless. There was very little action and what little there was was over way too quick (like 10 pages of talking, 1 page of getting attacked by tentacles, then another 10 pages of talking about said tentacles). There are also too many in-jokes. Lots of \\"nudge, nudge, did ya get that name I just dropped?\\" That's fun occasionally but every other paragraph it gets old fast.

The hard-boiled, supernatural, ultra-secret government agency, science fiction genre just doesn't grab me.My interest is entirely in the second novella, \\"The Concrete Jungle.\\" This, to the best of my knowledge, is the first reference in popular culture to FPGA-based reconfigurable computing (RC), an area in which I have an active research interest. As with other out-there technologies of the past, it's waved around as a semi-magical way to get essentially infinite computing power. And, for the benefit of the reader, I'd like to point out that FPGA is generally taken to mean \\"field programmable gate array,\\" i.e. not factory-programmed, rather than \\"fully programmable.\\" I could pick nits about the fictional date at which the story proposes to use RC, too, but that would be pedantic even for me.I recommend this, at least as a curiosity, to anyone currently engaged in FPGA-based RC.

The hero was changed from a family man, to a young punk kid, and moved from the US to the UK. The technology was changed from being old and alien to witchcraft. And an unnecessary love interest is introduced.The entire concept of the great filter that wipes out civilizations once they reach a certain technology level is abounded. And the whole concept of humanity on the brink of extinction is missing.'A colder war' was wonderful, and I was really looking forward to seeing how the story ended. It's a pity that the author decided not to try to dig his hero out of the hole he was in at the end of 'A Colder War'"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"I found myself laughing out loud a few times reading this book. Stross is a gifted writer in many ways. His imagination is as broad as his very British cynical sense of humor.The Atrocity Archives is an interesting concept. Stross plays with the idea that magic was rediscovered mathematically by Alan Turing just before his death. Or... its a little confusing exactly what the historical timeline is that Stross is playing with...The title \\"Atrocity Archives\\" comes from a secret library or vault that houses Nazi WWII relics. Stross has come up with an ingenious though very un-politically correct theory that spins the Holocaust into a magical experiment. The millions of deaths were sacrifices used to create dark magics. Part of the story revolves around this idea and Stross does a pretty good job of making it rather fascinating.The main character is a bloke named Bob Howard. He was conscripted into a secret British agency sort of like MI-5 or the NSA. Here he fights bad magic, sort of like a James Bond character, only he is a novice. So the story is part James Bond spoof.The idea here is pretty cool. I kept thinking of the Men In Black movies. I think this is pretty much what this book is formulated upon. Bob plays the Will Smith character who discovers aspects of the Laundry (name for the CIA style agency Bob is working for).I dont often find myself thinking of movies while reading a book. Two of them really stick out for me. Men In Black like I said before and Brazil. I think of Brazil because this story is very much about the insanity of Bureaucracy. Stross often pulls in one character or another whom ends up fighting politically with budgets and or red tape, mucking up the life of Bob Howard and his cohorts.I say Men In Black because of that wayyyy over the top UN building where all of these aliens roam around while the humans attempt to stave off disaster. You get that alot here in the Atrocity Archives. Only instead of that zany craziness in Men in Black, I felt like had seen this all many times before... that the whole concept was very old hat.I feel a little odd saying this, I am a fierce believer that 99% of any pseudo-action book has way to much stock placed on the chase scene's. A lot of books these days feels like they were intentionally crafted to become the next action summer blockbuster. I feel that most books rely too much on the chase scene and suffer greatly by not fleshing out their characters...The Atrocity Files does focus on the characters here, and for the first time ever, I am saying that this book needed a little more of the chase scene and a little less in the plot construction. Several times in the first half of the book the author sets up a climactic moment of suspense only to have it end right at the beginning. Bob wakes up in a different place from where he started. And Stross fills the reader into what just happened. It would be great if the author did this once. But not multiple times.So in conclusion, everything was good except the authors execution of a lot of the story. Its more than a little old hat. A lot of the mocking fun here was being done to death 50 years ago in British culture. Just watch the first Casino Royal (with a very young Woody Allen) for example (more movie references... hmmm). Still, I enjoyed the story and would probably recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Maybe the funniest thing I've read in years. Definitely the most creative genre mashup I've read. Trust me, if I were 1% as funny or interesting reviewing it, you'd have purchased it by now."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"After reading the first three volumes of The Merchant Princes I was half willing to completely write Charles Stross off. This fantasy series is less than impressive and while it has decent ideas about parallel worlds and secret families and has the potential to be a really strong series. But The Merchant Princes has been overall disappointing to read.Charles Stross, on the other hand, has been lauded with most of the awards that a writer in SFF can be awarded with and he picks up nominations almost before he finishes writing a work of fiction. So maybe it was just me. Maybe I was missing something. Stross is known more for his science fiction than his fantasy, so perhaps if I gave his science fiction a shot I would find something that would live up to the hype.I started at the beginning with The Atrocity Archives. The Atrocity Archive is a short novel which was his first published novel and the Archives also includes a novella The Concrete Jungle. The Concrete Jungle is a Hugo winner in 2005 for Best Novella.I can only describe a small portion of what the novel is about because there are just somethings I am unable to explain properly. Let me say that the novel is set in early 2001 and there is a man named Bob Howard who works for the Laundry in London. The Laundry is a secret organization which is in place to battle the forces of darkness.Imagine a world where the Nazis had attempted to tap into the netherworld to bring all sorts of evil to support the Third Reich and that all of this is possible and just science fact. Stross gives a level of detail to the unreal that the impossible feels almost prosaic. It is a remarkable talent.Bob Howard (Robert E. Howard reference, anyone?) is a computer guy but wants to be put in the field on spy type jobs and his involvement without sufficient training gets him involved in events that build beyond what he ever would have imagined. Bob Howard gets involved into this very netherworld evil that the Laundry is trying desperately to stop.What makes The Atrocity Archives quite a bit different than other SFF novels is that this is a combination of Lovecraft, Len Deighton's spy novels and perhaps a little bit of Neal Stephenson.I think that Charles Stross is far stronger at the non-Merchant Princes work because while The Atrocity Archives read like a slow moving spy novel it kept building and building and became more and more interesting and exciting to find out what was happening next. The Atrocity Archives is worth the time spent reading it.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"like most Stross' novels it's intriguing, funny, entertaining and thrilling,he's very good at mixing mystery, hardcore sci-fi and irony and come out withthe literary equivalent of an energy drink."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Stross is one of Paul Krugman's favorite authors, and as a Krugmanophile I decided to check him out. First I read &#34;Glasshouse,&#34; which is brilliant, so I moved on to this series, which is quite different but also brilliant. The protagonist is a tech wizard whose job with a British magical-secret-intelligence entity is fairly low in status, so he gets sent out for rather dangerous odd jobs (which always seem to run up a bill that the financial department objects to). You never can tell what kind of demonic alternate universe you might puncture with the wrong computer code--but he has the weapons necessary and knows how to use them (and you can make some at home, if you have the required corpse of a suicide and a few other items).

Stross takes a few premises (magic exists asas suppressed science, all of the major countries have groupsin charge of magic suppression, great scientists and mathematicianshave stumbled on the keys to this suppressed knowledge) and buildsa book without much in the way of characters or even plot. Thebook is really just a sequence of episodes. The plot centersaround a guy who is basicly a system administrator who getsdrafted into the larger work of technology suppression andThe Fight Against Evil. The book reads like a collectionof stories, which perhaps it was.Stross mentions that while he was writing The AtrocityArchives, Tim Powers book \\"Declare\\" was published. \\"Declare\\"has a similar plot, but a much stronger story line and strongercharacters."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"I'd never heard of Charles Stross until my wife picked up this book for me. Its premise is interesting: A Lovecraftian world where summoning can be done much more efficiently using computers and advanced mathematics. Monsters and fractals and programs, oh my! The main setting is the over-the-top-secret British \\"Laundry Services\\", a department so secret that even the law covering up its secrets is secret. The protagonist, from being an advanced sysadmin, gets his wish of getting into more active service and of course ends up wishing he hadn't. Much combating evil cults and other-worldly monstrosities using computers, modern weapons and unholy artifacts ensue.Unfortunately, the writing does not hold up to the interesting premise. It is as if it tries to do several things at once and fails. It's not funny enough to be on par with Terry Pratchett or Douglas Adams. It doesn't take itself seriously enough to make the horrors really horrible. It only scratches the surface of the rich vein that is British culture. For an avowed geek like me, probably the best part is the techno-babble. It is clear that Stross is familiar with a goodly amount of computers, mathematics and physics, and uses it for plot lines and explanations that are sometimes quite unexpected and interesting. However, it lacks cohesion, and has a geekier-than-thou attitude that gets old really fast (\\"Wave if you understood that\\" - yeah, I did the proof. Move along). His expositions are too obvious and too much revelling in obscure technical terms, getting in the way of the plot instead of advancing it. Stross needs to learn to edit himself, a harder task for any writer than just the writing.Stross gets a B+ for an intriguing world and plot that doesn't really convince."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"While I can't say that I'm overly fond of much of Lovecraft's actual work, the ideas that he created - namely the named and nameless horrors that exist just beyond what we perceive as reality - have intrigued me for years. So when I heard in a very roundabout way of the existence of Stross' works down that road*, I decided to take a trip to the library and see what was what.I'm really glad that I did; the book was fantastic. The title \\"story\\" (which I believe was initially the book entirely before the second bit got added) takes a little while to get going, but the explanation at the beginning is really worth it as the events start to unfold. By the time \\"The Atrocity Archive\\" was finished, I was estatic to see that there was more book to read in the form of the much shorter \\"Concrete Jungle.\\"The events in \\"CJ\\" move along at a much brisker pace owing to the previous introduction of all the necessary characters, and even though didn't quite contain as much action as \\"AA,\\" I thought it was the more riveting story.The weirdness of the book is balanced quite nicely with a helping of humor; not quite as black as that found as 'John Dies at the End,' but along the same vein of \\"weird things are DAMN weird.\\"A fantastic read and I eagerly anticipate enjoying the further exploits of the characters.*The creation of a role-playing game called 'The Laundry RPG' based on Stross' works."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"I almost stopped reading The Atrocity Archives when I read the implication that Alan Turing may have been killed off after divulging his last theorum to an old wartime friend who he should have known better than to trust.

I take Mr. Turing's suicide very serious and am grateful to the British for finally apologising for their part in his suicide.That said, I continued on and have been able to lose myself in this story which is reminiscent of a geekier British Dresden Files. I could have done with a little less attempt at the humor. Sometimes, it can seem on the verge of overkill.Other than the above nit-picking Charles Stross has won me over and I want to read more from his catalogue."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"This book would make perfect reading for the unsung system administrator in your life. What if the intricacies of taking care of data could accidentally call evil from another dimension? What if your high level work mentor could not only cow your immediate (and irritating) boss, but could actually send her screaming into a hell dimension? This and other fun questions are answered in The Atrocity Archives. Stross introduces Bob Howard, a quiet unassuming tech in a very secret place who finds himself mixing in with the big boys. He thought that he wanted more field experience-- at least until he actually gets it.The book is actually a short novel (\\"The Atrocity Archives\\") combined with a short story \\"(\\"The Concrete Jungle\\"-- which won a Hugo in 2005 for the best novella). I liked both, but I also wanted both to be longer.Think a spy thriller mixed with Lovecraft mixed with a horror satire and you've kind of got the feel of the book. There's more humor than Serious Drama, but it works very well in the combination. I'm looking forward to reading The Jennifer Morgue."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"My first exposure to Charles Stross was his short story \\"A Colder War\\" ... which he generously makes available for free, on his website. I emailed the author and asked for more of the same, and he took the time to recommend his \\"Laundry\\" series, \\"The Atrocity Archives\\" and \\"Jennifer Morgue.\\" I've recently finished reading both, and eagerly await the third which is promised some time in 2010.The only down side to his books are the inclusion of a lot of geek-speak, especially computerese that only an IT guy would appreciate. As it happens, I am an IT guy, so I caught most of his references! Still, I can see as how they may put off more 'normal' folk. [One mustn't annoy the muggles!]After that, the books are a treasure trove of originality! His characters are interesting and complex, his plots are unique, the milieu they operate within is dark, in that government bureaucracy/operations group type of way. The main character, Bob Howard, isn't an 'everyman', he's an 'every-geek' and you root for him because he's so out of his element in the world of spies and assassins and action hero's. Yet, in a world in which \\"math IS magic\\" and \\"computational demonology\\" is a job title, the guy in the know is exactly the kind of hero you want on your side!Also, the short story after the novel, \\"Concrete Jungle\\" is excellent and demonstrates just how twisted intraoffice politics can be, when everyone involved is 'used to' dealing with mind & reality warping technologies.Finally, the essay at the end really opened my eyes to the reason WHY a horror / spy story cross over is so easy. Charles makes a convincing argument that Lovecraftian horror really is spy fiction - because it's more concerned with uncovering secrets then fighting monsters. And, why cold war era spy stories really are horror fiction - because they have total nuclear annihilation as their backdrop. I appreciated this essay and considered it an 'extra' in the sense that modern DVD's have extra's and interviews with the director's, etc.Anyway, more then worth the time to read. I highly recommend this book and it's sequel, \\"Jennifer Morgue.\\""},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"A fun read, especially if you've got a degree in CS and/or are addicted to slashdot. The CS in-jokes and pop-culture references are pretty good, but get old after a while. Unfortunately, the characters are pretty thinly drawn (a complaint I had about Stross' Singularity Sky also). The main character is your typical geek who falls into a lot more trouble than he was expecting. The love interest is every 13 year-old geek's wet dream (she's beautiful and loves Knuth's books!). Everyone else in the book is completely forgettable or cliched (e.g. the \\"mad scientist\\" roomates Pinky and Brains).The plot is uneven, slow in the first half and shifting into \\"action\\" mode in the second half. The mixture of a modern office atmosphere and Lovecraft reminided me of Spencer's Resume with Monsters, which IMHO held together much better.I got introduced to Stross by his short story \\"A Colder War\\" which exists in the same Lovecraft meets the military-industrial-complex universe.

The essential problem is that mathematicians and computer hackers, if they're good enough, can accidentally arrive at solutions that can open doorways to other dimensions, where things dwell that are utterly malevolent and which will consume our entire world if they get the chance. What are these monsters like? Lovecraft wasn't writing fiction, basically.Bob Howard is a computer hacker who did the wrong kind of really good work and got forcibly recruited into the super-secret, but badly underfunded, agency that deals with this threat. Eventually, he's unlucky enough to get what he asks for-promotion to field work. Suddenly, Bob is dealing with demon-possessed terrorists, philosophy professors who've found a new and different way to get too close to the truth, and threats to the very fabric of existence. Life is isn't boring anymore. And that's all just in The Atrocity Archive. This book also contains a novella, \\"The Concrete Jungle,\\" the further adventures of Bob Howard through the really dark side of the world.Very, very good"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Among other things that make this special is the genre-fusion. The technobabble that punctuates can be excessive, and slow the narrative sometimes, but it generally lends verisimilitude. This is a comic novel, and sometimes fails to avoid the chief pitfall of comic novels --cuteness. But when Stross is good, he's very good, and evokes his world with skill. The freshness of the approach helps, too: the subsequent novels lack that, and just aren't as good. While I agreed with much of what he said in the appendices, the book could have done without them. Better not to know how the sausage is made."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Reading the rave reviews here, I HAD to try this one. It wasn't up to the acclaim for me.Stross has created a detailed world, and delivers an incredible texture to his story, but if you don't have a computer science degree, it might be tough figuring out what is magic, what is technical, and what is just gibberish. There's so much here that seems inside humor, and I, for one, was on the outside.The book has amazing potential, but by avoiding mainstream readers, it won't be as successful as the author deserves.Make no mistake, this book has some really great ideas, and combines Lovecraftian horror with action, and dunks it in the movie \\"Office Space.\\" Portions of it just fly along, and the original ideas are fantastic.The problem was that when explanations were made, I just don't speak programmer language, so I didn't get it, and the book bogged down.I won't say this is not a good book, but if it were slightly less reliant on the technical language, it would be elevated to great."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"For those of us who can understand the depth and layers of writing here, it doesn't get much better than this. One need only be steeped in Lovecraft, Howard, Mythos Lore, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, video gaming, techno gadgets and James Bond to begin to scratch the surface of the little gems found in this collection and The Jennifer Morgue. Truly unique, kind of like reading a Brian Lumley / Ian Flemming / Neil Stephenson novel?!"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"This consists of two separate stories \\"The Atrocity Archives\\" (235 pages) and the Hugo Award winning novella \\"The Concrete Jungle\\" (85 pages).Both stories star Bob Howard, a strange mix of IT specialist, secret policeman, and mathematical magician, who works for The Laundry, a super secret British government agency fending off supernatural threats.The Atrocity Archives may initially seem a little rambling, but stick with it, for the second half pulls it all together into an extremely focused and tense conclusion.In the Concrete Jungle our hero faces a fascinating new threat, mixing magic and technology, against Her Majesty's Government (or at least the placid town of Milton Keynes). Howard gets to fight off an amazing range of threats, both magical and bureaucratic, before good rather mysteriously triumphs.Stross provides a deft mixing of technological arcana with mathematically based magic, with much ironic humour along the way. Great fun!"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"I usually dislike the horror genre in any of its forms, and have no liking for Lovecraftian fantasy. Though _The Atrocity Archives_ could be said to belong to this genre, I found it by turns hilarious, creepy, and tense. In short, I enjoyed it immensely. There's a lot to like about this book, and if you don't like some of the things you encounter in its pages...well, there is still a lot to like. There's the Cthulhu mythos, evil Nazi necromancy, office politics, computer in-jokes, spy novel tropes, all leavened by a refreshing dry wit that is subtle enough to leave you wondering why you are laughing at this stuff.I particularly like Stross' penchant for strewing about historical and technical allusions so that his narratives are a minefield for the curious. I would have sworn there was never an \\"Ahnenerbe\\" SS, dedicated to strengthening the Third Reich by ferreting out ancient Aryan and Teutonic mysteries. I really didn't know that the Nazi party was descended from an organization created by the mystical Thule Society, but apparently it was so. (At least Wikipedia tells me that both are true.)Of course, Stross cleverly mixes the truth with the not-quite-true and the outright nutty (otherwise this wouldn't be fiction, but a classified government document, and one would have to be shot after reading it). One example of how Stross shades reality is one character's idiosyncratic use of a \\"Memex\\" machine (allegedly because it is more secure than a mere electronic computer). The Memex was a proposal made in the 1950s by Vannevar Bush for what we would today call an implementation of \\"hypertext\\". It was based on the technology of the day--data was to be stored on microfiche, and its operation was entirely mechanical. As I said, this was merely a theoretical proposal--no such machine was ever built. Or so they tell us..."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"The Atrocity Archives by Charles Stross is a production from Golden Gryphon Press. Cost is less than $18.00 with the usual shipping charges. The book is in its second printing but 1st editions may still be found for those of you who care about such things. It is a beautiful hardcover; all of Golden Gryphon's books have great production qualities. I have a copy ofEternal Lovecraft and it has similar appeaing features. Binding is cloth with a nice slip cover with art by Steve Montiglio. The painting depicts some arcane appearing machine creating a gate into another world, very well done and very appropriate to the subject of the book.There is an introduction by Kevin MacLeod and a detailed author's note at the end, both of which are enormously informative and as entertaining to read as the books iself. The book in fact contains a novel, The Atrocity Archives, and a novella, The Concrete Jungle, which carries on with the same characters from The Atrocity Archives. AA was originally serialized in a UK SF magazine, and was reprinted here; I amnot sure, but I think it may have been expanded some for the novel version.For those of you who don't know him, Charles Stross has written, in my opinion, one of the best mythos stories ever, A Colder War. This story is available to read free online on his website and also in his story collection Toast. I believe it will also appear in The Cthulhuian Singularity whenever that worthy collection sees the light of print. Now I am struggling to come up with comparisons here, the story is that good. It sort of fits in with Cody Goodfellow's Radiant Dawn, or even more, the Delta Green fiction, where the Lovecraftian truth of theuniverse is known by the governments of the nations and they try both desperately to conceal it from their citizens, and use this horrible knowledge as a weapon. The soviets have a handful of shoggoths and the means to free Cthulhu, and the US has access to some extradimensional gates. I find the story wildly original, marvelously written, absolutely true to Lovecraft and also carrying a perfect sense of horror. So it was with great anticipation that I turned to The Atrocity Archives.Some spoliers may follow.First, I really enjoyed reading this book and can recommed it without hesitation. But I am having a very hard time deciding what the heck it is that I am recommending! I read the novel and novella before the introduction or the author's note, and came to a conclusion that although this work lives and breathes in Lovecratft's worlds it is not really a mythos novel at all, not the way A Colder War is. The author's note just confirmed my suspicions! Most interesting is that Stross had not read Tim Power's Declare or any Delta Green before finishing AA, so it is entirely his own conception.Briefly, all the mythos entities etc are real, intelligent and malignant alien entities that exist in alternate universes (ah, the old multiverse concept!), who may have access to our universe if the proper ritual is performed. It turns out that there is a scientific and mathematical basis for this ability to open gates , and it has been sytematized, and this knowledge is a closely held givernmental secret. All the occultism has now become much more mundane. I'll quote an example; \\"In the case of the great circuit of Al-Hazred, the terminator was originally a black goat, sacrificed at midnight with a silver knifetouched only by virgins, but these days we just use a fifty microfarad capacitor.\\" Being a computer geek helps you create/understand/master the mathematical circuits you need. Mundane, yes, but the danger to the summoner remains, particularly if you are trying to summon or manipulate a more intelligent alien entity. In fact the AA refers to the record of The Holocaust, where the Nazis tried to use an enormousblood sacrifice of millions to open the gates to supernatural aid that would have won the war for them (similar in concept but greater in scale than DG's Karotechia). But nowadays everything is run by a labyrinthine, unnavigable and intractable civil service beauracracy. And so this novel really is more a cloak and dagger spy novel, where the trappings are not so much James Bond gadgets as ancient geases, sarificial gates and hands of glory as standard issue occult weapons. Honestly, there is no Lovecraftian feel at all! Anyone who seems to be stumbling onto the science or ritual necessary to manipulate reality this way is the forcibly recruited by the government for nationalsecurity reasons.The hero is Bob Howard, a hacker/computer geek turned field agent, who goes spook hunting to track down what seems to be the remnants of a cell devoted to the nazi dream of opening a gate so the ice giants, some malignant entity can come through and finish the war properly for once and all. Someone a bit like Q issues him some occult gear, he never goes anywhere without a laptop or palmpilot, he rooms with some computer geeks who are busy creating nameless gates in the basement apparently for the heck of it, he basically has a small cubicle to call his own and supervisors who are quite petty. All in all superbly written and great fun. He meets a British expatriate named Dominiquewho is of course strikingly pretty, a brilliant mathematician, acomputer geek and who falls for him. Of all the characters she was the least successful, partly because in spite of all these qualities attributed to her she never rose above the level of window dressing, the damsel in distress who needed to be rescued. High tech, low tech, extradimensional tech, this book was a corking good read. But read it with mindset that it is a spy novel and you catch the flavor better. I liked the novella The Concrete Jungle equally well. I certainly hope Mr. Stross continues Bob Howard's adventures in future books!"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"What makes this book particularly delightful is all the accounting and bureaucracy the poor protagonist must deal with before he's allowed to save reality as we know it. Stross makes clear that there are a handful of people in the Laundry who are really good at solving the supernatural problems threatening to destroy the world, a lot of people who are really good at making the first group fill out time cards, and a much-too-large group that really doesn't seem to understand anything that's going on around them, and that should definitely not be allowed to take continuing education credits in demon summoning...."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"What a hoot... enough inside geek jokes to choke a Gibbering Horror...I finished it in record time... and re-read it a day later to catch everything I missed the first time!"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"A fun combination of Lovecraft monsters, evil ratzis, spies, and Yes Minister, with a touch of Snow Crash.Robert Howard works for 'The Laundry' - the slang name for the spook agency that deals with thaumaturgical, paranormal and invasion by cold, alien intelligences from other universe.Interesting lengthy essay at the end where Stross talks about the spy novel as horror novel, due to the horrible looming real life threat of nuclear armageddon that was the thread running through a large number of them in recent times.Entertaining solution for useless paperclip counting backstabbing office politicking bureaucrats, too!"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"As in his other books - ACCELERANDO, IRON SUNRISE and SINGULARITY SKY, this is a novel of post- Singularity, after the non-biological entity has become conscious and evolved with a terrifying speed into the Eschaton which is beyond human comprehension.In this tongue in cheek horror tale, Alan Turing completed his last theorem and a Turing machine was born. Unfortunately this opened the gateway to a universe of awful creatures. Battling this is our intrepid hero, Bob, and his sidekicks of computer geeks. Indeed it reads like a funny MI6/noire/horror/sci-fi jack of all trades as the nerds save the world from certain doom."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"This book was like a doughnut: enjoyable as I chewed through its pages, but guiltily hollow in retrospect. The story moves quickly, and I laughed out loud on occasion; for the first half of the book I was prepared to give this an easy 4 stars. But as I progressed, I realized it wasn't Stross's writing that appealed to me - that was downright clunky in parts. It was not the story - that was basically a clever Lovecraft/Deighton mash-up (with touches of bureaucratic IT hell) overlaid on a banal sci-fi plot progression. And it certainly wasn't the characters, who lacked any sense of depth or personality - they were merely there to do useful or amusing things. (Aside: Stross's female characters were especially egregious. There was the crazy ex-girlfriend, the petty bureaucratic boss, and the nerd's wet-dream: a woman whose sole personality trait was \\"smart\\" - she conveniently goes for geeks who think they're not good enough for her, and needs saving by the hero.)Instead, my reading pleasure arose from the sense of self-satisfaction that arose from understanding the in-jokes and the math/science/geek-culture references. Stross played my nerd-ego like a violin, and I ate it up; but afterward I felt guilty for that. It's been a matter of days since I completed this novel, and already the story and characters have faded from my mind; only the author's clever devices have any potential for lasting impact.Still, the weaknesses of The Atrocity Archives were only glaring upon reflection. The novel was a fun read because it's not difficult to suppress the critical parts of your brain while you're in it; for that, it deserves 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Bob Howard is his section IT geek in The Laundry - the UK's version of government sponsored supernatural protection agency. Life is pretty predictable for him till he decides to apply for active duty, and his first \\"simple\\" job goes pear-shaped on him. From this point onwards Bob is going to learn that while he might know a lot about the supernatural he didn't quite know as much as he thought about The Laundry itself.This book is actually one novel, \\"The Atrocity Archives\\" where we meet Bob and the strange world he inhabits and a novella, \\"The concrete jungle\\" which follows up the main story in sequel.I really enjoyed this book. It doesn't have any real noticeably slow patches. Despite his sometimes horrible work I also liked Bob. I'm glad I picked up this book, while the whole idea of a real dangerous supernatural world surrounding us isn't unique this is a nice fresh approach to the theme. Some of the things it deals with are straight out of a nightmare, but despite that it has an undertone of humour and a sharp eye for office politics and procedures. It's a bit like Dilbert with teeth at times.

Characters are well formed and the universe feelsreal enough."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"The Atrocity Archives (2004) is the first SF novel in The Laundry Files series. It is set in the current era, but in a world where mathematics and the proper word phrases effect reality. It contains two stories, an introduction and a glossary or acronyms.During World War II, the British discovered a mathematical interface to what is commonly called magic. They also found that the Nazis were already using magic to produce weapons. These magical effects are kept secret from the general public by the authorities, but shared with the allies.The Laundry is a British agency concerned with maintaining such secrecy and with protecting the populace from breakouts from other dimensions. This organization was originally a part of the Special Operations Executive, but was spun off when other agencies in the SOE were eliminated after the war.In this novel, Robert Howard is a man recruited by the Laundry after almost releasing a powerful being into his environment. Bob works as a computer technician in the Laundry, but has applied for training as a field agent.Andrew is an operation manager supervising magical activities. Bob sometimes works for Andy, but his efficiency reports are submitted by Harriet.Harriet is a line manager from Hades in the matrix management of the Laundry and supervises Bob's technical activities. She doesn't like Bob's attitude and obsesses over missed reports. Harriet is fully aware of every word in the agency handbook. She works for Bridget.Bridget is a high ranking manager who wants to be prime minister before she retires. She is also obsessive about paperwork.Angleton is head of the Counter-Possession Unit. His office is across the building in the Dunsey Wing. It is large and crammed with books and souvenirs.Boris the Mole is a security officer and an old hand in the Laundry. He works for Angleton.Dominique O'Brien is a Professor of Philosophy in the University of California at Santa Cruz. Mo also works for the Defense Department on persuasion methods.Josephine Sullivan is a Detective Inspector at Milton Keynes. She has been cleared for Section 3.In this story, Bob gets a chance for a field assignment from Andy and finds it wet and boring. He waits until everybody leaves a building and crawls through an unlocked window, knocking CDs all over the floor. Then he cracks into a desk computer and erases another discovery of Turing's Theorem.Bob gets back to his flat at 2:30 in the morning and sleeps through his alarm clock. He is awakened by a call from Andy asking when he is coming to work. Bob suggests eleven o'clock and Andy agrees.Bob meets with Andy, Boris and Harriet in room B4. Andy says that he had accomplished the objective despite the poor fieldwork. Harriet mentions his timekeeping problems and lack of prior notification.They also discuss the disposition of the target. Andy confirms that he had rediscovered Turing's Theorem from first principles. Bob suggests that they recruit him into the Laundry and make him sign Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act (1916).Andy has Bob stay behind after the meeting. He suggests that Bob should stay on the good side of Harriet; Bob isn't sure Harriet has a good side. Andy also compliments him on the field exercise and states that he will send Bob to a field training course.When Bob gets back to his office, he has a Beowulf cluster to fix and thirty-two emails. After staring at the wall for five minutes, Bob reads the first email. It is from Mhari. He stares at the wall for another five minutes.The next email is a directive on sick leave sent by Harriet. It states that any such leave exceeding half an hour requires a doctor's note. If possible, such leave and note should be submitted in advance.Feeling a headache coming on, Bob reads the next email. It is from Fred asking to more help. Bob stares at the wall again and decides to take off the rest of the day.Later, Bob attends the Computational Demonology for Dummies course. He has already taken the course -- and probably could teach it -- but his job is to keep an eye on the trainees. Fred is also attending the course, but is totally clueless about the topic. Bob tries to talk him into switching classes.Three months later, Bob goes to California to meet with Mo. He has no idea that she is a good looking woman. But the meeting lands him in a hospital.In the second story, Bob is working for Angleton. He gets a call at 4:00 AM from his boss. Angleton is calling a Code Blue.Bob is outside his flat within ten minutes and is delivered to the Laundry fifteen minutes later. As Bob enters the boardroom, Angleton tells him that he is late. Bob points out that the police driver had not wasted any time.Angleton, Boris and Andy brief him on GAME ANDES REDSHIFT. It seems that the techies in Q Division have developed basilisk software for CCTV units around Britain. Now there is a ninth stone cow in Milton Keynes and Angleton wants to know why.Bob gets to fly down to Milton Keynes in a police copter and check out the cows. Eight concrete cows are sculptures, but the ninth is fried and dead from a basilisk stare. Bob takes its temperature and finds it to be hot as an oven.The next day, Bob visits the Milton Keynes copshop and talks to DI Sullivan. Josephine has traced the cow to a dairy farm and found that it had been sold to a fictitious individual. The first witness on the scene had been hours later. Bob plants a geas on Sullivan to keep her from talking to others.The police had found the Range Rover used to haul the cow, but it had been wiped down and had no usable prints. Bob asks to see the car and is taken to the impound lot. There he takes occult reading with his palmtop and then notices that the CCTV camera in the lot is pointing to the car.He tells Sullivan to hit the deck and dives for the ground. When she doesn't move, he pulls her legs out from under her. She gets a little feisty over that.Meanwhile, the Range Rover explodes and then the guard is zapped by SCORPION STARE. Bob lights his miniature Hand of Glory and grabs her hand. Under cover of the invisibility spell, they move to the pound office and deactivate the CCTV there.Then Andy arrives on the scene and recruits Josephine into the Laundry. Angleton had assigned them the job of checking a small SERA branch in a local office park. They drive over in the police car and find most of the SERA workers dead.These tales present magic as an offshoot of mathematics. The devils, demons and other preternatural beings are actually inhabitants of other dimensions. They can be invoked by Turing's Theorem or other geometric or mathematical methods.These tales resemble the works ofH.P. LovecraftandSimon Green, but are presented as science fiction. In that respect, they are much like de Camp'sEnchanterseries and Rick Cook'sWizseries.Office politics is deadlier than interdimensional possession. The next installment in this sequence isThe Jennifer Morgue.Highly recommended for Stross fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of scientific magic, office politics, and a touch of romance. Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"I must say that I picked this book with some trepidation, even with the great reviews, as it didn't really sound like \\"my kind of thing\\". Within the first five pages I was hooked! Having worked in Customer Service and IT for the last 35 years, I can say without hesitation that Stross nails the IT culture, civil service, political in-fighting and a hundred other things both in and out of the IT world. The concept that he uses in this series of books (the idea that magic is really all just math, which can be accessed via technology and computers) is an interesting and humorous one. With a tone that is snarky, sarcastic and, at times, down right irreverent, his style had me actually laughing out loud several times. I would, however, couple my recommendation with a warning: if you aren't familiar with the computer industry in specific, or the IT world in general, you may not get some of the in-jokes. None the less, I found this set of two stories humorous and incredibly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Maybe you're not familiar with TheRegister.co.uk's BOFH (Bastard Operator from Hell). He's the smart-ass systems admin you don't want to cross.Perhaps you missed Mad Magazine's classic Spy vs Spy. They're the two spies who are always having a go at each other.You probably work with Dilbert, but you might not realize it.And then there's some nameless horror out of a mythic legend that needs to be put down, and how, and you don't want to meet one anyways.Stross actually comes from IT, so this is one techno-thriller where the technology is real and magic is found in the deep corners of potentially city-destroying fractal patterns. The world he weaves is truly excellent. Like Philip Dick, he grounds all of his characters as real people in a real world. You know them as people and not puppets. There is a set of ideas creating a solid foundation for the scenes. Unlike Dick, Stross' stories are far more accessible, and unlike other current SF writers, its an engrossing romp with reality and unreality woven together like a Celtic knot.Bob, our protagonist, works in a British civil service job in an oddly-named agency with pretty much no prospects other than looking at his cubicle walls for the rest of his life. He's got a micro-matrix-managing boss who should have pointy hair, but her hairdresser wouldn't allow that to happen, never. We meet Bob while he is standing out in the rain, waiting to get in through a window.This is one book where I was never bored, or aghast at a writer's complete lack of technical knowledge. Stross is an excellent writer, and I am going to put him on my short list for buying his other books."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"This isn't the first attempt at mixing mathematics and magic. James Gunn's \\"Sine of the Magus\\", Poul Anderson's \\"Operation Chaos\\", and Rick Cook's \\"Wizard's Bane\\" books all spring to mind.But Mr. Stross has truly carved out a new, terrifying, and terrifyingly humorous niche in this particular sub-sub-genre of science fiction and fantasy.It's not so much a novel, per se, as a series of closely connected novelets dealing with one \\"Bob Howard\\" (Robert E. Howard, by chance?) and his growing awareness that The Things Are Out There, and they're *hungry*. And so, he has no choice but to pick up his PDA and his copy of Knuth's suppressed Volume 4 and do battle.Stross carries the stories along smoothly, with dashes of humor (wave if you get some of the more esoteric computer science/physics/mathematics jokes), and cold, horrifying nightmares to make even Lovecraft shiver. By the end of the book, you're not sure whether you've laughed your way through a horror novel, or shivered your way through a comedy.This was massively worth the time I took to read it. Stross has a sequel in the works, as well, and there's another Bob Howard story coming out in the first issue of Baen Books' new E-magazine \\"Universe,\\" that I'm waiting for.I hope Bob Howard has a long future, because if he doesn't... (shiver)More, please!"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"The first time I finished reading The Atrocity Archives, I did something I hadn't done in an age: turned back to the beginning and read it straight through again. There are never enough books like this, most likely because writing them is so much harder than it looks.Thank you, Charlie."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"What a great book! Charles Stross' \\"Atrocity Archives/Concrete Jungle is a mixtue of Lovecraft, Len Deighton as well as Monty Python and Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\" all in one. This is a book that a reader will have to read multiple times and will glean something new from the book in every reading.Bob Howard is an IT (Info Technology)support person for the Laundry, a British Department under the OSI banner, now known as MIV and MI VI. The Laundry is the Department that deals with the paranormal for Britain and endeavors to keep the nation free from events and creatures from other dimensions and universes that \\"would like to suck brains and souls from our bodies.\\" In Mr. Stross' world, supernatural events and creatures are not conjured through arcane blood rituals but through uses of computers, mathematical formulas and other non-supernatural, technical means. Other countries have paranormal departments as part of their spy/security apparatus. For example, the U.S. paranormal department is known as the Black Chamber.The reader discovers that no one joins the Laundry, they are forced to \\"join\\". Bob Howard \\"joined\\" the Laundry after he was discovered playing with a mathematical theorem on his computer that threatened to obliterate the town of Wolverhampton in a ghastly Lovecraftian manner. He is promoted from IT to field agent after rescuing a summoning class from a possessed classmate who did not follow the rules and discovers that his first case means saving Britain and the rest of the world from a nameless horror from another universe who is working it's way to our earth with past cooperation from a renegade SS Unit, the Ahenenerbe, who used a ghastly summoning ritual that pertains to the Holocaust, to escape the current earth at the end of WWII.This book defies convention. This is a mixture of Science Fiction, Horror and British Humor all rolled into one fascinating mix. The reader becomes intimately involved in the minutiae of the British Civil Service and their frustrating and over beaureaucratic methods of conducting business. Bob, for example, lives in constant fear of explaining his every action and decision to the unseen but fearome \\"Auditors\\". Stross' characters are enagaging and memorable; from the sensuous and mysterious Dr. Dominique \\"Mo\\" O'Brien who has a major part to play in Bob's first mission, to the mysterious and very sinister Angleton who Bob ends up being a Private personal secretary, the British term for \\"Administrative Assistant\\", Bridget and Harriet from HR, his fellow Laundry worker roomates Pinky and Brains and Bob's slightly harried superior Andy.I love this book. I am currently finishing \\"the Jennifer Morgue\\", the second, but hopefully not final Laundry/Bob Howard novel by Mr. Stross.

Or maybe not - maybe he has just provided us with the real story for the first time? Who knows?Mixing Cthonian mythos, quantum physics and metaphysics, mathematical metatheory and spy thriller, Stross has made reading this book kind of like watching Monty Python in Japanese. There is simply no way to define the genre. That said, it is certainly a fun ride! Populated with computer programmer wizards, electronic gorgons, zombie birds and genetically engineered mer-people, this is a weird and wonderful world.Bob is our hero, a member of the Laundry - a section of the British Secret Services that is so secret that even knowing about it is illegal unless you are a part of it. The Laundry is dedicated to making certain that the veils between the realities don't end up being pierced by accident - some mathematician using an unusual theorem or a computer programmer coming up with something new - that would actually end up calling up the Elder Gods or opening up a portal to allow the gibbering hordes of demons access to our world. Bob was conscripted when a computer program he was working on almost ended up remaking a large part of a section of Britain. He recently made the mistake of asking to work in \\"active service,\\" and that request has just been approved ... things keep going from bad to worse as he is continually thrown into circumstances that end up snowballing into events beyond his control; and things are never quite what they seem.In \\"Concrete Jungle\\" he is awakened at 4 am to go and look at concrete cows in Milton Keynes; it appears that there may be an extra one there (there is a herd of concrete cows - sculptures. There are supposed to be 8. Bob finds 9). Bob discovers what appears to be the work of a basilisk or gorgon. How can this be? Again, things quickly tobaggon out of his control.Bob is the perfect hero for the modern age - armed with a Palm Pilot and cell phone (and occasionally a pigeon's foot) rather than a gun; scrawny and nerdish rather than tall and handsome, he is the epitome of the modern computer geek/hacker. Somehow, despite his tendency to stick his nose where it doesn't belong, and to jump into the middle of things where he has no business being, he manages to always come out ... well ... alive.I can definitely recommend this book to anyone who: likes dry British humour, likes Monty Python, likes Charles Stross, likes Ctholian mythology, likes H. P. Lovecraft generally, likes spy thrillers, likes alternate reality worlds, or just enjoys a really weird and wonderful yarn. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Though frequently billed as Lovecraft meets a spy novel, it also has a healthy flavor of alternate history like Hellboy, in which evil Nazis carry on their occult madness and murder long after the war. The least expected twist is the black, oh-so British humor of mundane life in the face of otherworldly weirdness, in which our hero is as terrified of having to fill out requisition forms in triplicate as he is of hellspawn that can rearrange his molecules. It drags a little between scenes, especially with some of the domestic humor of his housemates and girlfriend, or it'd be five stars all the way."},{"Title":"The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files)","review":"Charles Stross is rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors, and this book is largely responsible.

Maybe the shuffling undead assistant that brought you tea is standing about, maybe the boss called you on the carpet earlier and you had to speak truths because you were bound by spell to... Stross wrote a book so good, so full of dark humor and great descriptive flashes, that I read it in a sitting. The setting is at once ridiculous and darkly real, not because of the subject matter (equal parts Lovecraft and Cold War thriller) is normal and expected-- far from it. Stross just writes scenes so well that they all hang together in a wonderful way. Even if it's not a great work of literature it is a great read.If you read and enjoyed the attitude of a Quiller book, stayed awake too long reading Lovecraft, know who Don Knuth is, read about Alan Turing and have read the Atlantic Monthly article by Vannevar Bush you will order this book right now."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"There are two main versions of the Bulger brothers. One brother, Whitey, turned to crime, became a crime syndicate leader, and is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List. The other much younger brother, William, didn't know his brother well and was not influenced by him, yet instead wanted to help others. William became the good brother to Whitey's bad brother, and William went into politics and became a powerful Massachusetts State Senate and rose to be an influential political leader as Senate President Pro Tempore.This book suggests another version. It claims William and Whitey together violated public ethics by working in cahoots. It shows how cocaine dealing associates of Whitey's obtained state jobs with William's assistance and how a budget amendment introduced by Senator Bulger forced the retirement of several State Police officers investigating Whitey. It further disputes William's assertions that he had little awareness of what his brother was doing.William Bulger admittedly was not a political reformer. \\"Show me a reformer and I'll show you someone who won't be back\\" through reelection, Bulger once claimed. Bulger admittedly was a master of the political deal. He grew up in a Boston where local residents knew the police and prosecutors could be bribed and pardons and commutations could be purchased. When William made it to the legislature, patronage was widespread. Legislators often got jobs with little responsibilities for their friends. State Rep. Barney Frank would quip how, when he arrived at the Massachusetts Capitol, he found more people to open doors than there were doors.Whitey not only was a criminal, he was a medical subject who as a prisoner was given LSD and studied. To what degree the drug affected Whitey, we can speculate. To what degree the government felt guilty for the damage they inflicted, we may never know. What is known is that Whitey began playing both sides. Whitey became an FBI informant. Yet, Whitey didn't switch sides. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover seemed so hungry for organized crime information that the FBI looked the other way when informants performed their crimes. To Whitey, this allowed him to take advantage of both worlds. He could get the FBI to arrest his rivals and get them to look the other way as he took over the lead in mob activities.While William was a political leader of South Boston, Whitey controlled the rackets operations (allegedly driving out the Cosa Nostra and taking control himself) in South Boston, and the FBI and the Bulger brothers helped each other out, according to the author. Senator Bulger was there to help FBI agents, who generally weren't highly paid, find other jobs when forced into retirement. Senator Bulger was accused of extortion, yet an FBI probe quickly found the Senator Bulger had done nothing wrong. Indeed, William and the FBI agent who investigated him seem to have become friends, as William served as the master of ceremonies at the FBI agent's retirement party.William Bulger helped elect John Silber as Governor. While Silber and Bulger had a good working political relationship, Silber worked less well with the public. Governor Silber upset many voters by stating that a women over age 25 were over the hill, openly questioning why so many welfare recipient s were \\"from the tropical climates\\", and proclaiming he that the elderly should die and to make room for the young. Opponents openly began calling for the end of the \\"Silber-Bulger\\" form of government.Sensing that his political career was ending, William Bulger shifted into academic and became the President of the University of Massachusetts. Unfortunately, William's taking the Fifth Amendment before Congress when questioned about organized crime was not well received by University Trustees. William Bulger resigned his Presidency.It should be noted that the author was one of the University Trustees who opposed William Bulger. Still, the book appears to be very well researched and is an intriguing expose into one of Massachusetts most powerful families. Whether it is the story of a family whether both sons crossed the lines of lines of legality and morality, this book argues the answer to that question is: they both did."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.

From an early age Whitey was headed in the wrong direction in life and he soon became one of the most feared men in Boston and is currently in the top ten on the FBI's most wanted list. For a long time Billy seemed to be on the straight and narrow, at least to the public, as he became involved in politics, eventually becoming president of the Massachusetts State Senate. But \\"The Brothers Bulger\\" shows the Billy earned his nickname of \\"The Corrupt Midget\\".I'm not a big fan of Howie Carr's newspaper column in The Boston Herald and almost didn't read \\"The Brothers Bulger\\" because of that. I'm glad I did. Newspaper column to the contrary, Carr can actually write and does a good job telling the Bulger's story. I've lived in the Boston area my entire life and while aware of the Bulgers I wasn't aware of the extent of Whitey's crimes or the extent of the corruption. I was also surprised at the number of local politicians and other well known Bostonians who knew what was going on with the Bulgers and looked the other way including Michael Dukakis, Kevin White, Joe Moakley, Bill Weld, and Cardinal Law.Of the two brothers, Whitey's story, not surprisingly, is the most compelling. He is truly a brutal man, not caring who he killed, be it man or woman. One of his killings was so brutal I cringed while reading it. His dealings with the FBI are mind boggling and not very reassuring. While Billy's story is less compelling, it was still interesting to read how he maneuvered his way through Boston politics and managed to snag himself a nice sized pension from U-Mass Boston. What was especially interesting about all this is the numerous mistakes he made politically and still came out on top for a long time.As of right now, Whitey Bulger is still at large and wanted by the FBI. If he is ever found (and after reading this book I have to wonder how hard the FBI is looking for him), I hope Howie Carr is able to write a book about Whitey's years on the lam, which I'm sure would be quite interesting.\\"The Brothers Bulger\\" is a compelling read."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Many hours can be spent scouring all sorts of documents in order to gain the same amount of information Howie Carr presents in his book.

Anyone moving to Massachusetts and in need to catch up on the seedy past of this Commonwealth need not go too far. And if that someone is still willing to move to Massachusetts even after reading this book, then he or she will be ready to strike up a conversation with any of the locals and fit right in. Regular listeners of the Howie Carr Show will delight in the amount of detail Howie goes into. Over the years, Howie has told many a crime tale but the book goes way beyond what he can cram into 15-minute segments.

I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers with regards to the FBI. They don't want to capture Whitey. He can probably put the whole FBI in prison. The only hero in this book is Keating who had the guts to stand up to Billy Bulger. I stay awake at night, thinking about the State cop who committed suicide after Billy Bulger ruined his life for doing his job.

A fewamusing anecdotes, like how Gerry Anguilo, upon being informedthat a fellow gangster was dead, shouted, \\"He can't be dead!He owes me $30,000!!\\" Can't make up stuff like that.Fans of Carr's column and radio show should be delighted.He has more photos and information at his various websites."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"As a recent Boston-area resident and politiphile -- not to mention a casual listener to the Howie Carr radio program -- I confess to being pre-conditioned for interest in this book. Picked it up a Boston-area book signing, and have no regrets.To be fair, however, 'The Brother Bulger' (TBB) requires a sufficient amount of ramp-up time until you feel as if you're following Carr's whirlwhind style. Akin to his radio program, Carr drops you right into the action, with the reader left trying to get his/her literary bearings before the book starts to truly make sense.At that point, however, what a ride it is! The cast of characters in this book are a virtual 'who's who' of Boston politics, the incredible web of causation of individual actions (from mob peon to Governor) amazing to piece together. Simply put, I cannot perceive these individuals nor the city of Boston the same way after reading TBB. Not from a better nor worse sense, rather now as an insider looking out, versus vice-versa. Somewhere in NYC and New Orleans, historians of Tammany Hall and Huey P. Long are both smiling.Of course with any book of this nature, some of Carr's accounts should be perceived as perspective vs. fact -- especially with Carr's initimate role in covering the Bulgers for decades while at the Boston Herald. Would be interesting to read the Weeks account to truly corroberate TBB's statements."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"People reviewing this book seem to think Billy Bulger is not corrupt and this book slanders him. Uh huh.....Just a few things regarding that slime.. the fact that he took at least 1 phone call that we know of from his killer brother after he was on the lam, he invoked the 5th at the comittee assembled to try to get info,he has said he was disinclined to cooperate with authorities and would never be \\"helpful to anyone against him.\\"...William Bulger has no more right than any other American to defy a Congressional subpoena. Further, as someone who holds a position of public responsibility -- indeed, one who has profited from public positions for most of his adult life -- he has a duty to uphold due process and respond to whatever demands it makes on him.Also the states biggest crime figure was one brother, and the other ran the state. And it gets better. The gang had a club house. The house was next door, not down the street, or near, but right next to.....Massachusetts Senate leader Billy Bulgers house..tell me he knew NOTHING about what these people were involved with. RIIIGHT. Don't get me started on his obgoing lawsuits where he has been trying to sweeten his annual six-figure pension by $32,000His second brother jackie lied to grand juries investigating his fugitive brother and lost his pension as a court clerk because of it. Now ONE brother is involved with the fugitive and has taken his phone calls but the other brother has not? No freakingw ay..the whole family stinks to high heaven and they all should share a cell togther, but that sadly will never happen.

A real page turner outlining the back stabbing treachery employed by both of South Boston's infamous son's as they followed their dual paths to the top. If Whitey hadn't killed 19 people (and probably way more than that)the question of \\"Who is more treacherous - Whitey or Billy?\\" might be more of a jump ball. But treacherous or not Billy was loyal to South Boston and lots of people wouldn't have decent jobs to support their families if it wasn't for him. Patronage is not a new component of political life, Billy just perfected it to an art form. This book also seems to be a more accurate portrayal of what actually happened than the hubris and revisionist history that seems to be prevalent in a lot of auto-biographical gangster books. But note to Howie Carr: South Boston High is on G Street, not H Street. Also there are places in the book where you seem to deliberately omit names, opting instead for a general description of the speaker or source etc... Why? The theory that Whitey is gay and used to be a male hustler in the Back Bay seems hard to believe and I wonder if Howie is just busting Billy's stones but who knows?

Carr is both a columnist and talk show personality with views that are relatively far to the right, as he always has an axe to grind with liberal government in Massachusetts. Despite this fact which could create bias in his piecing together the Bulger case, I thought this book was an honest attempt (laced with touch of outrage at criminal immunity and left wing corruption) to expose the injustice which allowed the Bulger brothers to dominate Boston for a long, long time.Carr's research and personal involvement with the case (through his role as Boston Herald columnist) gives him a credible platform on which to stand, but I found there might have been a small number of instances where he crosses the line into tabloid country (which is not uncommon for the Herald). The main point of contention, although it is mentioned briefly, is the statement that Bulger \\"turned tricks\\" at gay bars during his formative years in the late 1940's. There is some evidence to back this up; Bulger was known to frequent these establishments, but Carr also prefaces this information with the fact that corrupt cops used to shakedown homosexuals who were caught in the act, rather than bringing them down the station. It seems likely that Whitey's involvement was along these lines; the old school mob was not known for its tolerance of homosexuality and probably not an equal opportunity employer when it came to inducting them into the power structure. It read more like a hateful tabloid smear than credible journalism.Other than this assertion, which seemed out of place in the context of the book, Carr's writing seems to stick to the facts that surfaced with FBI handler John Connolly's files and the testimony of the Winter Hill gang once the DEA, US Attorneys and the State Police busted them up for good in the mid 1990's using RICO statutes. The DEA busted Whitey's cocaine ring (which grew from protection to distribution) and the State Police and US Attorney's used Chelsea bookies to establish racketeering charges. Like many gangster tales, it ends with a \\"battle of the rats\\", or who can testify first instead of taking the rap, with hitman Johnny Martorano, Bulger partner Steve Flemmi and the mafia/Winter Hill strong arm man Frank Salemme all trying to make a deal by giving up their associates. With the apprehension of Bulger last year, the sense of entitlement that defines all \\"protected\\" mobsters has been put on display, who argue that they were \\"authorized\\" to break the law in exchange for their status as informants. This protection allowed Bulger to execute almost 20 known victims, but perhaps in reality there are many more that no one will ever find out about.This case was a low point in the history of the FBI, as anytime they were involved in Whitey's case, the gangster would seem to know what the law was doing before they did. John Connolly is the exemplary Federal Agent gone bad, who crossed over to become a full time crook, using gangsters to eliminate gangsters, creating a monster in the process. But in Connolly's defense, this was a precedent that he inherited from 60's FBI agents H. Paul Rico and Dennis Condon, who used Jimmy \\"The Bear\\" Flemmi and Joe \\"The Animal\\" Barboza to eliminate pesky mobsters that avoided prosecution, most notably the Teddy Deegan case where Bear and the Animal were confirmed as the shooters, yet 4 other mobsters on the FBI's radar were convicted of the crime. Connolly happened to grow up in the Southie projects with the Bulgers and when Billy was elected as Southie State Rep in 1960, he had the blessing of US Speaker of the House John McCormack (brother of the Curley era bookie boss \\"Knocko\\"), who had a line right to J. Edgar Hoover. Connolly was as much a victim of circumstance as he was an overly ambitious Fed who wanted to make a name for himself upon his selection along with John Morris as Rico and Condon's replacements. Connolly still maintains that his destruction of the New England mafia was a noble achievement, but Carr shows how the facts clarify the reality of dog eat dog underworld survival taking precedence over justified prosecution.I find these kind of books fascinating (as do many others) because of the secretive nature that is revealed once big time mobsters are prosecuted and most of the facts come to light. With most gangsters, there is an enormous faade created around them to insulate their crew's activities. In Bulger's case, this was mainly done through the charismatic State Senate President Billy Bulger, who shielded his older brother Whitey's notorious gang from any meaningful prosecution for 25 years. Concerning Billy Bulger, Carr restrains his impulse to rant on an ideological political basis; his writing definitely has an attitude but as the reader learns, the facts don't lie. Billy was a relic of the Curley years; from his South Boston base, he spurned suburban liberals and was a case of big government at its worst, with bloated projects, payrolls and skimming by the insiders, pretending to \\"look out for the little guy.\\" While this may have been true for some of Billy's career, he will forever be known for corruption, cover ups and gangsterdom. His case gives perfect fodder for all Massachusetts Republicans who cry foul with big government spending. In the end, he let both the public and his party down.I thought this book had a near perfect mix of the evolving brother tag team, and how they ruled concurrently in separate realms. In Gerard O'Neill and Dick Lehr's book, the focus is the FBI, while Carr uses his book to highlight the political dimensions of Massachusetts corruption during the latter half of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I must admit, I'm amazed no charges were ever brought against Billy Bulger, who was as crooked a politician as his brother was a mobster. Billy Bulger was the man behind the scenes pulling the political strings, while his brother Whitey, who by all accounts was very close to Billy, was on a murder rampage that decimated the streets of South Boston.And to believe that Billy Bulger had no clue as to the whereabouts of Whitey while Whitey was on the run for 16 years, is to believe in the tooth fairy.Still, this book is very well written.

Carr attempts to guide the reader's reactions with overstated adjectives to describe the shenanigans of Billy and his minions, and I found Carr's style to be simplistic, biased and insulting.

However, although Billy appears to be a hard ball playing politician, the accusations against him appear to be shaky at best. I am sure he did some things he is not proud of, but what politician has not? His greatest crime seems to be that he was the brother of one of the most vicious criminals in New England history.I am not that familiar with Boston politics, however, I do know that Mr. Carr is a rabid right wing radio host, so his lense while viewing Billy Bulger may be somewhat clouded. I would recommend Black Mass and Brutal over this book."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"If you've read BLACK MASS then this book is sort of a re-run, but it has the sense to step back and take a longer look at the case of Whitey Bulger. Howie Carr is an awful writer, who can't put two sentences together, but what he does have is a time-honored narrative strategy, and this one involves comparing the lives and the characters of the two brothers. The story is even slanted a bit to make the reader feel that the \\"good brother,\\" Billy, the one who ran all of Massachusetts legally, is just as evil as his missing brother, the elusive \\"Whitey.\\"If you don't live in Boston, you just won't care as much as those who do. Carr has strong opinions about the enforced school busing that tore up the city, but he's not really qualified to make his opinions into anything more than a rant.Whitey is something else, though, isn't he? From his teen years spent hustling men and selling his body to visiting businessmen and tired Army captains in the immediate postwar period, he got arrested numerous times for petty crimes, since he had learned to hide the more serious ones. Did his brother cover up any of his murders? Carr paints a picture of a severely retarded Irish society in which college was discouraged for it would remove you from the neighborhood; it was bettr to become a hood than wear a cap and gown in some other city or state. In such a system, Whitey found his own good looks drained from him, and he went elsewhere for sex pleasure, eventually molesting underage boys and girls using, according to his henchman Eddie Mac (in his book STREET SOLDIER, which Carr cites) the same methods their parish priests would employ, breaking in the young boys of the neighborhood and \\"training\\" them to obey his commands. Whitey had a longtime girlfriend whose younger brother he also had an affair with--the boy killed himself afterwards. Nice! But at least he was enjoying himself. The problem with Billy Bolger was that he wore a mask of hypocrisy, the same one all politicians wear, a mask that covered up the fact that he was robbing the city, then the state, blind, in the name of civic city and self-righteousness.The disappearance of Whitey remains a mystery, and Howie Carr might have tried a little harder to track down his man if he wanted a really slam bang conclusion to his forty year trek through corruption. Alas, the book stumbles to a halt, and the reader feels a little morose, as though the moral of the story is, bisexuals get away with everything."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Carr provides a hit-by-hit detailing of every murder in Boston over a number of years - many committed by James (Whitey) Bulger. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Billy, obtained a law degree, became involved in countless acts of patronage, etc., rose to President of the State Senate, and eventually was appointed President of the University of Massachusetts.Too long and detailed.

He does, however, have his gift, an ability to write about the Boston Mob and its connections with a broader understanding and an acuter killer instinct than just about anyone else out there. He knows where to sniff. Carr should have been dead a dozen times over for the columns he was writing as all this stuff happened on the street, and the fact that he isn't brings us this whopper, the book that forced Billy Bulger into retirement. Howie is a jerk, but one with brass balls. Believe it.My only gripe, and the reason I didn't give it a five star rating, is that while it covers the backroom dealing in detail it doesn't chronicle the street-level grime, crime, and desperation that Whitey inflicted on the streets of South Boston, that a lot of my friends escaped.

Though recently a couple of books about Bulger came out at the same time, those books were written by Bulgers stooges and as such are clearly self serving. Read them if you want, but take them with many grains of salt.Carrs book is the most recent of a trilogy by various Boston reporters. First was \\"Black Mass\\" by Dick Lehr and Gerald O'Neill; then came \\"Deadly Alliance\\" by Ralph Rannelli. Carr, a Boston Herald columnist, has had Massachusetts politicians in his sights for years. And high up on the list was former Mass. state senate president Billy Bulger. His political corruption and cronyism rivaled that of Chicagos Daley and Louisianas Huey Long. Another brother, Jackie, was a Suffolk County juvenile court judge. But most interesting was the eldest brother, James aka Whitey. He ran Bostons Irish mafia for over 20 years, at one point even rivaling the Italian mafia. One reason why Whitey became so powerful was that the Boston FBI backed him up in his quest for power. He was a Top Echelon Informant. He could do no wrong. He was untouchable. His list of crimes was extensive( including 20 murders). The FBI even blocked other law enforcement agencies( DEA, Mass. State Police) from investigating him .The other two books were excellent. They also sometimes focused on specific things. Deadly Alliance for example focused heavily on the Top Echelon Informant program. Carrs book focuses heavily on how the Bulger family rose to the top ( both legal and illegal although there didn't seem to be much difference). He also shows how Billys influence helped save Whitey numerous times, destroyed lives, and even was able to get sympathetic media influence ( Mike Barnicle of the Boston Globe is a perfect example).Since this book is the most recent it also contains many epilogues( who's been convicted, what new laws there are). I'd recommend you read all three to get a complete idea of what happened in Boston."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Living in Boston, I am very famimiar with most of the stories floating around about the Bulger Bros. Howie corrals all of the stories that I have heard, adds a few new ones, and presents the lives of Whitey and Billy in a parallel comparison.

An interesting read, but does not contain much new info on the two men."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I listen to Howie everyday on my way home from work and he is the man! This new book of his is an excellent read [...]"},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Radio journalist Howie Carr is to be applauded for this book which delves deep into the foul reality beneath Massachusetts's veneer of tolerance and Liberalism. This book chronicles the rise and fall of the Bulger brothers of South Boston's Irish neighborhood. Billy, the younger of the two, would rise in the ranks of the Democratic Party to bevome a political kingmaker in the mold of Boss Tweed. \\"Whitey,\\" the elder, would rise to the heights of power as the city's most brutal gangster, one who makes Al Capone look rather friendly. While Billy's rise would leave a trail of corruption and shattered careers in its wake, Whitey would leave behind at least 19 murders and leave the FBI with a black eye from which it may never recover. While Billy's career would crumble in disgrace, Whitey is still out there somewhere, laughing at the authorities whom he always seems to be ten steps ahead of. In a city where personal vendettas raged in both the State House and on the streets, politicians, law enforcement, and journalists would turn a blind eye to the criminal activities of the Bulger brothers. The Republicans out of a misguided sense of loyalty, and the Democrats as part of a shameless attempt to protect one of their own. In the end, as Mr. Carr writes, the fact that it is supposed to be public service rather than self service was a concept that the Bulgers never did grasp."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I grew up in Massachusetts and was on the State Police for a while, I used to cut all Howie's articles out of the Herald and post them on the barracks bullitin board.

I have little knowledge of the actions of the Bulgers, and I assume that the things in this book presented as facts about \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, about other hard-core Boston criminals, and about the FBI agents who wound up being protectors of Whitey (and a few of them on his payroll) are accurate and have been checked for veracity. There is also a large amount of what I would call \\"editorial innuendo\\", as distinct from facts, about these people, and although most of this is insulting and accusatory, it is obvious that none of the underworld guys discussed in the book would file a libel suit, even if the innuendos gave an unfair impression; by and large, the criminals discussed in the book are in prison or in hiding.The book's material on William (Billy) Bulger is almost equally packed with innuendo, but my careful scrutiny of the book hasn't turned up any explicit statement that Wllliam committed or endorsed any violations of law, whether by Billy Bulger himself, by Whitey with William's knowledge and support, or by anyone else at the behest of William Bulger or with his prior knowledge and consent. As a follower of the coverage by the Globe and the Herald for many years, I was well aware that Billy Bulger did many things of very dubious ethical propriety, but the same could be said about the majority of Boston politicians over the last 40 years.William Bulger was the most loved politician in Massachusetts for many years by many of his constituents, and the most hated by many citizens of Massachusetts. I have never met William Bulger and don't expect that I ever will, but I have watched him in public, and I once corresponded very briefly with him (one letter from me to him, a reply from him to me.) I consider him to be the most effective politician and official in Massachusetts over a period of many years, and in particular I consider him to have had an extremely strong positive influence on the University of Massachusetts during his time as President of the university. He is now actually retired; if he chose to run for office again, I would vote for him for just about any elective office I can think of, because he actually gets important things done.These positive aspects of William Bulger are just plain not mentioned in this book. That's a pity, because William Bulger is an extremely intelligent and complex person. He lost his job as President of U. Mass. because he became an embarrassment to the university and the state, but that does not mean that he was a bad guy or a criminal. I would have welcomed a more balanced portrayal of Billy Bulger in this book.The book fails to explore various fascinating issues, presumably because the author could get no reliable evidence concerning them. For example, it gives little information and discussion to the question of just how Whitey and his friends managed to win a multimillion dollar drawing of the lottery. I have never believed that to have been accidental, and by a good deal of thought finally figured out a way in which they could have done that with essentially no risk to them. But of course I haven't a clue to whether the method I worked out was the one they actually used.All told, I enjoyed reading this book, although I wish it contained fewer polemics. Perhaps even \\"Billy\\" Bulger might enjoy it; he has an extremely good sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Duh, dis heah book ain't dat good.

Did the CIA link ever really end? Does it, ever? Or how about other agencies?2)William Bulger was the first proponent of a child abuse protection bill in Massachusetts3)The informants are alleged to have raked in millions of dollars but William Joseph Breen(\\"Billy Breen\\") of Winchester was said to have accumulated big money as an informant only to have it seized by the IRS. Breen hailed from same area as Brian Callahan. Do informants in fact, assess a 'tax' on behalf of the government as the cost of doing business as such?4) Was Whitey in fact gay, or has this allegation been used against he and targeted people as a means of control by limiting access to the opposite sex? By doing so, constantly keeping Whitey and others in a state of emotional turmoil and susceptible to manipulation? It has been speculated that claiming a straight man is gay is a way of destroying his character and limiting his ability to develop meaningful relationships with the opposite sex and increasing emotional dependence on a series of government-sponsored handlers."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"As one would expect from a tabloid columnist, this is a first-class hatchet job. All you need to know about Mr. Carr's objectivity and professionalism you can glean from reading about his self-reported antics at a Congressional hearing, in his introduction.I had the privilege of serving in the Massachusetts senate from 1973 to 1982, during Bill Bulger's rise to the presidency. I was the opposite of Bulger in almost every way (some would include ability!). I was a Republican from outside Boston, who voted to keep the racial imbalance law, which led to the bussing crisis. (Given what happened to Boston, it was probably a bad vote--there must have been a better way then this measure, which in my view helped no one, black or white.) I am a Protestant, whose 8th great grandfather, John Hall, arrived in Massachusetts from England in 1634. (Alas, my Old Yankee antecedents don't include Old Yankee money!) I was not a lawyer, but a full-time senator, living on the modest senate salary and the occasional paycheck of a sergeant in the Marine reserves.Despite this divergent background, I became an admirer of Bill Bulger's intellect, wit and grace. To me, he seemed the ideal polymath, rising through lucubration. I considered him a friend, though I can't say I was ever invited to his home, his cottage or on one of the \\"trade missions\\"! Nor, alas, was I offered a position at my Alma Mater, U-Mass. I guess this makes me one of those obeisancent Republicans Mr. Carr saw the senate populated with. Bulger helped me a number of times, and never asked for a thing in return. In fact, Ways & Means chair Jim Kelly, whom Carr describes as strictly \\"cash & carry,\\" helped me a time or two in the budget with things for the college in my district. He, too, never asked me for a thing, not even a vote (though Jimmy did like to be asked hat in hand!). Maybe it's just my good looks or charming personality, or maybe I just had little to offer in return, despite Mr. Carr's claim that \\"no deal was too small.\\"In Mr. Carr's excoriating account, every nugatory meeting is a conspiracy, every negative rumor a reportable fact, every joke worthy of an acerbic comment, every personal characteristic, such as Bulger's height, a target for snide vituperation, every politician either a mortal enemy of Bill Bulger, or a dim and corrupt sycophant. Maybe I just feel slighted, as not only did Mr. Carr not give me a derogatory nickname or insult me, he left me entirely out of the book, showing just how unimportant I was. (Though I did serve on the second legislative subcommittee to investigate MBM, until we were relieved of that task by appointment of a Blue Ribbon Commission. Neither gets a mention, which I suppose indicates Carr found not even a rumor to smear us with.)Is there a possibility that Bill Bulger did anything at all good for his constituents, or the people in Massachusetts, during his long years in office, or at U-Mass? Not by Carr's account. That James Bulger is a criminal of the worst kind is undoubted. That Bill Bulger played the Boston political and patronage game without peer is a given. That he may have more family loyalty than most people are comfortable with is probably true. Was he corrupt? Well, he's been tried, convicted and punished by Mr. Carr, and in today's America, that is apparently enough. No need for the courts to do more.This is a powerful story and a balanced look at Bill Bulger's career, and his relationship with his infamous brother, by a disinterested observer, would have had a much greater impact, and been a public service. Carr's book, however, is the type of splenetic account we'd expect of a bio of Howard Dean by Anne Coulter, or of George Bush by Michael Moore.

For a coupld dollars more, I could have bought a new paperback new in the store."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"This book is a major disappointment. Carr writes a gossip column for a Boston tabloid newspaper, The Herald. He is neither an investigative reporter nor an historian. The Brothers Bulger reads like a string of his columns laid out end to end.There is no depth to his writing and offers no insight into James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger. Neither does it shed light on his relationship with those who worked for him. How and why did close associates like Kevin Weeks and Kevin O'Neill come to meet and work for Whitey? What are the consequences of Bulger's reign of terror on Boston and South Boston in particular?The people who can give insight would never talk to Howie Carr. Carr writes as an outsider looking in. Born in Maine and schooled in North Carolina, he displays little understanding of Boston's working class. He shows no empathy for the people he writes about. Bulger's victims come across as stooges who deserved what they got.Major players are often part of a laundry list of names simply dropped into the narrative without introduction. If you are not from Boston, and don't know the cast of characters, you'll find this a confusing book.There is nothing new here. Carr, by his own admission, draws a lot of his material from Black Mass: the True Story of an Unholy Alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. The major investigative work was done by the Boston Globe's Spotlight Team and reported in the 1988 series, The Bulger Mystique. Reading the Globe's online articles about Bulger will give the interested reader more detail than Carr's book.Carr's has a personal and passionate hatred of William Bulger, former president of the Massachusetts Senate. His writing is so vitriolic that it casts doubt on its accuracy. He doles out a lot of minutiae when he writes about William Bulger's rise through Massachusetts politics. But do we really need a whole chapter devoted to describing who attended the annual Saint Patrick's Day fest in 1987?If you must read this book, and I recommend you don't waste your time, get it from the library or wait until it show's up in the one dollar remainder bin at the book store."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but was sorely disappointed.

And all the kings men also includes congressional committees who basked in their public investigation of Sen Bulger and came up with scratch. Poor Howie: all full of righteous thunder and a sack full of yellow journalism."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Subhead: Esau and Esau as told by Jacob.For years and with media complicity, Massachusetts State Senate President Billy Bulger carefully constructed a \\"Jacob and Esau\\" public perception concerning his relationship with his gangster brother Whitey. Enter the real Jacob (one Howie Carr) to pull the mask of the impostor showing that the brothers Bulger are a pair of Esaus (twin masters of deception and mendacity).Carr's Boston Herald column has been a must-read for New England truth-seekers for many years and is even more necessary today since other voices of dissent (Jerry Williams, Don Feder, David Brudnoy) have left major Boston media. I began following Carr's writings as a college student in the 1980s. I wondered why he was attending these seemingly obscure criminal trials, entertainingly exploring the huge spider web of government payrolls, and what all of it was leading up to. Now we know -- \\"The Brothers Bulger.\\"The story tells how Whitey Bulger (one of the few Bulgers ever to hold a job in the \\"dreaded private sector\\") rose to prominence in the Boston underworld thanks to connections with crooked FBI agents (the main one, John \\"Zip\\" Connolly, grew up in the same South Boston public housing project as the Bulgers) and shielding by politicians like Billy Bulger. The heroism of a few good men like state police Lt. Col. Jack O'Donovan, implacable foe of Whitey, and Carr (although the columnist/radio show host doesn't claim credit) is seen between the lines.The humor of Carr, which has helped him reach the top of the New England media heap, is ever present. Among other nuggets, Carr reveals that programs of the Dukakis administration (the same people who gave us Willie Horton) paid for hair transplant treatments of Winter Hill Gang boss Howie Winter.Our author cuts to the crux of corruption in joking that after the pedophile priest scandal felled Cardinal Bernard Law, Billy Bulger had one less person to commiserate with over \\"the decline of morality in American society.\\" Two-faced people like Bulger and Law ARE the decline and thank G-d Carr and others are saying so.Carr indirectly makes a case for Mitt Romney's presidential aspirations (although I much prefer Texas libertarian Congressman Ron Paul). Romney was the only governor to openly challenge Billy Bulger. Romney got Bulger to quit his hack job as University of Massachusetts president by threatening to put legal firebrand Alan Dershowitz, Judge E. George Daher (who gave Billy his \\"Corrupt Midget\\" nickname), and Carr on the college system's board of trustees. At last, \\"the CM\\" exited the public arena although this favor cost commonwealth taxpayers about $1 million.The salvation of daily newspaper journalism, if there is to be one, is in editors getting out of the way and letting reporters roam and pursue their passions. Before the corporatization of news (a subject briefly touched on in \\"The Brothers Bulger\\") editors trusted reporters to go after stories they (reporters) thought were important. Today, it's mostly top-down management with the predictable result of \\"managed\\" news. Adding to the problem is the gullibility and carpetbagger nature of today's journalists, false constructions of \\"beats\\" instituted by newsroom executives, pursuit of something called \\"objectivity\\" (which doesn't really exist), and gutlessness in the face of demands from the lawyer/government/business axis.Carr's 25-year pursuit of the Bulgers, amid cries of \\"unfairness,\\" shows that \\"he said, she said\\" stories more often than not hide the truth. Reporters and columnists must be able to use their expertise and intuition to write stories that people want and need to read. (But, yes, this freedom is capable to being abused like any other human enterprise).Carr likely has at least one more great book in him. If Whitey Bulger (now age 78) is ever captured, this will likely provide the inspiration."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Very provincial, but an incredible story. Corruption in Boston is legendary, but this story tops them all. Carr (also a local radio talk-show host) goes into amazing detail, dating back over 40 years, to make startling connections between State Senate President Billy Bulger and his FBI Most Wanted Serial Killing Brother James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger. You will be amazed at the level of corruption, including the FBI, the abuse of power at every level, and the staggering control these two men had over the city of Boston for over a quarter century."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Howie Carr's \\"The Brothers Bulger\\" is the standout volume on how the South Boston Irish came to dominate Boston politics and organized crime. Unlike the best prior works, \\"Black Mass\\" and \\"The Underboss\\", Carr delves into the evolution of Boston politics and the circumstances that brought Billy and Whitey Bulger to the top of their respective careers, an important backdrop for non-Boston readers.More importantly, Carr details how corrupt pols and lawmen enabled politician Billy and killer Whitey to kick the competition to the curb.The book ends with sufficient loose ends to entertain the reader with speculation on Billy's and Whitey's fate.

I have respect for Howie in this sense; In Boston so much space and time in the media is given to black and Latino gang activity as if Somerville, South Boston (Southie) and Charlestown (Townie) are relatively crime free. The only differences between the minority gangs and the Bulger Boys and their ilk is this: The FBI does not fund and befriend gangs in Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan (the black neighborhoods) and the FBI sanctioned gangs bury their victims with FBI knowledge. The black and latino boys leave their dead on the sidewalk.I am not so sure Howie Carr shouldn't have hired protection. Howie's book has done what the Boston Globe has been too \\"punk\\" to do. Tell the real deal and reveal an actual connection between the criminality of Whitey and his lying brother Billy. He reveals Billy Bulger as the foul sleeze he is. Filth under the cloak of respectability still stinks.Thanks Howie for reasons you probably don't even fully realize.Keep a look-out though. Revenge is a dish best served cold.

This book is based on both the public record and his interviews. The 'Preface' provides the background to this book. The 'Prologue' serves to introduce us to the Bulger brothers. Politician Billy, then the president of the University of Massachusetts, and James, on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. Chapter 1 tells of the family history. James Michael Curley was the admired politician of the day. The family was poor but intact. The South Boston neighborhood had \\"the lowest crime rate in the city\\" (p.26). Billy and James went on separate paths. Chapter 2 tells of the \\"Governor's Council\\" and their governmental function (pp.42-43). [Is it different in your state?] Who was responsible for corruption in Massachusetts (p.53)? Could \\"four innocent men\\" be railroaded to prison for a crime they didn't commit (p.59)? Did \\"social engineering\\" change South Boston from a law-abiding working-class enclave into a community divided by class and ethnic tensions (p.68)? Who benefitted?Page 92 tells how \\"outside sections\\" are used for secret legislation. Page 96 explains how school busing avoided the rich Boston suburbs. Chapter 8 tells about payoffs on the University of Massachusetts campus in Dorchester. One effect of capping property taxes was to make cities more reliant on state aid (p.124). Should states ban dual office holding (p.157)? Chapter 14 starts by telling about connections in Boston. Did they have something on Cardinal Law? Page 191 explains the Depositors Trust Bank burglary (safe deposit boxes belonging to organized crime). Page 215 explains politics and family connections (it is like the feudal system). Is it different in corporations? Did Billy sabotage the Dukakis campaign (p.219)? This level of corruption wouldn't be believed if this was a novel (pp.245-248). With a \\"line item veto\\" and enough votes a Governor would control the state budget (p.265). Page 267 explains how public TV gets rated. Are your state colleges and universities being used to pay politicians (p.284)? Are tuition costs going down? Page 300 explains hiring practices at one state college, page 301 explains the costs. How many other telephone company employees are corrupt (p.303)? Page 312 tells how judges are appointed. How many other college presidents would invoke the Fifth Amendment (p.314)? Page 316 explains skyrocketing college costs. Eventually a new Governor appointed new trustees to the board, and Billy resigned with a large pension. The 'Epilogue' ends this story as of 2005.This book documents the faults of some, but neglects to cover the Big Picture. The Ruling Class and its corporate aristocracy are neglected in this book. Carr does not even hint at the powers that use and then discard politicians and front men like Billy and others. When the puppets outlive their usefulness a new cast appears in their place. That's show business. Carr gives just a hint about earlier politicians, but not much political history before the 1950s (p.21). This book explains how the Establishment brought the drug trade to South Boston."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"The Brothers Bulger is an incredible, fast paced, well written true life story detailing the absolute evil that kidnaped and raped one of America's great cities for almost three decades. Its the tale of two brothers -- one the serial killing gangster that loved nothing but his own gratification -- and the other brother one of the nation's most powerful legislator's who's every action personified his credo that \\"no deal was to small\\". Brothers with only one thing sacred -- their loyalty to each other. Nothing else mattered. Not friends, neighborhood, or even lovers. All were simply tools to be used and later discarded. Like a starving locust swarm these corrupt men came from Southie to devour all the city had to offer. And perhaps most chilling for us all, Jim Bulger has yet to be caught. He is still out there laughing at the fools he left behind ...

I have always followed the Bulger brothers story in Mass. I hope this is another book as the story gones on. I wish he would do another book with more details on Billy and the politics of Mass."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"This is a quintessentially American story that is both important and unforgettable. One reason it is important is that it affirms the adage: \\"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" Another is that, the deep FBI and police corruption begged the question: Who guards the guards themselves? But also, no matter how distorted morally, this story is still somehow a perverse but generic template for ethnic \\"ghetto success:\\" Two brothers from a \\" \\"disposable\\" part of inner city Boston make good; one through \\"low hard crime\\" (Whitey was a serial murderer, bank robber, extortionist, and a \\"top echelon\\" FBI informant; while Billy, on the other hand, engaged in grafts and payoffs, illegal political procedural maneuvering, patronage, nepotism, \\"no show jobs,\\" extortion, racketeering, sweetheart and unholy deals, arson and insurance scams, as well as political blackmail and business frauds.). The mantra of Boston corruption at the time was: \\"Nothing on the level; every thing a deal, and no deal too small.\\"Another reason it is important lies more deeply embedded in the subtext of the book: Their two-man crime wave became, perhaps unconsciously, an existential way of redressing bitter and deep injuries to lower class Irish Americans, through the use and propagation of commonly accepted and tolerated patterns of inner city crime and corruption. During the 1970s, the experiment in social engineering transformed South Boston ethnic communities, from predominately law-abiding working classes to a festering backwater of lethal class and ethnic tensions, overlaid with drug and welfare dependency. All who could: fled to the suburbs. It was thus from the depths of these diminished circumstances, that each brother's pursuit of power became a wicked double-edged and twisted end in itself. In the leftover spaces of Boston society, and with \\"huge Irish sized chips on their shoulders,\\" the Bulger brothers both became successful in their own perverse and irredeemably criminal ways.It is unforgettable because it shows the depths to which corruptions can descend when the rules of humanity and the rules of morality are perceived to both be irrelevant at the same time: Because the society was unfair and had basically turned its back on Boston's \\"Southies,\\" in the subconscious mind of the Bulger brothers, Boston was no longer an entirely legitimately run society. It was therefore open at both ends to being \\"gamed\\" in ways that all angles could be played towards a ruthless and cynical kind of \\"get over\\" success. Power through corruption thus became, not just the signature route; but the only route to success; and more importantly, the only way \\"to get even with\\" a society perceived to be cruel, immoral, indifferent and dehumanizing to the \\"Southies.\\".The Bulger brother's crime wave thus could be rationalized as an existential avenue to societal revenge: a way of removing the ethnic chip on their shoulders by \\"thumbing their noses\\" at a society that had purposely dealt them a bad hand simply because they were lower class Irish. It was a way of calling Boston's illegitimate society to account through \\"power moves\\" already tolerated by Boston society, including crimes of all genres that terrorized the city of Boston for a generation. In short, this two-man crime wave taking place at opposite ends of the societal spectrum, proved both that the society that discriminated against lower class Irish was a \\"moral sham\\" and that lower class Irish (the Southies\\") were not deserving of their ascribed inferior status after all, but could play society's illegitimate games as well as (or better than) the next group.It is also unforgettable because it is a textbook example of how fragile and tenuous the moral fabric of our society can be. It shows for instance how \\"tolerated\\" inner city corruption can be \\"gamed\\" and \\"played\\" by two determined brothers and then used to take over the rest of a large urban city. Whitey Bulger became an FBI informant at an early stage of his criminal career, but then quickly realized that his FBI handlers were equally vulnerable to the same kind of immorality they expected and extracted from him as their \\"resident stooge.\\" And just as they had captured and \\"turned him,\\" he slowly reeled them in and \\"turned them in reverse.\\" And they became \\"the bigger fish\\" without ever realizing what had happened to them. This small \\"reverse advantage,\\" greatly assisted by strategic murders, FBI and police corruption, was soon parlayed into a incestuously corrupt web in which Whitey's informants, his FBI handlers, were \\"running interference\\" for the Boston crime wave engineered by Whitey himself.Billy on the other hand, operating at the other end of the political spectrum, realized that every angle he played had to be played precisely and opportunities had to be seized with \\"cold blooded calculation.\\" And then, the gains had to be consolidated quickly through ruthlessness; that is through terror, extortion, graft, patronage, blackmail and punishing enemies. Both brothers thus were playing the same immoral game, at opposite ends of a chessboard stacked against them, with the same corrupt Boston officials. They just did so with different weapons.Although it was difficult keeping all of the names and nicknames together, this was a good read.Five stars"},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"This is a pretty good book. It is very confusing lately with the huge influx of books about this topic. Since the Departed has come out, everyone wants to know the real story of Whitey and Boston. Everyone is on a get rich quick thing with all these books. It is hard to judge because it seems that every new book coming out discredits the last one. I enjoyed this book, but like I said it is very confusing when you are trying to substantiate who is telling the real version of the story. I give a lot of credit to the gangsters who write the books because they were there and can tell it like it happened. That also leaves room for them to beef it up too. I guess what I am trying to say is that Carr is a writer and reporter and has done extensive research on this topic. Accurate or not, it is still a fantastic read and I think some of the fun of it all is reading the other books on this topic and trying to figure out how it really happened or who is telling the truth."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"This is an excellent true tale about 2 brothers who grew up in the south Boston projects and rose to the top of their vocations.Billy Bulger,pulls himself up to become a high profile lawyer and politician,and Jimmy(Whitey) who rises to the top of Bostons' Irish Mafia.Apparently Whitey had help from some government agencies such as the FBI because the bureau was at the time trying to wrap up the Italian Mafia and recruited members of the Irish Mafia to bring it about.Whitey played both ends against the middle, ratting out members of his own criminal organization while using his law enforcement connections to elevate his own position in organized crime.The book goes into alot of detail in regard to this and the author is a Boston newspaper reporter who worked closely with these investigations. His tale is highly credible.Whitey's brother,Billy Bulger,a high profile Boston lawyer,rises to the top and is conspicuously seen with all of the top New England politicians. The author is clear though that these other politicians probably had no knowledge of any of Whitey's criminal affairs. At the end of the book the reader is left pondering about how much of Whitey's dubious enterprises did brother Billy know about.Some of the members of Whitey's nefarious gang lived almost right across the street from Billy.There is also included in this insightful book an in depth expose on the forced busing crisis of the 1970's, that fits right into the book without distraction. The busing controversy involved busing students of color to different all white traditional neighborhoods.This caused alot of controversy and it is a vital part of the story in regard to the rise of the Bulgers in their prospective areas of expertise.Billy Bulger,the lawyer and his brother Whitey who was both user and used by the law."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"As a resident in Boston in the mid 90s and listener to Howie Carr's show, I can't thank Howie enough for going forward on this book. Seeing the semmingly good (Billy) and evil (Whitey) being basically the same - evil, greedy and corrupt. It is a great story about how people in positions of power may be just as criminally minded as the ones behind bars, just with a bigger expense account and showcase (Billy's St. Patrick Day's annual breafast).I confess I got a little lost with all of the characters in this true story. For future printings I would hope that there is a chart of some sort to show the different players in this real life drama of crime, corruption and politics in Boston.Highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in politics.

Not living in Massachusetts, I was powerless to vote or have any influence over Bill's well deserved downfall, but I rejoiced as I heard Howie call for it. And whenever possible, I read Howie's column online until his newspaper started charging me for the privilege.This book relates the truly incredible story of the rise and dominance of the Bulger brothers in Massachusetts and Boston politics and criminal circles. I remember Theodore White in his famous MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT series commenting how Massachusetts was the most crooked political machinery state in the union.

Library in Massachusetts. Ironic, since in Kennedy's day many were seeking a race, creed, color-blind society. Yet, we still do not have it.Carr's work, while easy reading, must have been a monumental pursuit through all of the court records, depositions, government agency files, and his developed \\"feel\\" for Boston and Southie, in particular. I must confess that although I was well aware of Bobby Kennedy's efforts to expose the Mafia, I had no idea how closely allied the Kennedy family was with organized crime in Boston. Many are aware that Joseph Kennedy, Sr. made his fortune during the bootlegging days, but organized crime, thuggery, and hooliganism in Boston from 1933 to the early 2000s is really quite amazing.Carr focusses his narrative on two brothers who grew up mainly in Southie when it was an Irish neighborhood. Irish names fly by page by page, and this is a fine organizing theme. If there is not yet a manuscript/movie in the making, there soon will be. You might think up some characters to play the Bulger brothers, Boston accent and all.

There are lots and lots of interesting factoids in this book (expect one: how is the author still alive!?) but there is no cohesive story arc to hold them together and make them digestible, and the book readable. Instead there's a rambling, discombobulated narrative that jumps from one subject to the next, information delivered in fits and starts with little flow, no character development whatsoever and minimal story telling. Imagine writing down 1000 thoughts on 3x5 cards and then putting them in a box; then take them out one by one and tape them together. I imagine that's how Howie delivered the book to his publisher. And the editor took the box of cards down to the printing press. Too bad. I was hoping for an interesting read. Instead, one is left with a total disgust for how politics, law enforcement and crime go hand in glove in Boston. But with little understanding of WHY, HOW, etc. No doubt many of Howie's adoring fans (of which I am one, truth be told) will lambaste this review; so be it.

Many parts of this book were new information for me (especially the detail of Whitey's exploits and the way that Billy tried to protect him).

Howie's book shows you why."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Not to put too fine of a point on it, but Massachusetts is one uniquely evil state.Only in this state can a senator become an icon after killing a young woman. Only in this state can unelected judges get away with reclassifying the institution of marriage by fiat. Only in this state can legislators steadfastly refuse to enact the death penalty to eliminate even the most venal murderers from our midst.And only in this state could two thugs--one a master of physical brutality, the other a master of political brutality--dominate power structures for decades.The two thugs in question are the central figures of Boston Herald columnist and popular talk-radio host Howie Carr's book The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century. With exhausting detail and scathing sarcasm, Carr chronicles the frightening rise and precipitous fall of two sons of South Boston--James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, a bisexual hustler and bank robber who ultimately seized control of organized crime in the Greater Boston area in the 1970s and 1980s, and his younger sibling, William \\"The Corrupt Midget\\" Bulger, a Boston College grad who became what can only be described as a de facto dictator during his tenure as President of the Massachusetts State Senate from 1978 to 1996.Bulger-era Boston was a grotesque excuse for a city, beset by unrelenting racial tension, endemic political corruption, and immeasurably high rates of criminality and drug use and abuse. Together and separately, both Bulgers managed to exploit and worsen the problems of the era. Along with his partner Stevie Flemmi, Whitey (who had the assistance and approval of on-the-take FBI agents) eliminated numerous rivals to emerge as a cocaine kingpin and underworld powerbroker worth at least $50 million. Carr asserts that one of the corrupt FBI agents, John Connolly--who grew up with the Bulgers in \\"Southie\\"--was specifically asked by William Bulger (who apparently played a role in getting Connolly the FBI gig in the late-1960s) to make sure his older brother stayed out of legal trouble. Connolly was more than willing to comply with the request, making sure that Whitey became an FBI informant against Boston's Italian Mafia (despite the fact that Whitey provided little information of practical use; in fact, most of the \\"good stuff\\" was provided by Flemmi) and letting both men know of potential law enforcement action against them. (Connolly also made sure that Bulger and Flemmi were omitted from numerous indictments that would have ended their criminal enterprise, and thus ended the free flow of cash and gifts he received from Bulger.)While Whitey and Flemmi consolidated their power, William Bulger took advantage of political upheaval on Beacon Hill to become the state's most powerful politician. Like all dictators official and unofficial, he used his position to secure high-paying public sector jobs for unqualified relatives, coatholders, and other assorted \\"hacks,\\" while punishing legislators who crossed him--and, Carr asserts, state and local law enforcement officials who posed a threat to his drug-peddling, rival-and-girlfriend-murdering sibling. A judge who refused to help secure a job for a high-school dropout who was the son of Billy's political mentor suddenly had his salary cut dramatically. A state trooper who interfered with Whitey Bulger's 1987 attempt to fly out of Logan Airport with $100,000 cash had his career subsequently sabotaged: \\"His overtime dried up, it became clear he would never be promoted, and he plunged into a deep depression that didn't lift even after he finally quit the job. In 1998, [the trooper] finally committed suicide.\\" Bulger's power was so absolute, Carr claims, that he was even able to influence the 1988 Presidential election: \\"After the Democratic convention in July 1988, [then-Massachusetts Governor Michael] Dukakis (whom Bulger detested for his pro-forced busing stand in the 1970s) had opened a seventeen-point lead in the national polls, and [George H. W. Bush's] prospects looked grim. But at Billy's suggestion, Bush flew into Boston, and toured Boston Harbor in a boat, stressing not only the massive pollution problems, but also the fact that it was costing billions to clean it up, and that Dukakis and his state government had been so lax in addressing the issue that a federal judge had been forced to take over the entire project...After Bush's visit to Boston Harbor, Dukakis' poll numbers began falling, and by Labor Day, the Duke found himself behind by double digits\\" before his eventual November loss.The dual dominion of the Bulgers finally started to collapse in the early-1990s, as several of Bulger's drug peddlers--almost all of whom, strangely enough, had public-sector jobs--were busted in a DEA sting operation, thus beginning a series of events that led to Whitey Bulger's mysterious departure from Boston (and later, the United States) and the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of Flemmi and Connolly for their role in protecting and preserving Whitey's power. Meanwhile, William Bulger, severely damaged by his role in an extortion scandal involving a real-estate developer, and having failed to get an acolyte elected mayor of Boston, left the Senate for an unreasonably lucrative job as President of the University of Massachusetts system, where he presided for seven corrupt years (\\"The UMass payrolls had been larded beyond belief. There was layer upon layer of bureaucracy--entire new levels of Bulgerite hackocracy had been created...There were new provosts, chancellors, and deans by the dozen, all making more than $100,000\\") before he resigned in the wake of an embarrassing performance in front of a Congressional committee on government ethics, in which he stretched the truth to the absolute breaking point in an effort to disavow any role in protecting his felonious brother.Carr's book is deep in detail--and non-Massachusetts residents will be deeply disgusted by the profoundly immoral actions of both subjects, one of whom \\"felt no compunction to assist the authorities in capturing a serial killer and cocaine dealer\\" (i.e., Whitey). The book embeds itself in the reader's mind: it will jar one's conscience to come to grips with the breadth and depth of Whitey's murderous venality, as well as the extent to which William was able to get away with his political thuggery due to his legions of \\"admirers\\" in politics, academia and the press. The Bulgers' twin empires were as vast as they were fundamentally perverse. Such perversion could only take place in Massachusetts.Carr has been repeatedly profiled by the PC police during his years as the Herald's top columnist, and his liberal critics will undoubtedly attack the book for its occasional profanity and its frequent barbs at Democrats who were members of William Bulger's admiration society in decades past. However, the inevitable attacks on the book will not affect its historical status. The Brothers Bulger is a landmark, an All The President's Men for the modern era. It's a very good book about very evil men.D. R. TuckerNotes From D.

They really prove Howie's points about how the neighborhood protects its own - a dynamic that enabled this whole sordid story to happen.Some can't seem to let go of the simplistic Mike Barnicle fairy tale image of Billy as the \\"good\\" brother. I don't understand how they can read the details of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority (MCCA) where Billy (not Whitey) stacked the board with Whitey's friends and associates, and still say he's such a great and honorable guy. And what about the blatant punishments meted out through back room legislative shenanigans not only to Billy's own political adversaries (even those in his own party - like Barney Frank), but also against law enforcement personnel who were investigating Whitey?!?!Billy's a smart guy who knows how to cover his trail, and he's always had plenty of friends/enablers in high places (and low places) ready to rush to his defense no matter how obvious or heavy-handed his behind-the-scenes machinations became. Again, it's exactly this sort of blind faith and allegiance that created the perfect atmosphere for Whitey and Billy to thrive - each terrorizing the city and state in his own way.Excellent book that can be confusing at times - it covers a long time frame and involves lots of characters. But I think the detail Howie goes into is necessary to illustrate the intricacies of how everything intertwined to build the Bulger empire."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Couldn't put it down.

However, the reader might wonder how much abuse takes place at the local and state level or among other state or federal agencies? It seems that specifically FBI men are being targeted with all of the ridicule. Can anyone say how informants for the IRS,ATF,CIA,DEA,or any other agencies might be dealing?There can be a question raised here also about just how much Whitey and Steve actually took home. Billy Breen (of Winchester, same as Brian Callahan), another informant, was said to have taken in large sums of money but it was all seized by the IRS. How do we know the Treasury did not in fact prosper from this program? Why doesn't Congress hold hearings to hear from informants across the board about what they were told,how they were treated and how they may have been betrayed? How can Karen Silkwood disappear without concern and others not?An interesting note in this book is how Mr. Carr mentiones that Whitey wrote of being deceived about the purpose of the LSD experiments. Is this so unbelievable? Could Whitey's excesses have been in part due to disillusionment over what he had signed up for?"},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"the character Whitey Bulger, was just caught.

The older brother went into the army and a couple years later the younger was being harassed by activities a man who bore the same name in the same town, as if the younger brother had another identity created and which was made to look bad to hurt him in the identity confusion following. It is speculated the older brother set up the younger brother, both from Woburn,Mass and that the older brother after a name change went into FBI service at his younger brother's constant expense.Wherever the younger brother went the older followed and bad thingsalways happened to the younger as a result.

I had been told stories growing up, particularly the one about the mobster's girlfriend being accosted at the Frolics at Salisbury Beach (contrary to Howie's reference, Salisbury is in Massachusetts).

Did Dennis Condon or others have ties to Ron Weafer or Agent Driscoll also of Woburn in the 1960s,as well as Judge Sartorelli? Was a child of a key player in this case shuffled about as an abandoned,abused child under a child care system overseen by Whitey's brother?3) Are psychological and practical tactics used to encourage suicide among targeted opponents of government? Trooper Johnson and the Barrett boys are but a few examples. How many now are languishing, unknown to the general public? Does the government cutoff financial resources,career options,social relations by subtle bad mouthing, or arrange romantic pairings with the intent of the befriending partner to monitor and meddle with the target as deemed necessary? One man i know of was befriended by women who when on dates constantly used the restroom and such, perhaps to make discreet cell phone calls updating a third party on goings on with the target.4) Did Bulger and Angiulo team up in an effort to usurp the FBI?5) How can Bulger possibly be apprehended given the power of the gay/bisexual underground in America? Was Bulger gay or bisexual or is this disinformation to assassinate his character? Does the government routinely use romance and sex to manipulate targets? Does organized crime?6) Did the FBI, fearing a breakdown in the program, assign various personnel to monitor children of principals in this case and if needed assign those individuals to target and harass or destroy the children? If not the FBI, was NSA or CIA or perhaps even Secret Service involved?"},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Those of us who listen to Howie Carr on his talk show or read his column in the &lt;u>Boston Herald&lt;/u> will find little new in this book, though it still serves as a great compendium of the sordid reign of both Bulgers.

Under pressure, he resigned the position of president of the University of Massachusetts after testifying in a federal investigation involving the actions of his mob-involved brother.Whitey, a fugitive since 1995, fled just before he was to be indicted on charges involving 21 murders. His life of violence has earned him the distinction as the FBI's second most-wanted man, second only to Osama Bin Laden.The Brothers Bulger takes us from their childhood days in South Boston.

That was all right, I had anticipated that a large crowd would be there to see Howie and brought a copy of The Brothers Bulger with me after hearing that a few previous signing locations had sold all of their copies of his book before a number of his fans had the chance to buy one.He held onto his pen as we shook hands and then graciously signed the cover page of my book as I requested, \\"To Sam, The search continues! Howie Carr\\". Then it occurred to me that these signings, with their picture-poses alongside happy fans and shortened conversations with listeners, (and readers) must at times become exhausting. There may have been a couple of days or nights signing, and writing this fantastic book, that he could have chosen to put the pen to rest but did not.As I read my copy of The Brothers Bulger I am struck by the sheer volume of detail; from the intense descriptions of brutality, that are by no means gratuitous, to the transcribed conversations between those Southie wiseguys. This was not, I repeat, not a mere glance over his shoulder at these activities. Howie was in there looking for the truth, to the dismay I'm sure of some Boston politicos who harbored or tried to soften the image of the hardened killer that Whitey remains.

Carr's unique view and placement in the historical narrative elevates this book from merely an interesting read to a lasting work of non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Billy Bulger began his public life in 1960 as South Boston's delegate to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, working his way through a lengthy career that awarded him a fifteen-year stint as President of the Massachusetts Senate. From there he proceeded to the prestigious and highly visible perch of President of the University of Massachusetts. Jimmy Bulger, five years older, was a small time South Boston hood who, after serving ten years in prison, including Alcatraz, returned to Massachusetts to lead a complex life as both an organized crime boss and informant for the FBI. Because Billy and Jimmy, better known as Whitey, happen to be brothers a great cottage industry of speculation has developed about the nature of their relationship, of which this particular work is a piece.There are those who would like to believe that the Bulger brothers were joined at the hip, Billy the white collar \\"Corrupt Midget\\" and Jimmy [Whitey] the feared blue collar muscle end of the family. By implication, at least, in the minds of many they teamed together for a generation to create a two headed monster of graft and corruption, Billy by legislative fiat and Whitey by the less polished, Jack Bauer style of persuasion. The dust cover of the book implies this state of affairs, and it is a sexy premise. A lot of government time and money at all levels has been invested in trying to prove this was so. Mitt Romney, current presidential candidate, orchestrated Billy's removal from the U. Mass. position for what amounts to a charge of embarrassing the state.However, at the end of the day the author Howie Carr is no more able to prove criminal collusion than any branch of law enforcement [and I emphasize the legal sense of \\"to prove,\\" as in a trial jury, with smoking guns and no reasonable doubt.] Consequently the author decides to bring the question to the court of public opinion. He gives an overview of the careers of both men, the general tenor being the question of how one brother would not know the foibles, chicanery, or outright criminal violence of the other.My problem with this approach is that many readers who understand how big cities work will probably not drop dead of shock to learn that collusion of some sort greases the machines of government, business, and crime. The one surprise to me was the depth of involvement of the FBI, which not only employed Whitey for decades as a CI--a poor confidential informant at that--but which did little to investigate individual agents like Zip Connolly, who profited handsomely from his underworld connections [254]. Boston, like Chicago and New York, was rife with organized crime and questionable government practices. From time to time a well-spun tale from a good observer is a useful civics lesson, and this is probably the primary enduring value of this work, a reminder of how dirty and grimy urban life can become.In reality neither Whitey nor Billy were much known outside of Massachusetts in their heyday. In recent years--probably because the FBI was publicly humiliated--Whitey has been raised to Osama Bin Laden status, while his brother on the other hand was featured favorably on \\"Sixty Minutes\\" in 1992 after thirty years in local politics. Other cities had--and have--criminal characters of Whitey's propensities, some no doubt worse. One can conclude that Whitey's status derives in large part from his brother.The author has clearly had his fill of Billy. Whitey at least has never claimed to be what he is not. Billy's story is somewhat more complex and morally perplexing. Having read Billy's autobiography, I have long felt that his weaknesses are parochialism and inflexibility. He was a good pothole politician who was completely blindsided by the school bussing issue after even Deep South politicians had made their peace with it. He joined arms with Louise Day Hicks, never realizing how badly this played outside of South Boston. Carr is correct in his assessment that the younger Bulger's electability was always quite limited, and that unlike Joe Moakley, Michael Dukakis, Barney Frank, and others, those who could afford to dream, his ambitions would have to be met locally.Billy Bulger was known disparagingly for many years as \\"The Corrupt Midget.\\" But in a city remembered for James Curley and The Big Dig fiasco, was Bulger truly and uniquely corrupt or was he doing business as usual? At the very least he used his powers of patronage very wisely, enough to make some of his questionable personal and public dealings go away. There is no smoking gun, however, that he used them to make Whitey's day easier. Of course, the question could be asked the other way--did Whitey make his brother's day easier? I suspect that Whitey's existence probably helped his brother in intangible ways, and probably without his brother's direct approval. It is easy to imagine Whitey making threats, verbal and otherwise, but this will probably remain conjecture.Which brings us to our present day dilemma: how much does Billy know that he is not telling? Carr documents Billy's extensive efforts to keep from being asked in a court of law whether he in fact harboring a fugitive and hindering prosecution. The author has certainly done a good job in making Billy Bulger look guilty of something along these lines, if nothing else. But legal proof is another matter. And, with Whitey now 80 and Billy close behind, it is quite possible that the Bulger saga will live on as yet another colorful chapter of Beantown's four century history."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Being from New Hampshire I couldn't care less about mass corruption.

Two brothers in Boston, one a politician and the other a mobster, shaping politics and crime in Boston for decades. Whitey Bulger, who is still an international fugitive, makes an excellent precursor, if not template, for Jack Nicholson's role in the film \\"The Departed\\". The author is an award winning newspaper columnist who clearly knows Boston intimately, along with who is connected to whom on both sides of the law, however, it can be a little confusing for the reader to keep up without a table of organization or flow chart. Frequently, Carr states facts or describes events that it is assumed he acquired from court transcripts, police reports and street sources but the reader is often left to take it simply on faith because the hard evidence or source isn't referenced or cited. Still, it's an interesting saga of the backrooms and chicanery in Boston over the past five decades."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I read this book after enjoying the movie, \\"The Departed.\\" Howie Carr has certainly mastered the art of delivering a fast paced story, one that wraps inuendo around facts, dates, and personalities. He knows his subject matter, the Bulger Brothers, like a butcher knows a steer, and, he carves it up to a fare-the-well.The narrative opens with Billy, the politician brother, testifying before a congressional committee where he doesn't come off well taking the 5th. His brother Whitey, meanwhile, tops the FBI list of America's most wanted criminals spawning a cottage industry of global Whitey spottings over the last decade. Howie Carr clearly doesn't think much of Billy's lifetime of political fixings and seeks to tie him to his psycho criminal brother in the Bostonian version of a politico-fandango, true or otherwise. It's in a way too bad as Billy has risen from the shanty Irish mean streets of \\"southie\\" to be president of the state senate followed by a stint as president of UMass. Alas, his life of political corruption, shades of J.M. Curley's era, catches up to him, but not before he receives a handsome pension to ease his retiring years.Whitey, on the other hand, comes across for what he apparently is which is a pretty scary guy. He murders well over 50 people after getting out of Alcatraz in his early 20's. Carr leads the reader thru the various killings and maimings with the added feature of FBI corruption thrown in. Whitey was an FBI informant which made for a bad ending if you were his competitor in crime, and this is where Carr ties Billy to Whitey with the corrupted FBI agent fitting neatly into the mix, all a part of an all-star criminal class out of the southie end of Boston. And what a story it is as it reads like an endlessly repeating drive-by killing spree all juxtaposed with Billy's political operations shades of the Kennedy machine - ipso the Irish mob of Nicholson in the Departed marries the life of Danial Drew, he of Days of Erie fame. Nothing has changed, just the names.I'd recommend a book entitled, \\"the Bosses\\" to frame out the Billy side and perhaps Vinnie Teresa's, \\"My life in the mob\\" for the Whitey side. In any event it's a page turner which I looked forward to reading again after each time I had to put it down. All the Mass-politico names are there including Barney, Ted and J.F. Kerry. What a bunch!"},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I am a 23 year old woman that fashion and girlie things and I am not normally a person that would buy books like this, however I was fortunate to meet Howie in Ellsworth, ME. This book is very captivating! I bought the book Saturday night and started reading Sunday and have it finished this Tuesday morning. It's informative, educational, and just interesting.

I still learned stuff I hadn't known before.Howie's got a great style, which you'd expect from someone who first made his bread and butter with his writing."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"This has lots of information and reads well! However, there are individuals being subjected to financial,career,emotional and mental damage in this ongoing battle that are not mentioned here or anywhere else, such as the man. a.k.a. 'Chico' who:1) When Whitey fled, was fired at his job at his job with a controversial Cambridge ,Mass. company suddenly and suspiciously, only to be subjected to blackballed references as he passed from one employer to another, each having business ties or indirect connections to the company along the way. One of these corporate divisions, in Cambridge,Mass., was within a 2-3 minute walk of one of Jerry Angiulo's top men's office, who ran an escort service among other things nearby.2)At one such employer, the man was blamed for the fallout then occurring in the Bulger case (1996-98)even though he had no ties whatsoever to the case to his knowledge.3)In March,2006, as assorted new books such as this one were released, the man's landlord, an associate of nearly 25 years, mentioned Howie then began acting bizarre toward the man.It appeared that certain individuals may have been emplaced in the man's life to act in a certain way should the Bulger program be compromised. An example is of one \\"friend\\" of the man, who after 14 years of \\"friendship\\" revealed that he kept notebooks on discussions between he and 'Chico'; notes that might not reflect accurate discussions as much as character-assassinating documentation for future use.The same man went by the name of the ceo of a firm who had been complained about for dumping toxic chemicals at an industrial park in Woburn,Mass. in the 1980s based in New Jersey and with an Oak Bluffs address.4)Strong signs of psychological manipulation, in which the man appeared to be surrounded by individuals at work and outside of work funneling information to a third party for evaluation and tactics... an example of this is if 'Chico' showed an interest in sex or particular women, provocative women would appear, tease Chico and ultimately disappoint him. If Chico confided to associates around him he would like marry and have a child, then every obstacle would seem to appear in his path. What the public might not know is how limitless government resources are in manpower and how much can be brought to bear against an individual if he or she does not cooperate.One such tactic is to prevent say a man from having female relationships then start rumors of homosexuality;or, subject the man to willing females but with a major stipulation: to have them you must do so at risk of assassinating your own character, such as dating married women,etc.Financial and career destruction are well-known tactics also, as Trooper Johnson's case shows.This is a recommended book with a slight reservation that Howie might not understand the enormity of what organized crime and the government can do."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"As much as a simpleton that Howie Carr is, his recounting of the Bulger brothers' lives exposes the small-minded venality that taints so much of the city. That Billy became president of UMass was puzzling to anyone who didn't know the story behind the story. Carr's explanation of how it happened and how corruption followed him put it into context.The book is an engaging read, but mostly for Bostonians and New Englanders. Carr's biases come through, but given how preposterous the situation is/was, they are overwhelmed by the bizarre nature of the facts and they are a minor annoyance that doesn't get in the way of the narrative.With a readable typeface, an engaging storyline and low amounts of concentration required to get its gist, Carr's book is great treadmill reading."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I can't say this is a dull or lackluster effort. It would be hard to write a bad book on this topic. However, there is virtually no new ground broken on Whitey Bulger in this book that \\"Black Mass\\" didn't already review (in greater detail in some cases) If this book has a strength it is in exposing the unabashed connection between Billy and Whitey and the obvious help that Billy provided, trashing the notion that Billy is some innocent bystander, completely uninvolved in his brother's criminal antics. Again, though, unless you know nothing about this saga, you will not really learn much that is earthshaking. Some additional tidbits about the consequences of aggressively chasing whitey meted out by Billy, some funny political stories that are worth a chuckle but again a compendium that any casual reader of the Boston Globe would already know and certainly understand. I will say that Howie does do a great service in assembling the relentless parade of crooks, political hacks and dirtbags that have been par for the course in Massachusetts for the past century. The sheer weight of the unethical behavior of individuals like Billy Bulger illustrate that unlike the mythical public relations persona when it comes to sociopathlogy, Whitey has nothing on Billy.My biggest beef with this book is that it ends its assessment of Whitey's flight in the late nineties with no real followup or even theory on where he is today, how he is surviving on a day to day basis and how he could still evade capture. Also no prediction on what might happen and why. Yes, it is made clear that whitey has money stashed all over, that possibly his best trump card is his taping of conversations with crooked FBI agents (that they desperately would not want to be made public if Whitey was captured) and that he benfited by planning his getaway for years, but I already knew that. For those in the know on this case, I'd call this one to get out of the local library."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"The title of the book indicates that there are two brothers who terrorized and corrupted Boston for a quarter century. I had heard of Whitey's evils for years. I bought the book to find out what one, Billy, did that corrupted and terrorized Boston. I was greatly disappointed since there was nothing there. All we really learn about Billy is that he was investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing by the feds but Howie suspects the investigation wasn't on the up and up. I can't get it straight whether Carr thinks the feds are on the level or not. I suppose he believes they are when they do things that reaffirm his beliefs.Another aspect of the book I found wanting is that Carr puts forth Kevin Weeks as a credible source. Yet I hear Carr is now holding out that Weeks is totally incapable of belief.There are other books written and to be written about this sordid episode in Boston's history. \\"Black Mass\\" tells the story from the view of a corrupt FBI agent, John Morris. Ralph Ranalli's \\"Deadly Alliance\\" is better than either other book because he takes the FBI corruption dead on. If you are interested in any of this, start with Ranalli"},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"While the hype leaves many to believe that there will be revelations in this book, much of it is re-cycled from Carr's columns he writes for a Boston daily.

I also bought BRUTAL by Kevin Weeks and was amazed at how much I learned. That book is worth the money for sure. It's funny but Carr is a journalist and Weeks is a criminal (I saw the 60 Minutes episode with both of them and thought Carr looked like a little sneak) yet Carr has written a dishonest and inaccurate book while Weeks at least told the truth. The 60 Minutes show should have been enough to have warned me not to buy Carr's book. But you can save your money.

But you think that after all those years, he would have paid attention or at least tried to verify his facts. But I guess when you have your own radio show and newspaper column, you begin to believe that whatever you say or write has to be correct, without following through on your journalistic mandate to get it right! Aside from gleaning his facts from previously written articles by his fellow Herald scribes, Howie didn't even seem to bother to check the transcripts of all the court cases over the years. My advice--skip this clip job and read BRUTAL by Kevin Weeks. At least the stuff in his book was vetted by 3 juries, the DEA, the DOJ, the Mass. State Police, etc. And he's not a blowhard who thinks he's the second coming of Mike Royko or Jimmie Breslin.

There is mention of two FBI agents Nick and Charles Gianturco, one of which had Bulger and Flemmi over his house at Christmas. Howie claims that Nick is corrupt just like John Connoly. Where is his proof? If that is so then why wasn't the agent indicted and found guilty? The answer is because neither of them were corrupt....PERIOD! I have known both of theose agents for many years.

The book makes a good effort in detailing the seperate but connected lives of the brothers and the connections that they had with-in the political & underworld community, showing just how much of a gray area it was between the two. Howie Carr Does a decent job detailing these brother's lives, but at times the book is confusing and writing could have used a little more work in the editing department as some of the writing is misleading unless read over a coupe of times.I would suggest reading Black Mass before getting into this book to give a better understanding of what is going during the time period from when Rico from the FBI was courting Whitey, before he took over Winter Hill. It helps to give a better understanding as to why Zip Connolly was making Whitey seem a perfect informant.If anything this book can be looked at as an expansion to the story of Boston corruption and delving into the life of Billy Bulger, & just how the relationship with his brother had functioned through the years."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"I became a fan of Howie Carr after living in Boston and listening to his afternoon show on WRKO. While I don't agree with all of Howie's conservative views, I really enjoy his take-no-prisoners view of politics and his witty attacks on the Bay State's many inept politicians. After enjoying The Departed, I was intrigued by Carr's book on the Bulger brothers and picked up a used copy. I read through it in one day.The Brothers Bulger is a great read, and an almost unbelievable tale about how Whitey and Billy Bulger rose to complete power in Massachusetts crime and politics despite blatant evidence of their misdeeds. I was shocked by how both brothers were able to consolidate and maintain their power over two decades. In a clear, sharp narrative Carr maps out the lives of both brothers. Throughout the book, I was filled with mixed emotions of anger and hilarity. I was often furious at how dozens of police, FBI agents, and U.S. Attorneys looked the other way as Whitey Bulger murdered dozens of people. And many times I found myself laughing out loud at the ineptitude and corruption of nearly every person mentioned in the book. The world Carr describes is filled almost entirely with scoundrels and villains, and nearly no heroes. Because everybody had their hand out, Whitey and Billy were able to skate by time after time.Two things really struck me about the Bulgers' story. First is the magnitude of Whitey's crimes. Carr shows that to merely label Whitey Bulger a mobster is to understate his gross criminality; Whitey was a serial killer. I had no idea that Whitey was directly involved in dozens of brutal murders, all made to consolidate his criminal empire and eliminate his perceived enemies. Carr discussed Whitey's cruelty and threats to anyone who stood against him. Whitey Bulger was no ordinary mobster, he was a monster that was allowed to roam free for over 20 years before the powers that be finally decided to go after him. By that time, he had stolen nearly $50 million, and left hundreds of ruined lives in his wake.Carr's description of Whitey's crimes and the tales of his sadistic exploits are made all the more astonishing by the criminal behavior of the Boston FBI. It is almost impossible to believe the levels of corruption demonstrated by the top agents in the Boston FBI. The FBI used Whitey as an informant, but the relationship was one-sided from the start. Whitey fed them few valuable details, instead using the agents to settle scores with his enemies and other mob rivals he wanted out of the picture. Whitey also bribed dozens of them with cash, jewelry and other items. In return, many of the corrupt agents, headed by John \\"Zip\\" Connolly, shielded Whitey for years from any potentially damaging investigations and did everything they could make sure Whitey stayed on the street and continued his reign of terror on Boston, even obstructing justice.Amazingly, Whitey would have dinner and hang out with agents as if they were friends. Whitey and Zip Connolly even vacationed together! Their corruption was aided by indifferent federal prosecutors and Billy Bulger, who, as the state Senate Majority Leader used the FBI to protect Whitey. This went on for years. Along the way, many of these agents collected bribes, retired to cushy positions, and even helped conspire to murder enemies of Whitey.Sadly, many of the book's main villains did not meet justice. Whitey was tipped to his eventual indictment by Zip Connolly and hasn't been seen since, Billy fell into disgrace but never faced a trial for his corruption, and even Connolly, despite being convicted under RICO, got a mere 10 year sentence in federal prison. I would have preferred all of them spent their rest of their lives in prison.I was somewhat disappointed that Howie didn't analyze the Bulgers and how they corrupted the Bay State for so long. But in many ways he doesn't have to. Howie is a superb storyteller, and the evidence he dishes out throughout his tale is so overwhelming and stunning that it speaks for itself. As it turns out, The Departed wasn't all that far-fetched."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Howie Carr is an author that I never knew until I picked up this book at the supermarket. I never heard of the Bulger brothers and I have only visited Beantown once for a couple of days as a tourist a few years back. Since I live in New Jersey, this book helps me understand our own corruptive state politics and powers that be better but I am still angry at them anyway. The Bulger Brothers remind me more of Cain and Abel. They both seek the same success even crossing borders and lines that most of us would never dare cross. Imagine Whitey Bulger at your Thanksgiving table or any of his goons. The book is true and I am only halfway through reading about Whitey's crimes and trying to understand the corruptive state of city and state politics. I like the Boston as a city but the Bulger brothers have shown what can happen when they abuse their powers to influence, control, and even destroy others for the sake of their own. You don't want Whitey Bulger to have a grudge against you because he's dangerous. He's not the second most wanted man beside Osama Bin Laden for nothing as the author writes. His danger is that he is too close to us. He looks and acts just like anybody else. We don't know how many dead bodies there are that have not been uncovered in Boston yet but the dead does speak sometimes if you listen hard enough."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Great tale of crime gang in Boston and how national, state, and local law personnel were bought out and actually protected them. Good read on crime and politics. Some of the editing is bad, the last chapter seems almost disconnected in the book, it jarringly repeats material covered repeatedly earlier in the book. Plus the author places a lot of personal invective and leaps of assumption in the book. Carr labels almost everyone as incompetent or corrupt, usually both, except for one person he supported in a perjury case. Left wing or Democrats come in for special contempt. If you saw Billy Bulger's testimony before congress, you saw Carr behind him making faces like an elementary school student at a class picture. Filtering out the bias and assumptions traded as fact, it is a good book and documents severe corruption problems that let a serial killer go on for far, far too long."},{"Title":"The Brothers Bulger: How They Terrorized and Corrupted Boston for a Quarter Century","review":"Howie has an amazing memory and recall for details and related information concerning the dastardly of Boston.

Growing up in Massachusetts, I had always known so many of the names in this book, mostly the politicians, but had no idea how much Billy was linked in with them. Aside from the Whitey/gangster half of the story, this book could almost be used as a history guide to Massachusetts politics. In terms of Whitey, if you are unaware of the true depth of this man's crimes, this is a must read, especially since it was written before Whitey was found in California.

No mean feat, a journey equivalent to Seattle to Mexico City through some of the most remote of Downunder's extensive wilderness. Told with humour and an eye on frailties both equine and human it details the courage and perseverance of a young Sharon Roberts and husband Ken as they confront everything from crocodile infested rainforests to baking waterless plains, while managing a sometimes reluctant but always bold group of horses. But more than a horse story it's a dashing good read, which the armchair traveller and the non-horse enthusiast can enjoy alike. For horse lovers it is a how-to guide to modern packhorse travel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The art of thinking,","review":"When I first read this book, back about the time I started college in the 60's, it was still in print. I bought copy after copy, underlining and marking until the book was overmarked and I needed a new one, which I would then buy and start marking anew. It would not be much of an exaggeration to say that I would hardly be the person I am or anything like it without this book and the influence that it's had on me. One example: the power of altruism (any high ideal) actually lived in action. (Living One's Life on a Higher Plane: Moral Elevation a condition of high thinking.) Who would have thought that to sacrifice for a goal higher than one's self helps one to think? And yet, I have found from experience that it does. The richness and practicality of this book are amazing. Single phrases or sentences have echoed and re-echoed in thought for decades--just indeed as recommended by the author as just one way of richening one's thought. If Dimnet quotes it, I don't remember it, but &quot;to thine own self be true&quot; (source?) might be one way of summing up the whole book. But not as a catchy aphorism--rather as a whole approach to thought and life studded with so many gems of practical advice and wisdom that one has a constant tendency to start quoting the book verbatim. Here's one that I've always loved (approximate): &quot;Know what you want! say the newspapers, we have it ready for you! Wise counsel indeed, for the whole art of thinking is in it.&quot; It would be easy to write a whole book on that one piece of advice. Another: to think about something, populate your mind with favorable images and keep them there awhile. (Sound cryptic or superficial?: read the book; it's not.) There are dozens, scores more. Perhaps for many people the single most important thing to learn is that thinking can be learned, that it is an art like any other with definite rules and dos and don'ts. Read this book. If you're not a barbarian, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The art of thinking,","review":"I guess everyone has a story about how they came across &quot;The Art of Thinking,&quot; by Dimnet. For me, I found it on a friend's bookshelf a dozen or so years ago. I have seen other books similar to this (and much larger and more &quot;hip&quot;) in used bookstores. Such books are pure fluf compared to the jewel Dimnet produced in this very small book. It presents the author's ideas on the nature of true creativity in any given field and how to unclutter your mind to be able to get at your own thoughts. But the book goes well beyond this to be a showcase of writing and eloquence. Here is Dimnet, a Frenchman and a Latin scholar, and, of course, an excellent writer of English who, conveniently for us, directs his comments to Americans. To give a hint of more of the contents: All children under the age of nine are poets and philosophers. When they notice their elders, they (all, without almost a single exception) begin to imitate them. In this one action is lost all their brilliance; and for most people, they never get back to what fired up their minds as children. Also, he says, being forced to fill a blank paper with an essay, when one has nothing to say, is one of the most powerful experiences school-age children go through, which forever turns them off to writing, and actually helps to kill their ability to think. This book is worth more than just a read-through."},{"Title":"The art of thinking,","review":"I first found this book over 20 years ago, and make it a practice to re-read it every few years. It starts as a comparison between American and French education systems, but cleverly guides the reader down an irreversible and compelling path of intellectual criticism into the &quot;land&quot; of intellectual integrity. In essence it tells you to &quot;think your own thoughts&quot; and &quot;be aware of the flimsy foundation upon which your knowledge/belief system is based.&quot; In a world cluttered with data, this book guides us towards the essentials.

Rather than read and think the thoughts of others, I now refrain from such activity, and from showing my teeth when I smile (per his instruction). I have also stopped saying 'basically', 'the thing about it', and 'blah blah blah'.

Bronowski launches a critique on a more pervasive foundation of western philosophy, that of dualism. Bronowski seeks to reduce the dualistic view that somehow science and technology are antithetical to the human spirit. The book is constructed as an extended essay consisting of three distinct, though closely related arguments:a) The Creative Mind - an argument that the human mind operates creatively whether engaged in logical constructivist activities or in more subjective expressions of thought. In short, Bronowski argues here that the Poet and the Physicist have much more in common than we allow ourselves to believe.b) The Habit of Truth - an argument that both the right (creative) and left (analytic) sides of the brain are doing the same thing, seeking truth, in the generative process.c) The Sense of Human Dignity - an argument that the objective exploration of science and technology are just as \\"human\\" as the quest for introspective or subjective understanding of the human condition.Epilogue) The volume also contains an interesting fictional dialogue titled The Abacus and the Rose, held between a public servant, a scientist and a literary figure regarding the nature of their thought processes.Bronowski emphasizes the notion that the outcomes of science and technology are mere tools and artifacts, it is the spirit and creative energy behind them form the basis for human values and ideals. For Bronowski human values are what drive scientific discovery just as they drive public policy or artistic creativity. We get into trouble when we try and separate these ventures from human values, and thus confuse means and ends. In this way Bronowski offers a compelling argument that is less a critique of positivism than a call for a more holistic vision of human development and the creative spirit.The essay is well written and easy to follow and provides some solid insight on the ever more difficult task of linking scientific and technological progress with human value systems.\\"Whether our work is art or science or the daily work of society, it is only the form in which we explore our experience which is different; the need to explore remains the same.\\" (Bronowski, 1965, p. 72)"},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","review":"This is a small but profound work. The three chapters\\" 'The Creative Mind''The Habit of Truth' ' The Sense of Human Dignity' taken together constitute an argument against modern positivistic philosophy and logical analysis regarding the absolute separation of 'is' from 'ought'. As Bronowski understands it the sense of values pervades and in a sense brings together the major realms of creative life. The special values of Science itself are for Bronowski 'independence and originality, dissent and freedom and tolerance; such are the first needs of science; and these are the values, which , of itself, it demands and forms.\\"Yet Bronowski also strongly emphasizes the evidence- based nature of Science in its search for Truth. And he speaks of the process of its development ,\\" the view that our concepts are built up from experience, and have constantly to be tested and corrected in experience.\\" Here is the great distinguishing feature of Science not only its quest for truth but in its power to transform the world.What Bronowski does in another sense is cut across the 'Two Cultures' divide posited by C.P. Snow. A person of both literary and scientific background himself he finds that ' the exploration of likenesses' through symbolic concepts define creativity both in literary and in scientific realms.Bronowski is in a very deep sense a humanist who defines and dignity of mankind in its search to understand and transform the world.There is much to be thought and said about this very important book."},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","review":"I became interested in this title by attending a talk that included the likes of Harvard's Steven Pinker, who mentioned it in his address to the audience. Now that I have read it, I am amazed I had never heard of this book. This should be required reading in science classrooms at the high school level (if not even earlier) the world over. Bronowski makes a stirring case for science, as he wrote this in the 1950s when human society was faced with the crossroads, whether to continue down the path of progress aided by science, or to maintain the old society as driven by the mechanics of religion. He comes down firmly on the side of science, and in few cases (perhaps only from Christopher Hitchens of late) has such an impassioned plea for that discipline been put to paper or oratory. Pages of this book are quotable, and given the very anti-science rhetoric being tossed around political circles in the United States lately, are poignant admonishments to defend science against the forces of ignorance that seek to unseat it and place subjectivity and superstition in its stead. The book is a good and short read, and is separated into three parts, the third of which closes Bronowski's advocacy with an impassioned crescendo. The entire text is worthwhile though, and the author references history and philosophy often as he gives his perspective in relation to science.This book should be on the shelf of every scientist and ardent skeptic. It's the kind of statement that needs to be heard much more often today, particularly when evolution is being attacked as conspiracy in the classroom, and children are falling treacherously behind in math and the sciences nationwide, stricken with disinterest in the type of hard work science requires."},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","review":"It is easy today to get depressed about mankind. Bronowski demonstrates that there is hope for us yet. He also demonstrates that we, perhaps know more and are capable of more than we thought."},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","review":"I can't say too much about this book. I purchased this as a gift. The receiver was pleased with the book, so I guess it was of value to them."},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","review":"This was required reading for me in a required Social Sciences survey course required for my B.Sc. in chemistry over forty years ago (I hold an earned Ph.D. in chemistry in additon to a later acquired law degree). I still regard it as one of the most influential books in my life. I understand the essays in this small book to be a critical examination of various scientific philosophies. However what I found to be most illuminating was Bronowski's study of values in a scientist's search for truth; how the values necessary to enable the search for scientific truth in the cooperative enterprise of science are human values ratified by the great religions of the world. What this meant to me as a callow (at that time) intellectual who was more of an agnostic than an atheist at that point in my life was that many of the value systems espoused and shared by the great religions were independently derivable by the values necessary to succeed in the quest for \\"truth.\\" This resonanted with me personally more than any thundering proselytizer in a church pulpit and my faith began to grow. This is a small book to have such a large effect and it is worth reading for many reasons - some well elaborated by other reviewers. I think Dr. Bronowski would be pleased with its effect on me."},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","review":"Bronowski's &quot;Science &amp; Human Values&quot; should be purchased with A.J. Ayer's &quot;Language, Truth &amp; Logic&quot; --the quintessential explanation of the &quot;verifibility criterion of meaning&quot;. Just as the Russell/Whitehead &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; sought to ground mathematics upon a foundation of pure logic, the &quot;verifibility criterion of meaning&quot; sought to provide an empirical basis for all scientific enquiry. However, the inescapable conclusion is that ethical imperatives (sentences containing the word &quot;ought&quot; or its equivalent) are non-sensical. However logical, this position may be untenable from a practical standpoint. Jacob Bronowski's crtique of the &quot;logical positivist&quot; position in his &quot;Science and Human Values&quot; pointed out an underlying social injunction implied in the positivist and analyst methods. That implied imperative is: &quot;we OUGHT to act in such a way that what IS true can be verified to be so&quot;. Ironically, Bronowski's critique may have saved logical positivism from its own inflexible consistency, placing its edifice not upon an unassailable axiom but rather upon an &quot;ought statement&quot; which will not admit of proof by the very method which is its logical offspring."},{"Title":"Science and Human Values","review":"Before reading, I assumed J. Bronowski's Science and Human Values would be a work dealing with the opposition or harmony of scientific-technological progress and our social values. Instead, it examines science as a specific case of human activity and the definition of human values in general and specifically with regard to science.Bronokowski begins by dispelling the \\"schoolboy\\" notion that science is a collection of \\"facts\\". It is instead a creative activity like art and philosophy in which concepts rule. Concepts are open to interpretation and development, and this is what happens in science.The second essay in the book puts forward the position that all human values are like scientific values and subject to change and development. This is not only a theoretical possibility but an historical reality, as evidenced by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and other political developments.In the third essay, a theory of social values based on science is developed. \\"Value\\" is defined as a concept that both joins men in a society and lets them retain some individuality. In the scientific community values such as truthfulness and scholarship are what allow the scientific community to exist. Bronowski seems to say, then, that if we want a society that integrates science it must be a society that upholds scientific values, and science must support certain values in society in order to thrive.That science should be the basis of society is not so much stated outright as assumed or implied. This is a work of pragmatism. Too bad Bronowski didn't realize that he assumes science is a collegial society. In fact, the scientific community today is predominated by concerns such as tenure, profit and grant security. It is extremely hierarchical, with the drawing together aspects of values much more prevalent than the individuating ones.The last part of the book is a dialogue (a la Plato) on the same theme."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Anastasia Romanov","review":"Was not even a book it was a phamplet.

But as she grows up I'm hoping this is one of the books she returns to every now and then like the poem books I still have from my infancy."},{"Title":"The Everyman Anthology of Poetry for Children (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"I love poetry, I'm a huge fan of the Everyman's Series, and the prospect of an Everyman's book of poetry for children may have set my expectations too high. Another reviewer notes that some of the poems may be difficult for children, and I second that. Few rhyme. Now, whatever your stance on rhymes and poetry, I think most folks who know children will agree that rhyming is key. To a child, it's what makes a poem a poem. And for the most part, these poems don't rhyme, and are sure to baffle the young, would-be poetry fan. Aside from that, the majority were written more than a century ago, and the wordage is awkward to a young modern child's ears.A children's poetry anthology can be many things, but a young reader ought to be able to hole up in a corner somewhere and read, understand, follow, be delighted and tickled now and then, and generally come to realize that hey--I like poetry! This book won't pull that off."},{"Title":"The Everyman Anthology of Poetry for Children (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"We purchased this for our oldest grandson in hopes that he develops a love of poetry that we enjoy.

It's a gift that we don't know how he'll receive."},{"Title":"The Everyman Anthology of Poetry for Children (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"It seems to me the primary basis for inclusion in this anthology was that the work was in the public domain. The most frequently represented author is \\"Anonymous,\\" with works like \\"The Merry Bells of London\\" (\\"Gay go up and gay go down / To ring the bells of London Town. / Bull's eyes and targets, / Say the bells of St Marg'ret's. / Brickbats and tiles, / Say the bells of St. Giles.\\" And so forth.) Many works are excerpts: An eight-line song from a Renaissance masque [\\"Oberon\\"] by Ben Jonson, or the \\"Spring\\" song from Shakespeare's \\"Love's Labour's Lost.\\"Now, let's take \\"Spring,\\" for example. The song starts: \\"When daisies pied and violets blue / And lady-smocks all silver-white / And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue / Do paint the meadows with delight, / The cuckoo then, on every tree, / Mocks married men; for thus sings he, / Cuckoo; / Cuckoo, cuckoo: / O word of fear, / Unpleasing to a married ear.\\" I don't really know how a child is going to make sense of this; I'm guessing that even a large number of adults might miss the fact that \\"cuckoo\\" is \\"unpleasing to a married ear\\" because it sounds like the word \\"cuckold.\\" But without that information--and this anthology seldom provides such information--then you can't really appreciate the poem. The irony is that the editor probably figured that what makes the poem appropriate for children is that it has the word \\"cuckoo\\" in it, playful and musical, but it's exactly that word and its--for children--obscure connection to the seldom-used word \\"cuckold\\" that will make it incomprehensible to them. Can an adult read it aloud to a child in a way that highlights the musicality of language, even if the full meaning remains out of reach? Sure. But wouldn't it be a better way to foster an appreciation of poetry if you picked poems that highlighted the sound of language while ALSO having a meaning that's accessible to children?I mean, they have Coleridge's \\"Kubla Khan\\" in here. Wonderful poem, obviously, but I don't see the point in reading it until you're at least 14 or 15 years old (unless you're extraordinarily precocious). When I think of poetry for children, I think of poetry targeted to kids between the ages of 7 and 12 or 13. Yes, as the five-star reviewers say, there are a few poems here that fit the bill, but they are truly few. If you're interested in getting your young children interested in poetry, I would start with one of the Shel Silverstein anthologies instead."},{"Title":"The Everyman Anthology of Poetry for Children (Everyman's Library Children's Classics)","review":"My daughter is almost eight and reads well, but I am hard pressed to find anything in this anthology that she will enjoy or comprehend. I have a five year old son and an almost three year old daughter to whom the entire contents are useless.

My Captain! etc.) and none of the ones I loved as an elementary school student (The Secret, My Shadow, Who Has Seen the Wind, Wynken Byinken and Nod, Paul Revere's Ride, etc.). Even as an anthology for older children, just on quick perusal, I can say for certain that there are many great poets completely left out- E.B.

A book which captures the reader's need for sensual, lyrical description as well as having the ability to allow common emotional themes to transcend the two covers, Nin paints for us the city of Golconda, Mexico, with its poor but happy natives and sweltering tropical escapism. The main character, Lillian, is a jazz musician who travels to Golconda for a 3 month stint and along the way rediscovers the beauty of Mexico she knew as a child, of the wise and natural existence known to those she meets, and the demons she must exercise from her own past.

Nin disdains all writing technique, scenes, plot, but she's great on characterization and wonderful sensual descriptions of her settings. She has a rep as a writer of erotica, and that rep is well deserved, but there is little of that here. What's really fun is to read her diaries from the same period and setting, so you can see what this was based on. If you love her, and I do, you love her better than anybody. She's just great."},{"Title":"Arabic On The Move( 3CDs + Guide) (Language on the Move)","review":"One of my big gripes is that virtually every language course out there wants you to believe that they teach language the way we learning it as children. Get real!!! Watching my grandchild learning to speak and remembering how my children learned to speak English, I can categorically state that none of them learned to read while learning to speak, much less \\"good\\" grammar skills. They did not learn to read until they were 5 or 6, and as for grammar, there are facets that they did not learn until college. That is why I prefer to begin a new language with audio only.This is an excellent beginner's course. Unlike many of courses in this format, the pauses to repeat the language are sufficiently long enough that you can repeat the phrase before the instructor moves on to the next phrase.Naturally, the pace of speaking is slower than natural -- after all when you are just beginning your ear is not adjusted to understanding a language as it is naturally spoken. There is a pamphlet that comes with the CDs to provide a transliterated dictionary of the words used in each section. Naturally, you are not going to be reading this brochure while driving, but it is a nice fall back when at home and uncertain how you want to pronounce a word.Keep in mind that this program is in colloquial EGYPTIAN Arabic, not Modern Standard Arabic. Egyptian colloquial Arabic is widely understood because of the predominance of Egyptian dialect used in movies, TV programs, etc. If you are using these tapes to supplement a course in MSA you are going to find some differences. MSA is the literary language of educated Arabs (and others) and is familiar throughout the Middle East, however you will be understood in either dialect. If you are going to use movies and TV shows to supplement your studies, you will be listening to Egyptian (except for Alzeera, which insists on the use of MSA).I highly recommend these tapes if you want to learn Arabic. Although certainly no expert in the language, I have found them to be a useful introduction to the Arabic language."},{"Title":"Arabic On The Move( 3CDs + Guide) (Language on the Move)","review":"I liked this cd set.

Neil Postman's writing styles rambles quite a bit which is very distracting. Also, the reader has to assume that his seemingly random string of facts that he brings us to agrue his case are true. But once you get past that and stick with it, his occasional gems of insight show through (especially in chapter #9 entitled &quot;Scientism&quot;). Neil Postman's reminds me of an eccentric professor that you would have in college: while he is very perceptive and enlightening in the classroom environment, you soon realise when class is over that he is dressed as if he didn't know it was 1998."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"The book describes a history of the impact of technology on human culture. It describes why American culture has a deep confidence in technological solutions, even if the problems are more readily solved by simple non-technological changes. Postman is consistently insightful in his disection of why we have the relationship with technology that we do. Highly recommended for anyone that works in the technology industry."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Written in a somewhat angry spirit, this book is one of many that have appeared in recent years that could with fairness be labeled as \\"technoreactionary\\". These books lament the current state of technology and believe it to be \\"alienating' and socially disruptive. They do not want to eliminate technology, but instead put it in its \\"proper place\\", with the latter not really being defined, but with the implicit connotation being clear: technology has run rampant over traditional worldviews and has become very unhealthy for the human condition.According to the author cultures can be classified into three types, and all are represented in the modern world. The first type is called tool making and was the predominant culture up until the seventeenth century. One can still find tool-making cultures in isolated parts of the world, and the author invites the reader to seek them out. The second type is referred to as a \\"technocracy\\", wherein the old tool making culture is retained to some degree but where technology is beginning to be pursued for its own sake, with its social impact essentially ignored and its dynamic manifesting itself in bureaucracies. The third type is the \\"technopoly\\", which is not defined explicitly but instead is characterized by its uncritical acceptance by the culture that practices it.American culture is a technopoly writes the author, and is the sole example at the present time. He gives several reasons why it became one. It first had to pass through the \`technocratic' stage, this occurring somewhere along the time of the publication of the Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, whose ideas gave credence to the need for \\"impersonal, large-scale\\" production. Humans were then reduced to being \\"barterers\\" and \\"wealth seekers.\\" Machines were invented to make machines, and inventing became the predominant pastime, with no cognizance taken of why invention should take place. Humans became not children of God but \\"consumers\\", all subject to the ups and downs of the marketplace. But then America morphed into a \\"technopoly,\\" with its emphasis on scientific management, the replacement of human judgment with calculation, and meaning in social life is only to be found in the context of \\"machinery and technique.\\" But for America to become a technopoly also required an \\"improbable world\\", which is characterized by an uncritical acceptance of the authority of science and a lack of what he calls an \\"information immune system\\" that will allow effective filtering of extraneous information and provide worldviews and narratives that give societies coherence and meaning.Because of his aversion for change, and his willingness to accept myths and other cultural narratives for their ability to maintain social cohesiveness, the author follows the conservative political tradition. He complains of the tendency of technocracy/technopoly to negate the past or even turn its back on it, disrespecting traditions and supplanting them with new but very ephemeral ones. The \\"continuity\\" of family life and regional traditions are to be discarded, not because they are immoral necessarily but because they are superfluous. In a technopoly one for example does not pray for relief from disease; one uses penicillin. One does not set down roots: being mobile is the predominant lifestyle.But it is the scientific worldview that makes modern society appear so alien to the author and to many people at the present time. Since discoveries are occurring so fast, this worldview can take on the appearance of being too \\"conceptually permissive.\\" The author gives examples in his treatment of the \\"improbable world.\\" But science is now giving interpretations to notions that were just a decade ago considered \\"off limits\\" to scientific investigation. For example, its view of romantic love has its origin in various chemical/neuronal processes in the brain. And then there is genetic engineering, particularly in its use of transgenic technologies, which has allowed a much more extended notion of species. A goat can take on the genes of a spider and produce silk for example, allowing spiders and goat to be related by deliberate technological intervention. And genetics of course has shown just how similar humans are to other life forms, and how easy it might be to alter human genetics to make humans even more similar to these life forms.But the author never gives a convincing argument as to why a technopoly is unhealthy or alienating, and there are many readers that will demand he speak for himself when he makes commentary on the alienating and dominating influence of technology. Such readers, and this reviewer is one of them, find life in the modern world very exciting and meaningful. We are proud apologists for scientism and technology. We deify it and we are drunk with it, but we never get a hangover from its contemplation and indulging ourselves in it. And we will not hesitate, not for a second, in continuing to push forward its frontiers with new discoveries and new applications. And when one technology is found to be dangerous or threatening, we will work incessantly in finding another one to negate these dangers. And yes, from a particular point of view we do surrender ourselves to technology, but not from the love of domination.It is our curiosity that we surrender to: we do not interrupt its flow and we deliberately and unashamedly move across boundaries in order to understand and explore new frontiers. No idea, no conception, and no invention is considered to be off limits, and we take delight in the disturbance of cognitive equilibrium. We worship creativity, ingenuity, and the smashing of old tablets. Our heroes are scientists, inventors, and technicians. Our morning coffee is the perusal of patent applications and preprint servers. We only feel envy when we think of future generations, when contemplating their immersion in technologies not yet envisaged. And life in the modern world is utopia for us: we feel privileged to be able to participate in this maelstrom of discovery, in this intoxicating technopoly called the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman is an amazing, independent thinker and reflector on our culture. From education to media to technology, Postman is impressive in his insight into the trends and movements that pervades our times.This volume focuses on science and technology taking over much of culture. It's an easy transition of our times to assume that someone that is brilliant enough to make a rocket engine is capable of rendering educational decisions and spiritual ones. Postman thus becomes as he states: &quot;a dissenting voice .. to moderate the din made by enthusiastic multitudes.&quot; This will lead many on to further thought and investigation on a key aspect of our times which should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman at times presents some very weak arguements, but he does cause the reader to think, and at the end of the book, he finally comes across as a rational man with a worthy cause. I highly recommend this book. Postman makes great use of the english language, and his point is worth pondering."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"The late Neil Postman&#8217;s book, Technopoly, is a sobering assessment of a technologically obsessed American culture. The fact that the book was presciently published in 1992, long before the Internet became ubiquitous, is alarming. Don&#8217;t be fooled though, Postman isn&#8217;t a pure Luddite and this isn&#8217;t a book that is anti-technology. Perhaps the best way of putting it is that Postman harbors a sense of digital ambivalence. Like Postman, I don&#8217;t necessarily condemn the technologies themselves per se, although I certainly share some of his concerns. Technology can complement human values or it can desecrate them. It all depends on its application. So how did American culture become a Technopoly?According to Postman, a technological history of a society can be broken into three phases: tool-using, technocracy, and Technopoly. In a tool-using culture, technology is used merely as a physical tool (think utensils), where as in a technocracy the tools &#8220;play a central role in the thought world of the culture&#8221;. In a Technopoly, then, the culture can only be understood through the tools. Technopoly can thus be thought of as a &#8220;totalitarian technocracy&#8221;. At the time this book was published Postman claimed that United States was the only Technopoly in existence (I suspect he would revise that statement today if he were still alive).A Technopoly is a society that thinks that knowledge can only be had through numbers and thus, it is a society that puts an obsessive focus on trying to quantify life and puts excessive trust in experts. It&#8217;s also a society that believes that management is a science. I suspect Postman, if he were still alive, would agree with me that it&#8217;s the soft technologies that are the most insidious. You know, things like IQ tests, SATs, standardized forms, taxonomies, and opinion polls.The idea of trying to quantify things like mercy, love, hate, beauty, or creativity simply wouldn&#8217;t make sense to the likes of Galileo, Shakespeare, or Thomas Jefferson, according to Postman. Yet, this is exactly what many of our platonified social scientists try to do today. He goes on to say that, &#8220;If it makes sense to us, that is because our minds have been conditioned by the technology of numbers so that we see the world differently than they did.&#8221; Or as Marshall McLuhan succinctly put it: &#8220;The medium is the message.&#8221;So where did this obsessive focus on quantifying begin? Postman traces its history back to the first instance of grading students&#8217; papers (quantitatively), which occurred at Cambridge University in 1792, thanks to the suggestion of a tutor named William Farish. Farish&#8217;s idea of applying a quantitative value to human thought was crucial to those who believed we could construct a mathematical concept of reality.So what beliefs emerge in the technological onslaught? Here&#8217;s one passage that resonated with me.These include the beliefs that the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thought is efficiency; that technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment; that in fact human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unnecessary complexity; that subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking; that what cannot be measured either does not exist or is of no value; and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts.Another modern side effect of Technopoly is information overload and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that Postman was disgusted by our obsession with information and statistics. There are statistics and studies that support almost any belief, no matter how nonsensical. Personally, I think Nassim Taleb put it well: &#8220;To bankrupt a fool, give him information.&#8221; Postman stretches a popular adage to drive home this point himself. &#8220;To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and therefore, &#8220;to a man with a computer, everything looks like data.&#8221;Postman reminds us, however, that not all information is created equal. He writes: &#8220;Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems.&#8221; For example, consider the following noise that I&#8217;ve made up, but could easily be recited on ESPN: 77% of all Superbowl games have at least one field goal scored within the last seven minutes and 27 seconds of the third quarter. Even if this were true, does it really tell us anything useful? If one has an opinion they want verified, they can easily go on the Web and find &#8220;statistics&#8221; to support their belief. Sadly, there seems to be not only a market for useless information on the Web today, but for harmful information too.A Technopoly, according to Postman, also promotes the idea that education is a means to an end, instead of being an end in itself. He laments the fact that education is now meant to merely train people for employment instead of instilling a purpose and human values in them.Ultimately, reading this book reminded me that those who don&#8217;t learn how to use technology will be used by it."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This was a book I had to purchase for school and Amazon gave me a great price on it I however am not to fond of the read it is rather interesting to hear his views but I don't think I agree with most of them."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Excellent purchase for my doctoral class.

I read Amusing Ourselves to Death and immediately loving it, I ordered everything else I could find by Neil Postman. Im sorry I did it, and I will never order other books by an author based on what I read in one book again. In this book you will find such craziness as why the medical profession would be better off with less technology because it ruins the doctor-patient relationship. Well, next time Neil Postman needs a triple bypass he can go and worry about it somewhere with poor technology in order to enjoy his friendly doctor-patient relationship. The technology of the world has done plenty of harm to the world, but this book will not tell you many legitimate reasons why or how. Stick with Amusing Ourselves to Death and save yourself some money and a few hours you will never get back."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Having read several of Postman's books I find this to be the one of his most poorly argued. The same issues are presented as in his better books (&quot;Amusing Ourselves...,&quot; &quot;Disappearance of Childhood&quot;) but written as a manifesto of what technology --Technopoly-- has brought to society.Unfortunately his examples end up being self contradictory, often to hilarious effect by easily being read against his message. This is shows in how argues against &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;specialization&quot; while he himself is a prime example. Many other examples are show that he's no &quot;wiser&quot; than technophiles since he uses many examples at &quot;face value&quot; --since they were in print-- as more valid than those shown presented by computers.The highest irony would be anyone reading or writing reviews such as this one --which greatly contradicts his early, and strong dismissal of computers. Such approaches are not mentioned or conceived that there would any way for people to communicate or to respond to his work such as these reviews. Anyone reading reviews &quot;praising&quot; his work should ask HOW of IF they could do this BEFORE computers and the internet.Many of his strongest examples are misplaced. A prime example is to raise the TELESCOPE to the same level of importance as print and mechanical (pg 28). He cites the telescope, not the facts it revealed, as undermining religious authority. Even though, on the SAME PAGE, he admits Copernicus' work was done without it. He does not suggest that circulation of that information, as with Luther's writing, had far more impact on Christianity. He seems to suggest that, if not for the telescope, the earth would remain at the center of the universe thanks to the Catholic Church.Given that this book was written before the rise of the web it is clear that he should realize, especially starting his work with the Phaedrus, that he's not in a position to crown himself a &quot;wise king.&quot; This is most clearly that many of his concerns are misplaced and address media that are still in period of flux.Bottom linePostman is as his best when writing about the past and media effects where he can undergird his opinions with the writings of others, such as McLuhan. When doing so, his presentation is clearer and more accessible than McLuhan.Unfortunately the more he pontificates about the future the more his ignorance of technology, discomfort with change, and his desire to return to the idyllic 1800's clouds his rhetoric showing (quoting the Phaedrus, pg 4) &quot;... the reputation for it [wisdom] without the reality.&quot;"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I do not agree with many things in this book, I never really found a point to it.

It is carelessy written, its arguments are logically shaky to say the least, and it contains glaring factual errors.I was all the more disappointed because I had previously read Postman's excellent book \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\". Furthermore, Postman's topic in \\"Technopoly\\" is a serious one and deserves a serious and lucid treatment which, alas, it does not get here.As I read this book I became more and more exasperated by its shoddy thinking, but the \\"last straw\\" which made me bang the book shut in disgust was Postman's statement that a Turing Machine is a computer which can pass a Turing Test."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"What was Neil Postman thinking?

The worst part is that he rambles, boy, does he ramble. On and on he goes about absolutely nothing in particular. We get it, he hates technology, but the fact that he wrote 240 pages of the same thing over and over is a bit much. I will never read this book again.

The idea that computers or media or too much information will make people less human or end childhood is just plain silly. Do you feel less human using a computer as you read this? I don't think so. Postman arguments are foolish whining without basis."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I love technology. I tell you this, even though it must be obvious to you considering where these words are appearing. I love technology, but I'm not blind to its problems. To those who say technology has no faults, I ask you when was the last time your computer crashed or whatever happened to that grand notion of a &quot;paperless office&quot;? Technology is something between Pandora's box and Prometheus' gift; I would not want to live without it because I've read history, but I can also imagine an even better world.Neil Postman may or may not love technology, but he certainly knows its failings. Postman is the author of several books on the interplay between American culture and technology, and his most recent, Technopoly, is in some ways a culmination of his previous efforts. Postman is an educator who is distressed by the state of American education. Instead of simply decrying the fact that schools are changing and moaning for a return to the &quot;good ol' days,&quot; Postman took the time to understand the nature of the beast, dissect it, and present his conservation strategy. As he states, his idea of getting &quot;back to the basics&quot; is not quite the same as that typically bandied about by politicians and policy makers.First, the argument. Postman describes what he calls the three stages of how a culture deals with technology: 1) tool-using, 2) technocracy, 3) technopoly. In a tool-using culture, technical improvements are limited to the uses at hand. This differs from the technocracy, where the tools &quot;play a central role in the thought world of the culture.&quot; In the technopoly, tools become the culture. Astute readers may sense a possible linkage here with Alvin Toffler's three waves of culture detailed in The Third Wave. Toffler views each wave as having a trough and crest, with monumental social impact happening as each wave breaks upon the shore of human culture. Toffler says the reason for the breakdown in our traditional structures today is that we are in the break between the second and third wave. Toffler predicts a time of stability in the future, in which this new wave of culture and technology will have enhanced all of our lives. Postman and Toffler are not exactly foes in their views of the waves of culture, but differ on how we are to approach this change. Toffler implies that it will sort itself out -- a type of laissez-faire view of societal change that makes it easier to understand Toffler's ties to Newt Gingrich. Postman feels we must address the change, or it will destroy us.To that end, Postman writes a history of the growth of technology in American society. His history centers on the impact of technology on the medical profession -- how it saw the progression of each technological stage to the detriment of both doctors and patients. As damning as this evaluation is, he follows it with an even better one from our standpoint: the impact of computers on American culture. As I said before, I love technology, and computer technology most of all, but it was impossible not to follow Postman's clear and reasoned analysis of the computer's impact on society.Had Postman ended here, having formulated his theory and verified it with examples, the book would have been simply interesting, but Postman follows it with a suggested course of action. It is unsurprising that, as an educator, his solutions center on this area of society, but he states that his suggestions could never be implemented without being supported in the political and legal arenas, to name two. Postman proposes a goal for American education -- no longer, he says, can we simply train people for employment (the current state of education), but we must instill in people a purpose. His proposed goal is the betterment of humanity. To achieve this goal, he suggests that we get back to the basics in our schools, but by this he means the study of the underlying assumptions of our culture rather than just basic skills. That is, he posits a curriculum that includes the history of every subject as part of that subject, including the history (or ideology) of history itself. Only by understanding how we came to be in the place we stand now, will we be able to move forward.Only a few days before I finished reading Technopoly, Microsoft and MCI announced an initiative to get every public school a presence on the Internet. While it is a generous offer, we should examine the purpose of it all. How exactly will this aid our educational goals? I love technology and I'm bullish on the prospect of the interactive properties of the Internet to help bring about a new form of thinking, critical Americans (especially as opposed to the last mass media technology that came about, television), but that does not mean that the implementation of the technology does not need to be evaluated. And this, in a nutshell, is what Postman is about. I've probably done a major disservice to Postman in summarizing so much of his treatise here, but I hope that it has been sufficiently intriguing that it actually got you to thinking. I suggest as a follow-up that you try the text itself or some of the works listed in the bibliography. It is what I'll be doing."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I heard Neil Postman on a radio interview for this book, several years before I read &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death,&quot; which I consider a better book. I went back and read Technopoly, because it is (for better or for worse) in many respects a classic in the field. After reading &quot;Disappearance&quot; and &quot;Objections,&quot; I've found that Postman does a good job maintaining a basic premise or thesis throughout all of his books.In technopoly, Postman offers an interesting perspective on those who would &quot;gaze on technology as a lover does on his beloved,&quot; known as technophiles, and those who are on the other end of the spectrum, I'll call them technocritics. This is a book that clearly defines the potential problems that we may incur if we blindly allow technology to answer society's most pressing questions.As a quantitative researcher, who recognizes that a qualitative approach is sometimes necessary to tease out the richness of data (perhaps later to be empirically tested), I really enjoyed Postman's perspectives in the chapter titled &quot;Scientism.&quot; In this chapter, and throughout the whole book, Postman included wonderful little vignettes: &quot;Freud once sent a copy of one of his books to Einstein, asking for his evaluation of it. Einstein replied that he thought the book was exemplary but was not qualified to judge its scientific merit.&quot;I see there are several other reviews, and so as not to make mine too long, let me end with this summation: Postman is a good writer and he's got lots of interesting threads of reasoning in this book. Not all of his arguments have a tremendous amount of backing, but you will gain valuable persepectives that you may not have thought of/about previously. From that standpoint, and the fact that his paperbacks aren't extremely expensive, I recommend adding it to your shopping basket."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"There is much to learn from this important book. Over the last two hundred years, both science &amp; technology have rapidly &amp; irrevocably changed the face of the earth. In the postindustrial world, we've banished infectious diseases from our midst (at least temporarily), have instituted public health &amp; sanitation measures, and have made creature comfort a part of everyman's lifestyle. Yet, there is profound and widespread concern regarding exactly where technological innovation is taking us, what this mysterious journey will cost us in terms of a sustainable and palatable ecosystem, and exactly who (if anyone) is driving this huge and anonymous innovative juggernaut. This book deals provocatively with this issue; i.e. the promulgation of a culture in which science and technology have come to assume the pivotal role in our society.Sociologist Max Weber warned almost 100 years ago of an alarming tendency in western civilization to displace our tradition-based religious cultural ethos with a dangerously superficial \\"faux\\" rationality in which all decisions and all measures would come to be made more and more exclusively by scientific and logical means. Yet science by its very nature cannot answer questions dealing with values, advising us as to what is right, or good, or best. It can only speak to us in terms of effective and efficient means to achieve such cultural values and social ends. It is this tension between a human-oriented cultural ethos, on the one hand, and scientific progress through technological innovation not so oriented on the other that is Mr. Postman's real subject.Mr. Postman understands that science and technology are both our friends and our antagonists, and as our amigo the Unabomber has pointed out, what technical innovation introduces as \\"voluntary and optional\\" soon becomes \\"compulsory and obligatory\\", as did the introduction of automobiles and traffic regulation. In this fashion, by flooding our social, economic, and political environment with items and objects that drive the nature of society as much as enhance it (can anyone now doubt that the introduction of personal computers poses such a double-bind?), we are radically changing the nature of our society and its culture without benefit of any guiding values, precepts, or notions as to what is best for our people and our community other than to allow frenzied competition between technological rivals to see who can unlease the latest/neatest technological innovation to make our lives easier or entertain us more cleverly. Our direction in terms of progress seems to be random, at best, and Postman argues most persuasively that there are hidden dangers to our freedoms, our prosperity, and even our awareness that result from this surrender to the indifferent impulses of technological innovation. We best recognize this indifference and the dangers it poses for a free and open society.As author Sales Kirkpatrick notes in his wonderful book \\"Rebels Against the Future\\", \\"technology is never neutral\\"; it carries out its exclusively rational and logical intent to its conclusion. Yet often the fact that this conclusion is not necessarily in the public interest or consistent with the long-term goals and aspirations of our culture seems somehow irrelevant. Yet it is anything but irrelevant; it is central to the question as to how critically important decisions regarding our future and well-being are to be made, and on what basis. Will we have a society in which such decisions are made through open debate in a public forum, or one in which the decisions are made for us, based on market projections, what can be sold and distributed, researched based on its sales potential in anonymous test tubes and clinical labs, where the latest in scientific certainty is readied for pandemic public introduction? Time is growing short and we must soon decide. This is a fascinating, provocative, and important book. Read it!"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This is one of those books that make you think the only reason it isn't permanently on the New York Times Bestseller List (or the top 100 of the Amazon.com list) is because the general public is either too afraid to read it after seeing the subtitle, or people in power have been doing everything they can to render it unattractive. With every new innovation and social argument today, from birth control and feminism to the media and privacy, we all find ourselves suspiciously willing to turn over every intellectual rock and make hamburger out of every sacred cow in the search for enemies, heroes, reasons and justifications for our beliefs and actions. Yet with fear and trembling we all ignore this one- which Neil Postman makes all too clear may be the only one we should be discussing: the surrendering of all of our true sense of freedom, independence, responsibility and community to the wrathful, jealous god of Technology. In the opening to the book he quotes a philosopher who sums up his entire point with an idea that puts our entire cultural period into a disturbing perspective: regardless of its basis in scientific innovation and theory, technology \\"is a branch of moral philosophy, not science.\\" The mere thought that our entire world and the daily transformations taking place in it may be in the wrong hands- at our request- and that THAT is the explanation for the incredible degree of unquestioned, unexamined change, is enough to make you afraid of your computer. And remember, this book was published years before Dolly the cloned sheep came to town, or we were anywhere near as close to charting the entire human genome. (Like the relationship of Einstein's theories to the Manhattan Project, with that alone we have no idea what world we are in store for or what war in the twenty-first century will be like; yet we go blindly onward, giving our scientific leaders and CEOs of industry carte blanche, without questioning if we have a choice.) Postman simply makes it clear that the people who are taking us where we are headed don't really know what they're doing anymore than we do in terms of the implications for our culture- or any culture's- future, and really don't care. Because they have sold their souls to the idea of progress and markets- falling in line with the dictates of the cult of technology. Many countries around the world see Globalization as little more than the Americanization of the world, like Rome around the time of Christ. Postman's TECHNOPOLY makes it clear that that force may have malevolent implications because it could actually be built upon the transformation of American democracy and culture into that of technological fascism. With every chapter, some almost hilarious in the little absudities we live by made clear, some scary in their implications and explanations of the seemingly unrelated ills of our world, Neil Postman creates one of the greatest and most important diagnoses of the Achilles heel of modern Western Society ever written. TECHNOPOLY is prophetic, and like every prophet, what he has to say will only be apocalyptic to our world if we choose to ignore it."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"The best thing to understand about this book is that Postman doesn't hate &quot;Technology&quot; or condemn it. He isn't a Luddite or anything. He shows that &quot;Technology&quot; is very useful in solving problems while it often times creates other problems. I am a student majoring in Information Technology while concentrating in Database Design and Implementation. I love technology and it is definitely what I want to do. But, books like Postman's keeps you focused on what the real purpose of technology is. Postman touches on the fact that we are drowning in our own information. In history there has always been outlets for information. Knowledge was sacred and only passed on through certain avenues. This involved churches, schools, apprenticeships, etc. Now with the revolution of a Global Community, the transfer of data is instantaneous and removed from its context. This is a very good book. Postman writes with a fluid intellectual tone. I have just ordered another one of his books &quot;The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School&quot;. I feel that with the change in how are world is viewed and how we view ourselves within that context, it is important to discuss something such as education because it will surely be drastically affected by this change."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I first picked this book up in high school more than 10 years ago. More recently, as a Ph.D. candidate in engineering, I gave it another read. From both perspectives, a teenager with some grade-school science courses and a tech-saavy graduate student, I have thoroughly enjoyed this book.This is a book about how technology affects the way a society interprets and thinks about all aspects of life and culture. Postman starts by looking at the past and very low tech (writing, for instance) and ends up examining the tech of the present. This book was first published in the 80s with a reprint in 1993, so some of Post's observations about computers and TV are very dated. I would love to see a 2nd edition to this book to address the technology of today and it's accessibility.Despite the dated comments on present tech (which in the present age is understandibly difficult to keep up with) the overall thesis is highly relevant and this book should be read by all, science and tech enthusiast or no. It will definitely make you think about things you have previously taken for granted. The next time you use any technology, from a pen to a pda to a dvd player, you will ask yourself how this skews your world view.Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Neil Postman, who was the head of the New York University Department of Communication at the time Technopoly was written, had been teaching for 30 years. During that time, he wrote \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\" which continues with H. Marshal McLuhan's theme of \\"the median is the message. But, unlike McLuhan, who embraced the unfolding potential of emerging technologies, Postman perceives a darker future. \\"Technopoly\\" follows \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\" and further explores Postman's misgivings of a world in which technology seems to be holding sway over man's intellect. \\"...(T)he uncontrolled growth of technology destroys the vital sources of humanity. It creates a culture without a moral foundation. It undermines certain moral processes and social relations that make human life worth living.\\" Civilization, according to Postman, could be divided into tool using (pre - 17th century), technocracies (the Industrial Revolution), and technopolies (the current state of the United States, with Western Europe, following close behind). In the tool using era, tools were designed to subdue nature for the benefit of man. In the era of technocracy, tools were \\"not integrated into the culture; they attack the culture. They bid to become the culture.\\" Here, we think of print. In technopolies, the focus is on efficiency in all forms of thought and labor to the extent that human judgment by itself regarded as untrustworthy and in need of automated supplementation. In developing that theme, Postman makes the following points: - We live in a society in which all other forms of our culture tend to be subordinated to technology. - we are becoming less human with a gradual loss of contact with the human elements in our culture. - technology seems to be taking more and more control of our lives with our focus shifting from effectiveness to efficiency. - we are beginning to place a greater faith in concrete numbers rather than the subjective, and we are beginning to discount educated intuition in favor of the dictates of mathematical models. - previous ages were noted for the development of technology, or tools, that were user friendly; plows, the hand press, hand tools, and the stirrup. These tools remained subordinate to the interests of man and served mans interests. - the synergism of automation, systems management, scientific methods, systems analysis, and programs of zero- defects have displaced calculated risk taking, innovative exploration, and a human reliance on \\"the touch and feel\\" of exploratory program building. - modern man seems to have exchanged critical thinking for a passionate embrace of trivia. In discussing the ecology of information, Postman contends that as society experiences information overload from a wide variety of sources (television, radio, press, movies, computers, etc) and that the traditional values control systems (family, church, school) cannot function in their traditional roles. According to Postman, since families, for example, are no longer able to provide adequate social guidance in light of all the technological pressure, they must turn to new, technologically enhanced control mechanisms: expert services, IQ tests, SAT scores, to supplement judgment. As we move deeper into the age of the computer, Postman sees the computer as usurping initiative and responsibility while taking the element of chance and surprise out of research that has frequently produce unanticipated breakthroughs in other areas. Postman's prescription is a return to healthy individual and collective skepticism and to object and question rather than submit. It seems that to Postman, it's important to get an answer the question \\"why?\\" before entertaining the question \\"Why Not?\\" Postman urges that individuals become resistance fighters by following his ten commandments. If there is a potential for a technological suffocation of our values, the remedy may rest in a reemphasis of the humanities, religion and the philosophy of technology. There is a difference between McLuhan and Postman's vision of the future and the role technology plays. To McLuhan, future technologies cradle man's potential to develop, use and maintain the full range of his potential. To Postman, future technologies are poised to suffocate that spark within the human soul that makes man unique within the universe. Postman harkens to a Jeffersonian belief in man that reposes great trust in the judgment of an educated people. However, Postman does not seem that have the same trust that McLuhan did: that man ultimately will tame new technologies to serve his vision of the future.In a larger sense, though, Postman's ten prescriptions demonstrates his belief that man can overcome the threat posed by technology run amok. Postman, more so than McLuhan, focuses on the negative aspect of technology and has more doubts about man's ability to mold these wonders of science into his vision of tomorrow."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"For two semesters, I've taught out of *Technopoly*, and I sympathize with many of the points in it. Scientism bothers me, and I'm always going on about the Popperian criterion, that a scientific proposition must be falsifiable. So I was disappointed to see Postman fall prey to the same fallacies he criticizes. For example, he repeats the tired old error that Einstein proved &quot;everything is relative&quot; and so morals don't matter-- a classic example of the equivocal fallacy, as neither of Einstein's theories of relativity had anything to say about moral relativism. Postman also misrepresents BF Skinner's vision of humanity: &quot;The automaton to be redeemed by a benign technology.&quot; Anyone who bothers to read Skinner will find that he regards human beings as feeling, thinking, flesh-and-blood creatures. More broadly, Postman proceeds on the explicit assumption that science and religion are irreconcilably at odds, when in fact, science has nothing whatever to say about religious propositions. It is only when religious authorities presume to make testable claims about the natural world that science might come to bear. To think otherwise is to give science powers that it doesn't have-- in a word, it's scientism. Postman's nostalgia for an age of religion-induced &quot;certainty&quot; left me totally cold. Certainty about what is most uncertain? No, thank you. That is the kind of comforting &quot;certainty&quot; that has given us evils ranging from quack medicine to ethnic cleansing. Most disturbingly of all, Postman indulges in the very &quot;agentic shift&quot; that he rightly criticizes, saying essentially that a technology will do what it is designed to do. Who has designed it? To do what, and to whom? Such questions are swallowed up in the passive voice and Postman's anthropomorphization of technology. Amid all the talk of conquest and oppression, there is a conspicuous absence of conquerors and oppressors, a notable omission in what purports to be a historical overview of technology. I more or less agree with his final point, that elementary and secondary education should emphasize fundamental, classical disciplines like logic. Such training might result in fewer books like *Technopoly*, or at least equip more readers to spot the obvious errors."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I read this book years ago, but its insights continually help me understand the changes taking place around us. Postman's essential point is that technological change-and he's talking about all such change, from the Stone Age on-inevitably brings about changes in culture. These changes are both profound and subtle, so Postman offers a wealth of examples from different eras. The bigger the technological change, the more dramatic the cultural shift is. He's not, repeat not, against technological development per se. He simply asks that you look at it and try to see the changes as they happen in the hope of mitigating the inevitable downsides. New technologies involve what he called \\"Faustian bargains\\"-they give you something, but they also take something away. I have to say that I was very taken aback by the number of people here who really didn't seem to address or, frankly, understand, the main point of this fine and valuable book."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"What is going on with the world to day? If you've ever asked this question this books for you. It not only explains the theories behind the present trends, but forces us to look at what caused them. From the tool age to the technology age, Postman has put before us a look at what our culture values and why. Why do we put values on thing such as the human mind. Is the information we get from the world of technology being filtered or has it become so bad that we are no longer free thinking humans, but controled by what we're told by technology. Read this book and make up you own conclusions on the world in which we live, this Technopoly."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"A must read for all those who are genuinely interested in education, and how it's being destroyed by Technology. The process of learning is as important as what we learn. If we don't care how we acquire knowledge, we won't care how we use it, store it, or develop it."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"the message has gone unheeded for years now, and the quest to put everything on computers/electronic will prove to be a large part of the downfall of society...I am glad I bought the book, it's a real eye-opener"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"As I watch our technology-driven,consumer culture hurtle along, I am struck by the profundity of Postman's words. He was a genius. My only regret is that I didn't discover his work until he was gone."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"What a thought provoking book. The book is easy reading and very interesting. It makes you think a lot about important social, cultural, and psychological issues. Technology can be a blessing but it can also be a curse. Neil Postman explains why, in a quite sophisticated and honest way."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"The book describes a history of the impact of technology on human culture. It describes why American culture has a deep confidence in technological solutions, even if the problems are more readily solved by simple non-technological changes. Postman is consistently insightful in his disection of why we have the relationship with technology that we do. Highly recommended for anyone that works in the technology industry."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"An inspiring book that had me looking at the way that I live my life, and how dependant I am on technology. Neil Postman stresses that without understanding what it would have been like without the impressions of technology, we cannot fully understand how it is taking us [as people in general] away from our natural cultures. Explaining the possitive points of technology first, he then continues by stressing where and when technocracies took over, and offers some sugjestions on how to solve them. I recomend this for anyone that has ever questioned technology or its hidden motives."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I'm disappointed with some of the negative reviews I've read about this book. I think this is one of the most important books written this decade. Postman is not the Luddite that many make him out to be. He simply recognizes that American culture is evolving with technological advancement. New technologies do not simply add to our culture. They fundamentaly change it. Some of the changes are good, but we must realize the negative effects as well."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This book starts off on some very strong premises and is a real page turner to about the half-way point, then it becomes difficult to read, as if the author ran out of compelling ideas too early on. He then spends several chapters brazenly criticizing the major establishments of technology (medical science and computers) as irresponsible, dangerous developments in western society. But Postman does conclude with a strong final chapter that challenges the reader. Overall, I'd say it was a tough read, but compelling. Any book that challenges your assumptions and world-view is significant."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman argues that as the development of technology has progressed, our society has lost the ambiguities and subtleties--the &quot;shades of grey&quot; that make us human. Instead, doctors rely too much on tests rather than trusting their own judgement skills, students are graded primarily on test scores rather than other factors as well. Everything is binary, quantifiable, we want answers yesterday. Our lives are run by technology: we wake up to an alarm clock, our lives are centered around the public transportation schedules and the eleven o'clock news.Although Postman doesn't advocate the abandonment of technology, he does encourage us to be aware that technology is indeed running our lives. The trouble is, most of us are not even aware of the extent that it is, and we need to use technology responsibly.A very thought provoking perspective, I would say. I think anyone who has anything to do with the development of technology should read this book."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"In 2003 Neil Postman died at the age of 72; Jay Rosen, a former student of Postman, recollects that \\"he wrote with a pen, never used email, owned no computer and had no regrets about never going online. To him it was not a matter of convenience. It was about keeping an independent mind by making independent use of objects. In this way, he taught me and many others to think for ourselves, precisely because we didn't think as he did.\\" This personal recollection is, I think extremely apt for one who has been called by some part of a contemporary neo-luddite movement.As Postman notes in the book the Luddites were a social (anti-)reform movement of the early nineteenth century who, protesting against the introduction of mechanisation of particularly manufacturing industries which also resulted in a downturn in worker's rights. The protest took the form of destroying the machines that were both the means and symbol of the disfranchisement. Postman writes that \\"the term \\"Luddite\\" has come to mean an almost childish and certainly naive opposition to technology. But the historical Luddites were neither childish of naive\\" (p. 43). It is in this sense that Technopoly can be seen as a neo-luddite manifesto (albeit a more restrained academic version, there's no smashing the London Stock Exchange to bits in Postman's thesis)!Postman's central idea is that (modern) civilization has developed - one is loathe to say evolved - through three stages: the Tool-using society, the technocracy and finally, the technopoly. I must confess that I remain unsure there is that much of a difference between technocracy and technopoly but that is not the book's main advantage in any case.It is a shame that Postman did not use the Internet - indeed, since it's explosion after this book's publication I would be interested how Postman would have extended his analysis to include it, - the reason I say this is because Postman would have made an excellent blogger. The reason is linked to the title I have given to this review: \`the rage against the machine'.Technopoly is basically an extended, and I should add intelligent, rant. Early on in the book Postman suggests that \\"New technologies alter the structure of our interests: the things we think about. They alter the character of our symbols: the things we think with. And they alter the nature of community: the arena in which thoughts develop (p. 20, emphasis in original).\\"Technopoly challenges us to think about how the technocratisation of knowledge and heed Postman's call for a reinvigoration for the concept of tradition (although absent the conservative leaning I read in Postman's analysis). All in all, Technopoly is unlikely to convince one put down one's keyboard and turn off the electricity supply it will however pause to give one thought as to the sociological and philosophical implications of the often unstated assumptions the lay beneath today's technology obsessed [and possessed?] culture(s).Overall a compelling, provocative and recommended book."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Cultural critic Neil Postman goes after what he calls technolopy which is essentially a \\"self-justifying, self-perpetuating system wherein technology of every kind is cheerfully grantedsovereingty over social institutions and national life.\\"Postman is not by any means an luddite but he wants us to be aware of how technology has shaped our society,and epistemology. Often not for the better in many respects.We live in a society that does not use machines but is more and more used by them. It shapes our world view. Postman attempts to trace it's effect on us from the beginning. Overall he does a fine a job. Although a easy read many of the topics require closer scrutiny and thinking. Which is good, he wants you to think about whats happening not just accept what he has to say.In one chapter he roasts the medical industry's infatuation with new technology while the doctors neglect their patients. Patients invariably are reduced to slabs of meat on a assembly line. He makes the salient point that information is not understanding, which is usually ignored by most promoters of technopoly.Another chapter deals with 'scientism' which is science distorted into a intolerant fundamentalist belief system and its effects on our society. This chapter is his most humorous as he disects some the masters of the obvious(Dilbert like scientists who think they have discovered something profound but what most people on the street already know)Like people are afraid of death and that open minded people tend to be open minded. That's right Ph.d's have done studies to prove these notions! Perhaps a better title for this chapter would have been \\"the marching morons of science.\\"The last chapter deals on how to resist technology in our daily lives. Which he sums ups in several points(not all of them are listed in this review). Though it's not enough in my opinion, considering technolopy's corrosive influence on people and cultures throughout the world. Things need to be addressed at the nation policy level if anything is to be really changed.* who do not regard the aged as irrelevant* who admire technological ingenuity but do not think it represents the highest form of human achievement.* who are at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding.* who have freed themselves from the belief in the magical power of numbers, do not regard calculations as an adequate substitute for judgement or as synonym for truth.The book is a good starting point to informing oneself on the minuses of technology. Though dated much of his observations are still relevant and a good antidote to high tech mavens like Kelly, Moravec and their ilk. Another good book is David Ehrenfeld's \\"Beginning Again\\" written from a profession biologist POV. Or better yet, get Wendell Berry's tract \\"Life is a miracle\\" which a rather thorough disection of technolopy's epistemology and what lies beneath it's pretty public facade."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"\\"Back when men were bolder, and women were prettier, etc.\\" Every generation has probably heard various versions of this kind of \\"it's getting worse\\" story. Postman names all through this book the alternatives modern life gives us when a new technology comes along. Of course this happens. The automobile took away the chance to let neighbors chat when buggying down the dirt roads, their horses lazily nibbling the grass as the time passed. But the horse buggy took away an earlier \\"pleasure\\" at the expense of the improved technology of the buggy. All this seems very obvious, and the author uses an urbane, Time-Magazine style of prose to dance around these technology-finally-creates-Technoply talks. One wonders if the creator of fire caused the first humans to not enjoy the pleasure of shivering any more.There is truth in what the author is saying, of course, and the reader will certainly be a little more sensitized to a deflavoring of culture because of progress. Admittedly, this \\"urbane writing style\\" makes an easily-readable work, and it is a plus not having to wade through a long, strident sermon. Also, Postman gives the Left a deserved kick in the shin regarding their forgiving memory of Joseph Stalin, and their often-observed intolerance for other views.Maybe there were just too many topics to talk about in this book. An earlier work, Amusing Ourselves to Death, is much more focused, making the author's argument easier to see. Both books can be read quickly, though, and most readers will enjoy the many facts about the origins of things which Postman sprinkles through the book."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"One of Australia's leading social research organisations, Roy Morgan Research, carried out a study last year that pointed to the fact that people are increasingly unavailable. Unavailable in the sense that they are always occupied by a hand held gadget or have headphones on to shut out the sound of traffic. Billions of dollars of public money can disappear in seconds as a result of derivatives trading or poor investment. Marketers are finding newer and more invasive ways of influencing our behaviour. Little of this would be possible without the modern computer.The best and very worst of life is brought right to our door through the use of computers. Postman's main contribution is not to say that technology is good or bad but that it has chloroformed the gatekeeper. Australia, a young country like the US, is the world's leading early adopter of technology. We are also one of the world's most gullible populations, along with the US, UK and New Zealand having adopted neo conservative economics over the past 30 years. This sleepwalking, juvenile approach to politics and economics is reflective in our love of novelty. A facile individual such as Rupert Murdoch is the perfect leader for a society hooked on distraction. This is a great book. If you think it is simply anti-technology as the 1s and 2s have stated, you are missing the point.Finally, the current trend to technology and abstraction appears to be characteristic of a society dominated by left-brain thinking. This case is strongly put forward by psychoanalyst and former Oxford lecturer in English and Philosophy, Iain McGilchrist. His wonderful book, \\"The Master and His Emissary\\", proves Postman's case. I suggest reading \\"Technoopoly\\" first and then reading \\"The Master\\" to see it reflected in your own life and the lives of those you live with and care about."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This is definitely one of the most important books that I have read. The author tries to explain how some things that are taken for granted have a huge impact on our lives. The author raises some really interesting, and disturbing, questions. Science is being treated like a God (people used to argue that certain things were right because God said so, now we argue that things are right because science has proved so) and computers are being treated like human beings (a computer is \\"infected\\" by a \\"virus\\" that is \\"contagious\\" and should be \\"treated\\" or even \\"quarantined\\"). The worst thing is that humans are being stripped of their humanity. We rank people, we assign numbers to their beauty, their intelligence, and many other things. Social sciences are being treated like physics although the former is concerned with humans that have feelings, that react and that think while physics is concerned with objects. The book doesn't ask if technology is good or bad, it just asks what role technology should be confined to. Recommended for everyone."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I've long appreciated Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society and Lewis Mumford's two volume study, The Myth of the Machine. Many of the things which most concern us, much of what we tend to lament--whether in the schools or churches or environment--results from our naively enthusiastic embrace of technology during the past two centuries. Then, ignoring the past, we often want to solve today's problems without addressing their root cause--technology--because we enjoy its comforts. With Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, c. 1992), Neil Postman joins Ellul and Mumford by adding insight to the indictment of contemporary culture he initiated a decade ago with Amusing Ourselves to Death.\\"Stated in the most dramatic terms, the accusation can be made,\\" Postman writes in his Introduction, \\"that the uncontrolled growth of technology destroys the vital sources of our humanity. It creates a culture without a moral foundation. It undermines certain mental processes and social relations that make life worth living. Technology, in sum, is both friend and enemy\\" (p. xii). And that's what makes the issue so difficult, for usually friends are friends and enemies are enemies. As a friend, technology obviously makes life easier in many ways. Yet, as an enemy, it tends to sever us from those traditions which make life truly worthwhile. So while it eases our bodies it empties our hearts! The Brave New World Aldous Huxley imagined half-a-century ago seems to have actually emerged, a world controlled by a \\"Technopoly\\" which redefines what we traditionally understood \\"by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence\\" (p. 48).Postman pursues his theme through such diverse realms as medical care, computers, statistics, opinion polls and politics, education, advertising. Everywhere, he finds, the deadening hand of Technopoly, sustained by the ideology of \\"Scientism,\\" is at work destroying traditional culture. As a professor of education, Postman performs best when discussing his own province. \\"In Technopoly,\\" he says, \\"we improve the education by improving what are called \`learning technologies'\\" (p. 171). Thus the latest computers are always judged necessary, though one would be hard pressed to prove they help students read or write or think better than they did 100 years ago. Computers are purchased (while library book budgets go unfunded) because they've become an unquestioned necessity. That's because they do some things more \\"efficiently,\\" more rapidly, in more volume. Should we ask \\"what is learning for,\\" the computer compulsive can only answer in terms of means, not ends.\\"Modern secular education is failing,\\" Postman says, in a probing analysis, \\"not because it doesn't teach who Ginger Rogers, Norman Mailer, and a thousand other people are but because it has no moral, social, or intellectual center. There is no set of ideas or attitudes that permeates all parts of the curriculum. The curriculum is not, in fact, a \`course of study' at all but a meaningless hodgepodge of subjects. It does not even put forward a clear vision of what constitutes an educated person, unless it is a person who possesses \`skills.' In other words, a technocrat's ideal--a person with no commitment and no point of view but with plenty of marketable skills\\" (p. 186).This, of course, brushes aside thousands of years of philosophical reflection on the reasons, the whys of education. Plato and Cicero, Augustine and Jefferson, all knew what to aim at in educating our young. Thus they focused on great texts, which told stories, which gave learners a sense of place and history, of value and values. Our technically-oriented modern education, singularly concerned with producing functionaries for the economic mysteries, lacks such. Religious educators, especially, struggle with Technopoly. In the traditional approach, \\"learning is done for the greater glory of God and, more particularly, to prepare the young to embrace intelligently and gracefully the moral directives of the church\\" (p. 178). Such an agenda is so unlike modernity's mainstream \\"education\\" that religious educators generally ease away from traditional disciplines to join their more respected secular counterparts, reducing \\"education\\" to specialized competencies of some sort.Given Postman's doleful discussion, one wonders what then we should do! In response he concludes: \\"No one is an expert on how to live a life. I can, however, offer a Talmudic-like principle that seems to me an effective guide for those who wish to defend themselves against the worst effects of the American Technopoly. It is this: you must try to be a loving resistance fighter\\" (p. 182). To do this, he says, you must constantly remember and reflect upon the energizing symbols, re-telling the formative stories which under gird our nation. Religiously, resistance fighters \\"take the great narratives of religion seriously and do not believe that science is the only system of thought capable of producing truth\\" (p. 184). We who live by The Book should find nothing new in this, of course, for the incessant refrain of Deuteronomy, and other sections as well, is the injunction to remember. Remember who God is, remember who we are, remember what God has done for us! And don't stop telling the story!Postman's work is readable, contemporary, full of helpful illustrations and data. While Ellul and Mumford remain the best analysts of our technological society and its predicaments, Postman is more accessible and equally stimulating."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"A well reasoned assault on the modern embrace of technology for its own sake, this book delivers a somber message. Cultures without an organizing belief system tend to collapse, and our instantized consumer society is extremely good at dispensing with belief in anything beyond dollars and cents. Postman sorts history into three bins: tool users, technocracies, and technopolies. The first is self explanatory, and tool use becomes a technocracy when machines become pervasive enough to require bureaucracies to manage their use. But the goal remains the same -- improvement of the human condition. The next stage is reached when preservation and expansion of technology becomes paramount -- often at the expense of human well being. Technological change becomes valued for its own sake, regardless of the impact -- in fact, the impact is no longer weighed. A simple example: connecting every school in America to the internet is deemed good and perhaps inevitable without any proof whatever that computers or interconnection benefits students or education. (My question: If we build it, will they numb?) Postman's practical suggestion is that we re-think education goals. While admitting that schools alone cannot end technopoly, he suggests that we can create a generation of loving resistance fighters. That is, citizens who understand that history is really \\"histories,\\" reinterpreted in each age; that language matters, with particular attention to semantics; that every technology, from language to microelectronics, comes with a bias and causes effects both intended and not, both visible and hidden. Education, he insists, is not about job skills, it is about thinking. As an organizing principal Postman offers Jacob Bronowski's theme in THE ASCENT OF MAN (Little Brown & Co, 1976), the story of humanity from its origins, with all of the brilliance, pain, victory, struggle and understanding that make us who we are.
