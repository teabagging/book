One of the most celebrated British writers of his generation, Graham Greene s own story was as strange and compelling as those he told of Pinkie the Mobster, Harry Lime, or the Whisky Priest. A journalist and MI6 officer, Greene sought out the inner narratives of war and politics across the world; he witnessed the Second World War, the Vietnam War, the Mau Mau Rebellion, the rise of Fidel Castro, and the guerrilla wars of Central America. His classic novels, including The Heart of the Matter and The Quiet American, are only pieces of a career that reads like a primer on the twentieth century itself. The Unquiet Englishman braids the narratives of Greene s extraordinary life. It portrays a man who was traumatized as an adolescent and later suffered a mental illness that brought him to the point of suicide on several occasions; it tells the story of a restless traveler and unfailing advocate for human rights exploring troubled places around the world, a man who struggled to believe in God and yet found himself described as a great Catholic writer; it reveals a private life in which love almost always ended in ruin, alongside a larger story of politicians, battlefields, and spies. Above all, The Unquiet Englishman shows us a brilliant novelist mastering his craft. A work of wit, insight, and compassion, this new biography of Graham Greene, the first undertaken in a generation, responds to the many thousands of pages of letters that have recently come to light and to new memoirs by those who knew him best. It deals sensitively with questions of private life, sex, and mental illness, and sheds new light on one of the foremost modern writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ytjVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sidney's Comet","description":"For centuries the slobs that inhabit the Earth have been rocketing their refuse into the galaxy, carelessly littering the cosmos with trash.

Lee's fifth child, began her journal in December 1852 at the early age of twelve. An articulate young woman, her stated ambitions were modest: \\"The everyday life of a little school girl of twelve years is not startling,\\" she observed in April 1853; but in fact, her five-year record of a southern girl's life is lively, unpredictable, and full of interesting detail. The journal opens with a description of the Lee family life in their beloved home, Arlington. Like many military families, the Lees moved often, but Agnes and her family always thought of Arlington -- \\"with its commanding view, fine old trees, and the soft wild luxuriance of its woods\\" -- as home. When Lee was appointed the superintendent of West Point, the family reluctantly moved with him to the military academy, but wherever she happened to be, Agnes engagingly described weddings, lavish dinners, concerts, and fancy dress balls. No mere social butterfly, she also recounted hours teaching slaves (an illegal act at that time) and struggling with her conscience. Often she questioned her own spiritual worthiness; in fact, Agnes expressed herself most openly and ardently when examining her religious commitment and reflecting on death. As pious as whe was eager to improve herself, Agnes prayed that \\"He would satisfy that longing within me to do something to be something.\\" In 1855 General Lee went to Texas, while his young daughter was enrolled in the elite Virginia Female Institute in Staunton. Agnes' letters to her parents complete the picture that she has given us of herself -- an appealingly conscientious young girl who had a sense of humor, who strove to live up to her parents' expectations, and who returned fully the love so abundantly given to her. Agnes' last journal entry was made in January 1858, only three years before the Civil War began. In 1873 she died at Lexington at the young age of thirty-two. The volume continues with recollections by Mildred Lee, the youngest of the Lee children, about her sister Agnes' death and the garden at Arlington. \\"I wish I could paint that dear old garden!\\" she writes. \\"I have seen others, adorned and beautified by Kings and princes, but none ever seemed so fair to me, as the Kingdom of my childhood.\\" Growing Up in the 1850s includes an introduction by Robert Edward Lee deButts, Jr., great-great-grandson of General Lee, and a historical note about Arlington House by Mary Tyler Freeman Cheek, Director for Virginia of the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association.

At stake are the quality of care for millions of Americans and the financial well-being of individuals and employers squeezed by skyrocketing premiums-not to mention the stability of state and federal government budgets. In Redefining Health Care, internationally renowned strategy expert Michael Porter and innovation expert Elizabeth Teisberg reveal the underlying-and largely overlooked-causes of the problem, and provide a powerful prescription for change. The authors argue that participants in the health care system have competed to shift costs, accumulate bargaining power, and restrict services, rather than create value for patients. This zero-sum competition takes place at the wrong level-among health plans, networks, and hospitals-rather than where it matters most, in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific health conditions. Redefining Health Care lays out a breakthrough framework for redefining health care competition based on patient value. With specific recommendations for hospitals, doctors, health plans, employers, and policy makers, this book shows how to move to a positive-sum competition that will unleash stunning improvements in quality and efficiency.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kp5fCkAzzS8C&dq=Redefining+Health+Care:+Creating+Value-Based+Competition+on+Results&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost Art of Practicing His Presence","description":"The presence of God is meant to be more than just an occasional event during Sunday morning Worship---you are meant to live in God's presence!

You're telling me I can do the same!?  Well, no. Author Madeline Stanionis isn't claiming that. She's President of Donordigital, not Pollyanna. What she is saying is that you can raise a healthy amount ? thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars ? if you approach email fundraising with a measure of intelligence and creativity.And you've got to hand it to Stanionis. Any consultant who would give away the store as she does in this book has something grander in mind than her own self interest.And give away the store is what the author does. Generously dispensing advice, insider tips, and recommendations she usually commands tidy sums for, Stanionis reveals precisely what you need to do, step by step, to raise substantial money with email.And while it's not as simple as sending hastily written emails every week or month, neither is it unduly complicated or time-consuming.At heart, raising thousands of dollars with email is all about building your list, using timing to your advantage, crafting a series of coherent messages, presenting your email in a visually appealing way, and carefully observing your returns for clues that can guide your future efforts.That's it really. And any organization following Stanionis' trenchant advice will see immediate results.Further, there's plenty of material in the book to customize and adapt, as Stanionis offers a wealth of sample emails from diverse organizations.And taking it a step further, in the Resources section of the book, the author shows you how to identify just the help you might need (a \\"messaging vendor\\" who can send your emails, for example).Other books talk about  Internet fundraising,\\" which usually encompasses e-commerce strategies such as online shopping malls and auctions.

Throughout their poignant journey, the Dodsons humorously reminisce and reaffirm their love for each other, as the younger Dodson finds out what it means to have his father also be his best friend. Final Rounds is a book never to be forgotten, a book about fathers and sons, long-held secrets, and the lessons a middle-aged man can still learn from his dad about life, love, and family.

The author provides an extremely accessible guide to Catholic teaching, social theory and gay and lesbian theology which will enable every reader to truly appreciate the 'remarkable gift' of being gay and Catholic.' - Elizabeth Stuart, Senior Lecturer in Theology, University of Glamorgan, Wales. For generations, gays and lesbians from Catholic backgrounds have struggled to reconcile their sexual orientation with their Church's rigid anti-homosexual stance. Some leave the Church in despair while others suppress their sexuality in order to remain in the Church. Maurice Shinnick argues that homosexuality should be seen as a gift from God, rather than a curse. He shows how attitudes to homosexuality have developed in different Christian denominations around the world and offers a careful re-reading of Catholic teaching. This Remarkable Gift calls for a genuine dialogue between the Church and gay and lesbian people and offers a guide to the paths such a dialogue could follow.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QEZaBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Death of Adolf Hitler Unknown Documents from Soviet Archives","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=84FYPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Death+of+Adolf+Hitler+Unknown+Documents+from+Soviet+Archives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classics in the Classroom: Using Great Literature to Teach Writing","description":"Classics in the Classroom presents practical ways to use great literature to inspire imaginative writing by young people and others.

Gallagher s best-selling reader is now with SAGE Publishing! User-friendly without sacrificing intellectual or theoretical rigor, this popular anthology for race and ethnic relations courses introduces students to classic statements, contemporary favorites, and works by early career scholars. Rethinking the Color Line helps make sense of how race and ethnicity influence aspects of social life in ways that are often made invisible by culture, politics, and economics. The readings reflect a variety of approaches to studying race and ethnicity: a focus on specific minority groups; two or more groups in comparative perspective; and topics that look at the experience of many groups historically and within social institutions. Readers will see how they influence and in turn are influenced by race and ethnic relations.

Luther Green is a government assassin. He is employed by E-1, an agency so secret, even the President is unaware of its activities. Luther was recruited from a military academy and plunged into a world where his only purpose was to eliminate America's worst enemies. Luther's mind and body were forged into a killing machine by Alex Deavers, a legendary agent who became Luther's mentor and best friend in the agency. When his training was complete, Luther was dispatched around the globe, racking up an impressive list of successful kills. After a decade of service, Luther is a deadly weapon whose former life is a faded memory. Luther is called back to America for a special assignment. Kilmer Gray, the current Director of E-1, informs Luther that his old friend, Alex Deavers, has turned rogue agent while on assignment in Africa. Deavers has disappeared and is rumored to be insane. Luther accepts the job of terminating his old friend. Luther, and his TWA (Tech & Weapons Advisor), Marcellus Hampton, track Deavers to the U.S. Deavers proves a dangerous and elusive target leading Luther on a chase through the bowels of America's inner cities, dropping clues which signal that all is not as it seems with the mission. Alex lures them into constant danger, testing Luther's skill and loyalty at each turn. Finally, Deavers leads Luther to the latter's hometown, a place where Luther has not shown his face for over ten years. Suddenly, the game is compromised as Luther's family and old friends are targeted by the rogue agent. Luther captures Deavers, but now he cannot terminate him, not until he discovers why his old friend turned rogue and what actually happened in Africa. When Luther discovers the truth, he realizes that he was marked for death from the start and must now turn rogue agent himself or face elimination. Luther discovers a secret spanning a half century, involving billions of dollars and costing millions of innocent lives. Luther summons all of his skill and turns it against the agency which created him. In the climatic battle, Luther topples E-1, humbles a President and rediscovers the man who was turned into a killer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0mq5cqxAsQC&dq=The+Executioner%27s+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The managerial choice: To be efficient and to be human","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YEEUAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+managerial+choice:+To+be+efficient+and+to+be+human&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Chest and Shoulders: An Intense 6-Week Program (Men's Health Peak Conditioning Guides)","description":"Want a chest to treasure?

Jim Schafer and Mike Sajna take us on a trip from its mouth to its headwaters, charting the Allegheny River's history from its creation during the Ice Age to the present. Using historical records and accounts, interviews, personal experiences, and over 150 contemporary and historical photographs, Schafer and Sajna vividly portray the mighty Allegheny. The Allegheny played a key role in the French and Indian War, and after the Revolution it was the main thoroughfare for immigrants heading west to settle America from Ohio to the Northwest Territory, thus earning Pittsburgh the title \\"Gateway to West.\\" Part of the river's story includes its role in the Industrial Revolution, for it once bore the environmental scars of unrestricted industrialization. Today it has rebounded to become one of the best fisheries in the state and home to a diverse collection of flora and fauna, including several endangered species. It is also now one of the most heavily used rivers for recreation in the country. Throughout the text, Sajna weaves vignettes with the famous figures and interesting character who have encountered the river, from George Washington, John D. Rockefeller, Sr., and Andrew Carnegie, to Seneca Chief Cornplanter, John Wilkes Booth, \\"Johnny Appleseed,\\" and Rachel Carson. He also interviews contemporary people who live, work, or take inspiration from the river, including a woodcarver, a riverboat captain, and vacationers and naturalists. Through words and photographs, Schafer and Sajna depict the ever-changing face of the river.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IfdwQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Allegheny+River:+Watershed+of+the+Nation+(A+Keystone+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Candytown (Sticker Stories)","description":"In downtown Candytown, candy people drive candy cars.

This catalog accompanies an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum exploring how Studio 54 was a unique zeitgeist of an era. From the moment it opened in 1977, Studio 54 celebrated spectacle and promised a never-ending parade of anything goes. Although it existed for only three years, it served as a catalyst that brought together some of the most famous, creative, and strangest people in the world. It quickly became known for its all-ages celebrity guest list and its uniquely chic clientele of superstars and freaks of all races and sexual preferences who would often show up half-dressed or in costume. From the cutting-edge lighting displays and sound system to its elaborate sets that would change on a whim, altering the environment and ambiance, it was the beginning of nightclub as performance art. Now, the Brooklyn Museum is staging the first exhibition featuring the nightclub as a bellwether of New York City cultural life. More than 650 objects--spanning fashion, photography, drawings, film, and music--as well as video, film, and soundtrack, create an immersive experience, with an exhibition design inspired by the club's original lighting and atmosphere. Highlights include never-before-published costume sketches by artist Antonio Lopez and newly discovered set designs, as well as ephemera salvaged by the original club staff and interviews with the cultural luminaries who were there. Telling the story of this legendary club, as well as serving as a companion to the exhibition, Studio 54: Night Magic serves as a document of the era, depicting the wild energy and provocative creativity of this seminal cultural moment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8FROEAAAQBAJ&dq=54&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dishing Hollywood: The Real Scoop on Tinseltown's Most Notorious Scandals","description":"Dishing Hollywood is a delightful romp through sonic of the biggest scandals that have rocked Hollywood.

From the New York Times bestselling author of Eight Perfect Murders comes the heart-pounding story of nine strangers who receive a cryptic list with their names on it and then begin to die in highly unusual circumstances. Nine strangers receive a list with their names on it in the mail. Nothing else, just a list of names on a single sheet of paper. None of the nine people know or have ever met the others on the list.

Then, a father is shot in the back while running through his quiet neighborhood in suburban Massachusetts. A frightening pattern is emerging, but what do these nine people have in common? Their professions range from oncology nurse to aspiring actor, and they re located all over the country. So why are they all on the list, and who sent it? FBI agent Jessica Winslow, who is on the list herself, is determined to find out. Could there be some dark secret that binds them all together? Or is this the work of a murderous madman?

In Eastern Europe, the post-Communist countries are quickly adopting new criminal codes to reflect their specific national concerns as they gain autonomy from what was once a centralized Soviet policy. As commonalities among countries and states disintegrate, how are we to view the basic concepts of criminal law as a whole? Eminent legal scholar George Fletcher acknowledges that criminal law is becoming increasingly localized, with every country and state adopting their own conception of punishable behavior, determining their own definitions of offenses. Yet by taking a step back from the details and linguistic variations of the criminal codes, Fletcher is able to perceive an underlying unity among diverse systems of criminal justice. Challenging common assumptions, he discovers a unity that emerges not on the surface of statutory rules and case law but in the underlying debates that inform them. Basic Concepts of Criminal Law identifies a set of twelve distinctions that shape and guide the controversies that inevitably break out in every system of criminal justice. Devoting a chapter to each of these twelve concepts, Fletcher maps out what he considers to be the deep structure of all systems of criminal law. Understanding these distinctions will not only enable students to appreciate the universal fundamental ideas of criminal law, but will enable them to understand the significance of local details and variations. This accessible illustration of the unity of diverse systems of criminal justice will provoke and inform students and scholars of law and the philosophy of law, as well as lawyers seeking a better understanding of the law they practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tXY8DwAAQBAJ&dq=Basic+Concepts+of+Criminal+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beauty Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Smart Beauty","description":"Discover how to take beautiful care of your skin, apply makeup like a pro, and look your absolute best without spending a fortune.

Written on the boundary between art history and anthropology, it enters the domains of biography and mystery. Gauguin went to Tahiti in search of an exotic paradise. What he found was a French colony divided by race, sex, and class. Gauguin's works depict Tahitians at labor and leisure, and the fecund landscape of Polynesia; they also expose the contradictory perspective of an artist exiled both from the modern French metropolis and from the secrets of the indigenous Maohi culture. Drawing upon extensive archival and ethnographic research in France and Tahiti, Stephen Eisenman challenges interpretations of the political and gender content of the notorious artist's pictures. He compares European and Polynesian sexualities and spiritualities, and argues that many of Gauguin's most famous pictures are far more knowing than had previously been supposed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rCNqGwAACAAJ&dq=GAUGUINS+SKIRT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taprarmiuni Kassiyulriit: Stebbins Dance Festival","description":"Lucy helps her grandfather, and her entire community, recall the traditional dance festivals that they used to enjoy before the outsiders came.

Today s independent, self-sufficient lobstermen belong to the communities imbued with a European sense of ties between land and people, but threatened by the forces of homogenization spreading up the eastern seaboard. In the tradition of William Warner s Beautiful Swimmers, veteran journalist Colin Woodard (author of American Character: A History of the Epic Struggle Between Individual Liberty and the Common Good) traces the history of the rugged fishing communities that dot the coast of Maine and the prized crustacean that has long provided their livelihood. Through forgotten wars and rebellions, and with a deep tradition of resistance to interference by people  from away,  Maine s lobstermen have defended an earlier vision of America while defying the  tragedy of the commons  the notion that people always overexploit their shared property. Instead, these icons of American individualism represent a rare example of true communal values and collaboration through grit, courage, and hard-won wisdom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GKXEU7uR9i0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Turn Fear and Self-Sabotage into Confidence & Success (Personal Power!, Vol. 8)","description":"Do you stay silent because you fear rejection and judgment ?

Published in the twelfth century, Andreas Capellanus's canonical The Art of Courtly Lovehad a major impact on the culture of medieval Europeans and relates centrally to Arthurian romance, troubadour lyric, and other genres. More than just a list of rules and advice, the book has been remarkably influential in modern understandings of the Middle Ages, especially of the phenomena known as courtly love. Is it a time capsule of social laws and customs that prevailed in courts? Or was it a flight of fancy that mocked such etiquette? Debates over its nature and meaning have been unending. Its style and concerns contributed long and significantly to English literature, and for centuries its attitudes and practices reflected and may even have shaped thinking and behavior about love in Western civilization. Renowned medievalist Jan M. Ziolkowski has revised the standard translation of the work from the original Latin, maintaining its lively tone and sophisticated play with character and sentiment. He has also written a foreword highlighting the work's continued relevance and updated the bibliography with new critical sources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UBOFSQAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Courtly+Love+(Revised+Edition)+(Records+of+Western+Civilization+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After many days: Being the reminiscences of Cuthbert Fetherstonhaugh","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JysPAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America and Americans","description":"A Penguin Classic More than four decades after his death, John Steinbeck remains one of the nation's most beloved authors.

Once revered the world over, Foster s plantation songs, like  Old Folks at Home  and  My Old Kentucky Home,  fell from grace in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement due to their controversial lyrics. Foster embraced the minstrel tradition for a brief time, refining it and infusing his songs with sympathy for slaves, before abandoning the genre for respectable parlor music. The youngest child in a large family, he grew up in the shadows of a successful older brother and his president brother-in-law, James Buchanan, and walked a fine line between the family s conservative politics and his own pro-Lincoln sentiments. Foster lived most of his life just outside of industrial, smoke-filled Pittsburgh and wrote songs set in a pastoral South unsullied by the grime of industry but tarnished by the injustice of slavery. Rather than defining Foster by his now-controversial minstrel songs, JoAnne O Connell reveals a prolific composer who concealed his true feelings in his lyrics and wrote in diverse styles to satisfy the changing tastes of his generation. In a trenchant reevaluation of his NewYork Bowery years, O Connell illustrates how Foster purposely abandoned the style for which he was famous to write lighthearted songs for newly popular variety stages and music halls. In the last years of his life, Foster s new direction in songwriting stood in the vanguard of vaudeville and musical comedy to pave the way for the future of American popular music. His stylistic flexibility in the face of evolving audience preferences not only proves his versatility as a composer but also reveals important changes in the American music and publishing industries. An intimate biography of a complex, controversial, and now neglected composer, The Life and Songs of Stephen Foster is an important story about the father of American music. This invaluable portrait of the political, economic, social, racial, and gender issues of antebellum and Civil War America will appeal to history and music lovers of all generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ooc1DQAAQBAJ&dq=Songs+of+Stephen+Foster&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Protector","description":"In Father, The Family Protector, Educator James Stenson explores how fathers exercise their powerful and particularly masculine contribution to family life.

As headmaster, he made it his business to know hundreds of families intimately studying their family lives, watching their children grow into maturity, very often successfully, but sometimes not. Through countless conversations with fathers and mothers, he tried to account for the differences, looking for patterns of family life among those parents who triumphed with their children. What did these successful men and women have in common? What did they manage to do right?

This book is a study of a strangely neglected part of Evangelical history. But it is not merely, nor even especially, a historian's book - it is of general interest, absorbingly so. The reader is plunged into the child's world of the late eighteenth century, a world both surprisingly familiar and terrifyingly unknown. Their home life is examined, their schools and Sunday Schools, the sermons preached for them, the books and tracts and magazines they read, the diaries they wrote. Much of the atmosphere is death-haunted and repellent, entirely foreign to educational thought today. And yet ... the final proof of the efficacy of any system must be its fruits. Actual case-histories are considered, and conclusions attempted. The power of Evangelicalism must have vanished from the earth in a generation, had the fathers not nurtured the children, believing devoutly in their own educational abilities. Yet their many detractors have called them bigots, fanatics, fools and madmen. How fair is this judgment? And for today, how much of those first beliefs do we retain? What is our debt to those Evangelical fathers? A fascinating piece of social history is unfolded - often grim, even macabre, sometimes pathetic, occasionally gay but never, never dull.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQs8EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ranma 1/2, Vol. 10","description":"A remastered 2-in-1 edition of the all-time classic hit from one of Japan s most beloved creators, available for the first time in a format faithful to the original work.

G. Wells in 1913. Its full title is Little Wars: a game for boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books. Little Wars included fairly simple rules for infantry, cavalry, and naval artillery in the form of a toy 4.7 inch gun that launched projectiles, usually small wooden dowels to knock down enemy soldiers. In addition to its being a war game, the book hints at several philosophical aspects of war. The book is written in a whimsical style and illustrated with amusing drawings and photographs of a game being played that Wells describes in the book. Wells also gives a description of the game from the view of one of the generals in the battle bombastically relating his memoirs.

It is a classic case study of human ecology in a tribal society, the role of culture (especially ritual) in local and regional resource management, negative feedback, and the application of systems theory to an anthropological population. It is considered a major work of theory, yet it is also empirically grounded in Rappaports meticulous collection of quantitative and qualitative data on such material matters as diet and energy expenditure, as well as such mental-cognitive-ideational domains as myth and folk taxonomies. Rappaports tour de force is a recognized classic because it contributes in so many ways to anthropological theory, ethnographic methodology, ecological anthropology, and the anthropology of religion.

Patrul Rinpoche makes the technicalities of his subject accessible through a wealth of stories, quotations, and references to everyday life.

A preface by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, insightful introductory essays, explanatory notes, and classic illustrations enhance this quintessential introduction to Tibetan Buddhist practice. This new edition includes translations of a postface to the text written a century ago (for the first printed edition in Tibetan) by the first Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and a new preface by the late Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.

Indeed the authors examine, compare, and evaluate the evolution of the major rival stories comprising contemporary macroeconomic thought, but they also trace the development and interaction of key events and ideas as they occurred in the last century. Interviews with leading economists, one or two at the end of each chapter, also greatly help to shed light on this complexity. . . In sum, this is book which is very difficult to put down. Alessio Moneta, Journal of the History of Economic Thought It is not difficult to understand why this volume commands high praise from macroeconomic theorists, practitioners and teachers. It contains many interesting features that make it an excellent companion for both students and teachers of tertiary level macroeconomics. . . The authors present the material in a way that conveys to readers that macroeconomics is a living science , continually developing and still open to debate, controversy and competing policy prescriptions. In this respect it is a book that ought to be required reading for all teachers of the subject. It is also a valuable source of background reading for professional economists involved with economic policy making. Economic Outlook and Business Review . . . a wonderful history of macroeconomic thought from Keynes to the present, with an outstanding bibliography. It should be useful to undergraduates and graduate students as well as professional economists. Highly recommended. Steven Pressman, Choice Brian Snowdon and Howard Vane are well-known for their astute understanding of the main macroeconomic schools of thought and their skilled use of interviews with major figures. Here, they deploy a depth of scholarship in explaining the different schools and their key points of departure from one another. This book will be particularly useful to students looking for a clear, non-technical explanation of the main approaches to macroeconomics. Patrick Minford, Cardiff University, UK There are two steps to learning macroeconomics. First, to see it as it is today. Second, to understand how it got there: to understand the right and the wrong turns, the hypotheses that proved false, the insights that proved true, and the interaction of events and ideas. Only then, does one truly understand macroeconomics. This book is about step two. It does a marvellous job of it. The presentation is transparent, the interviews fascinating. You will enjoy, and you will learn. Olivier Blanchard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US In 40 years of teaching macroeconomics, there has been just one textbook that I have assigned year after year after year, namely, A Modern Guide to Macroeconomics by Snowdon, Vane and Wynarczyk. That altogether admirable book made clear to students what were, and are, the main intellectual issues in macroeconomics and did so with just enough formal modeling to avoid distortion by over-simplification. That book is now ten years old and the debate in macro has moved on. So there is good reason to welcome Snowdon and Vane back with this superb updated version. Axel Leijonhufvud, University of Trento, Italy This outstanding book avoids the narrow scope of most textbooks and provides an excellent guide to an unusually broad range of ideas. Thomas Mayer, University of California, Davis, US More than a decade after the publication of the critically acclaimed A Modern Guide to Macroeconomics, Brian Snowdon and Howard Vane have produced a worthy successor in the form of Modern Macroeconomics. Thoroughly extended, revised and updated, it will become the indispensable text for students and teachers of macroeconomics in the new millennium. The authors skilfully trace the origins, development and current state of modern macroeconomics from an historical perspective. They do so by thoroughly appraising the central tenets underlying the main competing schools of macroeconomic thought as well as their diverse policy imp","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z-c4AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Math - Advanced 2: Test Best Sat","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lPpGNwAACAAJ&dq=Math+-+Advanced+2:+Test+Best+Sat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Guide to Writing and Speaking Hb","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gMpAAQAAIAAJ&dq=Oxford+Guide+to+Writing+and+Speaking+Hb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonigan","description":"Collected here in one volume is James T. Farrell's renowned trilogy of the youth, early manhood, and death of Studs Lonigan: Young Lonigan, The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan, and Judgment Day. In this relentlessly naturalistic portrait, Studs starts out his life full of vigor and ambition, qualities that are crushed by the Chicago youth's limited social and economic environment. Studs's swaggering and vicious comrades, his narrow family, and his educational and religious background lead him to a life of futile dissipation. Ann Douglas provides an illuminating introductory essay to Farrell's masterpiece, one of the greatest novels of American literature.

Gone are the days of quitting by willpower alone! Using the latest findings in addiction research, Jopp explains the thought patterns that keep millions from trying to quit and details the most successful strategies for quitting.

But Darwinian selection acts on individuals, not groups, and most simple theories have shown group selection to be too slow ever to oppose individual selection successfully. In this book Michael Gilpin presents a model, based on predator-prey dynamics, wherein nonlinear effects are important, so that small advantages to the selfish individual are nonlinearly amplified into disaster for his group. The result is that group selection can be rapid and powerful. Of course many instances of apparent group selection can be explained by kin selection; in other cases, close examination reveals that seemingly altruistic behavior directly benefits the individual genotype as well as the group.

A clear formulation of a specific property or a logically consistent proof of a theorem often comes only after the mathematician has correctly \\"seen\\" what is going on. These pictures which are meant to serve as signposts leading to mathematical understanding, frequently also contain a beauty of their own. The principal aim of this book is to narrate, in an accessible and fairly visual language, about some classical and modern achievements of geometry and topology in both intrinsic mathematical problems and applications to mathematical physics. The book starts from classical notions of topology and ends with remarkable new results in Hamiltonian geometry. Fomenko lays special emphasis upon visual explanations of the problems and results and downplays the abstract logical aspects of calculations. As an example, readers can very quickly penetrate into the new theory of topological descriptions of integrable Hamiltonian differential equations. The book includes numerous graphical sheets drawn by the author, which are presented in special sections of \\"Visual material\\". These pictures illustrate the mathematical ideas and results contained in the book. Using these pictures, the reader can understand many modern mathematical ideas and methods. Although \\"Visual Geometry and Topology\\" is about mathematics, Fomenko has written and illustrated this book so that students and researchers from all the natural sciences and also artists and art students will find something of interest within its pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=55rzCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joe & Me","description":" Brilliant . . .

UPA films express a simplified audiovisual language consisting of stylized layout designs, asymmetrical compositions, colors applied flatly and in contrast with each other, limited animation and a minimalist use of sound effects. UPA artists developed this innovative style by assimilating those aesthetic features already expressed by Modern painters, graphic designers and advertisers. This book considers UPA films as Modern animations, because they synthesize a common minimalist tendency that was occurring in US animation during the 1940s and 1950s. It examines the conditions under which UPA studio flourished and the figure of its executive producer Stephen Bosustow; the influence of Modernist stylistic features of painting, graphic design and poster advertising on UPA animations; and UPA animated cartoons as case studies of a simplified audiovisual language that influenced 1950s-1960s international productions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ExJqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Listener In The Snow: The Practice And Teaching Of Poetry","description":"Mark Statman, a long time Writer-in-Residence for Teachers & Writers Collaborative, presents in this collection a series of essays and exercises on his own pedagogical approach to the elementary and college writing classroom.

The slave uprising in Haiti was a momentous contribution to the tide of revolution that swept over the Western world at the end of the 1700s. A brutal rebellion that strove to overturn a vicious system of slavery, the uprising successfully transformed Haiti from a European colony to the world s first Black republic. From the center of this horrific maelstrom, the heroic figure of Toussaint Louverturea loyal, literate slave and both a devout Catholic and Vodouisantemerges as the man who will take the merciless fires of violence and vengeance and forge a revolutionary war fueled by liberty and equality. Bell assembles a kaleidoscopic portrait of this seminal movement through a tableau of characters that encompass black, white, male, female, rich, poor, free and enslaved.

Standard bodies may wrangle and platform vendors may preach, but at the end of the day what are the technologies that are actually in use, and how can developers incorporate them into their own applications? Those are the answers Real World Web Services delivers. It's a field guide to the wild and wooly world of non-trivial deployed web services.The heart of the book is a series of projects, demonstrating the use and integration of Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, FedEx, and many more web services. Some of these vendors have been extremely successful with their web service deployments: for example, eBay processes over a billion web service requests a month!The author focuses on building 8 fully worked out example web applications that incorporate the best web services available today. The book thoroughly documents how to add functionality like automating listings for auctions, dynamically calculating shipping fees, automatically sending faxes to your suppliers, using an aggregator to pull data from multiple news and web service feeds into a single format or monitoring the latest weblog discussions and Google searches to keep web site visitors on top of topics of interest-by integrating APIs from popular websites most people are already familiar with.For each example application, the author provides a thorough overview, architecture, and full working code examples.This book doesn't engage in an intellectual debate as to the correctness of web services on a theological level. Instead, it focuses on the practical, real world usage of web services as the latest evolution in distributed computing, allowing for structured communication via Internet protocols.

Paul Farber's compelling book describes a century-old philosophical hope held by many biologists, anthropologists, psychologists, and social thinkers: that universal ethical and social imperatives are built into human nature and can be discovered through knowledge of evolutionary theory. Farber describes three upsurges of enthusiasm for evolutionary ethics. The first came in the early years of mid-nineteenth century evolutionary theories; the second in the 1920s and '30s, in the years after the cultural catastrophe of World War I; and the third arrived with the recent grand claims of sociobiology to offer a sound biological basis for a theory of human culture. Unlike many who have written on evolutionary ethics, Farber considers the responses made by philosophers over the years. He maintains that their devastating criticisms have been forgotten thus the history of evolutionary ethics is essentially one of oft-repeated philosophical mistakes. Historians, scientists, social scientists, and anyone concerned about the elusive basis of selflessness, altruism, and morality will welcome Farber's enlightening book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OfdyJRW8i4IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mercifully Brief, Real World Guide to... Raising More Money With Newsletters Than You Ever Thought Possible","description":"Today, many organizations are raising more money with their newsletter than with traditional mail appeals.And after reading Tom Ahern's riveting book, Raising More Money with Newsletters than You Ever Thought Possible, it's easy to understand why.Great newsletters, as distinguished from the mundane ones many of us receive, have so much more going for them.For starters, they deliver real news (not tired features such as \\"From the Director's Desk'' and \\"Introducing Our New Staff\\"). They make the donor feel important. They use emotional triggers to spur action. They're designed in a way to attract both browsers and readers. And they don't depend on dry statistics to make the organization's case.The essence of Raising Money with Newsletters than You Ever Thought Possible centers around seven fatal flaws, as Ahern calls them. And along the way to discussing ? and dissecting ? these flaws, the reader is treated to such chapters as:o Making news out of thin airo What a front page is foro Lower the grade level of your writingo Anecdotes versus statso How should it look? A proven formulaTransforming your newsletter into a substantial money raiser isn't all that difficult. As Ahern himself says, \\"You don?t need a degree in journalism to publish a newsletter that will keep your donors inspired (and generous). You just need a few skills and insights.\\"Read this book. Pick up those skills. And be assured that the ratio of time spent versus gains realized might well be the most cost-effective of your entire career.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WabHCl0LV9UC&dq=The+Mercifully+Brief,+Real+World+Guide+to...+Raising+More+Money+With+Newsletters+Than+You+Ever+Thought+Possible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sword Play (No Need for Tenchi!

For those watching the headlines and wondering what led the nation to this point, and what might come next, this book is a perfect place to start developing a deeper understanding. Based on decades of living and working in Syria, My House in Damascus offers an inside view of Syria s cultural and complex religious and ethnic communities. Diana Darke, a fluent Arabic speaker who moved to Damascus in 2004 after decades of regular visits, details the ways that the Assad regime, and its relationship to the people, differs from the regimes in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya and why it was thus always less likely to collapse quickly, even in the face of widespread unrest and violence. Through the author s firsthand experiences of buying and restoring a house in the old city of Damascus, which she later offered as a sanctuary to friends, Darke presents a clear picture of the realities of life on the ground and what hope there is for Syria s future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mVcrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe","description":"The text of the Broadway play, captures the last twenty years of American culture","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y75jPeHFJB4C&dq=The+Search+for+Signs+of+Intelligent+Life+in+the+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hitler","description":"Examines biographies of Adolf Hitler and their authors to reassess the reality of Hitler's life and his place in the history of the twentieth century","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oRwJs6qCMvIC&dq=Hitler&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bargen: A Woman's Weapon Paper","description":"This text presents an examination of Murasaki Shikibu's 11th-century classic The Tale of Genji.

Over the years, nearly 300 projects have evolved within the OKB. Nearly 90 reached the prototype construction stage, with more than 40 types put into series production.In the 1930s, the TB-1 (ANT-4) and TB-3 (ANT-6) bombers, the latter being the world's first heavy strategic bomber, paved the way for the long line of large multi-engined aircraft both civil and military for which the OKB is justly famed. Wartime production of the SB and Tu-2 plus the remarkable 'reverse engineering' of the Boeing B-29 that resulted in the Tu-4 led on to the jet Tu-16 and prop Tu-95 bombers. These, in turn were adapted for civil purposes as the Tu-104 and Tu-114 airliners. The supersonic Tu-22 and Tu-22M bombers and the Tu-144 airliner, a move into pilotless aircraft and a host of imaginative but unbuilt projects complete a fascinating work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PY8gAQAAIAAJ&dq=OKB+Tupolev:+A+History+of+the+Design+Bureau+and+its+Aircraft&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blind Sighted","description":"Gillian Flynn says, \\"Karin Slaughter is simply one of the best thriller writers working today.\\" A small Georgia town erupts in panic when a young college professor is found brutally mutilated in the local diner.

Stanley's discovery of this African \\"white tribe\\" haunted him and seemed to substantiate the so-called Hamitic Hypothesis: the theory that the descendants of Ham, the son of Noah, had populated Africa and other remote places, proving that the source and spread of human races around the world could be traced to and explained by a Biblical story. In The Lost White Tribe, Michael Robinson traces the rise and fall of the Hamitic Hypothesis. In addition to recounting Stanley's \\"discovery,\\" Robinson shows how it influenced encounters with the Ainu in Japan; Vilhjalmur Stefansson's tribe of \\"blond Eskimos\\" in the Arctic; and the \\"white Indians\\" of Panama. As Robinson shows, race theory stemming originally from the Bible only not only guided exploration but archeology, including Charles Mauch's discovery of the Grand Zimbabwe site in 1872, and literature, such as H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines, whose publication launched an entire literary subgenre ded icated to white tribes in remote places. The Hamitic Hypothesis would shape the theories of Carl Jung and guide psychological and anthropological notions of the primitive. The Hypothesis also formed the foundation for the European colonial system, which was premised on assumptions about racial hierarchy, at whose top were the white races, the purest and oldest of them all. It was a small step from the Hypothesis to theories of Aryan superiority, which served as the basis of the race laws in Nazi Germany and had horrific and catastrophic consequences. Though racial thinking changed profoundly after World War Two, a version of Hamitic validation of the \\"whiter\\" tribes laid the groundwork for conflict within Africa itself after decolonization, including the Rwandan genocide. Based on painstaking archival research, The Lost White Tribe is a fascinating, immersive, and wide-ranging work of synthesis, revealing the roots of racial thinking and the legacies that continue to exert their influence to this day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SK-NCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself VISUALLY Dreamweaver 4","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I8CAzQEACAAJ&dq=Teach+Yourself+VISUALLY+Dreamweaver+4&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Images and Relics: Theological Perceptions and Visual Images in Sixteenth-Century Europe (Oxford Studies in Historical Theology)","description":"Enth.: \\"Hans Holbein the Younger: The Cult of the Portrait\\" (S. 149-156).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qubuIWylVJUC&dq=Images+and+Relics:+Theological+Perceptions+and+Visual+Images+in+Sixteenth-Century+Europe+(Oxford+Studies+in+Historical+Theology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Defeating evildoers is our only option.(THE LION'S DEN): An article from: National Catholic Reporter","description":"'Breathtaking.'

Often using its residents' own words, Gerald Pocius describes in detail the continual creative encounters between past and present, between individual and community, that make up daily life in Calvert. By accepted standards of tradition, Calvert's culture is declining. Old structures are regularly torn down or renovated; antique household items are replaced with modern conveniences. Pocius argues, however, that the tangible expressions of a culture can be misleading. Calvert's essence is not in the things owned and used by its residents but in the spaces in which those things abide and in the attitudes, values, and obligations that delineate the order of those spaces. From woodlands, water, and fields to yards, gardens, and homes, Calvert's physical and social structure is governed by shared concerns about the community's livelihood and welfare. As a resident of Calvert puts it, \\"Where you're working in the same space with people you know ... it's just not practical to be falling out with everyone.\\" The sense of community that pervades Calvert is best exemplified by its annual draw for fishing berths. Because productivity varies among offshore fishing grounds, there is no private ownership of fishing rights. Rather, a lottery instituted in 1919 ensures each family the same chances for periodic access to the best fishing berths. The draw continues until all the fishing berths are awarded, but it is common for a family to opt out once they have drawn enough good berths. There are also instances of the most successful fishing operations sharing their catches. From his observations of Calvert's people at work and leisure, Pocius provides evidence to confirm the viability and durability of their culture. He reveals that standard assumptions about culture are inadequate, particularly those based on the primacy of artefacts and on sharp dichotomies between tradition and modernity. Calvert, he shows, belies our notion that declining cultural values and social segmentation are unavoidable side-effects of modernisation and a rise in material well-being. A Place to Belong will promote a constructive scepticism about the ways we perceive and interpret cultures and, most important, will remind us of what it really means to belong to a place.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h3u8Ry96OdoC&dq=A+Place+to+Belong:+Community+Order+and+Everyday+Space+in+Calvert,+Newfoundland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Gift for the King: A Persian Tale","description":"King Artaxerxes is not satisfied by any of the gifts he receives until a shepherd boy gives him a plain jar of water.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-TvDwAEACAAJ&dq=A+Gift+for+the+King:+A+Persian+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision","description":"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision begins by introducing the reader to the anatomy of the eye and visual cortex and then proceeds to discuss image and representation, face recognition, printed word recognition, visual sematic memory and visual attention and perception.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R5omxTX57wEC&dq=The+Cognitive+Neuroscience+of+Vision&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Short Stories of De Maupassant","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o8UZAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking Healthy Across America (A Healthy Exchanges Cookbook)","description":"Written for health-conscious cooks, a cookbook filled with low-fat, low-calorie food favorites includes healthful versions of pizza, lasagna, meatloaf, potato salad, cream pies, cheesecake, and much more.

Instead of ambush, skirmish, maneuver, or combat between individual heroes, the Greeks of the fifth century b.c. devised a ferocious, brief, and destructive head-on clash between armed men of all ages. In this bold, original study, Victor Davis Hanson shows how this brutal enterprise was dedicated to the same outcome as consensual government--an unequivocal, instant resolution to dispute. The Western Way of War draws from an extraordinary range of sources--Greek poetry, drama, and vase painting, as well as historical records--to describe what actually took place on the battlefield. It is the first study to explore the actual mechanics of classical Greek battle from the vantage point of the infantryman--the brutal spear-thrusting, the difficulty of fighting in heavy bronze armor which made it hard to see, hear and move, and the fear. Hanson also discusses the physical condition and age of the men, weaponry, wounds, and morale. This compelling account of what happened on the killing fields of the ancient Greeks ultimately shows that their style of armament and battle was contrived to minimize time and life lost by making the battle experience as decisive and appalling as possible. Linking this new style of fighting to the rise of constitutional government, Hanson raises new issues and questions old assumptions about the history of war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lAWEPUkz5sIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The last migration","description":"\\"An extraordinary novel... as beautiful and as wrenching as anything I've ever read\\" Emily St. John Mandel \\"An adventure of a wilder sort\\" Vogue US A dark past.

These attacks were sometimes carried out by soldiers, sometimes by angry mobs under cover of darkness. Either way, the effect was a complete dismantling of the free press. In the midst stood publisher John Hodgson, an angry bigot so hated that a local newspaper gleefully reported his defeat in a bar fight. He was also firmly against Lincoln and the war--an opinion he expressed loudly through his newspaper. When his press was destroyed, first by a mob, then by U.S. Marshals \\"upon authority of the President of the United States,\\" Hodgson decided to take on the entire United States. Thus began a trial in which one small-town publisher risked imprisonment or worse, and the future of free speech hung in the balance. Based on 10 years of original research, Lincoln's Wrath brings to life one of the most gripping, dramatic and unknown stories of U.S. history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9tOx9eYUY-YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Public Administration: Balancing Power and Accountability Second Edition","description":"An updated, thoroughly revised edition of the classic text in public administration.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tblkojb9gpIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Defense: The Heart Series (ACBL Bridge)","description":"Ultimate book for learning how to defend bridge hands.

'My Apprenticeship Vol. I.' is the second volume of fascinating work on Victorian society. Beatrice Potter Webb was born in Gloucester, England in 1858. Both her mother and brother died early in her childhood leaving her to be raised by her father, Richard Potter. He was a successful businessman with large railroad interests and many influential friends in politics and industry whose company the young Beatrice would become accustomed to. Upon reaching adulthood, Potter moved to London and helped her cousin, Charles, a social reformer, research his book The Life and Labour of the People in London. It was during this time that she was introduced to Sidney James Webb, who later became her husband and collaborator. The Webb's, together, wrote eleven volumes of work which arguably shaped the way subsequent scholars thought about sociology. They also collaborated on more than 100 books and articles on the conditions of factory workers, and the economic history of Britain, among other subjects.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t6lmCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Pay Zero Taxes (Serial)","description":"Committee Serial No. 7.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dr1o7I6WIjAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captive of Gor","description":"A woman from Earth is forced into sex slavery on the fantasy planet of Counter Earth in this Gorean Saga novel.

But what the recon team finds on Atlas sets off a chain of events that will force some hard decisions on the Marines . . . and end in a deadly surprise.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=unvS7NsU3NwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts","description":"Superb complete reproduction of 1797 edition of Edward Young's popular poem Night Thoughts, with 43 magnificent illustrations by William Blake.

Its popularity owes much to the lyricism of the prose, the pitch-perfect rendition of black vernacular English, and the memorable characters--most notably, Janie Crawford. Collecting the most widely cited and influential essays published on Hurston's classic novel over the last quarter century, this Casebook presents contesting viewpoints by Hazel Carby, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Barbara Johnson, Carla Kaplan, Daphne Lamothe, Mary Helen Washington, and Sherley Anne Williams. The volume also includes a statement Hurston submitted to a reference book on twentieth-century authors in 1942.

What makes us more susceptible to illness? Are we doomed to get sick when our coworkers and family members do? Is there a secret to staying healthy? Joel Fuhrman, M.D., a leading expert and board-certified medical specialist in prevention and reversing disease, offers a comprehensive guide to superior health. Based on the latest scientific research, Super Immunity shows us how we can become almost totally resistant to colds, influenza, and other infections. The evidence is overwhelming: we can supercharge our immune system to protect our bodies against disease everything from the common cold to cancer. Nutritional science has made phenomenal strides and discoveries in recent years, and when this new research is applied it enables us to seize control of our health like never before. Dr. Fuhrman explains this new science, providing everything you need to know to put this knowledge into action in your kitchen and in your life. What we eat has everything to do with our health, and, unfortunately, too many of us are living with a severely depleted immune function. Our dietary choices are making us sicker, shortening our lives, and costing us billions of dollars in doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications. But Dr. Fuhrman doesn t believe more medical care is the answer. Rather, he explains the solution is to change the way we eat. The standard American diet is nutrient deficient. We are eating too many highly processed foods, foods with added sweeteners, and animal fats and protein. At the same time, we are not eating enough fruits, beans, seeds, and vegetables, which leaves us lacking in hundreds of the most important immune-building compounds. By changing our diets and combining foods that contain powerful immune-strengthening capabilities, we can prevent most common modern diseases. Combining the latest data from clinical tests, nutritional research, and results from thousands of patients, Dr. Fuhrman proves that super immunity exists and is well within reach for those who choose it. We all have the ability to live healthier, stronger, and longer than ever before. Isn t it time you dis-covered super immunity?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MLPEQMWPgnAC&dq=Superimmunity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Christian Science Wartime Activites 1939-1946","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZIw1AQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Story+of+Christian+Science+Wartime+Activites+1939-1946&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charles Dickens' Complete Works","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jyMZAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men in Love : Male Homosexualities from Ganymede to Batman","description":"A Jungian psychoanalyst traces the artistic roots of eros between men, from ancient Greek times to modern times, through myths, art, poetry, and symbols, in a study that discusses such topics as the rape of Ganymede, Michelangelo's loves, and the letters between Freud and Jung.

Over the summer of 2013, the Reverend Dr. William J. Barber II led more than a hundred thousand people at rallies across North Carolina to protest restrictions to voting access and an extreme makeover of state government. These protests the largest state governmentfocused civil disobedience campaign in American history came to be known as Moral Mondays and have since blossomed in states as diverse as Florida, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Ohio, and New York. At a time when divide-and-conquer politics are exacerbating racial strife and economic inequality, Rev. Barber offers an impassioned, historically grounded argument that Moral Mondays are hard evidence of an embryonic Third Reconstruction in America. The first Reconstruction briefly flourished after Emancipation, and the second Reconstruction ushered in meaningful progress in the civil rights era. But both were met by ferocious reactionary measures that severely curtailed, and in many cases rolled back, racial and economic progress. This Third Reconstruction is a profoundly moral awakening of justice-loving people united in a fusion coalition powerful enough to reclaim the possibility of democracy even in the face of corporate-financed extremism. In this memoir of how Rev. Barber and allies as diverse as progressive Christians, union members, and immigration-rights activists came together to build a coalition, he offers a trenchant analysis of race-based inequality and a hopeful message for a nation grappling with persistent racial and economic injustice. Rev. Barber writes movingly and pragmatically about how he laid the groundwork for a state-by-state movement that unites black, white, and brown, rich and poor, employed and unemployed, gay and straight, documented and undocumented, religious and secular. Only such a diverse fusion movement, Rev. Barber argues, can heal our nation s wounds and produce public policy that is morally defensible, constitutionally consistent, and economically sane. The Third Reconstruction is both a blueprint for movement building and an inspiring call to action from the twenty-first century s most effective grassroots organizer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XyJRDQAAQBAJ&dq=This+Is+What+Can+Happen+When+We+All+Come+Together&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Crazy Occupation: Eyewitness to the Intifada","description":"When Jamie Tarabay, a young Australian journalist, was posted to Israel to report on the conflict in the Occupied Territories, her family were, understandably, somewhat concerned. Her parents had left Lebanon before war broke out in 1975 and watched as their beloved Beirut, the city they called the Paris of the Middle East, was violated by warring militias and torn apart by civil war. Her father took the family back to Lebanon in 1987 to live for three years, where they struggled with what it meant to be Christians in a Lebanon that was being overtaken by political and religious violence, before returning to Australia. And now their daughter, an Arabic-speaking Australian of Catholic Lebanese descent, was about to be plunged back into the thick of Middle Eastern politics. Wouldn't you be worried? But Jamie was unafraid, or perhaps just stunningly naive. Plunging into the vibrant life, culture and politics of the region, this memoir of her time in the Middle East is a vivid and highly readable snapshot of a life lived at the epicentre of the Arab-Israeli conflict. From the great optimism of the Camp David summit in 2000, the start of the intifada in 2001 and all that came after, Jamie was in the thick of it - Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron, suicide bombers, hard-line Jewish settlers, Palestinians living under curfew, seeing in the new millennium after Christmas in Bethlehem - all the while redefining her sense of what it means to be Australian, her morality, her heritage and her religion.

William Heth and Gordan Wenham explore the different schools of interpretation and present a fresh consideration of the various statements of Jesus and Paul, drawing on linguistic and contemporary cultural evidence. They closely criticize the view that allows remarriage after divorce on the grounds of immorality, widely held by evangelicals today. Instead the authors turn to the early Church, which permitted divorce but not remarriage. Written with clarity and careful consideration, Jesus and Divorce provides an important contribution to the ongoing debate on divorce. It offers a positive way forward, as the authors encourage us to apply the Bibles teachings to our lives and the lives of those around us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SnJMAwAAQBAJ&dq=Jesus+Teaching+on+Divorce&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Applied Calculus, 2e, Active Learning Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vqmIPQAACAAJ&dq=Applied+Calculus,+2e,+Active+Learning+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Foot Health Solution: How to Help Heel Spurs, Plantar Fasciitis, Achilles Tendon, Flat Feet, Shin Splints and Foot Pain","description":"Revolutionary book teaches how to use your foot muscles the natural way to relieve foot pain, plantar fasciitis, foot arch pain, Achilles tendon pain, heel spur pain, shin splints and other unwanted foot problems.The book, \\"A New Foot Health Solution,\\" teaches a permanent fix for many foot problems which stem from flat feet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UMwfAQAACAAJ&dq=A+New+Foot+Health+Solution:+How+to+Help+Heel+Spurs,+Plantar+Fasciitis,+Achilles+Tendon,+Flat+Feet,+Shin+Splints+and+Foot+Pain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Scot's Dialect Dictionary: Comprising the Words in Use from the Latter Part of the Seventeenth Century to the Present Day","description":"Excerpt from A Scots Dialect Dictionary: Comprising the Words in Use From the Latter Part of the Seventeenth Century to the Present Day The Introduction and the Dialect Map by Mr Grant I owe to the zeal for the Scottish vernacular shown by him as Convener of the Scottish branch of the English Association. His professional knowledge and experience as Lecturer in Phonetics to the Aberdeen Provincial Committee for the Training of Teachers render him exceptionally fitted to deal with the subjects handled in the Introduc tion and to draw the map showing the distribution of the dialects. These subjects are in brief as follows (i) A short history of Scottish, showing its original identity with Northern English; its use as a literary language down to about 1600; its decline during the seventeenth century; and the revival of a vernacular literature about 1700. (2) The separation into dialects; the distribution of these so far as at present known; their leading characteristics; and the extent to which they have been used in literature. (3) The pronunciation of Scottish, with special reference to the literary forms and the usual spelling. (4) The present state of studies in Scottish and the efforts to record the existing dialects. I have also received from Mr Grant two large lists of words, which have been incorporated in the Appendix as far as was needful. The readiness with which Mr Grant undertook to comply with my request that he should write the Introduction on these lines, and his accomplishment of his voluntary contribution to the usefulness of this book, lay me and - may I say - all who use this book, under very great obligation. I trust that its publication may help to further the purpose to which he is devoting so much energy - the purpose of ultimately gathering all available material over Scotland for a thoroughly scientific Dictionary comprehending all Scottish, Early, Middle, and Modern, so far as this is possible. Further contributions of words not found in this or any other Dialect Dictionary will be gratefully welcomed if sent to Mr Grant or to myself. All such words should be vouched for by the senders, with the exact meaning, the locality in which they are used, and an indication of the pronunciation.

In the last three years, Engineering Failure Analysis has continued to build on its early success as an essential medium for the publication of failure analysis cases studies and papers on the structure, properties and behaviour of engineering materials as applied to real problems in structures, components and design. Failure Analysis Case Studies II comprises 40 case studies describing the analysis of real engineering failures which have been selected from volumes 4, 5 and 6 of Engineering Failure Analysis. The case studies have been arranged in sections according to the specific type of failure mechanism involved. The failure mechanisms covered are overload, creep, brittle fracture, fatigue, environmental attack, environmentally assisted cracking and bearing failures. The book constitutes a reference set of real failure investigations which should be useful to professionals and students in most branches of engineering.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S8dHlsKDlAAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Age of Camelot: Catacombs (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","description":"Light for a Dark Age! ?

From Whyte s earliest paintings in rural Ohio and Pennsylvania, to the riveting portraits of her southern neighbors, historian Martha R. Severens provides us with an intimate look into the artist s private world. With more than two hundred full-color images of Whyte s paintings and sketches, as well as comparison works by masters such as Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth, and John Singer Sargent, Severens clearly illustrates how Whyte s art has been shaped and how the artist forged her own place in the world today. Though Whyte s academic training in Philadelphia was in oil painting, she learned the art of watercolor on her own by studying masterworks in museums. Today Whyte s style of watercolor painting is a unique blend of classical realism and contemporary vision, as seen in her intimate portraits of Southern blue-collar workers and elderly African American women in the South Carolina lowcountry.  For me ideas are more plentiful than the hours to paint them, and I worry that I cannot get to all of my thoughts before they are forgotten or are pushed aside by more pressing concerns,  explains Whyte.  Some works take time to evolve. Like small seeds the paintings might not come to fruition until several years later, after there has been ample time for germination.  Using broad sweeping washes as well as miniscule brushstrokes, Whyte directs the viewer s attention to the areas in her paintings she deems most important. Murky passages of neutral colors often give way to areas of intense detail and color, giving the works a variety of edges and poetic focus. Several paintings included in the book are accompanied by enlarged areas of detail, showcasing Whyte s technical mastery. More Than a Likeness is replete with engaging artwork and inspiring text that mark the mid-point in Whyte s artistry. Of what she will paint in the future, the artist says,  I have always believed that as artists we don t choose our vocation, style, or subject matter. Art chooses us.

The first is wellstone, a form of programmable matter capable of emulating almost any substance: natural, artificial, even hypothetical. The second is collapsium, a deadly crystal composed of miniature black holes, vital for the transmission of information and matter including humans throughout the solar system. The third is the bitter rivalry between Her Majesty's top scientists. Bruno de Towaji, famed lover and statesman, dreams of building an arc de fin, an almost mythical device capable of probing the farthest reaches of spacetime. Marlon Sykes, de Towaji's rival in both love and science, is meanwhile hard at work on a vast telecommunications project whose first step is the construction of a ring of collapsium around the sun. But when a ruthless saboteur attacks the Ring Collapsiter and sends it falling into the sun, the two scientists must put aside personal animosity and combine their prodigious intellects to prevent the destruction of the solar system . . . and every living thing within it.

The Pastons were members of the English gentry a tiny group of roughly 1,000 households sandwiched between the ruling nobility and the peasants, and a rough analog for the contemporary  middle class.  Their existence was fairly typical, but for the fact that it was recorded in an extraordinary collection of nearly 1,000 letters which have survived to this day. Through these letters, which cover the years from 1421 to 1484, and the lives of three generations of Pastons, bestselling historians Frances and Joseph Gies provide a rare window into the day-to-day life of this family, and the broader political and social goings-on of medieval England. A Medieval Family first tells the story of Judge William Paston (1378-1444), the patriarch of the family, a lawyer and judge who bought up land in Norfolk and left his son a sizeable estate, which was later forcibly seized by a neighboring baron. We then follow the family through its ups and downs over several generations, learning of their feuds with neighbors, the frequent instability of 15th century England, and significant historical events, such as the Siege of Caister and the Battle of Barnet. There are also many letters of more personal significance, including a series of Valentines sent to John Paston III. The work of acclaimed historians Frances and Joseph Gies has been used by George R.R. Martin in his research for Game of Thrones. In A Medieval Family, they have woven a compelling intergenerational saga that is essential reading for anyone seeking insight into the medieval period.  The Gieses, who specialize in making the Middle Ages accessible to nonspecialists, have done a wonderful job of linking and amplifying the Pastons  words.

With one or two exceptions, she brought every piece she worked on to some final form acceptable to her, rejecting at most the odd verse, or a false head or a false tail. Her attitude to her verse was artisan-like: if she couldn t get a table out of the material, she was quite happy to get a chair, or even a toy.

With the help of a personal trainer, she figures she'll be back to her fighting weight in time for Christmas. But when three months of candle-scented sex fails to produce the desired result, Emma decides that maybe Mother Nature needs a helping hand. Soon her life is a roller coaster of post-coital handstands (you can't argue with gravity), hormone-inducing (sanity-reducing!) drugs, and a veritable army of probing specialists (torturers, more like). It's out with alcohol and spontaneous sex, in with green tea and ovulation kits. Emma and James try everything from fertility drugs to in vitro, but all their carefully laid plans seem to go south -- along with Emma's rapidly plummeting self-esteem. The members of her support team are unquestionably loyal, but distracted by their own personal dramas. There's Babs, her younger sister, who prescribes Emma half an Ecstasy pill to treat her depression. Her friend Jess is pregnant with her second child and gives Emma an earful about the downside of motherhood. The glamorous Lucy, Emma's closest pal, fears she might be stuck in her \\"single rut\\" forever -- that is, until she meets Donal, a rough-around-the-edges rugby player who passes out on their first date but quickly proves that he is worth a second chance. And last, but certainly not least, is James, Emma's rugby coach husband, who quite unhelpfully manages to give himself a groin injury just when she is ovulating. But just when Emma feels as if her obsession may have alienated all of her loved ones, including James, events take a ninety-degree turn that will have unforeseen consequences for everyone.

What happened in 1983 to make the Soviet Union so afraid of a potential nuclear strike from the United States that they sent mobile ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) into the field, placing them on a three-minute alert Marc Ambinder explains the anxious period between the United States and the Soviet Union from 1982 to 1984, with the  Able Archer  83  war game at the center of the tension. With astonishing and clarifying new details, he recounts the scary series of the close encounters that tested the limits of ordinary humans and powerful leaders alike. Ambinder provides a comprehensive and chilling account of the nuclear command and control process, from intelligence warnings to the composition of the nuclear codes themselves. And he affords glimpses into the secret world of a preemptive electronic attack that scared the Soviet Union into action. Ambinder s account reads like a thriller, recounting the spy-versus-spy games that kept both countries and the world in check. From geopolitics in Moscow and Washington, to sweat-caked soldiers fighting in the trenches of the Cold War, to high-stakes war games across NATO and the Warsaw Pact,  Ambinder s account of a serious threat of global annihilation is spellbinding a masterpiece of recent history  (Publishers Weekly, starred review). The Brink serves as the definitive intelligence, nuclear, and national security history of one of the most precarious times in recent memory and  shows the consequences of nuclear buildups, sometimes-careless language, and nervous leaders. Now, more than ever, those consequences matter  (USA TODAY).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=myegDwAAQBAJ&dq=THE+BRINK&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"M.

By linking blockbuster Hollywood films of the 1980s to Ronald Reagan and his image, Susan Jeffords explores the links between masculinity and U.S. identity and how their images changed during that decade. Her book powerfully defines a distinctly ideological period in the renegotiation of masculinity in the post-Vietnam era. As Jeffords perceptively notes, Reagan was most effective at constructing and promoting his own image. His election in 1980 and his landslide re-election in 1984 offered politicians and the film industry some insight into \\"what audiences want to see.\\" Audiences--and constituencies--were looking for characters who stood up for individualism, liberty, anti-governmentalism, militarism, and who embodied a kind of mythic heroism. The administration in Washington and Hollywood filmmakers sensed and tried to fill that need. Jeffords describes how movies meshed inextricably with Reagan's life as he cast himself as a hero and influenced the country to believe the same script. Invoking Clint Eastwood in his speeches and treating scenes from movies as if they were real, Reagan played on his image in order to link popular and national narratives. Hollywood returned the compliment. Through her illuminating and detailed analyses of both the Reagan presidency and many blockbuster movies, Jeffords provides a scenario within which the successes of the New Right and the Reagan presidency can begin to be understood: she both encourages an understanding of how this complicity functioned and provides a framework within which to respond to the New Right's methods and arguments. Rambo, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Robocop, Back to the Future, Star Wars, the Indiana Jones series, Mississippi Burning, Rain Man, Batman, and Unforgiven are among the films she discusses. In her closing chapter, she suggests the direction that masculinity is taking in the 1990s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7nERHha7TZUC&dq=Hard+Bodies:+Hollywood+Masculinity+in+the+Reagan+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strategic Management in Public and Nonprofit Organizations: Managing Public Concerns in an Era of Limits Second Edition","description":"A new edition of this acclaimed examination of the problems faced by those applying strategic management ideas to nonprofit organizations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PdoSBPvcyRcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ellie the Adventurous Elephant (Jungle Friends Build & Play Storybooks)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bible Symbols Decoded: An Historicist View of Daniel and Revelation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BGV9AAAACAAJ&dq=Bible+Symbols+Decoded:+An+Historicist+View+of+Daniel+and+Revelation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE PRAGMATIC REVOLT IN AMERICAN HISTORY: CARL BECKER AND CHARLES BEARD","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ss5KAAAAYAAJ&dq=THE+PRAGMATIC+REVOLT+IN+AMERICAN+HISTORY:+CARL+BECKER+AND+CHARLES+BEARD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BABY'S TROPICAL ISLAND - by SWIM WAYS","description":"This open access book, written by world experts in aquaponics and related technologies, provides the authoritative and comprehensive overview of the key aquaculture and hydroponic and other integrated systems, socio-economic and environmental aspects.

The authors make comparisons of female and male sexual activities and investigate the factors which account for the similarities and differences between female and male patterns of behavior and provide some measure of the social significance of the various types of sexual behavior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JHWHCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Compleat Traveller in Black (Collier Nucleus Science Fiction)","description":"An extensive fantasy novel about the mysterious Traveller, who is burdened with fighting chaos wherever he encounters it in the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PiYsGoETnXgC&dq=The+Compleat+Traveller+in+Black+(Collier+Nucleus+Science+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miracle in the Hills","description":"Dr. Sloop and her husband began their lifelong dedication to the mountain people when they rode horseback into the remote hill region of North Carolina in 1909. The conditions they encountered were shockingly primitive. The people had neither doctors, nor schools and were suspicious of medicine and \\"larnin .\\" Electricity and running water were unheard of, roads were rough mountain paths and the diet consisted of \\"hog meat, greens and grease.\\" The main industry was moon shining. Dr. Sloop declared a personal war on moonshiners, tracking down hidden still with a reluctant sheriff in tow. She fought against child marriages and in a region where girls often married at the age of fourteen. With the help of the mountain people, she reinvigorated the weaving trade, built a church and a modern well equipped hospital. Her spirited support of education resulted in a modern twenty-five-building school.

Bruce Ackerman and Ian Ayres build on the example of the secret ballot and propose a system of  secret donation booths  for campaign contributions. They unveil a plan in which the government provides each voter with a special credit card account containing fifty  Patriot dollars  for presidential elections. To use this money, citizens go to their local ATM machine and anonymously send their Patriot dollars to their favorite candidates or political organizations. Americans are free to make additional contributions, but they must also give these gifts anonymously. Because candidates cannot identify who provided the funds, it will be much harder for big contributors to buy political influence. And the need for politicians to compete for the Patriot dollars will give much more power to the people. Ackerman and Ayres work out the operating details of their plan, anticipate problems, design safeguards, suggest overseers, and show how their proposals satisfy the most stringent constitutional requirements. They conclude with a model statute that could serve as the basis of a serious congressional effort to restore Americans  faith in democratic politics./DIV/DIV","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GbL3mENyZ_0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endymion Omnibus","description":"The triumphant concluding novels to the Hyperion Quartet, together in one volume for the first time.

As the couple settles in, the old problems that permeate their marriage--his unhealthy behaviors, her indiscretions--start bubbling to the surface. But while they attempt to mend their relationship, their neighbor, an intense young woman, is showing a little too much interest in their activities. Meanwhile, Caroline slowly begins to uncover some signs of life in the stark house--signs of her life.

Garr the extent to which they have been deprived of the Hebrew heritage of their Christian faith. For the past nineteen centuries, millions of believers have been denied their biblical legacy, the riches of the Hebrew foundations of their faith. Christian Judaeophobia, anti-Judaism, and Antisemitism have conspired to rob them of the treasures of their inheritance. Our Lost Legacy presents selected essays and lectures in which Dr. Garr urges the church to recover its Hebrew heritage, its connection with the Jewish matrix from which it was birthed. These pages call Christians back to the Bible, to the roots of faith that enrich lives and equip believers to achieve greater maturity through a more complete knowledge of Jesus, our Jewish Lord. Our Lost Legacy presents these vivid images of Christianity's heritage in the Hebrew faith: Biblical Judaism: The Root of Christianity; Hold to God';s Unchanging Hand; Christ, Our Righteousness; Jewish Jesus or Cosmic Christ?; The Secret to Fulfilling the Law. As you read this volume, you'll simply be amazed at just how Jewish Christianity really is!

Eventually he left his life in science to study with Tibetan teachers, and he is now a Buddhist monk and translator for the Dalai Lama, living in the Shechen monastery near Kathmandu in Nepal. Trinh Thuan was born into a Buddhist family in Vietnam but became intrigued by the explosion of discoveries in astronomy during the 1960s. He made his way to the prestigious California Institute of Technology to study with some of the biggest names in the field and is now an acclaimed astrophysicist and specialist on how the galaxies formed. When Matthieu Ricard and Trinh Thuan met at an academic conference in the summer of 1997, they began discussing the many remarkable connections between the teachings of Buddhism and the findings of recent science. That conversation grew into an astonishing correspondence exploring a series of fascinating questions. Did the universe have a beginning? Or is our universe one in a series of infinite universes with no end and no beginning? Is the concept of a beginning of time fundamentally flawed? Might our perception of time in fact be an illusion, a phenomenon created in our brains that has no ultimate reality? Is the stunning fine-tuning of the universe, which has produced just the right conditions for life to evolve, a sign that a  principle of creation  is at work in our world? If such a principle of creation undergirds the workings of the universe, what does that tell us about whether or not there is a divine Creator? How does the radical interpretation of reality offered by quantum physics conform to and yet differ from the Buddhist conception of reality? What is consciousness and how did it evolve? Can consciousness exist apart from a brain generating it? The stimulating journey of discovery the authors traveled in their discussions is re-created beautifully in The Quantum and the Lotus, written in the style of a lively dialogue between friends. Both the fundamental teachings of Buddhism and the discoveries of contemporary science are introduced with great clarity, and the reader will be profoundly impressed by the many correspondences between the two streams of thought and revelation. Through the course of their dialogue, the authors reach a remarkable meeting of minds, ultimately offering a vital new understanding of the many ways in which science and Buddhism confirm and complement each other and of the ways in which, as Matthieu Ricard writes,  knowledge of our spirits and knowledge of the world are mutually enlightening and empowering.

The instructions were simple, but the results were extraordinary. \\"You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project. Your secret can be a regret, fear, betrayal, desire, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything -- as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before. Be brief. Be legible. Be creative.\\" It all began with an idea Frank Warren had for a community art project. He began handing out postcards to strangers and leaving them in public places -- asking people to write down a secret they had never told anyone and mail it to him, anonymously. The response was overwhelming. The secrets were both provocative and profound, and the cards themselves were works of art -- carefully and creatively constructed by hand. Addictively compelling, the cards reveal our deepest fears, desires, regrets, and obsessions. Frank calls them \\"graphic haiku,\\" beautiful, elegant, and small in structure but powerfully emotional. As Frank began posting the cards on his website, PostSecret took on a life of its own, becoming much more than a simple art project.

It probably did not occur to him that he was embarking on a mission that would forever enshrine his name, and that of the Arsenal, in the annals of Civil War history. In words and images, St. Louis Arsenal: Armory of the West relates in detail the story of the Arsenal, from its founding in 1827 through its transition to cavalry post in 1872, then traces its new life and changing fortunes as the installation adapted its mission to meet the ever changing needs of the federal government. Such personalities as William Beaumont, Ulysses S. Grant, William Sherman, Robert E. Lee, Nathaniel Lyon, Daniel Frost, and many others who would claim a place in American military history once served at, or had dealings with, the St. Louis Arsenal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hiKdvZsiTpwC&dq=St.+Louis+Arsenal:+Armory+of+the+West+(MO)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Satan, Satanism, and Witchcraft","description":"\\"Imagine the scene,-a wide heath, often in the neighbourhood of an old Celtic dolmen, at the edge of a wood . . .

When these cars were new, other types of body by many different coachbuilders - saloons, limousines, fixed-head coupes, landaulets, cabriolets, drophead coupes, sedancas de ville - outnumbered the tourers and sports models. Sadly, these were the bodies which were the first to be scrapped, even though their chassis were often saved. This book uses over 200 contemporary black-and-white illustrations and some 50 specially-shot color photographs to tell the story of Bentley coachwork during the 1920s, and up to 1931 when the company went into receivership. Each of the three classes of coachwork - saloons and limousines, drophead coupes, and tourers - is traced as it evolved through that exciting decade.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4zRBAAAACAAJ&dq=Coachwork+on+Vintage+Bentleys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret at the Breakers Hotel: A Palm Beach Mystery","description":"SOCIAL CLIMBING CAN BE MURDER, DARLING Heiress Wally Tupper is bored to tears with parties, gossip, and the dull life of Florida's filthy rich.

A human (according to some) who had lived about the time of Moses, but now indisputably a god, he was credited with the authorship of numerous books on magic and the supernatural, alchemy, astrology, theology, and philosophy. Until the early seventeenth century, few doubted the attribution. Even when unmasked, Hermes remained a byword for the arcane. Historians of ancient philosophy have puzzled much over the origins of his mystical teachings; but this is the first investigation of the Hermetic milieu by a social historian. Starting from the complex fusions and tensions that molded Graeco-Egyptian culture, and in particular Hermetism, during the centuries after Alexander, Garth Fowden goes on to argue that the technical and philosophical Hermetica, apparently so different, might be seen as aspects of a single \\"way of Hermes.\\" This assumption that philosophy and religion, even cult, bring one eventually to the same goal was typically late antique, and guaranteed the Hermetica a far-flung readership, even among Christians. The focus and conclusion of this study is an assault on the problem of the social milieu of Hermetism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5-JKsMTEUaQC&dq=The+Egyptian+Hermes:+A+Historical+Approach+to+the+Late+Pagan+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notre Dame de Paris","description":"The gypsy street dancer Esmeralda captures the hearts of many men, including those of Captain Phoebus and Pierre Gringoire, but especially Quasimodo and his guardian Archdeacon Claude Frollo.

Lou Gehrig was a baseball legend the Iron Horse, the stoic New York Yankee who was the greatest first baseman in history, a man whose consecutive-games streak was ended by a horrible disease that now bears his name. But as this definitive new biography makes clear, Gehrig s life was more complicated and, perhaps, even more heroic than anyone really knew. Drawing on new interviews and more than two hundred pages of previously unpublished letters to and from Gehrig, Luckiest Man gives us an intimate portrait of the man who became an American hero: his life as a shy and awkward youth growing up in New York City, his unlikely friendship with Babe Ruth (a friendship that allegedly ended over rumors that Ruth had had an affair with Gehrig s wife), and his stellar career with the Yankees, where his consecutive-games streak stood for more than half a century. What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged. Later, aware that he was dying, Gehrig exhibited a perseverance that was truly inspiring; he lived the last two years of his short life with the same grace and dignity with which he gave his now-famous  luckiest man  speech. Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Jonathan Eig s Luckiest Man shows us one of the greatest baseball players of all time as we ve never seen him before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cSA7UvX_7T0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motorcycles, Sidecars and Cyclecars: Construction, Management, Repair- A Comprehensive, Non-technical Treatise, Defining All Forms of the Lighter, ... and Repair of All Representative Types","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HgofAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"South By Java Head","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mab_zQEACAAJ&dq=South+By+Java+Head&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three-Quarters of a Footprint","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BlRmPgAACAAJ&dq=Three-Quarters+of+a+Footprint&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mates, Dates Boxed Set One: Mates, Dates, and Inflatable Bras; Mates, Dates, and Cosmic Kisses; Mates, Dates, and Designer Divas; Mates, Dates, and Sleepover Secrets","description":"Lucy feels like everything is changing around her, and suddenly she is required to make all sorts of decisions.

It is a classic study of an American business aristocracy of colonial stock with Protestant affiliations as well as an analysis of how fabulously wealthy nineteenth-century family founders in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, supported various exclusive institutions that in the course of the twentieth century produced a national upper-class way of life. But as that way of life became an end of itself, instead of an effort to consolidate power and control, the upper-class outlived its function; this, argues Baltzell, is precisely what took place in the Philadelphia class system. Philadelphia Gentlemen emphasizes that class is largely a matter of family, whereas an elite is largely a matter of individual achievement. The emphasis in Philadelphia on old classes, in contrast to the emphasis in New York and Boston on individual achievement and elite striving, helps to explain the dramatically different outcomes of ruling class domination in major centers of the Eastern Establishment. In emphasizing class membership or family prestige, the dynamics of industrial and urban life passed by rather than through Philadelphia. As a result in the race for urban preeminence, Philadelphia lost precious time and eventually lost the struggle for ruling preeminence as such. When the book initially appeared, it was hailed by The New York Times as  a very, very important book.  Writing in the pages of the American Sociological Review, Seymour Martin Lipset noted that  Philadelphia Gentlemen says important things about class and power in America, and says them in ways that will interest and fascinate both sociologists and laymen.  And in the American Historical Review, Baltzell s book was identified simply as  a gold mine of information.  In short, for sociologists, historians, and those concerned with issues of culture and the economy, this is indeed a classic of modern social science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B1QAMx2idG0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miniature Chess Problems from Many Countries: 400 Compositions with Solutions and Comments","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ISxAAAAACAAJ&dq=Miniature+Chess+Problems+from+Many+Countries:+400+Compositions+with+Solutions+and+Comments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder at the Brian Boru","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a3M5PQAACAAJ&dq=Murder+at+the+Brian+Boru&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Midwife's Apprentice: A Unit Plan (Litplans on CD)","description":"LitPlan Teacher Packs have a foundation of materials for teaching works of literature.

But, true to his aim of setting in motion a two-way process between depth psychology and politics, he also lays bare the hidden politics of the father, the male body, and of men's issues generally. A special feature of the book is an international survey into what analysts and psychotherapists do when their patients/clients bring overtly political material into the clinical setting. The results, including what the respondents reveal about their own political attitudes, destabilize any preconceived notions about the political sensitivity of analysis and psychotherapy.

Samuel Milner provides a historical context for contemporary efforts to resolve these anxieties by examining the contest to control the distribution of corporate income during the mid?twentieth century. During this  Golden Age of American Capitalism,  apprehension about the debilitating consequences of industrial concentration fueled efforts to ensure that management would share the fruits of progress with workers, consumers, and society as a whole.

In addition, Dych attempts to connect Rahner's main theological teachings with those of Vatican II and with the teachings found in the Exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola.

From his attack of the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Virginia, in October 1859, as part of a scheme to free the slaves, Brown has been called a saint and sinner, rogue and redeemer, martyr and madman. Brown rebelled against the American government, and he murdered men in Kansas in order to end the murderous institution of slavery. He denounced war, but made war on his government in order to end an existing war for slavery. This anthology, which presents Brown's writing and diverse responses to his life and raid, offers a lens through which to analyze these tensions and contradictions.

On the horizon looms the specter of human cloning and genetic engineering, raising a storm of new moral and ethical questions. These questions, asserts the author, are not the only ones to be considered; the impact and role of public policy are equally critical. What part should the state play in human genetic intervention? To what extent does a democratic society have the duty to take steps to reduce genetic disease and improve the quality of life through genetic engineering? If society has such responsibility, at what stage does societal good preempt individual rights? What is society's obligation toward future generations and is genetic manipulation justifiable on these grounds? After surveying the state of the art, the author grapples with these questions, contending that decisions ultimately will not be based on ethical and moral grounds they will be fought out in the political arena.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7EyfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grammar of Conducting: A Practical Guide to Baton Technique and Orchestral Interpretation","description":"In the \\"conductor's bible,\\" Rudolf \\"proposes a course of baton training that allows the student to progress from simple to more exacting assignments, always applying baton technique to carefully chosen musical examples.\\"--Inside cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wWEJAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Grammar+of+Conducting:+A+Practical+Guide+to+Baton+Technique+and+Orchestral+Interpretation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Falling and Other Student Essays","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kR7iPAAACAAJ&dq=Free+Falling+and+Other+Student+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","description":"Davis' 14th novel in the Marcus Didius Falco series is a noir tale of gangsters, gladiators, and love.

The New York Book Review even claims her as 'the representative twentieth century woman'. Certainly her letters are now read as key modernist documents, as valuable and as finely written as her stories. Selections from her letters more than fifty years ago were aninspiration to de Beauvoir and Camus. They are now, in their full edition, prized by ordinary readers as much as by feminists and literary critics. The letters from Mansfield'slast year, following her worsening illness and the inevitability of its conclusion, become a harrowing but deeply admirable demonstration of courage, wit, independence, and an intense drive towards total honesty. As Hilary Spurling summed up an earlier volume, 'The narrowness of the sickroom did not so much contract as enlarge Mansfield's inner world. As her body lowered her defences, so in a sense did her imagination.' This is perhaps as close as we might get to a record a woman attempting tothink clearly, warmly, busily, until virtually the last breath.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gMkTDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+letters+of+Katherine+Mansfield&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","description":"A memoir of hope for the thousands of women struggling with infertility, from one who beat the odds by simply tuning in to her body and tapping her well of sheer determination. At a time when more and more women are trying to get pregnant at increasingly advanced ages, fertility specialists and homeopathic researchers boast endless treatment options. But when Julia Indichova made the rounds of medical doctors and nontraditional healers, she was still unable to conceive a child. It was only when she forsook their financially and emotionally draining advice, turning inward instead, that she finally met with reproductive success. Inconceivable recounts this journey from hopeless diagnoses to elated motherhood. Anyone who has faced infertility will relate to Julia s desperate measures: acupuncture, unidentifiable black-and-white pellets, herb soup, foul-smelling fruit, even making love on red sheets. Five reproductive endocrinologists told her that there was no documented case of anyone in her hormonal condition getting pregnant, forcing her to finally embark on her own intuitive regimen. After eight caffeine-free, nutrient-rich, yoga-laden months, complemented by visualization exercises, Julia received amazing news; incredibly, she was pregnant. Nine months later she gave birth to a healthy girl. Unlike the many infertility books that take a clinical  how to  approach, Inconceivable simply professes the wisdom of giving expert status back to the patient. Julia s self-discovery, and her ability to see her body as an ally once again, yield a beautiful message about the importance of honoring the body s innate powers, and the power of life itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U-AiTw6RvhsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No More Victims","description":"It happens every day.

Longer training, ever more advanced technologies-neither seems to prevent grievous errors. But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist. First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery, a simple ninety-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third. In riveting stories, Gawande takes us from Austria, where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater, to Michigan, where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements. And he follows the checklist revolution into fields well beyond medicine, from disaster response to investment banking, skyscraper construction, and businesses of all kinds. An intellectual adventure in which lives are lost and saved and one simple idea makes a tremendous difference.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9T3yxD8UhKoC&dq=New+Marketing+Manifesto+Hb&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Storm","description":"It is a day in the country, and everthing is hot and still.

In most cases, the amendments made by a codicil are relatively minor. For example, they may seek to appoint new executors, make new gifts or release people from debts. However, in other cases, the amendments can completely change the nature of the will - such as where you change the identity of the person who will receive the residue of your estate. Codicils are fairly simple to complete and use. In most cases, they simply refer to the existing clause of the will that needs to be amended and specify details of the amendment that is required. Once the codicil is completed, it needs to be signed and witnessed in accordance with the same strict legal requirements that applied to the execution of the original will. This self-help legal kit includes step-by-step instructions, detailed information and all the legal forms necessary to prepare your own codicil without the need or expense of engaging a lawyer. It also includes various examples of the changes that you might wish to make to your will.

Village communities, cultic groups, brotherhoods, sacerdotal families, philosophical schools, and other organizations are studied collectively under Aristotle's umbrella concept of \\"community,\\" or koinonia. All such \\"communities,\\" argues Jones, acquired their distinctive characteristics in response to certain key features of the contemporary democratic governmentegalitarian ideology, direct rule, minority citizen participation, and the statutory exclusion of non-citizens. Thus elite social clubs provided a haven for beleaguered aristocrats; the phylai, often referred to as \\"tribes,\\" evolved a mechanism for representing their special interests before the city government; an alternative territorially defined village afforded an associational life for the disfranchised; and in various groups we witness the beginnings of the inclusion of women, foreigners, and even slaves. No association, it turns out, can be fully understood except in terms of its relation to the central government. Some confirmation of the model is elicited from the design of the Cretan City in Plato's Laws, a utopian policy arguably reflecting the arrangements of the author's own Athens. Jones's book closes with a classification of the various associational \\"responses\\" and weighs the possibility that the classical Athens it reconstructs was the work of the democracy's founder, Kleisthenes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e1znCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Associations+of+Classical+Athens:+The+Response+to+Democracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Err Is Divine: A Novel","description":"First published in Hungarian in 1998, this novel is a stunning portrait of a world disposed to depravity in the pursuit of wealth. With To Err Is Divine, Hungarian writer Agota Bozai has fashioned a keen reflection on the overpowering excesses of human greed. Anna Levay, a widow and secondary-school teacher in a small resort city in Lake Balaton, is close to retirement. One evening, after her bath, Anna discovers a strange light floating about her head. It is a halo, like that of a saint. Anna is not a particularly good person and is, in fact, an atheist. She sets about trying to conceal her halo, but realises that only the truly innocent, small children and animals, can see it. But the concurrent power to heal and produce miracles are visible to a less exclusive audience, and once the greedy mayor and physician of the town discover Anna's new gifts, they set about using her to their advantage. They build a luxury health resort and line their pockets. Written as surveillance reports from heaven, the eleven chapters recount the event surrounding the (as it turns out) mistakenly bestowed halo in this richly ironic tale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ty5RswEACAAJ&dq=To+Err+Is+Divine:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Media/impact: An introduction to mass media (Wadsworth series in mass communication)","description":"From media history to today's rapid-fire changes, MEDIA/IMPACT: AN INTRODUCTION TO MASS MEDIA, 12th Edition takes you on a tour of the events, people, money, and technologies that have shaped the mass media industries.

Between 1892 and 1894, Charles C. Willoughby did some exemplary excavations at three small burial sites in Bucksport, Orland, and Ellsworth, Maine, and made some models of that activity for exhibition at the Chicago World's Fair. These activities were encouraged by E Putnam, director of the Harvard Peabody Museum and head of anthropology at the \\"Columbian\\" Exposition. Even earlier, another director of the Peabody, Jeffries Wyman, spawned some real interest in the shellheaps of the Maine coast, but that did not last very long. Twentieth-century New England archaeology, specifically in Maine, was--for its first fifty years--rather low key too, with short-lived but important activity by Arlo and Oric (a Bates Harvard student) prior to World War Later, I. another Massachusetts institution, the Peabody Foundation at Andover, took some minor but responsible steps toward further understanding of the area's prehistoric past.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ab_7NuAczhoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Make Money with Your Studio: Setting Up and Operating a Successful Recording Studio","description":"(Book).

Lynn Hansen rightly names the collection for her favorite bird, and for the flickers, or moments, of happenings caught in words, illustrating phases and interests of a lifetime. She carries us through childhood's joys of \\"forest humus, thick moss / and a bouquet of wild orchids\\" and woes, \\"the word move was profane because it frees the rat of anxiety that gnaws on the tight knot in my gut.\\" She rejoices when she declares, \\"When I retire I'm going to write poetry.\\" Then for a decade or more, that's precisely what she has done. Lynn was determined to be a scientist in a time it was regarded as impossible for women; her thirty-three-year career of teaching biological sciences at the college level has proven her right. Her keen naturalist's eye, her awareness and love of all life on this planet, and beyond, show in her poems. She even celebrates the lowly zucchini and rutabaga, though she does sigh toward the end of summer, \\"Zucchini manna again?\\" These observations are woven into the sum of time, the treasure of relationships, \\"just as our lives gathered out of jumble, then cemented with a matrix of mutual respect.\\" Lynn's lone robin \\"lifts his bugle beak to call up morning,\\" and so lifts us all.\\" -Patricia Wellingham-Jones, Los Molinos, California \\"This collection by Lynn M. Hansen is an excellent read. While each poem is intensely personal, moving from childhood experiences to motherhood to traveling the world to growing older, Hansen generously takes us along on all her journeys, creating poems that welcome all comers. Her close observations of the natural world, of lands both distant and close to home, create a landscape at once scientifically clear and poetically imagined, and her poems about growing up and getting older and the joys and losses that come with those parts of our lives, will make readers laugh and cry, sometimes all at once. In reading this book, I grew to even more deeply appreciate our world, our Great Central Valley, and Lynn Hansen's poetry, and I suspect the same will be true for all who read this celebratory work.\\" -Gillian Wegener, Poet Laureate of Modesto, California. \\"Lynn Hansen's gorgeous book of poems is a testament to a writer who loves life and fully embraces living every day. It's rare that a trained scientist will turn to poetry to reflect on the natural world and even rarer that those written poems would be this wonderfully lucid, evocative, and heartfelt. Filled with keen-eyed wonder and amusement, these poems will teach readers about life and how to live.\\" -Sam Pierstorff, Editor, Quercus Review Press","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jjt8nAEACAAJ&dq=Complaint+in+the+Garden.(Book+Review):+An+article+from:+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wellstone","description":"Humanity has conquered the Solar System.

Beginning with the primordial sounds of nature, we have experienced an ever-increasing complexity of our sonic surroundings. As civilization develops, new noises rise up around us: from the creaking wheel, the clang of the blacksmith s hammer, and the distant chugging of steam trains to the  sound imperialism  of airports, city streets, and factories. The author contends that we now suffer from an overabundance of acoustic information and a proportionate diminishing of our ability to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. Our task, he maintains, is to listen, analyze, and make distinctions. As a society we have become more aware of the toxic wastes that can enter our bodies through the air we breathe and the water we drink. In fact, the pollution of our sonic environment is no less real. Schafer emphasizes the importance of discerning the sounds that enrich and feed us and using them to create healthier environments. To this end, he explains how to classify sounds, appreciating their beauty or ugliness, and provides exercises and  soundwalks  to help us become more discriminating and sensitive to the sounds around us. This book is a pioneering exploration of our acoustic environment, past and present, and an attempt to imagine what it might become in the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_N56QgAACAAJ&dq=Soundscape&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pietro Annigoni: Monograph","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GMDzMgEACAAJ&dq=Pietro+Annigoni:+Monograph&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Can\`t Keep a Good Woman Down","description":"Women stand their ground in the midst of crisis in this story collection by the New York Timesbestselling author of The Color Purple.

Richard Borshay Lee spent over three years conducting fieldwork among the !Kung San, an isolated population of 1,000 in northern Botswana. When Lee began his work in 19863, the !Kung San were one of the last of the world's people to live this life. By 1973, when Lee last lived with the group, it appeared that they !Kung were a society on the threshold of a transformation that signalled the end of foraging as an independent way of life, at least in Africa. The !Kung San: Men, Women and Work in a Foraging Society, an ecological and historical study, is Professor Lee's major statement on his research. By maintaining simultaneous historical and synchronic perspectives, Lee is able to extend his analysis of core features from the contemporary !Kung to prehistoric societies.

Excitement stirred in his chest, and so began a two-year adventure of struggle, contemplation, and achievement that brought him even closer to the land that he called home. More than just the story of one man, Two Winters in a Tipi gives the history and use of the native structure, providing valuable advice, through Warren s trial and error, about the confrontations that march toward a tipi dweller. It shows, without thumping the drum of environmental doom, how you can go back to the land for two days or two years. The wild plants that Natives harvested for food and medicine still grow nearby. The foods still nourish; the medicines still heal. As Warren beautifully reveals, the wild places of the past still exist in our everyday lives, and living that wilderness is still a possibility.

What has been made clear by recent events is the necessity for a thorough understanding of credit derivatives by all parties involved in a transaction, especially traders, structurers, quants and investors. Fully revised and updated to take in to account the new products, markets and risk requirements post financial crisis, Credit Derivatives: Trading, Investing and Risk Management, Second Edition, covers the subject from a real world perspective, tackling issues such as liquidity, poor data, and credit spreads, to the latest innovations in portfolio products, hedging and risk management techniques. The book concentrates on practical issues and develops an understanding of the products through applications and detailed analysis of the risks and alternative means of trading. It provides: a description of the key products, applications, and an analysis of typical trades including basis trading, hedging, and credit structuring; analysis of the industry standard 'default and recovery' and Copula models including many examples, and a description of the models' shortcomings; tools and techniques for the management of a portfolio or book of credit risks including appropriate and inappropriate methods of correlation risk management; a thorough analysis of counterparty risk; an intuitive understanding of credit correlation in reality and in the Copula model. The book is thoroughly updated to reflect the changes the industry has seen over the past 5 years, notably with an analysis of the lead up and causes of the credit crisis. It contains 50% new material, which includes copula valuation and hedging, portfolio optimisation, portfolio products and correlation risk management, pricing in illiquid environments, chapters on the evolution of credit management systems, the credit meltdown and new chapters on the implementation and testing of credit derivative models and systems.

The understanding of the interface (or interphase) in composites is the central point of this interdisciplinary effort. From the early development of composite materials of various nature, the optimization of the interface has been of major importance. While there are many reference books available on composite materials, few of them deal specifically with the science and mechanics of the interface of fiber reinforced composites. Further, many recent advances devoted solely to research in composite interfaces have been scattered in a variety of published literature and have yet to be assembled in a readily accessible form. To this end this book is an attempt to bring together recent developments in the field, both from the materials science and mechanics perspective, in a single convenient volume. The central theme of the book is tailoring the interface properties to optimise the mechanical peformance and structural integrity of composites with enhanced strength/stiffness and fracture toughness (or specific fracture resistance). It deals mainly with interfaces in advanced composites made from high performance fibers, such as glass, carbon, aramid, ultra high modulus polyethylene and some inorganic (e.g. B/W, A12O3, SiC) fibers, and matrix materials encompassing polymers, metals/alloys and ceramics. The book is intended to provide a comprehensive treatment of composite interfaces in such a way that it should be of interest to materials scientists, technologists and practising engineers, as well as graduate students and their supervisors in advanced composites. We hope that this book will also serve as a valuable source of reference to all those involved in the design and research of composite interfaces. The book contains eight chapters of discussions on microstructure-property relationships with underlying fundamental mechanics principles. In Chapter 1, an introduction is given to the nature and definition of interfaces in fiber reinforced composites. Chapter 2 is devoted to the mechanisms of adhesion which are specific to each fiber-matrix system, and the physio-chemical characterization of the interface with regard to the origin of adhesion. The experimental techniques that have been developed to assess the fiber-matrix interface bond quality on a microscopic scale are presented in Chapter 3, along with the techniques of measuring interlaminar/intralaminar strengths and fracture toughness using bulk composite laminates. The applicability and limitations associated with loading geometry and interpretation of test data are compared. Chapter 4 presents comprehensive theoretical analyses based on shear-lag models of the single fiber composite tests, with particular interest being placed on the interface debond process and the nature of the fiber-matrix interfacial bonding. Chapter 5 is devoted to reviewing current techniques of fiber surface treatments which have been devised to improve the bond strength and the fiber-matrix compatibility/stability during the manufacturing processes of composites. The micro-failure mechanisms and their associated theories of fracture toughness of composites are discussed in Chapter 6. The roles of the interface and its effects on the mechanical performance of fiber composites are addressed from several viewpoints. Recent research efforts to augment the transverse and interlaminar fracture toughness by means of controlled interfaces are presented in Chapters 7 and 8.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qrjC9Yt8y6kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Migrant Daughter: Coming of Age as a Mexican American Woman","description":"In the long tradition of the \\"testimonio,\\" or personal narrative, Migrant Daughter is a deeply affecting memoir of a Mexican-American woman's coming-of-age during the 1930s-1950s, moving from rural New Mexico to life as a farm laborer in California, and finally to the campus at UC Berkeley as a scholarship student.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OaUwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Migrant+Daughter:+Coming+of+Age+as+a+Mexican+American+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast Track","description":"GET UP TO SPEED WITH FAST TRACK: U.S. History!

He plays high school football and worries about his weirdness, or lack thereof. Julia Rabia just moved to Owl. She gets free booze and falls in love with a self-loathing bison farmer who listens to Goats Head Soup. Horace Jones has resided in Owl for seventy-three years. He consumes a lot of coffee, thinks about his dead wife, and understands the truth. They all know each other completely, except that they've never met. Like a colder, Reagan-era version of The Last Picture Show fused with Friday Night Lights, Chuck Klosterman's Downtown Owl is the unpretentious, darkly comedic story of how it feels to exist in a community where rural mythology and violent reality are pretty much the same thing. Loaded with detail and unified by a (very real) blizzard, it's technically about certain people in a certain place at a certain time...but it's really about a problem. And the problem is this: What does it mean to be a normal person? And there is no answer. But in Downtown Owl, what matters more is how you ask the question.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t54_28jqrrIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinatown","description":"Willis Wu doesn't perceive himself as a protagonist even in his own life: He's merely Generic Asian man.

Except by one person, his mother. Who says to him: Be more. Playful but heartfelt, a send-up of Hollywood tropes and Asian stereotypes, Interior Chinatown is Charles Yu's most moving, daring, and masterly novel yet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m33HDwAAQBAJ&dq=Chinatown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"RISING CURVE","description":"Do we have the wrong map for the Christian life?

This lost world of stately pomp and unspeakable cruelty, artistic splendor and abysmal ignorance the seeming opposite of brashly optimistic, commercial, democratic nineteenth-century America engaged Twain s imagination, inspiring a children s classic, and astonishing fantasy of comedy and violence, and an unusual fictional biography. Twain drew on his fascination with impersonation and the theme of the double in The Prince and the Pauper (1882), which brilliantly uses the device of identical boys from opposite ends of the social hierarchy to evoke the tumultuous contrasts of Henry VIII s England. As the pauper Tom Canty is raised to the throne, while the rightful heir is cast out among thieves and beggars, Twain sustains one of his most compelling narratives. A perennial children s favorite, the novel brings an impassioned American point of view to the injustices of traditional European society. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court (1889) finds Twain in high satiric form. When hard-headed Yankee mechanic Hank Morgan is knocked out in a fight, he wakes up in Camelot in A.D. 528 and finds himself pitted against the medieval rituals and superstitions of King Arthur and his knights. In a hilarious burlesque of the age of chivalry and of its cult in the nineteenth-century American South, Twain demolishes knighthood s romantic aura to reveal a brutish, violent society beset by ignorance. But the comic mood gives way to a darker questioning of both ancient and modern society, culminating in an astonishing apocalyptic conclusion that questions both American progress and Yankee  ingenuity  as Camelot is undone by the introduction of advanced technology.  Taking into account . . . her origin, youth, sex, illiteracy, early environment, and the obstructing conditions under which she exploited her high gifts and made her conquest in the field and before the courts that tried her for her life she is easily and by far the most extraordinary person the human race has ever known.  So Twain wrote of the heroine of Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (1896), his most elaborate work of historical reconstruction. A respectful and richly detailed chronicle, by turns admiring and indignant, Joan of Arc opens a fascinating window onto the moral imagination of America s greatest comic writer. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America s best and most significant writing.

But they encounter obstacles that prevent them from following the path seriously, and especially from persevering on it. Time for God was written with these desires and difficulties in mind. In Time for God, author Jacques Philippe mainly concentrates on mental prayer: prayer that consists of facing God in solitude and silence for a time in order to enter into intimate, loving communion with him. Practicing this kind of prayer regularly is considered by all spiritual masters to be an indispensable path that gives access to genuine Christian life a path to knowing and loving God that empowers us to respond to his call to holiness addressed to each individual. Philippe draws on years of experience as a spiritual guide to illuminate the fundamental principles of mental prayer and describes some common mistakes and misconceptions that can lead it astray. With simplicity and clarity he explains the foundational principles for a healthy prayer life and gives advice for overcoming the various obstacles that arise when one sets off on the path of interior prayer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dg4vx9P7fpMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Printed Circuit Board Design Techniques for EMC Compliance (IEEE Press Series on Electronics Technology)","description":"Presents simple techniques for designing and laying out circuits that meet the most stringent domestic and international regulations on electromagnetic compatibility for high technology products.

Furthermore, Cooper turned novel writing from a polite diversion into a paying career. He influenced Herman Melville, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Francis Parkman, and even Mark Twain who felt the need to flagellate Cooper for his  literary offenses.  His novels mark the starting point for any history of our environmental conscience. Far from complicit in the cleansings of Native Americans that characterized the era, Cooper s fictions traced native losses to their economic sources. Perhaps no other American writer stands in greater need of a major reevaluation than Cooper. This is the first treatment of Cooper s life to be based on full access to his family papers. Cooper s life, as Franklin relates it, is the story of how, in literature and countless other endeavors, Americans in his period sought to solidify their political and cultural economic independence from Britain and, as the Revolutionary generation died, stipulate what the maturing republic was to become. The first of two volumes, James Fenimore Cooper: The Early Years covers Cooper s life from his boyhood up to 1826, when, at the age of thirty-six, he left with his wife and five children for Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1O68047d3OgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","description":"A renowned mountaineer chronicles his journey to Tibet with the daughter of a friend who had died in his arms in a Himalayan avalanche twenty years earlier.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NwubYVKGf-IC&dq=Below+Another+Sky:+A+Mountain+Adventure+in+Search+of+a+Lost+Father&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Periodization of Strength: The New Wave in Strength Training","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A83NAAAACAAJ&dq=Periodization+of+Strength:+The+New+Wave+in+Strength+Training&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","description":"Looking to enliven her dull summer vacation, Christine Ray takes a job on a crew filming a documentary at Smith Grove Mental Hospital--where Michael Myers had been locked up for killing his sister fifteen years before escaping.

Like most other Shakespearean scholars he had accepted, Bradley's portrait as shown in The Rejection of Falstaff, until (as he writes) he 'began checking it with yet another portrait - that which I found in the pages of Shakespeare himself. As the result of much recent work on the two parts of Henry IV, a new Falstaff stands before me, as fascinating as Bradley's, certainly quite as human, but different; and beside him stands a still more unexpected Prince Hal. The discovery throws all my previous ideas out of focus.' As the reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement wrote, Falstaff 'is no hero, as the romantics have tried to make him out, nor is he merely a typical and traditional stage-butt. But he is Falstaff riding for a fall; and when he takes his toss he is up again in still unconquerable effrontery and humour ... The Prince as we watch him through Dr Dover Wilson's eyes growing in grace, first in chivalry and then in justice, we do more than observe the making of a hero-king. We get to know a very lovable, faulty, generous, noble-minded young man; and a character in the play whose scenes are so far from being mere padding between Falstaff's that the whole is seen as a masterpiece of construction.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yixQlAvkurEC&dq=The+Fortunes+of+Falstaff&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English as She is Spoke","description":"In 1855, when Jose da Fonseca and Pedro Carolino wrote an English phrasebook for Portuguese students, they faced just one problem: they didn't know any English.

However, emerging critiques suggest the need to pay more attention to understanding men and masculinities, and to analysing the social relationships between men and women.This book considers the case for a focus on men in gender and development, including arguments based on equality and social justice, the specific gendered vulnerabilities of men, the emergence of a crisis of masculinity and the need to include men in development as partners for strategic change. Incorporating men into gender and development requires us to reconsider some of the theories and concepts which underlie policies. This book addresses a variety of such concepts and debates including the links between modernization, development and gender, whether feminist analytical frameworks are appropriate for incorporating men and their concerns, how useful the concept of hegemonic masculinity is in understanding different cultural conceptions of manliness, and the need to find ways of combining concern with micro level and private social relations with an analysis of macro level trends and structures. Chapters in this book draw on experience from a variety of geographical areas and different development projects and processes to analyse men and masculinities and to draw out implications for policy and practice. Subjects covered include working with children and in schools, impacting upon sexual health and intimate relations, and working with men in women's groups. Other chapters look at gender relations and masculinities in situations of violence and conflict, the role of the state and ideologies of nationalism in shaping masculinities, and the interlinking of gender relations with race and class. Overall they illustrate the complexity of economic and social relationships shaped by local, national and international processes, and the importance of incorporating an understanding of men and masculinities into gender and development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zqHnCXYZU2IC&dq=Masculinities+Matter!:+Men,+Gender+and+Development&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Should You Really Seek Custody Of Your Child?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yyArPQAACAAJ&dq=Should+You+Really+Seek+Custody+Of+Your+Child%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chariot in the sky: A story of the Jubilee Singers (Land of the free series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Islam in History: Ideas, People, and Events in the Middle East","description":"From secular-minded autocrats like Saddam Hussein to religious fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden, powerful voices in the Islamic world have been united by a fierce hatred of the West.

The result is this accurate, highly interesting account of the Cheyennes' life on the Great Plains, their system of government and religion, and their relation to the fur and hide trade during their last years of freedom. After nearly two centuries of fighting other Indians and whites for their lands, in the eighteenth century the Cheyenne's were forced to shift their range from the Minnesota River Valley to the Central and Southern Plains. From 1861 through 1875, they fought to maintain their free, nomadic existence. There were bloody wars with territorial forces and federal troops, and a few years of intermittent peace and retaliation (including the massacre at Sand Creek in 1864). Finally, after the intensive winter campaign of 1874-75, the fierce Southern Cheyenne's were brought to bay by the U.S. Army and herded onto a reservation in western Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).

Finally, Buddhist temples could evoke highly personal feelings of filial piety and nostalgia. This book demonstrates that representations of Buddhism by lay people underwent a major change during the T angSung transition. These changes built on basic transformations within the Buddhist and classicist traditions and sometimes resulted in the use of Buddhism and Buddhist temples as frames of reference to evaluate aspects of lay society. Buddhism, far from being pushed to the margins of Chinese culture, became even more a part of everyday elite Chinese life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aKTaDwAAQBAJ&dq=Out+of+the+Cloister:+Literati+Perspectives+on+Buddhism+in+Sung+China,+960-1279+(Harvard+East+Asian+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For All the Wrong Reasons: A Novel","description":"Adrienne prides herself for being smart, prim and proper.

Some, such as the Magnolia Service Station in Kansas, have been preserved on the National Historic Register; others, such as the Aztec Motel in Albuquerque, are still doing a thriving business; while others have simpy vanished from the landscape.Starting in Chicago, Route 66 Then and Now takes in the motels, cafes, gas stations, roadside attractions and key towns and sites along the route.

After examining the social background and political psychology of the young Libertarians, the author comes to the conclusion that in adhering to a world view that has more to do with individualism - or \\"property-rights anarchism\\"- than any form of collectivist ideology, such as Fascism; they represent the antithesis of traditional Burkean thought. For, while Conservatives have historically adhered to the authority of religion, prescription, instinct and communitarianism, Libertarians place their faith in the authority of reality, reason, mankind and capitalism. As a school whose epistemology is reason,ethics - self-interest and politics - and anarcho-capitalism, they represent, so the author argues, an important post-modern paradigm shift in both Conservative thought and activism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RO68vOwPd6UC&dq=Conservative+Radicalism:+A+Sociology+of+Conservative+Party+Youth+Structures+and+Libertarianism+1970-1992&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MARIA CHAPDELAINE - Recit du Canada Francais","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jZUNAQAAMAAJ&dq=MARIA+CHAPDELAINE+-+Recit+du+Canada+Francais&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Due Diligence Techniques and Analysis: Critical Questions for Business Decisions","description":"Discusses how to analyze and investigate a business when one is deciding whether to acquire it and/or whether to invest in it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RKsuW_mUs1kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","description":"THE STORY: The home of the Blackwoods near a Vermont village is a lonely, ominous abode, and Constance, the young mistress of the place, can't go out of the house without being insulted and stoned by the villagers.

And there are scores of ballplayers like Lipman Pike, Shawn Green, Cal Abrams and Eddie Zosky whose little-known Baseball stories will touch or amuse readers of any background. Beyond life-time batting averages, there are intriguing players like catcher Moe Berg who served his country as a secret agent during WWII.

It is rare to find an article that tells the \\"real\\" story behind the finished product. By having real researchers tell their own stories of \\"mucking around\\" with methodological and ethical issues in qualitative research, we get a more realistic, human story of the process. This is a collection of such stories. Authors were asked to describe their own experiences with methodological and ethical struggles as they engaged in their work. Each of the essays offers insight into the research approach used as well as particular issues which became apparent during the research process. Key issues raised by the authors include early learnings; gaining entry; overlapping, conflicting roles, and the boundaries of these roles; differential power relationships; who tells the story and whose story is told; ethical concerns related to confidentiality; and the influence of a researcher's particular philosophy or theoretical framework on his or her research. Throughout the book we see scholars whose personal stories or autobiographies intersect closely with their research projects. deMarrais introduces a unique framework to help students gain an overview of qualitative research methods and the underpinnings and processes in these approaches. This framework is centered on the ways we understand phenomena using qualitative research approaches that engage archival knowledge, narrative knowledge, or observational knowledge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5E3TtAEACAAJ&dq=Inside+Stories:+Qualitative+Research+Reflections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","description":"In this detective story, the fictitious Philip Trent must solve the riddle of the murder of an American millionaire.

Cursed with health problems and drawn into trouble more often than not, Tommy is the recipient of pity rather than admiration. He is nothing like his stepbrother Eric. Eric, a Nordic Adonis, is graced by a seemingly endless supply of good fortune-he is charming, a star athlete, and a magnet for anyone in his sphere. Yet in spite of these differences, Eric and Tommy are as close as two humans can be. After tragedy rips their makeshift family apart, the lives of these boys split. In a powerful story of modern-day resilience and redemption, Tommy and Eric forge their separate ways in the world, each confronting the challenges of his sphere. For Tommy this means dropping out of school, selling drugs, living on the streets, and somehow creating a family of his own. Motherless, African-American, and impoverished, Tommy has nothing but feels lucky every day of his life. For Eric, the golden youth, life means athletics, sexual attraction, excellent grades, prosperity, and the uncertainty that comes with prizes won too easily. Given everything, he trusts nothing. Eric and Tommy's parallel lives are an astonishing story of self-determination and the true measure of fortune. The ties that bind this Adonis and his sickly counterpart, however, are thicker than blood, and when circumstances reunite Eric and Tommy after years apart, their distinct approaches to life may be the only thing that can save them from forces that threaten to destroy them for good. Written with unique insight into the hidden currents and deeper realities of modern life, Fortunate Son is a tour de force by the author the Boston Globe calls \\"one of this nation's finest writers.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wlR8zkIA9koC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fag Hag (Plume Fiction)","description":"Secretly in love with an unattainable gay artist named Peter, Natalie Stathis subtly poisons all Peter's romances with men until Lloyd Hood, a gay survivalist gun shop owner, enters Peter's life.

Some radicals in the powerful Wyoming Stock Growers Association turned to the man who once boasted,  Killing men in my specialty; I look to it as a business proposition, and I think I have a corner on the market.  Cattle thieves were duly warned, blood was shed, and Tom Horn was implicated but never charged. Then on the morning of July 18, 1901, Willie Nickell, the fourteen-year-old son of a Wyoming sheepman, was shot. Horn s career was ended. The arrest, trial, and execution of Tom Horn ignite fireworks in Dean Krakel s book, and a colorful cast of cattle barons and lawmen adds to the sizzle. A jury convicted Tom Horn, but his hanging did not settle the specter of guilt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_H5vrDEEjPIC&dq=The+Saga+of+Tom+Horn:+The+Story+of+a+Cattlemen%27s+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fist Of The North Star: Blood Brothers (Viz Graphic Novel)","description":"When Kenshiro's brother Jagi cannot forgive Ken for being chosen to carry on the North Star's sacred line, he claims to be the Fist of the North Star and declares war on his brother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eDkPAAAACAAJ&dq=Fist+Of+The+North+Star:+Blood+Brothers+(Viz+Graphic+Novel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ABCs of Building Model Railroad Cars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RwQoAQAAMAAJ&dq=ABCs+of+Building+Model+Railroad+Cars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catholic Prayer Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=25d8jwEACAAJ&dq=Catholic+Prayer+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fabulae Romanae: Stories of Famous Romans","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fCeuNwAACAAJ&dq=Fabulae+Romanae:+Stories+of+Famous+Romans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs","description":"For artists, designers, and all with an interest in Buddhist and Tibetan art, this is the first exhaustive reference to the seemingly infinite variety of symbols found throughout Tibetan art in line drawings, paintings, and ritual objects.

Jesus told his first clergy,  If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.  In Lord, Have Mercy, Scott Hahn explores the sacrament of reconciliation and shows why it is the key to spiritual growth, particularly in these times of intense anxiety and uncertainty. Drawing on the history of ancient Israel, the Gospels, the writings of the early Church, and the lives of the saints, Hahn reveals the living, scriptural heart of the Church s teachings on penance, forgiveness, and reconciliation. It is a story that begins with the sin of Adam and Eve, continues in the biographies of Moses, King David, and the Apostle Peter, and reverberates in the lives of believers today. Hahn presents the Catholic and biblical perspective on sin and mercy, elucidating in clear, easily understood language the true import of Jesus  simple, yet profound promise I am the door; if anyone enters by Me, he will be saved (John 10:9). Like Hahn s earlier books, Lord, Have Mercy offers thoughtful, authoritative insights into controversial issues and disputed doctrines in a manner that will enlighten lay readers yet is thorough enough for scholars to appreciate. More than just a Bible study, it is a guide for the perplexed, providing practical advice and inspiration that will help readers come to a deeper knowledge of themselves and of Jesus through the sacrament of penance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ADgL6NTcxzYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"OLD BONES","description":"The #1 NYT bestselling authors Preston & Child bring the true story of the ill-fated Donner Party to new life in this thrilling novel of archaeology, history, murder, and suspense. Nora Kelly, a young curator at the Santa Fe Institute of Archaeology, is approached by historian Clive Benton with a once-in-a-lifetime proposal: to lead a team in search of the so-called \\"Lost Camp\\" of the tragic Donner Party. This was a group of pioneers who earned a terrible place in American history when they became snow-bound in the California mountains in 1847, their fate unknown until the first skeletonized survivors stumbled out of the wilderness, raving about starvation, murder-and cannibalism. Benton tells Kelly he has stumbled upon an amazing find: the long-sought diary of one of the victims, which has an enigmatic description of the Lost Camp. Nora agrees to lead an expedition to locate and excavate it-to reveal its long-buried secrets. Once in the mountains, however, they learn that discovering the camp is only the first step in a mounting journey of fear. For as they uncover old bones, they expose the real truth of what happened, one that is far more shocking and bizarre than mere cannibalism.

This is the story of a rising capitalist group in post-independence India. Until the arrival of Ambani, and now more like him, India's big business scene was dominated by a few industrial houses from British times. Ambani's Reliance group has risen to rival these houses in just 26 years since its foundation. By 1995, the group had 2.6 million investors, one in every eight Indian sharemarket investors, and is now so large that it has to hold its annual general meetings in football stadiums. Along with expansion, however, have come the intricate political connections, a whole raft of corruption charges and a rollercoaster of booms and crashes for Ambani and his company.

With Purgatory Ridge he cements his standing as a suspense writer of the highest caliber. Not far from the small town of Aurora (population 3,752) lies an ancient two-hundred-acre expanse of great white pines, sacred to the Anishinaabe and known to them as Minishoomisag (Our Grandfathers). Wealthy industrialist Karl Lindstrom does not have a reputation as a sensitive environmentalist, and some members of the Anishinaabe tribe are concerned about the proximity of the trees to his lumber mill. So when an explosion at the mill results in the death of a night watchman, it's obvious whom suspicion will fall upon. Cork O'Connor, in the throes of straightening out his life and repairing his marriage, is asked by his successor as sheriff to help with the investigation. His sense of community obliges him to accept, but Cork has distinctly mixed feelings about the case. For one thing, he is part Anishinaabe himself. For another, his lawyer wife, Jo, represents the tribe. Meanwhile, in a secluded house that overlooks the lakeside home of the Lindstrom family, a reclusive shipwreck survivor and his sidekick also seem to be harboring some resentment of their own against the industrialist. And it soon becomes clear to Cork that harmony, both at home and in the town, will be on the back burner for some time. William Kent Krueger's precise and atmospheric prose, combined with his keen eye for the telling details of small-town life and his vivid sense of the land and seascapes of northern Minnesota, will impress and delight both his old fans and those discovering him for the first time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vyaRdQdbRZkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leading Teams: Creating a Team - Resolving Conflicts - Delivering Results Through Teamworking (Essentials)","description":"Written for all levels of people in businesses of all sizes, this guide provides techniques for transforming teamworking.

In the era beginning with the 1920s, a quiet revolution was stirring the U.S. federal government's approach to Indian education.

Native American Picture Books of Change documents four decades of these storybook for Pueblo, Hopi, Navajo, and Sioux children. A body of work largely lost to history with the dismantling of the programs that brought them forth, these classics of Indian art and Indian-centered cultural education are presented collectively for the first time and placed in the context of Native American self-determination. These English and bilingual books showcase many of the important emerging Indian artists of the period, including Andrew Tsinajinnie, Hoke Denetsosie, Velino Herrera, Oscar Howe, Allan Houser, Pablita Velarde, and many other exceptional illustrators and painters. Writers and folklorists include Elizabeth DeHuff, who collected oral folklore for Taytay's Tales, illustrated by Hopi artist Fred Kabotie; and the prolific Ann Nolan Clark, a talented teacher whose lyrical In My Mother's House has remained in print for more than sixty years.

Undeterred by post-11 September government warnings against visiting this 'highly dangerous' area, Mortimer set off and found an extraordinary and surprisingly Anglophile country. Cool for Qat documents this remarkable journey, during which Mortimer pieces together how the riots of 1930 arose and considers their relevance to Western attitudes towards Muslims today. He meets many remarkable characters along the way and immerses himself in the national custom of chewing the narcotic qat leaf. After visiting the ex-British Protectorate of Aden - through which many of the seamen passed en route to Britain - Mortimer travels on to San'a and then Tai'iz. It is while visiting the isolated mountain villages surrounding this city that Mortimer finally meets men who worked in South Shields some 50 years ago. Carrying a battered book with images of Yemenis living in the North-east in the '30s from home to home, trying to jog distant memories, he realises his visit has taken on a new purpose - bringing a small part of the country's history back to where it belongs. Back in the UK, Mortimer's investigations into the 1930 riot reveal a society with many striking similarities to current times. Then, as now, Muslim immigrants were treated as scapegoats for all manner of ills, tabloid newspapers drummed up prejudice and hatred, and the powers that be often used fear and racial mistrust to disguise their own economic failings. Cool for Qat questions just how 'civilised' the Western world - and Britain in particular - is in comparison to Yemen. It is a touching, thought-provoking and at times humorous document of one man's travels through a country about which little is known in the West.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lisHEWf3vFAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The European Tribe","description":"In this richly descriptive and haunting narrative, Caryl Phillips chronicles a journey through modern-day Europe, his quest guided by a moral compass rather than a map.

Phillips deftly illustrates the scenes and characters he encounters, from Casablanca and Costa del Sol to Venice, Amsterdam, Oslo, and Moscow. He ultimately discovers that \\"Europe is blinded by her past, and does not understand the high price of her churches, art galleries, and history as the prison from which Europeans speak.\\" In the afterword to the Vintage edition, Phillips revisits the Europe he knew as a young man and offers fresh observations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D-wsDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hysterectomy?

Yet, few leaders devote focused attention to how this design is chosen, implemented, and adjusted over time. Robert Simons argues that by viewing design as a powerful and proactive management lever--rather than an inevitable outcome of corporate evolution--leaders can maximize productivity across every level of the organization. Levers of Organization Design presents a new design theory based on four key yet often underrated categories: customer definition, critical performance variables, creative tension, and commitment to mission. Building from these core areas, Simons lays out a step-by-step process leaders can follow to create structures and accountability systems that positively influence how people do their work, where they focus their attention, and how their activities can be aligned to contribute to overall strategic goals. He also introduces four levers of organizational design--unit configuration, diagnostic control systems, interactive networks, and responsibility to others--that leaders can manipulate to improve overall organizational efficiency and effectiveness vastly. For anyone accountable for measuring and managing performance, this book shows how good design can become an organization's roadmap to success. Robert Simons is the Charles M. Williams Professor of Business Administration in the accounting & control area at Harvard Business School.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bsSkVB7OQJ0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","description":"From Ratatouille through Brave, The Art of Pixar: Volume II features gorgeous and illuminating concept art and iconic final frames from the 6 Pixar feature films and 18 short films released from 2007 on.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aGKquAAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Pixar:+100+Collectible+Postcards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ranks of the Black Order","description":"Not unlike contemporary political situations in which terrorism leads to counter-terrorism in a vicious cycle, The Ranks of the Black Order illuminates the tragedy and monstrosity of violent vengeance on a human scale.

Profiler Roy Hazelwood is one of the world's leading experts on the strangest and most dangerous of all aberrant offenders-- the sexual criminal. In Dark Dreams he reveals the twisted motive and thinking that go into the most reprehensible crimes. He also catalogs the innovative and remarkably effective techniques-- investigative approaches that he helped pioneer at the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit-- that allow law enforcement agents to construct psychological profiles of the offenders who commit these crimes. Hazelwood has helped track down some of the most violent and well-known criminals in modern history; in Dark Dreams he takes readers into his world-- a sinister world inhabited by scores of dangerous offenders for every Roy Hazelwood who would put them behind bars: * A young woman disappears from the convenience store where she works. Her skeletonized remains are found in a field, near a torture device. Who committed this heinous crime? And why? * A teenager's body is found hanging in a storm sewer. His clothes are neatly folded by the entrance and a stopwatch is found in his mouth. Is he the victim of a bizarre, ritualistic murder...or an elaborate masturbatory fantasy gone awry? * A married couple, driving with their toddler in the backseat, pick up a female hitchhiker. They kidnap her and for seven years keep her as a sexual slave. The wife agreed to this inhuman arrangement in exchange for having a second child. Who was to blame? As gruesome as the crimes are and as unsettling as the odds seem, Hazelwood proves that the right amount of determination and logic can bring even the most cunning and devious criminals to justice.

But a crisis strangely linking past and future strands Kivrin in a bygone age as her fellows try desperately to rescue her. In a time of superstition and fear, Kivrin barely of age herself finds she has become an unlikely angel of hope during one of history's darkest hours. Praise for Doomsday Book  A stunning novel that encompasses both suffering and hope. . . . The best work yet from one of science fiction s best writers.  The Denver Post  Splendid work brutal, gripping and genuinely harrowing, the product of diligent research, fine writing and well-honed instincts, that should appeal far beyond the normal science-fiction constituency.  Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  The world of 1348 burns in the mind s eye, and every character alive that year is a fully recognized being. . . . It becomes possible to feel . . . that Connie Willis did, in fact, over the five years Doomsday Book took her to write, open a window to another world, and that she saw something there.

Amelia Farrow to lose her cool--except when it comes to George Gibson. With his devilish smile and chocolate brown eyes, the handsome defense attorney is known for playing it fast and loose with the ladies. When they're in court together, Amelia can barely think straight. But she refuses to succumb to George's charms--even if those charms can be pretty damn, well, charming... When George sets his mind to it, he can have most women wrapped around his finger in record time. But prim and proper Amelia, the daughter of L.A.'s most prestigious black judge, is the exception to the rule. It's obvious Amelia finds him attractive--and she'd be one fine-looking sister if she'd lose those stuffy business suits. So why can't he break through that icy exterior and get to the hot-blooded woman inside?

This perennially popular Norton Critical Edition again reprints the 1897 editions of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass along with the 1876 edition of The Hunting of the Snark. Each text is fully annotated and the original illustrations are included. An unusually rich \\"Backgrounds\\" section is arranged to correspond with three clearly defined periods in Lewis Carroll's life. Letters and diary entries interwoven within each period emphasize the biographical dimension of Carroll's writing. Readers gain an understanding of the author's family and education, the evolution of the Alice books, and Carroll's later years through his own words and through important scholarly work on his faith life and his relationships with women and with Alice Hargreaves and her family. Reflecting the wealth of new scholarship on Alice in Wonderland and Lewis Carroll published since the last edition, Donald Gray has chosen eleven new critical works while retaining five seminal works from the previous edition. Two early pieces--an essay by Charles Dickens and poem by Christina Rossetti--take a satirical look at children's literature. The nine new recent essays are by James R. Kincaid, Marah Gubar, Robert M. Polemus, Jean-Jacques Lecercle, Gilles Deleuze, Roger Taylor, Carol Mavor, Jean Gatt gno, and Helena M. Pycior.

In Why I Read, Lesser draws on a lifetime of pleasure reading and decades of editing one of the most distinguished literary magazines in the country, The Threepenny Review, to describe her love of literature. As Lesser writes in her prologue, \\"Reading can result in boredom or transcendence, rage or enthusiasm, depression or hilarity, empathy or contempt, depending on who you are and what the book is and how your life is shaping up at the moment you encounter it.\\" Here the reader will discover a definition of literature that is as broad as it is broad-minded. In addition to novels and stories, Lesser explores plays, poems, and essays along with mysteries, science fiction, and memoirs. As she examines these works from such perspectives as \\"Character and Plot,\\" \\"Novelty,\\" \\"Grandeur and Intimacy,\\" and \\"Authority,\\" Why I Read sparks an overwhelming desire to put aside quotidian tasks in favor of reading. Lesser's passion for this pursuit resonates on every page, whether she is discussing the book as a physical object or a particular work's influence. \\"Reading literature is a way of reaching back to something bigger and older and different,\\" she writes. \\"It can give you the feeling that you belong to the past as well as the present, and it can help you realize that your present will someday be someone else's past. This may be disheartening, but it can also be strangely consoling at times.\\" A book in the spirit of E. M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel and Elizabeth Hardwick's A View of My Own, Why I Read is iconoclastic, conversational, and full of insight.

As the child of a Jewish mother and Gentile father, Wieck was persecuted first as a \\"certified Jew\\" by the Nazis, then as a German by the Russian occupiers, including horrific internment in the Rothenstein concentration camp. His emigration to the West in 1948 marked the end of the 408-year history of the Jewish community in K?nigsberg.

He tells of his school days and their sudden end, the shock of Kristallnacht, his Aunt Fanny being sent by train to a destination unknown, the chemical factory where Jewish workers gradually disappeared, the bombs falling on K?nigsberg. The Russian occupation was anything but the expected delivery from the horrors of the war.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local  powhitetrash.  At eight years old and back at her mother s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors ( I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare ) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read.  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.

Yet tragedies past seem to pale in the wake of becoming involved in a war of mythic pro-portions between the Norse gods of the Aesir and the Frost Giants, competing for domination of Midgard (Earth) and Asgard (realm of the Aesir). Eric befriends the mighty Thor, his father Odin, and brother Loki, along with the industrious Rock Dwarves and the Valkyrie to save his uncle, his friends, and ultimately the planet and realms beyond. This is a classic adventure, seen through a young boy's eyes as he learns to accept responsibility and grow into a man. Adults and young readers alike will enjoy this truly heroic tale. \\"The action's divine, the plot mischievously intricate, and the characters of epic proportion (literally and figuratively).

Of the two great schools of Buddhism, Mah&_y&_na has the greatest number of adherents worldwide& it prevails among the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Tibetans, and Vietnamese& and contains within it a number of movements, notably Zen, which have been of growing interest in the West in recent decades. Yet despite this increased attention and enormous following, translations of Mah&_y&_na scriptures have been scarce and fragmentary; clearly, a comprehensive translation of a major work within the canon was called for. This volume addresses that need. It contains 22 of the 49 S&_tras of the Mah&_ratnak&_ta (or &\\"Treasury&\\") S&_tra, many translated for the first time in a Western language, selected and arranged to give the modern reader a progressive introduction to one of the world's major religious traditions. Subjects covered include M&_y&_ and miracles, the teachings on Consciousness, Emptiness, and monastic discipline, the Mystical Light of the Tath&_gata, and the devotional practice of Pure Land, making this a comprehensive source book of Mah&_y&_na Buddhism hitherto unavailable in English. The book also includes an introduction to provide historical and interpretive guidance, annotations that assist in the comprehension of difficult passages, and an extensive glossary that will be valuable to specialist and layman alike. A team of scholars, working in Taiwan, spent eight years translating the Treasury's million words from Chinese, using Tibetan texts for comparison and checking each S&_tra with an international board of scholars. In the course of translating from the original, special effort was made to retain both the devotional style appropriate for religious reading and the precision required by the scholar, while presenting the material with a clarity and flow that would make it accessible to the Western layman. The editors then selected, arranged, and annotated the 22 S&_tras presented here. Published in cooperation with The Institute for Advanced Studies of World Religions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n7HabuPxdLMC&dq=A+Treasury+of+Mahayana+Sutras:+Selections+from+the+Maharatnakuta+Sutra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Injured Brains of Medical Minds: Views from Within","description":"This book provides a unique perspective on what it is like to be brain-damaged, seen through the eyes of doctors or neurosurgeons who have themselves suffered a brain injury or brain illness.

But the sky is marred by two conspicuous columns of smoke, replacing pleasurable anticipation with alarm and suspicion. One smoke column is the result of an overnight fire that has damaged the master's outbuildings. The second column rises from the wooded edge of the village, sent up by newcomers to announce their presence. In the minds of the wary villagers a mere coincidence of events appears to be unlikely, with violent confrontation looming as the unavoidable outcome. Meanwhile, another newcomer has recently been spotted taking careful notes and making drawings of the land. It is his presence more than any other that will threaten the village's entire way of life. In effortless and tender prose, Jim Crace details the unraveling of a pastoral idyll in the wake of economic progress.

Representing a giant step forward from the conventional colour-themed border, this new approach to gardening gives just as much emphasis to form, texture, light and movement as it does to colour. Individual plants are used as harmonious elements in luxuriant and atmospheric plantings. Written in collaboration with No?l Kingsbury, Designing with Plants is an informative and visually breathtaking study of Piet Oudolf's planting theory and practice, and it provides all the advice necessary to create the same effects in your own garden.Beginning with the building blocks of planting design, a visual sourcebook of Planting Palettes illustrates some of the huge choice available in terms of form, texture and colour. The following chapter explains, with the use of planting plans and diagrams, how to combine these basic elements to create stunning and sculptural planting schemes. Theory is put into practice in Planting Moods in which stunning photography demonstrates how to create a particular feeling or atmosphere, and Year-Round Planting emphasizes the importance of choosing plants to give value throughout the seasons so that they contribute to the garden in death as well as in life. Rounding off with a detailed directory of key plants, Designing with Plants is destined to become an inspiration to all gardeners who wish to create, in Piet's words, 'an impression and an expression of nature'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oxpbPwAACAAJ&dq=Designing+with+Plants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Career Opportunities in Health Care","description":"Career Opportunities in Healthcare Management is a concise, reader-friendly, introductory healthcare management book that covers a wide variety of career opportunities in a broad range of direct healthcare settings--such as hospitals, physician practices, nursing homes, and clinics--and non-direct health care settings, such as associations, managed care and health insurance companies, consulting firms, and medical supplier firms.

Previously unpublished essays and notes help chart the life and times of a comic legend and include such gems as his reflections on how it feels to be crucified and his nostalgic memories of blowing up hotel rooms with his good friend Keith Moon.

The Chess Publishing Event of the Decade! The years after the Second World War saw international chess dominated by the Soviets Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian and then Spassky held the world crown, treating it as if it were almost an integral part of their country s heritage. There were occasional flashes of brilliance in the West Reshevsky, Najdorf, and later Larsen but no one really mounted a serious challenge to the Russian hegemony. Then, in the mid-1950s, a lone genius from Brooklyn emerged. Obsessed with chess, all his waking hours became devoted to finding truth on the 64 squares. It was an unrelenting, sometimes frustrating quest, but he persevered, eventually emerging as perhaps the greatest natural chess talent ever. It was clear from his early years as a gifted prodigy through his stormy ascent of the Chess Olympus, no one had ever rocked the chess world quite like Bobby Fischer. His raw genius for the royal game, combined with an indefatigable will to win, made him one of the most feared chessplayers of all time a genuine living legend. Now, for the first time, every single one of his tournament and match games is presented with insightful explanations and analysis. Best-selling chess author, German International Grandmaster Karsten Muller, annotates each game of the player many believe to be the greatest of all time. All 736 serious tournament games are supplemented by crosstables of every major tournament and match in which Fischer participated, dozens of archival photographs, along with brief comments and observations putting the play of the great champion into historical perspective.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vJBXDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Littlest Witness (Gallagher Justice, Book 1) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #549)","description":"The Littlest Witness by Amanda Stevens released on Dec 24, 1999 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OKW-0i8qFjEC&dq=The+Littlest+Witness+(Gallagher+Justice,+Book+1)+(Harlequin+Intrigue+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rita Aero's Walt Disney World : The Essential Guide to Amazing Vacations","description":"Rita Aero has completely revolutionized the concept of the Walt Disney World vacation, opening up the Magic Kingdom to fun-loving vacationers everywhere--singles, couples, business travelers, families with children--and becoming the ultimate authority on planning the perfect Walt Disney World getaway.

Through arctic wasteland, jungle, desert, and swamp, Nick pits himself against the elements and explains the geographical conditions that conspire to produce the world's harshest ecologies. He also discovers the various human quirks that people have evolved to make life at the edge bearable. In northern Greenland, Nick joins a group of Inuits hunting for narwhal, crucial to the group's survival, on the edge of fragile sea ice, while in the jungle he ventures into Congo's tropical forest, home of the Biaka pygmies. He joins the annual crossing of the Tenere desert by the women of the Tubu tribe to collect dates and then travels to Papua, one of the least explored places on earth, to find the Kombai people, a remote group of tree house dwellers above the Asmat region's flood plain. Extremes is Nick Middleton's amazing account of four of the most unwelcoming environments on earth. Can he pick up enough tips from the indigenous people of these locations to hack it at the very edge of human existence, or will his mid-latitude sensibilities forever let him down?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_GJpBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Monster Dots: Connect the Dots and Color","description":"Uncover dozens of weird and ghoulish creatures by connecting the dots.

As economic reform swept the People's Republic in the 1980s, visual propaganda ceased to depict the tanned and muscular labourers in a proletarian utopia, so typical of preceding decades. Instead, Western icons of progress and development were employed: high-speed bullet trains, spacecraft, high-rise buildings, gridlocked free-ways and projections of general affluence. Socialist Realism was phased out by design and mixed- media techniques that were influenced by Western advertising. This lavishly illustrated study traces the development of the style and content of the Chinese propaganda poster in the decade of reform, from its traditional origins to its use as a tool for political and economic purposes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hd8JEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus' Call to Discipleship (Understanding Jesus Today)","description":"The latest book in the successful Understanding Jesus Today series.

Here we learn how a poem by William Cowper heralds the arrival of the middle class; how snow science leads to existential questions of God and our place in the world; how the race to the poles marks the human drive to imprint meaning on a blank space. Gopnik s kaleidoscopic work ends in the present day, when he traverses the underground city in Montreal, pondering the future of Northern culture.

(Spirits of the Earth)","description":"Part 1. Aether is the Father of the Universe and the all-vivifying Spirit of Cosmic Matter. Myths always speak to those who listen. In Kosmos there are three higher principles: Chthonia (Chaos), ?ther (Zeus) and Chronos (Time). ?ther is the Spirit of Cosmic Matter, represented by Zeus, Osiris, and other androgynous deities; Astral Light is their shadow on earth. Fire is the unity of ?ther in its universality. But there are two Kosmic  Fires,  and a distinction is made between them in the Occult teachings. ?ther and H?mera are the light of the superior and the light of the inferior or terrestrial regions. ?therChaos?k??a is Deity. The ?ther of the Greeks is the ?k??a of the Hindus; the Ether of modern physics is one of ?ther s subdivisions on our plane. ?ther and Chaos (Plato s Mind and Matter) are the two primeval and eternal principles of the universe, utterly independent of anything else. ?ther is the all-vivifying intellectual principle; Chaos, a shapeless liquid principle, without  form or sense,  from the union of which two sprung into existence the Universe the first androgynous deity   the chaotic matter becoming its body, and ?ther its soul. ChaosTheosKosmos are aspects of the Unknown Space. Deity, in the shape of ?therChaos?k??a, Soul of the Universe and noumenon of Astral Light, pervades all things. The Theurgists called it the Living Fire, and the Spirit of Light. The science of physics, and of metaphysics for that matter, know nothing of ?ther. Yet Father-?ther is re-welcomed with open arms; and wedded to gravitation. ?ther is the source and cause of all forces, whether cohesive, chemical, thermal, electric, or magnetic. ?ther is septenary, whether ?k??a is meant by the term, or its lower principle   Ether. ?k??a is the Matrix of the Universe and the  Mysterium Magnum,  from which all that exists is born by separation or differentiation: it is the cause of existence; it fills the infinite Space; and is Space itself, in one sense. But as the finite within the Infinite, this light must have its shadowy side   the  Astral Light,  which is no light. Individual human beings can overpower that  fatal light  but only by the holiness of their lives, and by acts of kindness and brotherly love. In Buddhism there are no compulsory beliefs. We are to believe only when the writing, doctrine, or teaching is corroborated by our own reason and consciousness. But then, we have to act accordingly and abundantly. Nihil is synonym for the impersonal divine Principle, the Infinite All, which is neither  being  nor  thing.  It is the Parabrahman of the Ved?ntist, The One Life of the Buddhist,  That  of the Chh?ndogya Upanishad, the Ain-Soph of the Kabbalah, The Absolute of Hegel. Lord Buddha taught that the Primitive Substance is eternal and unchangeable. Its vehicle is the pure, luminous ?ther, boundless, infinite Space   still a creation of m?y?. Mastery of Buddhist dogmas can be attained only by following the Platonic deductive method, i.e., proceeding from universals to particulars. In Buddhist philosophy annihilation implies only a dispersion of matter in whatever form or semblance of form it may be. Even our astral bodies, pure ether, are but illusions of matter, so long as they retain their terrestrial outline. ?ther is incorruptible. The spirits of creatures, who are emanations of the most sublimated portions of ?ther, are Breaths not forms. The body of Jesus was abandoned to the earth while Christos, the Inner Man, was clothed with a luminous body made up of ?ther. Part 2. Ether is the Mother of differentiated matter vivified by the formless Fire of Aether. When we recall pictures from the ether, the returning current meeting the outgoing wave of crystallised sound takes it up by magnetic attraction, and returns to us simultaneously the images of the past and the vibrations of its sounds. Each particle of matter is the register of all that has happened and previsionally apprehends even unspoken thought which, once conceived, displaces the particles of the brain by setting them in motion, and scatters its ideas throughout the universe, thus impressing them indelibly upon the eternal and boundless expanse of ether. The Divine Intellect is veiled in man. His animal brain alone philosophizes. When  astral light  circulates in harmony with the divine spirit, the occult powers of plants, animals, and minerals magically sympathize with the  superior natures,  and the divine soul of man attunes with the  inferior  ones. But during the barren periods, the latter lose their magic sympathy, and the spiritual sight of the majority of mankind is so blinded as to lose every notion of the innate powers of its divine lineage and essence. Spirit is the personal god of each mortal and his only divine element. The dual soul, on the contrary, is semidivine, i.e., potentially divine. It is only when the human individuality, soiled with earthly impurities, overcomes separateness and identifies itself with the divine intelligence within, that the aroma of personal experience can become immortal. Although invisible, thought is a material force. Let the least cerebral motion reverberate in the Ether of Space and it will produce a disturbance reaching to infinity. ?k??a is not the Holy Ghost, because it would then be Shekh?nah (M?laprakriti). ?k??a is the noumenon of the Cosmic Septenary, whose soul is Ether. Ether is the lining of ?k??a, and ?k??a is the Anima Mundi and Mother of Kosmos. ?k??a, whose lowest form is the Ether of Space, is entirely different from the medium of Science. Fire is the Spirit of Deity, the active, male, generative principle; and Ether, the Soul of Matter, is the light of the Fire, the passive female principle from which everything in this Universe emanated. Hence, Ether or  Water  is Mother, and Fire is Father. Sound is the characteristic of ?k??a (Ether): it generates air, the property of which is touch, and which, by friction, generates colour and light. The ether of Science is the grossest manifestation of ?k??a, though on our plane, it is the seventh principle of the astral light, and three degrees higher than  radiant matter.  When ether penetrates or informs something, it may be molecular because it takes on the form of the latter, and its atoms inform the particles of that  something.  We may perhaps call matter  crystallised ether.  There is no such things as light, heat, sound, or electricity. There is nothing but radiant energy due to one thing   Motion of Ether. Modern Science may divide its hypothetically conceived ether in as many ways as it likes; the real Ether of Space, i.e., ?ther, will remain as it is throughout. Ether is the vibrating sound-board in Nature, in all of her seven differentiations. Where there was no Ether there would be no sound. The  Astral Light,  or Ether of Space, preserves the images of all beings and things on its sensitised waves. An occult explanation of  Spirit  photographs is that they are objective copies from subjective photographs impressed upon the ether, and constantly thrown out by our thoughts, words, and deeds. There exists an infinite ocean of ether, in which all material substance floats, and through which are transmitted all forces in the physical universe. So long as  Spirit  photography, instead of being regarded a science, is presented to the public as a new revelation from the God of Israel and Jacob, the jury will go on deliberating much longer. The mediumistic rapping is a correlation of vital force, emitted from the person of the rapper, with the potential energy of the ether. Cyprianus, the reformed sorcerer of Antioch, confessed that he knew of the Chald?an division of ether into parts. Part 3. The Seven Cosmic Elements, with their numberless sub-Elements, are modifications of One Element. There is but One Element in Nature, and at its rootless root is Deity. The so-called Seven Elements, of which five have already manifested and asserted their existence, are the fabric veiling Deity. Father-?ther has pre-eminence over, and is the synthesis of, all elements. Chaos-Theos-Kosmos is Unknown Space, producing the four primary Elements, which are known on the terrestrial plane as Seven Cosmic Elements. The attempt to derive God from the Anglo-Saxon word  good  is an abandoned idea. God is J?d, a phallic hook. He may be the creator of physical man,  out of nothing,  but not the spark of divine intelligence that  fell  in order to make animal man divine. The Seven  immortal gods who give birth and life to all  are constantly forming matter under the never-ceasing impulse of the One Element. The Seven Cosmic Elements, with their numberless sub-Elements, are modifications and aspects of the One and only Element. Four are entirely physical, and the fifth (Ether) semi-material. ?k??a, of which Ether is the grossest form, is the Fifth Cosmic Principle which corresponds to, and from which unfolds, the human Manas. The first four numbers in German are named after four elements. But the Ancients represented the world by five elements. Had they been ignorant of the heterogeneity of the elements they would have had no personifications of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and ?ther. Of the Seven Elements on our Earth, four are now fully manifested, while the fifth   Ether   is only partially so, as we are hardly in the second half of the Fourth Round and, consequently, the Fifth Element will manifest fully only in the Fifth Round. It will only be in the next, or Fifth Round, that Ether, the gross body of ?k??a, will become a familiar fact of Nature to all men, as air is familiar to us now. Cosmic Elements are the noumena of the terrestrial elements.  Water  is Matter in its precosmic state. Ether contains all other states of matter and their properties. The  waters  of creation are not the liquid we know, but ?ther   the Fiery Waters of Invisible Space. Fohat is the  Son of ?ther,  in its highest aspect. From Mahat-Intelligence proceeds ether; from ether, air; from air, heat; from heat, water; and from water, earth with everything on her. ?ther is universal Fire   imponderable power and potency. Ether is one of Seven Cosmic Principles. ?k??a is the synthesis of ?ther; and Ether, an aspect of ?k??a. The Astral Light is no  light,  it is the dark side of Ether, teeming with conscious, semi-conscious, and unconscious entities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YnmQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The tyranny of testing","description":"Hoffmann's complete and well-documented account of the failings and dangers of mechanical testing illustrates the inherent flaws in aptitude and achievement tests. It demonstrates the inadequacies of multiple-choice testing, in which candidates simply choose answers and need not justify their replies, revealing the tests' inclination to reward superficiality rather than subtlety and creativity. Aimed at teachers and others involved in education, this polemic exposes the corporate testing giants whose dubious claims to scientific accuracy shield them from public scrutiny.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=shpqlwNVyt8C&dq=The+tyranny+of+testing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grzimek's animal life encyclopedia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Between the Heartbeats: Poetry and Prose by Nurses","description":"An anthology of poems and prose writings in which nurses reflect on their everyday experiences and their reactions to the joys and tragedies they witness on a daily basis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4_RZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Between+the+Heartbeats:+Poetry+and+Prose+by+Nurses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hulk/Wolverine: 6 Hours (Hulk Legends, Vol. 1)","description":"This work provides an extensive guide for students, fans, and collectors of Marvel Comics.

This book follows her bestselling Outsmarting the Female Fat Cell, customizing the program for women ages 35 to 55. The book is easy to read, makes difficult concepts simple to understand, and has helpful checklists to keep you on track. Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell explains the role of fat cells before and during menopause and why midlife weight gain is such a pervasive problem. A woman's 30 billion fat cells get bigger and \\"more stubborn\\" during midlife, explains Waterhouse, because when they detect a lowered estrogen level, they step in to produce more estrogen and get larger as they get more active. Dieting doesn't work; instead of slimming your body, it thins your hair, muscles, skin, bones--and thinking. To combat these effects, Waterhouse explains how to work with your new menopausal physiology to minimize weight gain. You learn strategies of attitude, exercise, eating habits (including dealing with cravings), food choices, and stress management. For example, exercise at midlife fights fatigue, reduces mental sluggishness, improves sleep, stabilizes moods, reduces the severity of hot flashes, strengthens bones, and reduces the risk of breast cancer and heart disease.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=exlzQO523ZMC&dq=Outsmarting+the+Midlife+Fat+Cell:+Winning+Weight+Control+Strategies+for+Women+Over+35+to+Stay+Fit+Through+Menopause&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The affair at Royalties","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NrUYAAAACAAJ&dq=The+affair+at+Royalties&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Politics of Passion: Women's Sexual Culture in the Afro-Surinamese Diaspora (Between Men~Between Women: Lesbian and Gay Studies)","description":"The Politics of Passion centers on an old institution among the Afro-Surinamese working class in which women have multiple sexual relationships with both men and women. These women reject marriage because of the bonds of dependency it fosters, preferring to create their own families of kin, lovers, and children. Gloria Wekker analyzes this phenomenon, known as mati work, as she vividly describes the lives of Afro-Surinamese women. She gives an account of women's sexuality that is not limited to either heterosexuality or same-sex sexuality. Her work offers new perspectives on black women's sexuality, the lives of Caribbean women, transnational gay and lesbian movements, and an Afro-Surinamese tradition that challenges conventional Western notions of marriage, gender, and sexuality. By foregrounding the voices of Afro-Surinamese women, Wekker illuminates these women's daily lives in light of the changes occurring in Surinamese society. She also considers the historical, religious, psychological, economic, linguistic, cultural, and political elements that have shaped their lives. The book concludes with stories of women who have migrated to the Netherlands, where they have created new, vibrant mati communities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FoK-AwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Politics+of+Passion:+Women%27s+Sexual+Culture+in+the+Afro-Surinamese+Diaspora+(Between+Men~Between+Women:+Lesbian+and+Gay+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twelve Seasons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jgRbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Twelve+Seasons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Beisbol: Travels Through the Pan-American Pastime","description":"Investigates the national fascination with baseball in Central America, the many ways in which the game and baseball culture differ from North American versions, and the meaning of baseball to Pan-American sensibility","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ETw-igmBYosC&dq=El+Beisbol:+Travels+Through+the+Pan-American+Pastime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sports illustrated scuba diving (The Sports illustrated library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qOLYzQEACAAJ&dq=Sports+illustrated+scuba+diving+(The+Sports+illustrated+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rescue Of Ranor","description":"Having no magic powers of his own, Sven Pentalion enlists the help of a white witch and her familiar, a goblin demon, to help rescue his brother from a powerful Black Enchanter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2vK8AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Rescue+Of+Ranor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood and Money","description":"New York Times Bestseller: The  gripping  true story of a beautiful Texas socialite, her ambitious husband, and a string of mysterious deaths (Los Angeles Times).
