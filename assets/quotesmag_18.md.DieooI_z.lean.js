These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"That Hideous Strength\\", the third volume in Lewis's \\"Space Trilogy\\", stands as central novel of his that gives me the most pleasure in reading it. While \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is certainly his best work, \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is the central novel in my own imagination that I most sympathize with in terms of where I want to go with my own fiction.There is so much in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" that absolutely fascinates me, and much of the themes I also want to deal with in my own fiction. The abuse of language stands as one of the most terrifying elements in the novel. Wither stands as one of my personal favorites on the side of the N. I. C. E, as does Fairy Hardcastle. Wither is very developed and incredibly diabolical, and Fairy is a very masculine woman involved in sadistic police torture. The Nazis have a very strong place in this work. Much of the more hideous and hellish scenes in this book comes from the inclusion of the N. I. C. E as the dominant villainy that works evil throughout the text. Much of what they want to do tie into the Nazi movements, and each are equally terrible.The inclusion of Merlin makes it a much more interesting text, for there is the key theme of Nature against Anti-Nature, and Merlin very much is in harmony with Nature. What makes this such a strong work is that each group parallels the other, and wherever there is a vision of total evil there also stands an equally dramatic picture of that which is good.One thing that the critics seem to really harp on is the fact that this text has such a complex structure, but for myself that is one of the most exciting things about it. It is the fact that Lewis manages such a huge cast of characters, and does so rather well, that makes this one of my favorite of his novels, and certainly my pick for the Space Trilogy.While I respect \\"Perelandra\\" and find it a very fine artistic effort, it is this book that I keep picking up to reread when I make my jaunts through Lewis's imaginative gauntlets. This is truly the most fascinating of the \\"Space Trilogy\\".(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". I have published newly written reviews of \\"The Space Trilogy\\" composed long after I wrote the three original reviews of Lewis's science fiction.)..-----[In Late 1999 or early 2000 I also wrote this abandoned, unfinished review to \\"That Hideous Strength\\"]The first time I've heard of the trilogy, it was from a pastor's wife. I was only then reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS (this was back in 1994), and I decided I would try it. Being a fan of Narnia (although I do not like Lion nearly as much as the others), I figured this would be good also.THAT HIDEOUS STRENGHT, which is longer than the other two books combined, is a book like no other I've read. Its main weakness is it jumps from modern to mythical too soon. It is a novel of ideas, and then at the climax the story becomes mythical, with a violent ending. Also, Lewis assumes to much of the readers on the matter of Merlin. Merlin was an incubus, and had no father."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I am an avid reader of sci-fi and fantasy and finding good books that are Christian in that genre can be difficult. This is the third in a series called Lewis' \\"Space Trilogy.\\" The first two books, though set on other planets are more along the lines of works of fantasy than sci-fi. This one follows suit, though not set in space. It is set in post WW2 England and deals with a rich cast of characters facing an evil that wants to take over the country and ultimately the world. I highly recommend reading the first two books, Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra before you read this one but it is not necessary to do so as enough is explained that the reader won't feel lost without having done so. Lewis is a wonderful writer who gets the reader personally involved in the story and characters. I was so excited when this came out on Kindle and not simply as an audio book. I hadn't read it since I was a child, and gained a whole new understanding of the theology and issues that Lewis deals with in the book. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I enjoyed this book. As the third part of the Space Trilogy, it is VERY different in style. Whereas the first two basically follow the adventures of the main character Ransom on other planets, this one is set on earth, and follows a much larger set of characters with a more complex plot. It reads much more like a contemporary novel, switching between multiple threads of the plot, from several different character's points of view.Relative to the other two novels, this plot is downright labyrinthine, with a grand conspiracy to take over Britain and ultimately the world. On the surface this is a secular progressive movement, but below the surface are demonic elements (the dark eldila that we learn about in the previous books). Supernatural elements aside, the crazy plot with conspiracies within conspiracies reminds me of a Robert Ludlum novel (of course predating Ludlum by a few decades), and also (like classic Ludlum) the body count gets pretty high. Some of the occult elements of the conspiracy, and some of the serious-silliness also reminded me a bit of \\"Foucalt's Pendulum\\", although from a very different point of view from that novel. The whole plot is rather melodramatic, almost campy, and in parts Lewis's writing is rather cheeky, but this is also interspersed with more straightforward CS Lewis insights and thoughts into this, that, or the other thing (he's surprisingly insightful on marriage and relationships for a man who was a bachelor for most of his life). At times the plot suffers a bit under its own weight - there are some little strands that don't really go anywhere, and some characters that don't really matter, and some loose ends that don't quite get tied up. Lewis clearly likes his animal characters, but I found all the stuff with the bear and the other critters a bit silly and overdone. I also think the story could have been tighter as a standalone novel, without it being part of the \\"Space Trilogy\\" mythos, with the eldila and Oyeresu and Ransom and what not.As with the first two parts of the trilogy, a central theme is the dangers of \\"Modernism\\" or \\"Progressivism\\". With the larger cast of characters (vs just Weston as the main antagonist in the first two), Lewis gets to skewer many more caricatures of Modern thought. His main target remains scientific Materialism, but the bad guys include all manner of \\"Progressive\\" sociological thought (circa 1940s). It is striking how much of it rings true today, like we're still having the same debates, and the materialists and progressives of today are not that far removed from those of Lewis's day. I also thought Mark Studdock was an interesting character; I think he symbolizes all of Lewis's fears and suspicions of young academics (Lewis was a fairly senior professor by the time he published this). Studdock is thoroughly Modern in every respect, and as a result is continuously buffeted and blown about, going one direction and then another, always on the outside trying to be on the inside of something, anything. There's a quote, I'm not sure about the real attribution, about not being so open-minded that your brain falls out, and I think this is what Lewis has in mind with his portrain of Studdock. As I've read through the Space Trilogy, I really get the feeling that a lot of the characters and philosophies that Lewis disdains are drawn directly from Lewis's experiences with his fellow academics. It really comes through in this book - you get the feeling that Lewis wrote large parts of this book while sitting through interminable faculty meetings at Oxford.An interesting little tidbit is that Lewis borrows (or perhaps appropriates?) his friend Tolkien's concept of Numinor (Lewis's acknowledgment at the start of the book is amusing!) Now Lewis's book was published probably 6 or 8 years before The Lord of the Rings, and I suspect that the way Lewis ties in Numinor fairly literally with both our contemporary history as well as (for the purposes of this novel) a \\"historical\\" Arthurian Britain is probably not what Tolkien envisioned. It's a very minor part of the book (Numinor is mentioned by name only a couple of times) but I do wish Lewis would have skipped that, or just made up a different name for a mythical prehistorical age that fit the conception in this story."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is the second best novel I've ever read. It was a little difficult to read the first time, but then again I was twelve and wasn't so familiar with certain parts of the Arthurian Legend at the time. I have read it several times since then, however, I have only read the first two books of the Space Trilogy once. I have mentioned that this is the second best novel, the first would also be by C.S. Lewis. It is TILL WE HAVE FACES: A MYTH RETOLD.While many of his books are far more popular than THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH and TILL WE HAVE FACES, these two books are certainly his best works, and some of the best works in the English language. However, I must warn that if you are a Lewis fan and have read the Chronicles, you might find these much more difficult to read."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"A truly stunning book! Interesting how this book seems to be getting either 5 stars or 1 star. Like the story itself, there is polarization, no middle ground. This satirical comedy blends brilliant characters with an accelerating plot. The BEST thing is the true-life charecterization of the &quot;bad guys&quot; and the &quot;good guys&quot;. Modern 2-D writers paint the bad guys as blatent, psycopathic killers from the get-go. Lewis' bad guys are killers in disguise: socially acceptable, educated sophisticates who have literally duped themselves and they all distrust and despise each other. The good guys (i.e., &quot;fat Mrs. Dimble saying her prayers&quot;) are human, but trying really hard to do right.The second-best thing is all the spiritual/biblical parallels and symbols. It makes a powerful backdrop for Christians and a nagging echo, with a ring of truth, for atheists (or what Lewis called, &quot;materialists&quot;).The third-best thing was comedy. This was the funniest book I've ever read, but it's really not a comedy, no matter how you slice it. I can't remember the last time a mere book brought laughter to the point of tears and loss of bodily function (real-Merlin-fake Merlin and the banquet speeches at Belbury). Read 'em and weep."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"After reading or rereading the first two excellent books in C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy-- Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra -- it is almost impossible to keep from reading this book, its conclusion. Unfortunately, while the first two grow better with each rereading, this one grows more tedious. Mind you if you have never read it, do so. I am just suggesting that it is the weakest link. Lewis needs no praise and will not be diminished by any adverse criticism from me. He is intelligent, insightful, psychologically acute, imaginative, clever, urban, witty and literate, and everyone knows it. It is just that in this book he does it all a bit too much. This is the story of an impeding battle between the forces of good and evil. But what a cast of characters: archangelic beings, macrobes, a contraceptive subterranean lunar race, the Fisher King who is also Pendragon, a seeress of the House of Tudor, Merlin, magic out of Numinor the true West, a fortune inherited from an Indian Christian mystic, a Scottish skeptic, a menagerie of animals, earthly avatars of heavenly spirits, an institute the figurative and literal Head of which is a decapitated or rather decorporated mad scientist through which unearthly powers speak, and Withers the dithering deputy director who is so vague and obscurantist that one wonders how people in the evil institute (with the ironic acronymic name of NICE) even manage to put on their pants in the morning never mind engineer the extinction of the whole human race and the conquest of the entire universe. Add to all these of course the merely human elements of brutal police, ambitious and pretentious academics, narrow minded politicians and scientists. Lewis seems to want to pull it all together in one volume; he has everything here except moderation. And when the denouement comes, less than a handful of the evil are really in on it all, and almost none of the good forces are really needed. It is all very anticlimactic. There is a clever description of the politics of a small college, and a good recognition scene where Pendragon discovers himself to Merlin, and an initialllly enjoying citation of the maundering style of Withers (which CS seems to have so delighted in that he persisted in presenting it all through the text until it eventually becomes vastly annoying). Lots of insights too on every one of his favorite topics and pointed criticism on all his pet peeves, but do they all really need to be gathered here together? As in Perelandra this is an explicitly and essentially Christian book, possibly making the work of less appeal to readers who do not share that faith. And his attitude to the feminine, perhaps acceptable in his own day, is just too patronizing today. As I say, do read it, but it is by far the weakest of the three books."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I have been a life-long C.S. Lewis fan, and first tackled this book when I was probably about 12, returning to it often throughout the years (I am now 32). One of my favorite passages concerns the descent of the Eldila (especially Jupiter) into St. Anne's, although I thoroughly enjoyed the work as a whole. It can be a bit slow-going in parts, and definitely is &quot;British&quot; in numerous of its references, but all in all it's a great end to the series and a very instructive and entertaining story. Two quick comments here: an earlier reviewer wondered why Merlin was necessary and couldn't anyone have taken his role upon themselves. Lewis writes in the book how Merlin was needed because in life he had opened himself to the influence of spiritual powers in a way others hadn't, and that &quot;opening&quot; was what made him uniquely suited to the needs of the situation in the novel. As to the other reviewer's comments about Lewis not knowing a thing about women, and his views on contraception, it would seem that a fairer statement would be that Lewis' views did not correspond to the reviewer's, rather than a condemning statement about his views. I say this especially since I know many women who have absolutely no problem whatsoever with the views Lewis articulates in the book. Happy reading to all!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"'Out of the Silent Planet' was set on Mars, 'Perelandra' on Venus, so it is almost inevitable that 'That Hideous Strength' is set on Earth. Having journeyed through the Heavens, Ransom is now involved with a group of people, most of them Christians, in dealing with a demonically influenced organisation which has plans to eridicate the human race. Although Ransom is no longer the main character in this story, the others who take centre stage, notably the Studdocks, more than make up for this. The storyline is pacy with the occasional twist, and the characters, whilst some may not be three dimensional, certainly grab your attention. Definetly worth reading"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"C.S. Lewis proves here that he could have been the century's greatest novelist, had he ever attempted anything outside of genre fiction. Brilliant social commentary, perfect character studies, and a litany of Lewis' pet peeves (everything from postmodernism, feminism and sociology to vivisection and clear-cutting) are only some of the reasons to read this book. It's also entertaining, though odd (and some of the fantasy elements don't mix well)."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Don't want to start out by criticizing another book, but if you are looking for a theological, eschatological work that also manages to be literature, then pick this over LB series. This book is the third in Lewis' Space Trilogy, and the only one that takes place on our own fallen world. As he does in \\"The Last Battle\\" in the Chronicles of Narnia; he tackles the question of how will this whole thing end? Our protagonist to answer this question is a somewhat lightweight \\"modern\\" academe, whose main goal in life seems to be to achieve recognition in continually less desirable circles. It is one of the many valuable life insights that Lewis works into his stories. Slow starting, the book picks up the pace as the sides begin to take shape, and as the inevitable collision between good and evil, with some highly unusual twists takes place. The last fifty pages or so are among the best that I've read in my reading life. Ten stars would hardly be enough to rate this book. One of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"\\"That Hideous Strength\\" (1945) is the third book in the Space Trilogy, but in many ways it is completely different than the first two books: \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" (1938) and \\"Perelandra\\" (1943). The first two books are written almost exclusively from the perspective of Dr. Ransom, but in this book it is usually Mark or Jane Studdock's perspective and never Dr. Ransom's. The first two books were fairly short novels, but this one is longer than both of the first two combined. The first two books take the reader to Mars (Malacandra) and Venus (Perelandra), but this book stays on Earth (Thulcandra). The first two books have a single protagonist, while this book has a group trying to work together.The story is set in post-war England in a small university town (Edgestow). Mark Studdock is a young professor who seems driven to always make his way into the inner circle. His wife, Jane, is being troubled by some disturbing dreams which the reader soon learns are clairvoyant. Through the early part of the book, Mark is pulled into the group N.I.C.E. (National Institute for Coordinated Experiments), while his wife finds herself pulled toward the group of heroes which oppose them. Much of the novel is about the gathering of the forces. Mark is drawn to N.I.C.E. by his ambition, but he does question many of the actions and thus finds himself in a tenuous position. Jane does not want to oppose Mark, but when N.I.C.E. tries to arrest her she has little choice but to go with the other side.There are some very interesting aspects of this book, and it definitely takes some chances in bringing in the King Arthur story and blending it with the Eldil story established in the first two books of the series. Lewis is clearly talking about fascism in many places in this book. For example, N.I.C.E.'s goals include elimination of people they consider backward and selective breeding. They control the state functions such as the police, as well as industry, educational institutions and the media. Lewis also takes aim at materialism and how it is ultimately incompatible with ethics. Lewis brings in some religious themes as well, such as the Tower of Babel scene near the end where the leaders of N.I.C.E. are no longer able to understand each other's language. In fact, the books title is taken from a poem and refers to the Tower of Babel.There were also some things which did not work for me in this novel. I did not understand why he felt it necessary to make Lord Feverstone in this story be the same person as Mr. Devine in \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". He never makes use of that aspect, and the two characters do not really act the same way. The story also takes a long time to develop, and it probably would have been better served to move the story forward at a quicker pace as he did in the first two books. That being said, Lewis did turn this around from what I thought was the weak-link in the series, \\"Perelandra\\". This book was nominated for the Retro Hugo in 1996 for novels written in the year 1945."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"All right, there are problems with this book. Lewis' NICE conquers not only England, but the entire world, while the world hardly seems to notice or care. Lewis never has been able to describe any organization that included more than a pub-full of members convincingly. His &quot;international conspiracy&quot; comes off a bit like Spectre without the pirhanhas or pretty girls. He tries McPhee out in the role of house skeptic and house clown, but he doesn't really work in either. And Lewis can't seem to make up his mind if he wants his good guys to practice Christian miracles or pagan magic; where in the Bible do angels possess people? (Comes of hanging around Charles Williams, I guess.)So why do I keep on reading the book? Partly because, like a stew, I can push the ingrediants I don't like to the side. And partly because the book contains some tasty little stylistic and conceptual tidbits, like the proper names, which Lewis fills out with some classic parody, the fun of bringing Merlin back to modern England, and the contrast between the tramp and the magician in the climactic scene.But as Lewis said of Macdonald, the preaching, which would be a defect in other books, is what really saves this one, in my opinion. That Hideous Strength shows a remarkable understanding of the mechanisms of human depravity and redemption. The book is far better on this score than George orwell's antiutopian classic, 1984. Moreover, there are some wonderfully prophetic and insightful passages. The book has, in my opinion, aged extremely well, as technology and the New Age movement have taken the old dream of man as God to new levels in recent years. Was NICE a prophecy of what computer and biotech geniuses are going to do with the human mind in the 21st Century? We'll wait and see."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Lewis' apocolyptic vision of where mankind is headed hits far closer to the mark than the more widely read visions such as Brave New World and 1984. This is because Lewis recognizes that the evil lies not in technology or even politics but in the human heart.Lewis also shows a deeper understanding of how society functions -- as an investigative researcher I can vouch for the accuracy of his portrayal of how nefarious organizations manipulate the press, for example. He grasps what other writers never even seem to comprehend -- that it is the small choices made daily that lead down the path to Hell.As philosophy, as social commentary, or as a rolicking good story, That Hideous Strength is a compelling read."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Lewis' book is the modern story of *sacred England*, which is, apparently, called &quot;Logres&quot;..of the legacy of King Arthur, in Service to the Christ-Consciousness.(And every nation, he tells us, has its &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;profane&quot; traditions, and its own Story.) Lewis &quot;wakes up&quot; Merlin the Magician and brings him into the 20th century, and enables the reader to accept, as well as know, him. And the same is true for the novelist's wonderful characterization of a *bear* who plays a very big part in the story. And many other beautifully drawn human (&quot;all TOO human&quot;, in some cases) characters.This book is one of the greatest visionary novels I have ever read (or, in this case, listened to on tape.) The last cassette is almost inexpressively, *impossibly* beautiful. It expresses a vision of Harmony among all the Kingdoms of Evolution, and a Harmony of a Sacred Chain of Being that leads through all these Kingdoms and Beyond, into realms one might call &quot;the realms of the gods&quot;, of &quot;Cosmic Astrology&quot; with the planets as living beings, all within One Living God. Hearing it is in a way an entering of Paradise. A Sacrament.I thought I would select a few passages to share:from the 11th cassette: &quot;She comes more near the Earth than she was wont to, to make Earth sane. Peralandra (note: the goddess Venus) is all about us, and Man is no longer isolated. We are now as we ought to be: between the angels, who are our elder brothers, and the beasts, who are our jesters, servants, and playfellows.&quot;from the 9th cassette: In this heighth, and depth, and breadth, the little idea of herself which she had hitherto called &quot;me&quot;, dropped down and vanished, unfluttering, into bottomless distance, like a bird in space, without air. The name &quot;me&quot; was the name of a being whose existence she had never suspected: a being that! did not yet fully exist, but whose existence was demanded. It was a person--not the person she had thought--yet also a thing: a *made* thing. Made to please Another, and in Him, to please all others..a thing being made at this very moment, without its choice, in a shape it had never dreamed of.from the 11th: &quot;Go, in obedience, and you will find love.&quot;ps: I just found the tapes to OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET, the *1st* volume of this trilogy. _______"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Secular humanists will loathe it, but this is a great book.

The atmosphere reminded me a lot of \\"1984,\\" but with an ending I felt was more consistent with my beliefs as a Christian and a bit more uplifting.

They're young, and figuring things out for themselves - figuring themselves out. The crisis that moves them through this process is the disintegration of their little university hamlet by dark powers of technology.C.S. Lewis was a bachelor at the time he wrote this, and a man's man and academic to boot, yet he portrays a sympathetic and believable Jane, the young new wife. His portrayal of Mark, her academic don husband, is less sympathetic and more caricature like. But however realistic they are, the story is a page turner. Lewis pens fantastic dialogue, while slowly racheting up the suspense, and unraveling the complicated tale.The story brings together several threads of Lewis' work: the space travels of Harry Ransom, the protagonist of Perelandra and Out of the Silent Planet; his piercing focus on the workings of human conscience and rationlization; and British legend and mythology.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"While this book had all the elements that I loved in the previous two books (satire, allegory, poetic description), it was really lacking the cohesion of the other two and was generally a disappointing end to theSpace Trilogy 3 Book Set Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra & That Hideous Strength C.S. Lewis. Lewis seems very caught up in the politics of academia for the first third of the book, and then suddenly remembers the fantasy genre. The last third of the book features a rather anti-climactic battle that seemed to be a pastiche of several different mythologies.All that said, there is still a lot of value in the book. There are some deftly drawn characters unlike anything I've read in other literature of the 1940s. Lewis' investigation of the complexities of marriage, while it does not go far enough, asks important questions that blend faith and sociology in provocative ways.If you have readOut of the Silent Planet (Space Trilogy, Book One)andPerelandra (Space Trilogy, Book 2)I would recommend that you finish the trilogy, if for no other reason than plot continuity. I will say that this book does not stand alone as one of Lewis' better works."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"The N.I.C.E. (Nat'l Inst. for Controlled Experiments) wants that part of Bracton College's land that is said to contain the body of Merlin. Mark Studdock is drawn into the N.I.C.E, whose temporary headquarters are elsewhere, even as his wife Jane sees at first hand the things the N.I.C.E is doing. The two follow different paths throughout the book, each on different sides without realizing it. And it turns out that Merlin never really died, and furthermore, really was buried at Bracton College....The plot is much more complex than that, but that's the skeleton, stripped completely of flesh so as not to give away any surprises. The characterizations are good--some great. Jane is good--Mark is much better; literature has seldom had such a likeable twerp. Feverstone, Curry, Dimble, Ivy, the tramp, are all good. (McPhee, criticised as being 'unidimensional' by a previous reviewer, is, ironically enough, based on a man Lewis knew well.) Some of the best parts of the book are those that describe the politicking that goes on at Bracton and at N.I.C.E, and amusing little comments are strewn regularly throughout the text. However, the same previous reviewer is right on the mark in saying that the change in Ransom is both disappointing and unexplained, and I personally find some of Lewis's remarks on men and women grating. Some are funny, as when Jane wonders when Mark will really be back, thinking, 'for when men say that they will be away two days they mean that that is the minimum, and they hope to be away a week.'The way Jane despises women who shop for a new hat to comfort themselves and then turns right around and does the same thing is good too. What grates is the author's placid assumption, not that masculinity is good, but that it is the highest good, and that good spiritual beings grow more masculine as they grow more spiritual and perfect. That sort of thing can be ignored, however, especially on the second time through, and it's a rare reader who won't want ot read this book again. And then again."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This was by far my favorite of the trilogy (Perlandria was my least). First off, it is almost a misnomer to call them a trilogy. The style, feel, and even genre of this book is different than the other two. Lewis says that in the introduction, reading the other two is not even required to read this one (although it certainly does help, and I recommend very highly doing so).A lot of people are quick to criticize this book for the occasional slow part, the lack of focus on the main character of the other two, and having too much philosophy and ideals stuffed into too small a space.My main comment is that this book has to be read slowly. Lewis calls it a \\"Fairy tale for grown ups\\", but it is much more. There is so much philosophy, theology, social commentary and satire in there that if read as a quick fling sci fi or fantasy book, most of the point of it is missed. It encapsulates post-war england in a way that is truly striking: the hopes, the fears, the cynicism.I read this fast the first time, and thought a lot of it was kinda slow, but the end was great (but should have been longer), and that was that. But for some reason, in the years since I had read it the first time, it kept popping up in my mind. Situations from it would come out of nowhere, and whisper lessons to my mind.So, I just re-read it, but with much more intensity of thought, and time, and have completely fallen in love. It borders on the prophetic, in its strongest parts. And those are not in the action parts. The messages it bears are legion, if we are careful enough to listen!"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Well, this was very disappointing. In the final chapter of C.S. Lewis' space trilogy, he completely abandons almost everything that made the first two novels interesting. First, Dr. Ransom, the main character from the last books, is no longer the main character. Rather, two new characters, Mark and Jane, are the ones the reader sees most of the story through. Also, Lewis abandons most of the space theme as the characters stay Earthbound, losing much of the awe and wonder that characterized the settings of the first two novels. He also is way too analytical in this book as he is trying to refute some of the themes that make up the modern sci-fi movement of his time, as characterized by Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Really, this book is nearly 400 pages of debate, petty academic squabbles, and refutations, most of which hardly advances the story at all. And lastly, and perhaps the greatest tragedy of all, the entire story is anti-climatic. Not only do none of the characters really do anything to shape the story, but even Lewis admits, through the character of Dr. Ransom, that everyone was just observers and not movers. BORING! Still, some of the arguments that Lewis kicks around are interesting carry overs from the previous two novels, but this book completely failed as a story. Such a shame too. After \\"Perelandra,\\" this one had so much promise."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This trilogy may have been good if I read and spoke the King's English.

I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"It seems publishers are getting very sloppy with book printing. I purchased this book, along with the other two books in C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy and only one was printed without slanted text. I know it is only a paperback, and a $9.00 one at that, but money is being spent. I would recommend purchasing these Scribner books at a store (new or used) where you can purchase a copy that is not a defect. It defeats the purpose of a discount if the book is a defect. I believe the work of C.S. Lewis deserves better treatment. On a positive note, the cover design for this book, as well as for Perelandra and Out Of The Silent Planet, are very well done."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is not an easy book. Indeed its a badly disorganized book; the imagery is jumbled and confusing, the messages are difficult to disentangle, and the ending is confusing and leaves you wondering what moral Lewis was really trying to convey. And yet I love it. I often pick up and dip into at random, and marvel at the sparks of gold and deep haunting shadows on every page. Lewis melds the world of Arthurian mythology with the (to him) modern world of early post-war Britain, which itself now has a period charm of its own. On one side there is the world of the N.I.C.E. into which gullible Mark Studdock falls, its subtly perverted \\"scientific objectivity\\", the materialistic and nihilistic led by the satanically inspired, themselves the tools of the horrific \\"macrobes\\". On the other there hand is the Studdock's clarevoyant wife Jane and her new friends - the kingly Mr. Fisher-King, the homely Dennistons and Dimbles and the annoying but loveable McPhee. I love every last page - the descriptions of Bragdon Wood, the sad perversion of the \\"mad parson\\", the charismatic two-faced Feverston, the dunderheaded dons of the \\"Progressive Element\\", and who could forget Mr. Bultitude - \\"Last of the Seven Bears of Logres\\"?

While the sci-fi purist concept of a 'corporation' taking over and essentially looking to sterilize the planet and 'create the superior being' is well founded, Dr. Ransom's character really does little in this book other than 'sit and wait' for the higher forces to come to put a stop to it. The addition of Merlin was interesting insomuch as his dialog with Dr. Ransom, but the way in which he is sent to resolve the conflict at hand is a bit much, and to be honest entirely to grusome. Also, there is really little to no reason to empathize with the character of Mark, and Lewis' treatment of Jane is typically patriarchal to the point of (personal) insult. Even the fact that her name is &quot;jane&quot; (very non-entity-like) compared to &quot;Mark&quot; (apostle), is a bit much. But of course, that was part of the 'message' I was supposed to receive I suppose (being a female reader)."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Try and do a Jules Verne type story.

It deftly analyzes many of the problems of modern secular relationships and the secular state. But the ending is a complete deus ex machina. The killing off of all the various \\"evil\\" characters also feels a bit sadistic at times. There's never much suspense about how it will end. This might have been less of a problem if I was reading it as the conclusion of the trilogy, but Lewis says in the introduction that this can be read on it's own, if less profitably. The emphasis should probably be on \\"less profitably\\"."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I came to this trilogy late, thanks to a friend who gave me the first book for my birthday.

This third volume, though, is a bit different from the first two, where the hero travelled to other planets.

Since it was written many decades ago the advances of science and the shifts in society make it seem dated, but the book is still relevant since human nature and the results of a lust for power have not changed.

It clearly reflects CSLewis' bitterness about some aspects of his own academic career. The constant uncertainty of ones standing, the unceasing tension, the inbred community on whose foibles ones livelihood depends. And, of course, the book is an expression of the not-unreasonable anxiety response at the time by professors of (a certain type of) religious faith to the overwhelming competitive successes of the hi-tech fields, at explaining the world and at bringing money into the universities.CSL is very skillful at demonizing (literally) his intellectual opponents. As so often happens, the villians redeem what would otherwise be a stodgy book with a canned plot (Merlin lives! Science is demonic! Reanimating dead human body-parts is baaaaad!). The good guys, even, unfortunately, Ransom, are totally blah, as Lord Feverstone might say. CSL's pretentious patronizing at its worst. Read it for the quirky character-villians, fully worthy of a James Bond flick or the Brit late-sixties TV show \\"The Avengers\\". They include a sadistic lesbian (nicknamed \\"The Fairy\\") who runs a private security force consisting entirely of sexy young women in uniform. When has CSL ever written anything anywhere near this campy?Today in the USA the commercial religious right claims CSL as one of theirs. I'm not at all sure he would like this. (It's hard to picture him voting for Sarah Palin!) Then again he probably wouldn't appreciate the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" video games either.Four stars for vivid narration and entertaining personalities, especially John Wither, a master of rhetorical misdirection, meanlingless reassurances, and impossible-to-follow advice.

As this book was my second foray into C.S Lewis, (the first being the fantastic \\"'Till We Have Faces\\", I never understood where people get the idea that this work has heavy Christian overtones. If anything, it delves into paganism, and what appears to be precursors to Scientology and other UFO cults. If Christianity is a major facet in CS's works, then he may be exploring the underlying knowledge that manifests itself into the various, usually bloated religions, an effort that would otherwise result in his excommunication, or worse."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"To be fair, I only rate Lewis' conclusion of his trilogy a 3 in relation to the other two volumes. The first was excellent and profound. The second, Christian allegory much less exciting than the Bible or history. Here, almost second-rate fantasy. Maybe Lewis was expressing strongly-held beliefs. I'm sure that his true students must know a lot about what he thought in 1946--more than I do.It was certainly a horrible time to look backward into the then-recent past. Even as good a writer as Lewis could hardly do justice to the real-death story of Hitler's attack on the world, and what it took to fight him (murderous Stalin as ally, two nuclear bombs, and then welcoming German scientists to build the military space program against the heirs of that ally).Yes, That Hideous Strength is imaginative fantasy, well written in parts, and with a few interesting points about the nasty illusions we prop up to keep our world going as-is. But earthshaking? Unfortunately, not anymore."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"It seems that people either like That Hideous Strength the best or least of the Space Trilogy. I think the reason is that That Hideous Strength is very different than the other two books. It took me a couple of chapters to realize that this book was not going where Perelandra and Out of the Silent Planet went, but when I realized that I could enjoy the book on its own merits. In fact, this is my favorite book in the trilogy. Although a Christian theme runs throughout the trilogy, when it is presented in That Hideous Strength it becomes more accessible. The evil in the book could and does happen. The basic good in the book is no less extraordinary (with certain exceptions). The adventures of Ransom on other planets in the first two books of the trilogy were to prepare him for the battle on Earth in That Hideous Strenth. An interesting phenomenon of this book for me was that when I was reading about Mark and the N.I.C. E. I longed for the story to switch to Jane and the group at St. Anne's. The people at N.I.C.E. were so disagreeable and petty and backstabbing that it made me realize what C. S. Lewis was saying about the nature of evil (or the devil). This book can be read for its story alone, but it is much more rewarding if you think about the ideas and beliefs present as well.Even if you are not religious or a christian the book can inspire you to think about what you believe in."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I only recently discovered the Trilogy, never having been much of a Lewis fan, and read them in order. Each book has its charms, but I especially enjoyed the way That Hideous Strength built on the &quot;circles&quot; of the Bad Guys, both at Bracton college and later at Belbury. Mark Studdock, a person possessing neither distinction, character, nor a talent for evil, has lived his life - and ruined it thereby - in a search for admission to 'the inner circle,' and any circle will do. He learns that each concentric circle, in addition to being more exclusive as he supposed, is also more evil and more banal.The characterization of Stoddock is superb. Likewise the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dimble and a few other minor characters. The book is almost worth reading just to gain the acquaintance of Mr. Bultitude.Others are far less engaging. MacPhee - one of the most unidimensional characters I have ever read - is a continual annoyance. The whole build-up with Merlin, only to have him turn out completely powerless until &quot;possessed&quot; by the eldils, makes no sense to me at all. And then he - what? Explodes? Couldn't anyone have done that? And why do God and the angels need an Arthurian wizard, anyway?But the biggest disappointment was Ransom himself. He went from being a lifelike, engaging fellow, in the first two books, to an idealized shadow. We never really learn how he goes from being a Cambridge don to a wealthy landowner and &quot;the Pendragon.&quot; Who are these people who bequeath St. Anne's to him on the condition that he take the name &quot;Fisher-King?&quot; How did he become the Pendragon? No explanation.This was hard to accept from such a brilliant writer. But that's not to say the book is unworthy of attention. I expect to read it again, probably soon, and will probably get more insights from it the second time through.I believe much of the problem the Trilogy has with readers of my generation is that it is always classed as Science Fiction, which it certainly is not. People read it expecting familiar formulas, and don't know how to react when it turns out to be religious allegory. They should read more carefully. As with most of what he wrote, Lewis intended to illuminate more than to entertain."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This book is fun to read, satisfying, thought-provoking--everything you'd want in a book. The storytelling is suspenseful, and you are so curious to know what happens next. What does happen next always feels believable, and logical, even though it is unexpected. To me, this book is the epitome of reading entertainment, while, as usual with a C.S. Lewis book, it delivers a deeper understanding of spiritual truths."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Oddly enough, the third book in the Space Trilogy has almost nothing to do with space. It also has very little to do with Ransom, the main character of the first two books.The plot centers around a young couple named Mark and Jane Studdock. Mark finds himself working for NICE, the sinister organization that gets its work done by not telling anybody (including most employees) what's really going on. Jane, meanwhile, ends up with the good guys thanks to a newfound ability of hers.For the most part, the book is very well-written (as one would expect from Lewis) and enjoyable. Most of the characters are complex and interesting, especially the Studdocks.The story's main problem is the ending. The bad guys are all finished off within the space of a few pages, and without anything resembling a struggle. After so much buildup, it leaves one feeling a little cheated. Also, the concluding chapter is strange and seems very out of place.All of the mythology can get tiresome at times, especially when the planetary eldils (the 'gods') are involved. It slows the book down considerably. An exception to this is Merlin himself, who is a very interesting character. Sadly, he doesn't show up until the end, and leaves right after he's done him job.The book also very strongly supports a \\"traditional\\" role for women in marriage, even going so far as having the good guys tell Jane that she shouldn't join them without Mark's permission. This idea is said to be the will of God himself, not just someone's opinion. This was offensive at times, but did not contribute to the four-star rating, since it's so subjective. A person who agrees with Lewis will probably find that it enhances the book.With these minor reservations, I recommend That Hideous Strength to anyone who likes fantasy, especially C.S. Lewis fans."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"C. S. Lewis' THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH is nominally the third book in what is described as his \\"space trilogy,\\" but such a description does not accurately portray the nature of this prophetic work. Lewis himself calls it \\"a modern fairy-tale for grown-ups,\\" but that also falls short of adequate description. Since science fiction it is not, and a fairy tale it is not, let us see if we can determine what it may be.It is, of course, allegorical and suggests strongly the same sort of allegory that underlies the Ring series by Tolkien (despite the latter's statements to the contrary). As the scientific research organization N.I.C.E. steadily gains public acceptance, then public support, and then assumption of governmental authority, even as the nefarious nature of its goals becomes more and more evident, the reader struggles to scream a warning to the citizens being caught and enslaved in its encroaching web. Why do they not see through the faade of scientific progress and recognize the dehumanizing goals of this soulless entity? Why do they support this encroaching social cancer? Why do they turn against and attack those few who try to sound a warning? The reader, who has the advantage of an external vantage point, sees the growing evil, the destruction of that which is good, but is powerless to open the eyes of those who are being irretrievably deceived.Lewis' allegory is, unfortunately, timeless and is as applicable today as it was when it was first published in 1945. It is no stretch of the imagination to equate N.I.C.E. with the spreading multi-national corporations of the 21st century. As president of the United States from 1953 to 1961, Dwight Eisenhower warned of the social and economic dangers inherent in the growing military-industrial complex, but his prescience has been disregarded, or, more sinisterly, has been overwhelmed by the strength of industrialists whose wealth and power seem to place them above control by the people. Yet, had Lewis' warning been heeded in 1945, Eisenhower's would have been unneeded ten years later. Both are still applicable today.Is there a solution to the encroachment of evil into human affairs? If there is, Lewis did not know of it. True, by the end of THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH, the tools of evil are dead and the N.I.C.E. organization is destroyed, but Lewis warns that this has been only a battle and that the war will continue in other places and in other ways.Lewis' message is, as I hope I have now shown, as uncomfortably real, urgent, and contemporary as it was when he wrote it. As to the manner in which he wrote it, this book is surely the strongest and most readable of the trilogy, which includes OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET and PERELANDRA. In fact, even though reading the trilogy in order will give the reader a better understanding of Ransom and how he came to be the \\"Director\\" of the \\"good guys,\\" this final book can easily stand alone and, if only one of the trilogy is to be read, would be my choice of the one to read. The other two, while worthy of being read, are, at times, plodding in contrast to this one, which is guaranteed to raise the reader's inner tension and to urge him ever forward in the saga.If there is a weakness in the plot of this third book, it comes in the means of bringing down N.I.C.E., its minions, and its masters. Readers familiar with Greek drama and its use of a \\"deus ex machina\\" to rescue hapless humans from their own foibles will see that Lewis has relied on a similar technique. Literally, several intermediate gods (inspired by medieval concepts of hierarchical levels in the universe) as well as a reawakened Merlin and a biblical \\"Tower of Babel\\" solution are necessary to defeat the enemy in this battle, and I'm not at all certain that any of these weapons are available to us in the \\"real world.\\" Despite this, however, the novel is as gripping as any conspiracy suspense thriller, a comparison I have borrowed from another reviewer because I can think of no better way of putting it. In short, buy the book, read it, and, most importantly, learn from it. I have."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"This is certainly a very enjoyable book, particularly for those who are already fans of Lewis. Feminists will be outraged (they should read it nonetheless); Lewis' unique understanding of the nature of masculinity and femininity are very much in evidence here. I found the book rather moving in certain places, especially the growth in understanding that we go through with the heroine, as she develops from secular (liberal) humanist into a Christian. Lewis' deep intuition around the relationship of human (conjugal) love to divine love is (I think) spot on, and probably the most interesting aspect of this book for me (the significance/danger of the \\"Baconian\\" attitude towards nature is more cleanly expressed in _Abolition of Man_). However, the ending of the book seems a bit too easy and optimistic.I picked up this book because, as Lewis says in the preface, \\"it has behind it the serious 'point' [he had] tried to make in [his] _Abolition of Man_.\\" The latter book is an absolute masterpiece, and I would highly suggest that it be read before _That Hideous Strength_.

Lewis fans will read this with Narnia or the first two science fiction works in mind, and this reviewer encourages them to not do so. As other reviewers have noted, it is a confusion if not a disappointment if read with the wrong expectations. Though some of the characters and themes are carried over from the first two science fiction books, it stands by itself.It is my opinion that there is a great deal to learn from the good dystoipas and that they are neglected to our own detriment. This is one of the great ones and is something to be soaked in and learned from."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"The Space Trilogy of which &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; is the final installment is spiritual adventure candy for the soul. This is the first novel other than the Screwtape Letters that CS Lewis let's his comic side out to play.In the end the real issue is how the self anointed elite hatch their plans as if they alone matter and will decide what is best for those who don't matter. Quaint setting and uproariously funny moments do not detract from the sinister longings of the inner circle.Despite very eloquent and persuasive analysis to the contrary, the State, and other power groupings will not &quot;wither away&quot; anymore now than in CS Lewis' time. In fact the tyrannical impulse is alive and well and strangely enough abetted increasingly by both political parties and the media. If you enjoyed this trilogy. Check out &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning by Jerry Furland. &quot;Transfer&quot; is the first book in a trilogy as well. And, like Lewis, Furland can tell tell a story."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Book could not hold my interest until the middle to end. Too wordy to the point that the reader wants to skip pages to get to the meat of the story"},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I have read this book more than once. Already, that means it is a good book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought that the first two books of the series are a lot better."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"It's a great book that I recommend people read, its the sci-fi that adults can enjoy and C.S. Lewis was an incredibly talented writer."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"After enjoying the first two books in C. S. Lewis' space trilogy I was excited to start reading the third book titled \\"That Hideous Strength.\\" It is the conclusion of the first two books \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"Perelandra.\\" Unfortunately \\"That Hideous Strength\\" is much different than the first two books in the series. It is a \\"modern\\" fairytale tied to the legends of Merlin the wizard. The first two books were very original works, so it felt weird to have the possibility of Merlin suddenly joining the story (you will have to read the book to find out if he actually does). One of the strengths of the story, in terms of science fiction, was the part about the amoral use of science to create a hideous leader. There is also a reference to the moon, but it is very brief. The main theme of the story is about the spiritual corruption on planet Earth. Evil is often cloaked with the appearance of good. People often think themselves the opposite of what they really are. The author did a good job addressing these important issues, but I found the story itself gloomy and tiring to read. Much like \\"Screwtape Letters\\" this story makes good points but is not for someone looking for a cheerful read. There are a few cheerful moments in this book, but they are lacking.C. S. Lewis is a great author, but this story is not what I hoped for. The author describes this book as a fairytale for adults. It is more harsh and gloomy than the first two books in the trilogy. It does tie together with the first two books, but I had to do much reading before I saw the connection."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"That Hideous Strength may be Lewis' best fictional work. The novel does a fantastic job of combining spirituality and science in an interesting narrative.The story actually follows two characters: Jane Studdock, and her husband Mark. Jane's story follows her journey in meeting the character from the other books, and deals a lot with the spiritual aspects Lewis was interested in. Mark's story takes us to the villains of the novel, and explores whether man's investment in science is a gift to all of humanity, or another way some men can gain control over others.The story is, at heart, a cautionary tale about the perversion of science, and thus is a good companion to Lewis' nonfictional work &#34;The Abolition of Man.&#34;The only drawback I think exists in That Hideous Strength is that it relies heavily on Arthurian legend, which the book lingers on long enough, but f you have no knowledge of King Arthur, you might find yourself a bit lost."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"Lewis really grabs the academic and cultural environment that is constantly at war with God, trying to push him out of existence via the raw desire to be God ourselves. And as a child of Britain, how could he leave out Arthurian legend? One of the great masters of writing, logic and apologetics at work in great fiction that tells a gripping and believable story."},{"Title":"That hideous strength,: A modern fairy-tale for grown-ups","review":"I had been hoping to get this trilogy and the price is so right at amazon kindle store.

This time he's among medieval knights and ladies, with blood feuds and jousts, and of course our hero needs to reach deep to make it through. I guess there were a lot of isolated communities in the Africa of ERB's imagination. Having said that, ERB never visited Africa before writing these. He was, however, in the 7th Cav, in Arizona, which is Apache country. Tarzan is an Apache Scout, through the lens of a Victorian writer. This is great armchair adventure. If you want to go a little further, allow me to suggestJourney to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),The Tracker,Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,The Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy,Chi Kung: Way of Power, andHouse of Shattering Light: Life as an American Indian Mystic. These will all get you started on understanding more of what Tarzan would have had to be, had he existed in the flesh. I note related books because that is the most useful part of a review for me. I have found gems that way. I encourage others to do likewise."},{"Title":"Hidden Belize (The Hidden Series)","review":"This book was terrific! I read it immediately.

It examines all the arms of the army, the navy, the battlefield tactics, and all major engagements in which the british took part from the beginning of the revolutionary wars up until waterloo. Some of the color plates and uniforms prints are really nice, though uniform details aren't really explained. I would not recommend this for any uniform information. Overall, an excellent book, I am quite pleased with it."},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"As with her seductively dark debut novel, Damage (made into a film starring Juliette Binoche and Jeremy Irons), author Josephine Hart once again explores the paths of human desire and self-deception.A successful London psychiatrist, Jack Harrington, devotes his hours and thoughts to the problems of his patients. Divorced from a wife with whom he had spent time &quot;in the social purgatory that rowing couples inflict upon one another,&quot; he seems to lead a well ordered mannerly existence sometimes marked by overly protective feelings for his sister, Kate.Jack's tranquility is interrupted when his former wife suffers a heart attack, the family estate in Ireland is put up for sale, and the soon-to-be-married Kate develops an eerie edginess.When Jack and Kate return to the family home, he is forced to confront long buried truths concerning a long ago tragedy and the scars left upon those who witnessed it.With masterly detail and perceptive psychological insights Josephine Hart has penned a mesmerizing contemporary Gothic tale centering on familial relationships, both beneficial and pernicious.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"This book is a trip! You really have to pay attention while you read the book because they give clues all the way through it. There is a twist at the end that is totally unexpected. I had to re-read the last few chapters to make sure I read it right.The story is told from Jack Trainor's point of view. Jack is a psychiatrist, and has a younger sister Kate. Kate is a writer, but she seems extremely unstable. The focus of the story is Jack's differing relationships with women. By the end of the story, there is a resolution in both Kate's relationships with men through the resolution of Jack's relationship with women. All this resolution comes because Jack faces the truth of the horrible event that framed their youth.I would highly recommend this book. The librarian who checked it out to me told me it was strange, but I disagree. It takes a little bit to get used to, but the story grabs you as you get further in. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"OVERALL:This book is really wonderful in so many ways. The writing is honest, beautiful, and intricate, yet not ostentatious or pretentious. The story is very well thought out and the manner in which it unfolds is perfect. It is just so well-crafted (!) - throughout the story there are certain landmarks which as the story progresses begin to take on new meaning and importance.CHARACTERS:The characters are believable and three-dimensional, they are human with strengths and weaknesses, hopes and desires and faults. Jack Harrington is very real and a wonderful narrator; the reader is able to trust him and like him, despite the fact that we are privy to his more negative or darker thoughts. Kate, his sister, seems like an elusive mystery, though her explanation is unraveled at the end. Rose, Jack's ex-mother-in-law, is a wonderfully humorous character whom you just wish was real so that you could actually sit down and have a conversation with her.TITLE:At the end of the book, if one reexamines the title it takes on more meanings than originally thought, which I really must commend Ms. Hart on; it is really thoughtful, yet extremely subtle.BASICALLY:Definitely recommend it - a wonderful book that is worth buying, not just getting from the library."},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"I bought 'the Reconstructionist' as a bargain book. But what an excellent read. I can see it as a film. Though it would be quite a challenge to portray the relationship between the siblings. Ms. Hart obviously has a deep insight into a mind damaged by trauma. The need to protect ourselves or those dear to us, with whom we share such a situation.I felt she was excellent. 'Damage' is more concise reading, the characters are better described, but Ms. Hart still manages to maintain a distance from them. One wonders what will become of the main characters.What I thought was fascinating is that She writes with the mind of a man..made me wonder whether it was a man who had actually written the text."},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"What is with the strange ritual of thirty-something brother and sister, Jack and Kate Harrington, whereby they chastely dance with each other, nude to no music? Londoners, they are both successful: he as a psychiatrist; she as an enigmatic beauty, model, writer, etc; and both unmarried - actually divorced. But there has been unspeakable trauma in their lives.The author dangles this past before the reader as she follows Jack in any number of involved consultations with patients and Kate in her latest romance. What happened in their childhoods is always just below the surface. Basically, it has been up to Jack to keep it all tamped down and keep his sister together, but, inevitably, something happens to blow the lid off of this careful suppression.No doubt, the mysterious, unspeakable past keeps the reader's attention. Action is minimal; it is the complex dialogue and the psychological implications that are most interesting. Jack's imperious ex-mother-in-law Rose is an entertaining character, cutting through pretense. There is a certain sensuality to the book, but somewhat disappointingly, the stunning, elusive Kate recedes as the story progresses. The book's lengthy dialogue and reflection are not without some obscurity, but is not a major distraction."},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"At 218 pages, I thought this would be a two-day book, but no. It kept me reading much longer than I intended last night, and would not let me get up until I had finished it this morning. I was captured immediately by its upper-middle class London ambience, and by the brilliance of its dialogues. All right, some of these dialogues come close to being monologues, but when the speakers are intelligent people with some experience of the world, who cares? And all the time, I was slowly being drawn into an erotic conundrum rooted in a mystery buried long in the past.Jack Harrington is a Harley Street psychiatrist, with a specialty in trauma counseling. Several of the most interesting dialogues in the first part of the book are with people whose lives he is helping to reconstruct. And often this has to do with marriages. Jack's own marriage, to a theatre director named Ellie, failed some years before, and he himself is without a permanent partner. His beloved younger sister, Kate, a professional model, is contemplating her second marriage, to a wealthy businessman named Harold Abst, who, like so many children of wartime refugees, has himself reconstructed a life from the ashes. Jack and Kate are extremely close, closer than is normal for a brother and sister; we get the sense that neither of them will be able to move forward until whatever may be binding them has been released.The roots of this, as I say, go back to their childhood in Ireland, a happy period which nonetheless seems to have ended in trauma; the prologue suggests as much without spelling anything out. It will take a trip back to the house of his birth for Jack to be able to untie the knots. It is not just what happened in that house that matters -- the reader may well guess most of it -- but the example set by their parents' marriage, covertly observed by the only half-comprehending children. Josephine Hart weaves a fine net of psychic disturbance, and my experience while actually reading this was definitely five-star. However, I have to admit that the plethora of peripheral characters, while interesting in themselves, were not always tied tightly into the plot. And more seriously, I had trouble seeing the domineering Harold, despite his riches and devotion, as an appropriate husband for Kate after all. So, in the cold light of day, my five stars reluctantly go down to four."},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"This book was good. It definetely took me awhile to get into it though. There is alot of unecessary information in the begining of this book and starts out real slow. On a positive note, it does pick up as the story goes on and by the end I had come to enjoy it. There is a very strong relationship between brother and sister and shows the sacrifices family members will make for each other. Overall it was a good, quick read."},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"Well, as a matter of fact, I bought this book for my wife but I decided to read it anyway and I found it quite interesting. Not my favourite genre but surely a nice book and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Reconstructionist, The","review":"I really did not care for this book. I've not read this author before and found her prose to be very formal and pretentious, as were the characters. They did not seem at all real to me, nor did I care about them.Everyone in this book is completely self absorbed. No one reaches out or cares about anything but themselves and all ponderings are about satisfying self indulgences. Doctor Jack, who is certainly as mentally ill as his most vivid patient, and his physically stunning but demanding and shallow sister Kate, are of the class of too much money and too little imagination. They are the heirs to a terrible family tragedy which you are teased with throughout this story with questionable incest as a strong hook. Neither of them is able to have a normal relationship and the only consistent love in their lives is each other.The only character that I believed was the father of Jack and Kate. With his glacial flaws, charm and avarice, Michael Trainer is the best and worst of all fathers.When Jack is given the opportunity to purchase their childhood home, the dark trauma of this family begins to reveal itself to the reader. I was not surprised or satisfied by the revelation of what happened to make Jack and Kate such a mess. The ending was very predictable and Jacks new persona is slowly emerging as he closes the door forever, on where he came from."},{"Title":"The dance of Tahiti","review":"I was wow'ed by this book. If you are a dancer or teach dance, this is the perfect book to have for reference. It is filled with photos of dances; including photos of old style dance costumes.

This book is full of information that I have not seen elsewhere, specifically about important sites, events, and people. I learned alot about the many names attached to towns, parks, rivers, etc., in the region, and plan to visit many of these locations with my children in the coming years. Excellent book!"},{"Title":"An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians","review":"I thought this was a well-written and well-researched book. It tells a tragic story that sounds like fiction but sadly is fact. If you are interested in the Pawnee, Omaha, Ponca, or Otoe-Missouria tribes, the so-called indigenous tribes of Nebraska, this is an interesting book about their history. A quality book."},{"Title":"Encounters with the Invisible: Unseen Illness, Controversy, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (MEDICAL HUMANITIES SERIES)","review":"I was diagnosed with post-viral CFS in 1988. This book is an excellent description of living with CFS except for one thing: 3/4 of marriages affected by chronic illness break up, which means that most of us don't have the live-in support system she had.Some disbelieving doctors like to attribute CFS to \\"secondary gain\\" or enablers who allow the patient to \\"enjoy the sick role\\". Unfortunately, for many CFS patients, there's no enabler and the only thing you gain is the stress of trying to make ends meet with no income.Wall tells of having someone run her bath, gently wash her, dress her, and help her back to bed. That's a luxury most of us don't enjoy. If I'm not well enough to cook, I don't get dinner; if I cannot safely get in and out of the tub by myself, I don't bathe (on a cold winter day when I needed a bath to warm up, I got stuck in the tub for over an hour because I lacked the strength to boost myself up and out, and there was no one to call for help).Wall's live-in support structure allowed her to do what those of us who live alone can't: use all her energy to write a book to explain to the rest of the world what it's like to be trapped in a body and brain that don't function.I recommend this not only to patients, but to their friends and family as one of the best patient-written books I've read."},{"Title":"Encounters with the Invisible: Unseen Illness, Controversy, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (MEDICAL HUMANITIES SERIES)","review":"I have read many books on CFS but none has moved me more deeply in more different ways than this book has. One of the above reviewers was correct; this book is a classic, probably the first literary classic of CFS. Ms Walls, a professional writer, brings all her skills to bear in describing in poignant terms the losses, frustrations and triumphs she has encountered in her several decade long experience with this disease. There is something here for everyone; besides her story the author focuses chapters on the disease's history, it's name, the ongoing research, what it tells us about the pitfalls of modern medicine and more. What I enjoyed most about this book was her fine tuned sensibility and her poetic grasp of language. She proved to be an excellant guide through the issues that the CFS patient faces in our world today. We are lucky to have this book."},{"Title":"Encounters with the Invisible: Unseen Illness, Controversy, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (MEDICAL HUMANITIES SERIES)","review":"If I could write a book about CFIDS/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, this is the book I would want to have written. It captures the feeling of what it's like to live with CFIDS/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome better than any book I've read (and I've read a lot of books about CFIDS). The author, Dorothy Wall, manages to move seamlessly between the personal and the larger political and medical issues of this debilitating chronic illness.Wall grapples with many of the questions and issues I've thought about or have been forced to deal with, and which I'm sure many people with CFIDS will relate to. The role reversal of being better informed about CFIDS than the doctors you consult. The effect on your identity when your professional life is interrupted. Dealing with the expectations and advise of well-meaning friends and family. The way CFIDS forces you to reexamine the ethic of pushing yourself to exceed your boundaries and limitations. The desire to \\"pass\\" as a healthy person, if only briefly. The difference between accepting the realities of CFIDS and capitulating to them. The strain it puts on your closest relationships with spouse and family members when they are forced to become caregivers. The unexpected small joys and benefits that a constricted, slowed-down life can bring, like an appreciation of the beauty of a flower unfolding. The questions about what CFIDS and related illnesses may portend for our society.Dorothy Wall's background as an editor and writer show through, in the way the writing is at once spare and lyrical. She can be poetic without being flowery. The simplicity of the writing allowed her meaning to penetrate my CFIDS brain fog, so that I didn't have to read the book in five minute increments.Let me mention what this book ISN'T. It isn't a how-to guide for living with chronic fatigue syndrome, or a textbook for \\"CFS 101.\\" It doesn't include a laundry list of symptoms, suggestions for treatment, or a list of theories about the cause. In many ways, it contains more questions than answers. It does give a general overview and background, and the afterward by Dr. Nancy Klimas is a good summary of the biology of CFIDS and an overview of current research.This is a book that I want to press into the hands of family and friends, and say \\"Read this! This is what it's like.\\" I would urge anyone who either has this disease or knows someone who has it, to read this book. I'm seriously thinking about buying a second copy to give to my doctor."},{"Title":"Encounters with the Invisible: Unseen Illness, Controversy, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (MEDICAL HUMANITIES SERIES)","review":"As an ME/CFS person myself, I felt enormous relief as i read Dorothy Wall's 'Encounters With The Invisible: Unseen Illness, Controversy and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.'Here is someone living the other side of the world, describing how i feel, year in, year out.

With this book she effectively attacks the stigmatization of CFIDS which has led to a shameful dearth of funding for research and to a not uncommon dismissal of people with CFIDS as \\"lazy\\" or \\"just trying to get attention.\\" As a person with CFIDS the ending left me hopeful that in the future the situation for people with the illness will change."},{"Title":"Encounters with the Invisible: Unseen Illness, Controversy, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (MEDICAL HUMANITIES SERIES)","review":"This book is superbly written, and seamlessly joins the author's own stuggle with CFIDS with an account of the history and politics of the illness.

The author also provides comphrensive data relating to medical, historical, and social aspects of this troubling illness.

Dorothy Walls writes very well and although her case was so severe that it might depress and discourage a lot of victims, it is still worth reading. The longest I have ever been out of circulaion was 6 months 19 years ago...a few episodes lasting not more than a week since then but, and most recently, alas, a 2 month whammy.

She gave voice to those feelings whereas I couldn't get them out so clearly in words, I just felt them.She shares her battle with her denials, her doctors, her despair, at what this insidious disease does to a human life.She charts the history of this disorder, not only in the more present time, but how it possibly presented many years in the past. Constantly being a confusing entity to the medical establishment and patients alike.I felt affirmed reading this book. I felt less alone in the battle against this disorder.I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks they have CFIDS (CFS), no matter what others think you may have, or anyone dealing with a loved one with this disorder.

I heartily recommend it, even for kids who prefer blue, or green, or red, or orange..."},{"Title":"In My New Yellow Shirt","review":"This book is wonderful. It uses words my daughter is now beginning to learn and understand, and reinforces it with pictures. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"In My New Yellow Shirt","review":"The story My New Yellow Shirt by Henry Holt is about a boy who gets a new yellow shirt for his birthday and it becomes a treasure to him. He uses his imagination to be anything he wants. This story teaches me that I can use my imagination when ever I want.This reminds me of getting a new yellow shirt for my birthday just like the boy .It also remind me of using my imagination to create make -believe places, just like the boy.I would give this a 10 out of 10 because it remind me of when my aunt gave me something special that I treasure, just like the boy who treasures his new yellow shirt."},{"Title":"In My New Yellow Shirt","review":"We got this book for my son when he was only 16 months old, so he obviously couldn't follow the story line yet. He still can't, but this has been one of his favourite books from the beginning. It must be the style of the pictures as well as the everyday situations they depict (having breakfast, going to bed, playing in the tub in the yard, etc.) - kids can really relate. And as for the adults, we can also appreciate the sense of humour the book has - such as the license place \\"GRNMA\\" for a car driven by an elderly lady (supposedly Sam's grandmother). And once your child reaches the age when he/she an follow the plot, I'm sure he/she will enjoy the book even more.My son has been taking this book off the shelf almost every day since he got it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In My New Yellow Shirt","review":"All 4 of my grandchildren loved the book, Eileen really relates to children and she is the best."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"Although _The Rector of Justin_ is considered by many as Auchincloss' best novel, I didn't like it as much as some of his other books. It uses six narrators to tell the story of the Reverend Francis Prescott, D.D. -- founder and rector (headmaster) of Justin Martyr, a fictional school for boys in Massachusetts. The narrative structure seems contrived to me; Auchincloss used it better in later books like _The House of the Prophet_. You never get to know Prescott well enough to decide whether you like or dislike him, although maybe it is Auchincloss' intention to create the uncertainty. None of the narrators arouses your sympathy (the main one is just plain annoying), and the book has no trace of sentimentality in it. In Auchincloss' autobiography, _A Writer's Capital_, he says the character of Prescott is based more on Judge Learned Hand than on Endicott Peabody, the headmaster of Groton where Auchincloss went to school."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"Read this book years ago and decided to read it once again. One of his best and a really inventive, insightful and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"Louis Auchincloss recommended The Rector of Justin to me as a starting point, as I was unfamiliar with his writing. Then he chuckled and said that he doesn't claim that it's his best, only that it has enduring popularity and is the most commercially successful of his novels. The story portrays the fictional biography of an exclusive New England prep school's willful headmaster, Francis Prescott, and it portrays, too, the characters who \\"live under the shadow of the Prescott legend.\\" The story is related through six persons in that shadow. They are a former student, Brian Aspinwall, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, David Griscam, an old friend, Horace Havistock, his youngest daughter, Cordelia Turnbull, her common law husband, Charlie Strong, and another student, Jules Griscam, son of the above-mentioned trustee. Each relays impressions of the great man which derive from their own association with him. These glimses portray Prescott's multifaceted character, yet the portrait which emerges leaves the reader unsatisfied, as with a puzzle in which there are not only missing pieces, but also duplicate pieces. Auchincloss' writing is creative, and very clever, and there are hundreds of sentences which beg to be re-read, and which are every bit as fresh on the return leg. Another characteristic of the author's prose is numerous references. He invokes authors, their characters, and countless others: Omar Khayyam, King Lear, Meissonier, Parsifal, Steinbeck, Tom Brown and Arnold, Marlowe and Webster, the Count of Monte Cristo, Anne Boleyn, Rupert Brooke, Mrs. Browning, Billy Budd, Walter Gay, Tannhauser, Freud, Molvina Hoffman, Plantaganet Palliser and Lady Cora, Joseph Andrews, Henry Thoreau... And here are a few examples of the author's craft: \\"I am the youngest child of a marriage of June and January, and, alas, I cost June her life.\\" \\"He had all the jauntiness, guile, and charm of a papal bastard in the Renaissance.\\" \\"We became well-known hosts to the floating expatriate world that made a fetish of disillusionment.\\" \\"I had not expected that so little oil would settle such troubled waters.\\" \\"He was uneasy with children, for like a dictator visiting a free country, he knew that his power was suspended.\\" \\"He knew that his God was as mean as himself, and would never let him get away with anything as easy as that.\\" Unfortunately, though, the story's denouement fails to resolve its creative tension. The eclipse of Prescott's power, in his old age, is portrayed as dramatic and illuminating, but it is neither. Prior to the conclusion our protagonist is a self-absorbed demigod. In that conclusion he becomes yet more self-absorbed, though mortal, and simply fades away. A God as mean as himself, however, would not have let him get away with anything as easy as that."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"If you're going to read only one novel by the prolific American writer Louis Auchincloss, this is the one to read. It is a minor modern classic and represents Auchincloss's best work during what I regard as his prime period. The Rector of Justin tells the life story, from schoolboy to death at age 85, of Frank Prescott (Dr. Francis Prescott), rector/headmaster/founder of the exclusive New England Episcopalian boys' school Justin Martyr (a famous prep school), by means of six narrators, male and female, whose attitudes toward their subject range from veneration to hatred. It's an effective method of \\"surrounding\\" the elusive, somewhat larger-than-life central character, and the book is well written, the right length, and compulsively readable. I first read it when it came out in 1964, have just re-read it, and find that it holds up quite well. Auchincloss's main fault is his glib facility: writing is too easy for him; he was written too much; and too much of it, smoothly ushered in on its cushion of graceful, well-oiled prose, is pallid, thin, brittle, superficial; too much of it is engaging enough while you're reading it, but forgettable, leaving no lasting imprint. This fault is minimized but not absent here. This is not a profound or searching book, but an excellent, enjoyable read, and a fine introduction to a worthwhile if over-productive modern author."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"THE RECTOR OF JUSTIN is for my money the greatest of all&quot;school novels&quot; of the 20th century, and one of the great novels ever. Louis Auchincloss has an extraordinary collectioon of novels and non-fiction, and I hope more and more will appear in Modern Library's editions. Nobody now livng writes with the grace, richness of apirit and wit that Achincloss has, sentence by sentence. You care about hio people, and in all the novels there is a procession of fascinating, articulate characters, vividly alive and engaging,struggling, triumphing, wrestling with the complexities and hopes of their lives.. I must have read this novel ten times by now, across several decades. I have been handing out my own collected copies right and left. Nos it is newly published in a sparkling edition, and it stands with the world 's best fiction where it most certainly belongs."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"Auchincloss writes about the world of upper-class privilege in New England, a world he knows well, having been a Groton and Yale man himself. His stories often are set in the recent past, giving them a somewhat old-fashioned feel. This one, regarded as one of his best works (it's certainly the one everybody recommends), is an extended portrait of Dr. Frank Prescott, born at the end of the Civil War to an old Boston family with broad connections, taking Harvard and Oxford almost for granted, assuming he can do pretty much whatever he wants in life. And so he does, becoming first a minister and then a schoolmaster. Almost everything to do with religion in this book, by the way, even the word \\"church,\\" should be understood to mean \\"American Episcopal,\\" though that's never explicitly stated. After all, in Boston, there is no other denomination worth mentioning, not among the upper class. Dr. Prescott builds a Groton-like institution called Justin Martyr and serves as its only headmaster into his 80s, which means until World War II. We experience the history of both the school and the man through the eyes of a number of other people, including a young teacher who comes in almost at the end and who idolizes Prescott -- until he discovers why he shouldn't. Other viewpoints include Prescott's oldest friend, from their own school days, and the chairman of Justin's board of trustees, and his youngest daughter (a Bohemian rebel), and the chairman's son, and so on. Every POV but Prescott's own, in fact. This gives the reader a variety of takes on the man, whom Auchincloss develops in many dimensions, and whom the reader is encouraged to both admire and dislike, depending on the circumstances. The style is very readable, very un-stilted, and there are a great many highly quotable lines because the author is a master of descriptive metaphor and wry observation. Auchincloss is still writing (his first novel was published in 1947 and his most recent in 2007), though he seems to have receded into the background of the literary world somewhat. But this is an excellent place to begin and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"Louis Auchincloss is always dead-on in his fine wrought character portraits throughout his prolific oeuvre. Here, in what is likely his finest work, that, along with all his other formidable storytelling gifts, the characterization is at its lofty apex. He also experiments a bit with form, going beyond the usual fictional biography techniques by including pertinent conversations and writings by former students (a brilliant few chapters!), family, and associates. Indeed, there is a certain irony in his biographer's comments late in the book: &quot;But my trouble is precisely that I am not interested in writing a biography. I am interested in inspiring my reader, and I am much at odds with my century in believing that to demonstrate the best by itself is more inspiring than the best with the worst.&quot; We get an entirely balanced portrait of a great man of ideas who, joyously, is ultimately as human and full of foibles as the boys he so carefully nurtures. This is awesome, hopeful, faith-inducing, awesomely inspiring and fun read."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"Boarding school novels are a genre of their own, and the Rector of Justin feels like an essential part of it: the description of the charismatic overarching headmaster, the Leitfigur -- a theme that Rowling draws on with Dumbledore. For anyone interested in exploring that theme, this is an extraordinary book.The writing is a little mannered, almost hankering after the 19th century, and, at the risk of seeming too critical, Auchincloss on occasions struggles to carry it off. The narrator is overdoing meekness, and getting in the way of it all.Nevertheless, this book does open up a lot of questions about what education really is, how to carry it off, how authoritarian it can be and what damage charisma (and boarding schools) end up doing. It's also an endearing defence of a vanishing world. Somewhere else (1980) Auchincloss said that the \\"tragedy of American civilization is that it has swept away WASP morality and put nothing in its place\\". That isn't my view, but this book makes a case that deserves its hearing.It's a very good read, exactly what literature should be."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"This is #6 on the bestsellers list in 1964, the year I was born. I had a hard time at first getting into the story but it was magnificent! Auchincloss is a tremendous writer and probably, in my humble opinion, one of the best writers in the 20th century. He has a unique writing style. This book is unusual in the fact that it is told by 6 different individuals. This is the story of a man from schoolboy age to his death at age 85.Frank Prescott was a man of God and of honor. His calling to be a minister and of a teacher was fulfilled and he was very successful in building his dream of a Christian boy's school, although it was not exclusive to that religion. Dr. Prescott had respect for any boy of any religion. He was diligent, proud, and yet humble. He was willing to admit his faults and apologize for his mistakes. A respected man like this is very hard to find in this day and age. Dr. Frank Prescott was revered by any who met him, even if they disliked him.This was my favorite line & one of the last: \\"Dr. Prescott was greater than the school which he created and by which he was ultimately disillusioned, and it is my ambition to distill for future generations of Justin boys some bit of the essence of that greatness.\\"I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost someone in their lives they truly admired; it will open your heart to the sentiment of greatly appreciating those who have gone before us to set a pure example of respect & honesty."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"This book surprised me by having a lot of substance. This multiple-narrator novel provides a shifting portrait of a fictional New England Episcopal boarding school headmaster - a legend in his time. It's like a Tom Brown's School Days for early 20th century New England, from the point of view of the headmaster. There is no TGI whatsoever, but the book provides an interesting contrast to the English Public School novel. Among its questions: what does it mean to be a church school? How should we educate boys into men, and what is a man? Ultimately, it examines the uneasy tension between the idealistic, fervently faithful (and rather Puritanical) founder and the materialistic boys, parents, and board that make up the school."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"This is a very good work of fiction centered on Reverend Francis Prescott, founder and rector of a New England school. What is most interesting is the way in which Auchincloss builds his main character through the words of others. This technique, surprisingly, gives us a full portrait of the man and his times. Despite such a solid character study, what keeps this book from becoming \\"great\\" is the absence of some larger American themes (class conflict, race relations, political tension, etc.) I found this to be ultimately a personal story without much beyond the person."},{"Title":"The Rector of Justin","review":"This is writing at its most elegant.

Sex drives commerce, influences history, and plays a larger part in all of our day-to-day lives that most of us would be willing to admit. This book explores it all.The quotes are set off and/or put into context by brief commentaries, which go very far to the understanding of many of the quotes. The quotes are from all available sources, from the Bible, Plutarch, and Ovid to Al Goldstein, Andy Warhol, and Noel Coward. The quotes themselves are absolutely riveting, some highly clinicial, others highly cynical. There are the humorous, the base, the insightful, and the out-and-out ridiculours; you determine which are which.The book is organized very simply, with a subject matter table of contents beginning with \\"Abortion\\" and \\"Adultery\\" and concluding with \\"Virginity\\" and \\"Wedding Nghts.\\" There is also an index of quotation sources, so you can easily find a juicy tidbit from Mother Teresa, John Donne, Madonna, or e. e. cummings.This is a very enjoyable read, one which will open your mind and broaden your horizons through exposure to the points of view and humor of many, many others.

Although short stories, there's a continuity and this can easily be read as a novel as the character of Socrates Fortlow,\`an ex-con recently released from prison, lives his life in the Watts community. The stories are tough at times and tender at times. The first one introduces us to a young boy, Daryl, who returns in some of the later stories and we get a sense of the growing bond between the two and the attempt of Socrates to be a worthy guide and teacher to the boy. This is a very rewarding reading experience and is worthwhile reading regardless of the reader's ethnic background."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Mr. Mosley has created a fictional character who has taken on a life of his own. He has given us Socrates Fortlow a man who in one's mind lives beyond the pages of a book. If you buy the paperback and you love books you'll end up buying it in hardcover - hopefully a 1st ed. signed by the author. Enjoy - and learn."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"The story begins similar to the Langston Hughes short story \\"Thank you, Ma'am\\" (a literary nod that I enjoyed) as a young man attempts to steal from Socrates Fortlow, a clue that sets the tone for the rest of the book. Socrates Fortlow is an ex-con, 8 years out of prison after serving 27 years for rape and murder. _Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned_ is the story of Socrate's struggle to forgive himself of what he's done (in and out of prison) and to help other African-Americans in south central LA avoid similar mistakes.Fortlow is a complex character - he's angry: he sees the good and potential in others, but he can't see the same in himself. He's formidible: his huge hands are nicknamed \\"rock breakers\\" for a reason. And he has a remarkable ability to forgive others, yet is unwilling to forgive himself. Through Fortlow, Mosley shows us how important it is to recognize our universal humanity and that ultimately, we are all our brother's keepers.It is on the surface a light read, the messages subtle as Fortlow humbly goes about his business trying to find work, trying to stay out of trouble and (when he can), acting as mentor, philosopher and role-model for young and old in his neighborhood. Some may miss these nuances, in which case it is still a wonderful picture of one man's struggle to do right by himself. For those who give it a closer read, they will find the way in which Mosley gently shares his message rewarding. Recommended."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Mosley is a great talent and his writing is though provoking and insightful. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because I felt there was something lacking. I wanted to feel like there was some kind of conflict and there wasn't. It was preachy--in a good way- but if given a definite plot or pushed a little more in a definite direction it would have been an amazing book. Even the constant reminder of his rape and murder convictions didn't create enough conflict. His goodness outweighed his crime and eventually with every mention, I got this \\"haven't we all\\" feeling. It was as if he was confessing to stepping on ants. Overall though, I would suggest reading it, just because Mosley has an amazing honest voice in his writing and I love the passion he gives his characters."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This book was quite a refreshing change from what I've recently read.

What's more, he learns and teaches a new lesson everyday. There is much to be said for a person that can actually recognize his faults and learn from them.

This is not to say that the central character, Socrates Fortlow is a judgemental moralist. Far from it. This burly ex-con with his huge rock-crushing hands and terrible past, is searching for truth in a world where truth is no much unfashionable as crushed out of people's souls by injustice. He is a seeker not a saviour.The stories also form the link between Mosley's crime writing and his outstanding first SF novel, Blue Light, where issues of metaphysics are brought further into the foreground. Through the stories, Socrates acquires a kind of nobility that can only come from a totally honest struggle our own impulses as well as with the environment that surrounds us. There is a sense of place in 'Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned' that is very specific to 1980s Watts, but mythic and resonant and almost timeless at the same time. This only comes from genuine wisdom and understanding, qualities in which Mosley far outshines almost all contemporary authors.There are one or two weaker stories, notably one in which Socrates gets involved with the courts again, but this is a collection to come back to. And as with Raymond Carver, I felt compelled to stop for quite some time after each one as the subtle but powerful emotional impact percolated through my brain."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I heard it was a book of short stories, but found it to read like a novel.

During this fourteen short story run, the supporting cast are just as strong as they are flawed, much like Socrates himself. It was this character trait that kept me reading until the end. Socrates lived a hard life and he paid the price for it, however, throughout this book, his anger and resentment has made him not only a heroic figure, but a tragic one as well. Where else can you come across a man that will put together a plan to run a drug dealer out of his neighborhood, and the next story will have him standing in the face of one of his friends and tell him that he will stab him in the back to get with his wife and kids if he doesn't straighten up and fly right? It's these complex traits that make Mr. Fortlow such a facinating character, and this a facinating book."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I'd never heard of Walter Mosley and had not come to this book via the Easy Rawlins series. Rather, I saw it on a remainders table, bought it on impulse, gulped it down in two sittings. A book about black men and the ache to do something worthwhile against the odds of real life in South Central. Two days after I read the book I saw the movie adaptation with the inimitable Laurence Fishburne. A wonderful movie. But the book is better.

It is a wonderful collection, and also important, because it really questions that stubborn myth known as &quot;the American dream&quot;, and it does so without putting down the people who still believe in that myth, against all possible odds. The Fortlowe stories are far richer than the Rawlins books, especially because the main character is so complicated, and because Mosley never lets him take the obvious way out of any situation.

This collection of interrelated short stories together form a remarkable tale of subtle, and perhaps even unconscious, redemption. Socrates becomes a mentor, best friend, and invaluable member of society. In addition, he learns that not all is black and white, whether it be with regard to morality, or as between the races.The stories and their moral teachings are subtle, like well-crafted fables.

I am deeply appreciative of his wonderful contribution to the literature of our times. This book will outlive all of us . . . and it should!"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"A marvelous work by a gifted writer! Each story is a life vignette of an ex-con who is attempting to get along in the complicated world of modern L.A. His attempts to reconcile his violent past with his moral code and conflicts are the struggles of everyman. I savored each page. Just terrific stuff! Thanks, Walter."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Walter Mosley paints a picture in L.A. for African American Baby Boomers that is right on the mark. One can almost remember Socrates as either a threatning presence in the neighborhood, or know him as a relative that nobody likes to talk about."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Along with the simmerin', well-seasoned hoppin'-john, freshbaked, butter-lathered cornbread and fried porkchops (blanketed with hot, just-cooked, greasy onions), can anyone else smell a sequel comin' \`round the corner? Or is it just me? The sequel-odor is quite strong and none too subtle. But not necessarily offensive...A deliberate &quot;hello&quot;, formal introduction to a new (anti) hero. Goodbye &quot;Easy&quot;? One hopes that would not be the case. &quot;Always Outgunned...&quot; (I'm not going to spellout the entire title) was - is - a well-written book, with a seamless (formulaic?) style. Maybe a bit too smooth and predictable, relative to Mosley's earlier works, featuring the &quot;Easy Rawlins&quot; character. Characters are fleshed-out pretty well and there's enough going on to snag the reader's interest - entertaining him/her for a while...but one definitely can predict where the protagonist is headed. A highly manipulative piece of work...Would make a good teleplay. There's the (obligatory?) brush with romance and &quot;true reform&quot;. There's the expected do-gooder, band-of-old-guys-take-back-neighborhood, adopt-a-kid bits as well. Nice. Sweet. Good, technical job here, but (again) Predictable. Not as challenging, visceral or as fun as Mosley's earlier works (forget the experimental, unpleasant, confused &quot;RL's Dreams&quot;), but a worthy addition nonetheless to one building a &quot;Mosley Library&quot;. As a matter of fact, the book seems especially written to appease (comfort?) the loyal fans of the author, holding their hands while uttering frequent &quot;there-theres&quot; as they get used to the idea of a New Guy On the Block, perhaps a tad forlorn at their &quot;loss&quot; of &quot;Easy&quot;. But I ask: Is Mosley headed towards a rut? If one is a &quot;Mosley Nut&quot; (you know who you are), then I'd say: &quot;Buy the slick-looking, hardcover version of this book, read it twice and put it on the shelf.&quot; SP"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Socrates Fortlow is 8 years out of an Indiana prison where he served a 27 year sentence for the rape and murder of a woman and murder of a man. He is now 58 years old and living in Los Angeles in a shack in a poor part of town and is still in a constant battle with himself as he struggles to control the thoughts of violence that surge through him. Although Socrates is a violent man he is also a deep thinker using his own brand of insightful wisdom to combat daily problems and injustices.ALWAYS OUTNUMBERED ALWAYS OUTGUNNED is a book of 14 short stories featuring Socrates as he deals with the hardships facing an ex-convict who is trying to fit back into society. They cover a vast range of societal issues that can be considered mundane at first glance, but which make up the important detail of life. Socrates' approach to his problems range from borderline illegal to genius in their simplicity and common sense.Socrates' displays hi philosophical age of wisdom in the opening story when he catches Darryl, a local boy who has stolen and killed a rooster. He proceeds to teach Darryl the difference between right and wrong in a caring but unorthodox way. Immediately following this is a story where Socrates engages in an act of vigilantism, using his violent nature to warn off an undesirable character living in the neighbourhood. These opening two stories paint a vivid picture of the two opposite sides of Socrates Fortlow, the reasoning thinker and the man of violent action.Philosophical debates dominate many of these stories as Socrates meets men who: are thieves; are cheating on their wives; have walked out on their wives; have fought and killed in wars and who are now trying to cope with it; are cruel to animals. In each of these stories Socrates imparts his own brand of wisdom on others while inside he is in a struggle to contain the rage he feels towards these people.While not really mystery stories, they do involve crimes and criminals and the moral and social issues associated with them. For example, in one story Socrates has very strong suspicions that he knows the identity of a serial arsonist, but struggles with his rebellion against authority before deciding whether he should turn the man in or not. A later story brings back Darryl and his run in with one of the local gangs. Socrates does his best to protect Darryl from the perils of the gang culture that threatens to swallow him.I found these stories to be particularly engaging, addressing issues that one could dismiss as everyday events, but which are also very important. Mosley has created in Socrates Fortlow a very sympathetic character who is merely trying to survive as a black ex-convict in a hostile environment. His solutions to the problems that confront him don't always fall within the bounds of legality, instead aiming for the solution that will result in the \`right' outcome rather than the just outcome."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned is a collection of 14 stories revolving around Mosley's newest street hero, Socrates Fortlow, an ex-convict formerely convicted of a rape and double murder. The selections chronicle the tribulations that Fortlow faces after he is released from a twenty-seven year jail sentence. However, Mosley fails in his mission to present Fortlow as anything more than an ex-con. Absent are the sophisticated thought processes of the famous Ezekiel Rawlins, replaced by a character who seems to function merely on base instinct. Similarly, although these stories all seem to have a centralized theme, Mosley makes no Joyceian attempts to tie all of the stories together with a common theme that would create a larger (or at least more complete) picture of the persona of Socrates Fortlow. I do have to give Mosley kudos for his use of imagery. He makes the modern-day streets of Watts come alive with his particularly vivid descriptions. However, th! e grandiose backgrounds that Mosley paints are not enough to discourage us from discovering the largely disjointed foreground."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Walter Mosley takes us into Watts in Los Angeles where Socrates, the main character, lives physically and emotionally at the intersection of violence and goodness. This remarkable book uses the protagonist and a host of characters and events to present a penetrating look into the pre-riot Watts culture and the questions, feelings, insults, and dangers faced by people living there. As Socrates struggles with violence and goodness withing himself, the reader is privy to open, honest conversations that raise questions the full answers to which are yet to be discovered. Brilliant writing. Unforgettable experience reading it."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This is a great novel and journey.

If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.\\" -- Luke 17:3 (NKJV)Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned is the first book in the Socrates Fortlow series by Walter Mosley. As much as I admire the later books in the series, this one if my favorite. I first read it before I even knew that Amazon existed so I have never written a review of it.I decided that Christmas 2011 was a good time to reread the book and to share my views about this powerful work.If you haven't read any of the books in the series (Little Yellow Dog and The Right Mistake), be sure to start with this one. It's one of the most powerful books I recall in terms of capturing a convict's self-directed rehabilitation.When Socrates was sent to prison for murders and rape, he was just another guy seeking to gratify his price, appetites, and anger. Over the long years, he came to reflect on what his choices were before picking one. Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned is an eloquent fictional presentation of how powerful free will can be in taking us on a constructive path, even in the absence of seeking God's direction.In individual stories (separately published before this collection was put together), Mr. Mosley explores themes such as forgiving those who have wronged you, helping those who are weaker than you are, seeking peace with violent people, refusing to compromise with criminal behavior, rebuking sinners, getting a job from those who are prejudiced against you, inspiring youth to lead a decent life, patching up marriages, reaching out for dreams, rejecting easy compromise that could lead to violence and death, escaping street violence, addressing your regrets, the fragile nature of acquaintance, responsibility to the law and to the community, obtaining justice, and dignity in death. It's as though you were reading Socrates himself on the nature of the world, as seen through prison-wise and street-wise eyes.Although there's plenty of poverty, hatred, anger, fear, danger, and death here, there's also the nobility of the human spirit . . . and its potential to grow. I think you'll find this book to be uplifting. I pray that you will read it and think about how its lessons might be applied to your life.Bravo, Mr. Mosley!"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Didn't know of Walter Mosely until I read this book that was required by one of my English instructors. He is a good writer. My instructor is passionate about the book as well as the Author. Walter Mosely is one of her favorites. I enjoyed this book and I recommend it. It's very interesting."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This book was real winner. The movie, by the title 'Always Out-numbered,' was really engaging and entertaining, but the book better describes the story behind the actions of many of the charactors. After reading the book [if you've already seen the movie] you'll find yourself saying \\"Oh, so that's why that happened - it certainly does explain it now!'' The movie starred Lawrence Fishburn, Bill Nun (Radio Raheem from Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing), Bill Duke (The mean-looking black Interrogating detective from Mennace II Society), Bill Cobs, Cicley Tysen, Isaiah Washington, Laurie Metcalf (sister Jackie from sit-com 'Roseanne,' Natalie Cole, and last but not least - Don Cheedle's real-life true love Brigid Coulter. Please don't make the mistake of thinking that Natalie Coal cannot act, because she 'more than proved herself' in this minor, but powerful role as resteraunt owner Iowa Gibbs. Laurie Metcalf was every bit as much ''out of charactor'' in her role as Sandra Bullock was [in her role] in the movie 'Crash,' and like Bullock, she did an excellant performance! The supporting actor of this great movie was a thirteen-year-old new-commer Daniel Williams who played 'Darryle,' the wayward pre-teen thug-wannabe that Socrates (Fishburn) became a mentor and protector to. I'm really surprised that Williams hasn't had more roles in the years that followed [even to-date], because he struck me as such a promising candidate back then. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Socrates Fortlow is a character that embodies some part of the everyday experiences of African American people, hope, despair, insight, trust, wisdom. As a member of the criminal defense bar, I come in contact with people like Socrates on a daily basis. The novel had particular meaning for me. No matter hard difficult my job becomes, or how oppressive the law has become, or how inherently racist the system continues to be, or how frustated I get with my clients, this novel reminded me of hope, persistance and the goodness of mankind. This book reinforced why I will comtinue to represent men like Socrates Fortlow."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This book so impressed me that I felt compelled to write and STRONLY recommend the book to anyone who will listen. I won't waste your time by reviewing the content (since most of the reviewers have already supplied such information). I will tell you, however, that Mosely's work is the best book I have read in the last few years. I am moved by his characterization; entertained by his storyline; intrigued by his personalities; and placed by his thick descriptions of context. While I am a big fan of his &quot;Easy&quot; series, this is far and away his literary masterpiece. READ IT TODAY!"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"That's what Socrates' big hands are good for - the better to hold you with, as is this riveting story. I loved this story. I'm a Walter Mosley/ Easy fan. I was prepared for this book to not be a mystery but I was expecting something more like a Gone Fishin, so I was caught flat with this story of pain and redemption and the high cost of self-control.Socrates walks a thin line between prisons, the one from which he was released and the one represented by the limited life forced on those who live in the Watts of the world. The wider prison of the outside world threatens to claim Socrates daily and daily he struggles against its claim on him, his dignity, and sanity. The reader is right there - a witness to the large pains and small triumphs of Socrates' life.Walter Mosley doesn't spare the reader but rather nakes you face the problems as Socrates would - head on. There is a quiet, desparate, dignity in Socrates that cannot be denied.It's amazing how much life is represented in these few pages. Walter Mosley proves he can write anything and write it well."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I can see there are plenty of raves for this book already, I'd just like to say Mr. Mosley has topped himself again and I really enjoyed following this new set of characters.

Please Mosley, write some more..."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"A masterful achievement. Without ever losing the drive of his stories Mr. Mosley constructs brilliant morality tales about characters you immediately care about and root for.

I loved this book."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I enjoyed this collection of stories about the remarkable Socrates Fortlow as much as any book I've read in the past several years. The stories are more like chapters in a novel, each building on the prior story, yet each a classic short story that could stand alone. Mosley's use of dialogue and metaphor is simply unparalleled; he brings his protaganists alive like no one else. Readers who have enjoyed the Easy Rawlins series will surely love this book as well. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"A collection of stories (some are more like character sketches) is just not as compelling as a book with one story would be, but the main character is interesting and the book is well-written and not as bleak as it might be.

The story begins 8 years post Socrates' release from prison for rape and murder. Socrates is a man full of character, who has decided that his prison time was not enough to repay the debt to society for his heinous crimes. He makes a life long committment to encourage and mentor as he tries to muddle through the obstacles of being an ex con.Once again, Mosley has created a wonderful story. Socrates' profound descriptions of life around him are so perfect, it is difficult to imagine this man ever committed such crimes. There is a lesson in this story for everyone."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"For those who have read or listened to them, the Socrates Fortlow stories will be more enduring than the Easy Rawlins mysteries. Beyond this, Paul Winfield's performance (\\"reading\\" does not begin to do justice to his achievement) of these stories is at least the equal of Walter Mosely's work here. I really regret that I did not hear these tapes until after Winfield had died. I would have made great effort to advise him personally how moving, delightful, and enlightening his performance is. Winfield has more than internalized and reiterated these stories and characters. Time after time he intonates a word that catches the listener off guard with insight into Mosely's rich characters and settings, drawing a winsome smile, an outright laugh, or an uncomfortable unanticipated point of empathy with a life situation I really would not want. Winfield and Mosely have created a warm and indestructable thread in the fabric of American art that truly celebrates American culture, from a vantage point that one would not expect to yield such results. I am sorry to see that, as of this writing, Amazon lists the Winfield tapes as out of stock, but I can see why that is so because Winfield's performance here dserves to be \\"sold out.\\" It would be a great, great shame, however, if Paul Winfield's wonderful performance were not available soon again for an ever widening audience."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"A friend gave me Mosley's book Walkin' the Dog, to show me what good writing was about. Mr.Mosley not only drew me in, but I wished I had received Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned first, just so I knew more about Socrates Fortlow and how he arrived. I've since devoured the stories in both books, and made them part of my permanent collection of greats. Mosley is a prolific writer, who asks you to walk beside him through the streets of Los Angeles, eyes wide opened, and nostrils flaring, and if you dare to, take in the sight,sound,feel,and smell of the Watts ghetto. Mr. Mosley deserves acclaim for his effort and moreso for his extraordinary success in the creation of Socrates Fortlow, his friends and foe. Mosley is a winner. If you can't learn from him, you aren't listening."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Mosley's Easy Rawlins mysteries are terrific, and RL's Dream is worthwhile reading, but this book surpasses all his others. Socrates Fortlow is real, multidimensional, unpredictable but deeply moral, and his life in a very tough environment is gripping and believable. This is such a great book, you'll be glad you picked it up."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I usually enjoy the movie over the book, but this time around, I think the movie made me like Socrates far more. In the book, he really did murder someone and rape a girl, and that's made plain over and over again. It got to the point where I wished Mosley would stop reminding readers that Socrates Fortlow was a criminal, was huge, was intimidating and did rape and kill two people. I read it the first time, but I got the impression Mosley didn't truly want us to like Socrates. He'd mention the murders and Socrates always wanting to hit somebody so many times in the book where I wondered, \\"Why in the world does anybody want to hang out with this guy? He sounds angry all the time.\\" My shoulders dropped when I found out that Darryl killed the little boy. In the movie, it was someone else. But considering Darryl killed a little boy for just wanting to hang out with them, I had zero sympathy for him when the older gangbanger was bullying him. It's really hard for me to sympathize with someone who has done wrong when someone else turns around and does the same thing. I usually view that as karma.In the movie, Socrates and Iula were cute. In the book, Iula was mentioned so few times that I didn't care about her at all. The bookstore scenes and the dog accident were filler material that had nothing to do with nothing and could've been left out of the book. The beach scene with the marijuana couple who ate chili didn't serve any purpose whatsoever and there's not a woman alive who's going to be THAT nonchalant after a man said he's raped a woman. She's definitely not going to cuddle up with the rapist and want to have sex. Mosley really should've talked to some women to get feedback about that one. And two men were there at that? With ONE woman after she fully comprehends one seems unapologetic about raping a woman? Get outta here.I think the screenwriters recognized how unlikeable Socrates was in this book and took out every single piece of information that would make viewers not like him before they made that film with Laurence Fishburne. If I'd read the book first, I don't think I would've sat through the film."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"These stories, as read by the great actor Paul Winfield, are powerful testaments to life, love, hard times, etc.. These stories and their central character, Socrates Fortlow, are fine examples of a man, who did wrong, seeks redemption, and tries hard to make amends. The continuing theme of the crime which he committed ties them all together. Mr. Winfield's reading cuts across all racial barriers, to teach all of us, black and white, about one man's struggle(s) with his demons. His reading also adds passion and depth to Mr. Mosley's writing. I'd highly recommend these stories (in audio and print). [Refers to the audio edition.]"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I searched a used bookstore for an 1 1/2 hours knowing that inevitably God would reveal a wonderful book before me. When I found Walter Mosely's novel, I knew it was 'the one.' I loved Socrates, the main character, in a way I have never loved a book's character. And I am especially looking forward to the follow-up novel, Walking the Dog. (Soon to be released!)"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I'm new to Mosley and haven't read any of his detective novels, but I thoroughly enjoyed this quick, easy read. Each chapter told a poignant story, and though they don't come together as in a novel, they do tie together in a meaningful way. Many of the stories are mean and bittersweet, but they are ultimately honest and hopeful, and you can you feel the central character's, Socrates Fortlow's, often-conflicted emotions in dealing with a panolopy of hard choices and various (brought on often by an earlier life of crime) injustices, as well as his incredible determination to build a life out of less than nothing. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"as a volunteer in a local prison, i read this book with interest. i had never read any of walter mosley's fiction novels and had no preconceptions. socrates rings true as a man who has done wrong, knows it, and strives to rise above it, knowing that he can never forgive his past crimes. as rilke says: &quot;This is how he grows: by being defeated, decisively, by constantly greater beings.&quot; i am anxious to share this work with the men in my group - men who know this same struggle."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Mosley proves himself to be a very good writer who can develop characters with the likes of Faulkner and O'Connor with his collection of stories about Socrates Fortlow. Whereas the beginning is tough for those of us who expected a novel, the individual stories add up to a sum greater than most novels. Socrates Fortlow comes alive in the pages like no other chararacter in my memory has."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This is one of Mosley's best. He creates a heartbreaking, redemptive character in Socrates Fortlow. These chapters all connect or stand on their own as a testament to a man who has learned the hard way the lesson of redemption. His dignity and strength shine forth in all of his dealings with the people in his life. They are all connected by Fortlow's message of responsibility for one's actions. Walter Mosley has created a language that brings out the quiet strength in Socrates Fortlow. Can't wait for other Fortlow books."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"I've read and enjoyed the Easy Rawlins mysteries, but I Mosely's latest--a linked collection of stories about an ex-con/Knight Errant in Watts--firmly cements him (in my mind at least) as of one of the greats. I haven't been this absorbed by a character (or admired such economy of language) since I picked up my first Chandler novel years ago. In a recent interview in Time Out New York, Mosely hinted that he had originally planned to do 47 Socrates Fortlow stories, instead of just the dozen or so that appear in Always Outnumbered. Damn, would I kill to read the rest."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"this is an outstanding and realistic book about both the black society and for any man that is just out of prison and determained to make it. he make no excuses, he becomes a mentor to a young man trying to keep him from gangs and crime in watts. it gives you a hard long look at life, but it is both sad and uplifting as it shows a man who refuses to quit and finds his place in society and stays free"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This book should be read by everyone - especially by those afflicted by prejudices.

A minimum editorial labor could have pruned the explanations that are unnecessary when the stories are compiled. The reader across the bay from me was too harsh with ALWAYS PREDICTABLE, ALWAYS MANIPULATIVE-- it's OFTEN PREDICTABLE, OFTEN MANIPULATIVE.

I enjoyed this collection of stories, but I wanted it to turn into a novel (which might be next . . .) instead of a series of pat character sketches. I got tired of being introduced to the same character again and again. I know I shouldn't read a collection of stories as a novel, but I found Mosley's engaging writing hard to put down. So like a bag of potato chips, you can't have just one. Yet alas, like those chips, you wish for more substance. . ."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This is another boonie dog book review from Wolfie and Kansas. When we reviewed Walter Mosley's book &quot;A Little Yellow Dog&quot;, we complained that it was miscaninthropic. In Mosley's latest book, &quot;Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned&quot;, a collection of generally quite good short stories about an ex-con named Socrates Fortlow, Mosley displays an improved attitude towards canines. In a story entitled &quot;Black Dog&quot;, Fortlow rescues a large black dog who was run over by a car. Fortlow also punches out the driver who committed the atrocious act. Now that dogs have moved from the status of evil nemesis to victims in need of rescue from benevolent humans in Mosley's writing, perhaps in the future Mosley will portray us in a positive light."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"For years, we've seen the growth of so-called feminist writing. In my opinion, this is about as close to masculinist writing as you can get. It explores the soul of a man who wakes up every day and knows that he did this to himself. It's about a man who strives to keep living another day, the best years of his life gone, trying to live up to a standard he failed years ago. It asks the question what is a man? Those who criticize it as predictable or formulaic forget that life itself is predictable and formulaic. It's what you do with it that counts. Most of us will never face the trials of Socrates, being shielded from his cold reality by the concerns of credit cards and will I have to go with cloth instead of leather seats. But in the end, we still face the same questions. I applaud Walter Mosley for such an honest look into the soul of man."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"Mosley has a great knack for chatacter development and paints a plot that makes it hard o put this story down.

You can see and feel the anger of Socrates when people sometimes carelessly, sometimes callously disregard and disrespect him because he's old, poor, Black and sometimes just a little crazy. This series of stories made me rethink my own responses to the so called streetpeople I've worked with in a professional capacity with care and understanding of their feelings but calculatingly avoided otherwise. Socrates had his own moral code, his own sense of justice and though he didn't see himself as such, he was a good man."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"This is an incredibly well written work about redemption.

It is bleak and inspiring, engaging and challenging in its language, its characters and its forthright moral teaching."},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"The novel ~Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned~ by Water Mosley is a dramatic story that follows the adulthood of Socrates Fortlow; a convicted rapist and murderer who lives in Watts, Los Angeles. After being in prison for 27 years, Socrates tries to redeem himself by helping others with their own troubles and problems. Throughout the book, he comes across many people who change his life while he helps them. Socrates' journey shows him that life goes on even after it has stopped for him. He especially tries to help Darryl, a teenager who is on the same path of self-destruction that Socrates took, with his uneasy life in the ghetto. And as Socrates comes in contact with more and more people, he realizes that there is some humanity left within him and maybe even this world.This book has many adult themes in it from the dialogue to the main character being a convicted rapist and murderer. We believe this book should be read by more advanced readers. The format of the book is very complex. It does not go in chronological order. A chapter might begin with something that happened three weeks before the initial reading, and the whole chapter might be on that sole event. If you have read ~House on Mango Street~ by Sandra Cisneros, which follows the same format, this novel is not so hard. However, if you have not experienced this kind of reading before, you might find yourself lost frequently. Anyone below high school will have a hard time with this book. ~Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned~ has many dramatic and depressing themes and chapters. We do not suggest this if you are looking for an uplifting book. Many controversial subjects are covered in this book like racism, discrimination, the life in a ghetto, murder, rape, and many other things that some people find uneasy to talk to about.However, the book is fascinating, suspenseful, and makes you think. The novel is made to keep you on your toes with every twist of the story. Socrates becomes the unlikely hero that by the end of the book will leave you wanting more. We recommend this to anyone that is looking for an intense and wonderful novel that shows that there could be a little good still left in anyone no matter what.Greg, Christian, Carrie &amp; Ni - Culver Academy"},{"Title":"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned","review":"1. What is the text about? A series of interrelated stories about an ex-con living in Los Angeles; redemption and change2. What is good about it? The stories are crispy written and evocative. Mosley writes with strong themes but doesn't bash you with them.3. What is not so good about it? Nothing. But it's not a traditional narrative and those seeking that type of work may be disappointed (but not likely).4. Who might like it? Fans of Mosley's other work (the Easy Rawlins series); fans of sociological fiction, African American themed fiction.5. Personal bias: None really, except I like Mosley's work a lot. This is more &quot;literary&quot; than the Easy Rawlins stuff."},{"Title":"British Secret Projects : Jet Fighters Since 1950","review":"In this area of aviation, it is common place to find literature on American X-planes and German post war projects. However it seems as though the rest of the worlds experimental and prototype aeroplanes have been simply overlooked! Thinking I knew the majority of British prototypes, I purchased this book as a 'coffee table' reference only to be pleasantly surprised at the amount of content that was unknown to myself! I believe Tony Butler has produced a real gem in this genre. The book in written in a no-nonsense simple format, dividing the aircraft both chronologically and in sections by type and manufacture. Obscure and rare 3-view drawings make up the majority of the book's graphics, with a large amount of photos and artist impressions thrown in between the script. Compliments must also be extended to the publishers for producing the book in a glossy format (similar to their other published books: Luftwaffe Secret Projects, Fighters and Bombers). My only negative comment would be that more colour artist impressions should have been included. This would have been a great source as a modelling reference and also to enhance the books appeal to those who would not be that inclined to read a book on this subject. All in all, this book is definitely recommended to all those interested in this area of aviation, and I only hope someone will now produce a similar book on Japanese and European Secret Projects!"},{"Title":"British Secret Projects : Jet Fighters Since 1950","review":"X-planes have always held a special place in the aviation enthusiasts' heart. The fascination with what could have been and an enthusiasm for unheralded aircraft designs are showcased in this solid Midlands Publishing book by Tony Buttler entitled British Secret Projects: Jet Fighters Since 1950. The book, chock full of photographs, diagrams, and models of projects that never made the prototype stage, brings new life to many hidden aspects of the post-World War II British aviation industry. Buttler has worked with renowned Soviet aircraft expert Yefim Gordon, and has learned much from him in regards to delivering a book equally fascinating to both aviation buffs and modelers.Thanks to this book, we get the chance to learn more about what was once a sketch on a designer's notepad. Buttler examines the development of British fighter aircraft by breaking down the book into 15 chapters, each focusing on a different type of aircraft requirement by the British government. For example instead of lumping interceptors into just one chapter, Buttler breaks it into naval all-weather, naval day interceptors, and high altitude fighters. This allows a more detailed examination of the development of each type over a decade's time and how designs evolve in response to manufacturer and government input and to changes in the initial requirement.Other chapters include variable geometry designs, the first British supersonic designs, and fighters designed to reach speeds of Mach 2 or higher. The designs from manufactures like Hawker, Gloster, Fairey, Bristol, Short, Supermarine, and Vickers range from the unique to the truly bizarre. Some designs have an elegance and beauty unknown to American and Soviets designs, most notably the De Havilland DH.116 naval fighter with its graceful wing sweep and T-tail, the Fairey F.155T delta winged, twin engine interceptor, and the twin-boomed supersonic STOVL Hawker Siddley P.1216.At 176 pages and with well over 200 color, black and white photographs, and design sketches, this book is full of everything an aviation enthusiast desires. The only negative is that the British aviation industry had neither the industrial base nor the technological capacity to build and research aircraft like the Americans and Soviets did, thereby leaving many of the designs to a mere sketch or model instead of developing into actual prototypes. Interestingly enough, however, if one compares the progression of fighter design in Britain after the introduction of the jet engine to that of American and Soviet designs, many similarities emerge. This demonstrates that the science of aeronautics and the physics involved in flight heavily determines the progression of design and development.After the 1960's the British began using American or joint-design aircraft like the Phantom, the Tornado, and the Eurofighter. Only the Harrier and the BAE Hawk, pure products of British design, have survived to this day in service. For the future, with the loss of so many British design bureaus and the internationalization of fighter design, it is unlikely we shall ever see a pure British design again. The Eurofighter and Joint Strike Fighter seem poised to serve for the next 30-40 years wearing the colors that once graced the wings of a Spitfire or Meteor.The Secret Projects series from Midland Publishing gives a glimpse into the fascinating world of aircraft design that might have been forever lost if not for the passion and diligence of the author and publisher. This is a great addition to the series and a must for the collector's shelf. This and other Midland Publishing books can be ordered here on Amazon, directly from the US distributor, Specialty Press, or on their website specialtypress.com. Highly recommended for enthusiasts and modelers.A.G.

In British Secret Projects: Jet Fighters Since 1950 the reader will find a very complete history of jet development in the U.K. Mr. Buttler does more than cover aircraft from 1950, he also reviews the first secret projects such as the Miles M.52 to give a historical perspective of where British jet development started and where it was going.

Very well written, manages to include sufficient tech data for most people, while opening eyes as to the incredible range of ideas that the Brits were, damned sad to say, not allowed to take to the air with. Some of the machines have an odd, almost Russian look to them, while others would not be mistaken for anything but the products of the finest British designers. Don't hesitate, get a copy.

You think that after the events in Dark Angel and Fallen Hearts, that Tony would finally learn his lesson. But no he goes back to being the controlling, manipulator, he always was maybe even more so in some ways. In fact he's just outright pathetic here. He tells Annie that he has the chance to make amends and wants to, and maybe he did which is the sad part. Unfortunately for him he can't be any other way so he literally pays off Drake so they could keep Annie away from her past and what's left of her family especially Luke.I don't agree with many of the reviews where Annie is accused of being whiny and spoiled; no Annie is not as strong as Heaven but in all fairness she never had to face the obstacles Heaven did and had no reason to until now. Considering what happened to her I think Annie did show a lot of strength and defiance in some ways, especially when she was faced with Tony and Drake's lies, but she was annoying in her near obsession of Luke who she thought was her half brother at one time. I was annoyed that she be upset at the thought of his finding a possible girlfriend why were they allowed to become so close like this? They weren't locked up together like Chris and Cathy so in some ways its bizarre. It's okay that they were close but to develop those kind of feelings. It's not like they didn't have lives outside each other's and yet it seems that way. Oh well. In getting back to Tony like I said just pathetic. That he could still have that old lust for the young Leigh; how sad. I guess Leigh came back through Heaven and then through Annie and so on.Still not a bad book just wish Heaven didn't have to die and the way she did too. No surprise that Fanny's jealousy drove her to her death practically. But why would Heaven being the strong willed woman she always was; get in a car with a drunk Logan when a storm was about to start? She knew the storm was starting and she knew Logan had enough to drink; more than anything why did they put up with Fanny? Why even go to that party when all she did was keep throwing her affair with Logan in their face? And did anyone catch the butler being Gerald one moment and George in another chapter? That was funny. I still recommend the books but the first two were the best. The third was good too but Troy was said to have been found in the second book and Logan should not have slept with Fanny.A.M Torres author of Love Child"},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"I would recommend that you read Heaven and Dark Angel. Even Fallen Hearts, while mostly written by the ghost writer, does helpfully wrap up many issues in the series. Gates of Paradise is unnecessary because Heaven and Logan die off early in the book, leaving us at the mercy of their whiney sheltered teen daughter Annie. Her devastating car accident does not make her a more interesting person to hear from, and neither do her artistic talent or her complicated feelings toward her good-boy half-brother. Heaven's real father, the wealthy Tony Tatterton, insists he is the only one equipped to help Annie recover. She is bundled off to Farthinggale Manor, and is dismayed to see that the mysterious estate of her dreams has fallen into serious decay. She does not know what Tony is really like, but as a V.C. Andrews fan I prefer to remember him the way he was- articulate and cultured and astute. Now he instantly comes off like a confused old pervert who dazedly repeats whole sentences, word for word, from the previous volumes. His servants have aged right along with him, though Rye Whiskey's speech patterns have become offensively 'Gone With The Wind'-ish. (Actually this book does have some camp value.) I had a real inability to get past Annie's fussiness (\\"I WON'T take a nap until I see Tony!\\" \\"I wanted my beautiful sweet-smelling mother, not this ugly stranger!\\" \\"The maid's dumpy figure doomed her to always be someone else's domestic servant, I imagined...\\" The same kind of humiliating, disgusting event happened to Annie as did her mother at Winterhaven; yet, while I felt outraged when it happened to Heaven, I felt this wicked glee when Annie started screaming, 'OH, NO!' Otherwise, the text is nothing but Luke's supposed abandonment and Tony's boring persistence in turning Annie into a Heaven clone. As a reader nears the end of the book, hoping for at least one really sordid scene, Annie manages to hold Tony off before he can do irreparable harm! (Could it be the ghost writer thought it would be too much to inflict incest on a crippled person?) Rather disappointing tale; it gets two stars only because Drake's transformation into a wealth-obsessed Tatterton protege was kind of sad and interesting. Troy (esconced beyond the maze after all) is responsible for Annie's rescue from Farthinggale Manor, and he clears up the issue of Annie's true parentage so she won't feel guilt-ridden about loving the guy she thought was her half-brother all her life. And Aunt Fanny finally reforms. Sorry about the spoilers, but this book is best skipped. The prequel, Web Of Dreams, is more interesting because of Leigh's point of view about what really went on in that mansion and the shack in the Willies."},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"I thought Annie was a spoiled little brat throughout the novel. I actually wished Tony was killed in the first few chapters instead of Heaven and Logan. I think the book could've been better without the repeating of history (Annie getting convinced to dye her hair like Leigh and Tony trying to rape her the same way he tried to do with Heaven)...it would've been nice to have a story from Fanny's viewpoint."},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"While not as good as the other Casteel books (possibly because it was finished by Andrew Neiderman after VCAndrew's death), this book is still a very good read. The ending felt a bit rushed, but if you read the first three Heaven books and want to see how the saga closes, pick up this book. There's not as much action in here since it's supposed to be the end of the Casteel saga so the ending might feel cliched and I definitely think it could have been better, but c'est la vie. 4 out of five stars isn't so bad, after all."},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"The same events could have happened, minus 200 pages of continuing saga of Annie being mistreated by Tony. Her character is whiny, boring, and vapid; I just wanted it all to end."},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"I'm a big fan of VC Andrews, but I found myself disappointed with this book. There were continuity problems, typos, and some of the dialogue between Tony and Annie could have been cut and pasted from the previous books. It seemed like the publishers were in a hurry to churn out the next book, without having proofread this one first. One of the things that irritated me most was a small thing, granted, but still annoying. I have the paperback, and on page 132, Annie whines about not wearing the charm bracelet from Luke. What charm bracelet? I flipped back through the previous chapters, and this was the first time it was ever mentioned. The author also talks about a bracelet from Drake that just mysteriously appeared, also. Apparently, the author can't seem to get the story straight. And, yes, Annie is a bit of a whiner.

I would have liked it more if Annie did not whine all the damned time! She was nothing like Heaven! She was virtually spineless! All Annie did was complain and complain. When Heaven hit hard times, she straightened her back and dealt with it. It just seemed with age, Tony became more and more demented. This is not the man who helped toughen Heaven into an even stronger young woman. Unfortunately, Tony is a sick, weak, broken man who is caught up in the image of Leigh, Jillian, and then Heaven and Annie. But back to Annie. She just got on my nerves and she was spoiled. I skipped over a lot of passages, unfortunately. Well, since I am a Die Hard V.C. Andrews fan, with the exception of her Wildflower series, I feel I have been generous with my rating.

Although I know that is the formula V.C. uses I still don't like it much. You become so attached to the Heaven in the first three books that changing point of view to the daughter's side is kinda weird. I have to admit that in the Cutler series when the same thing happened in the fourth book I enjoyed much more. I think the only reason I didn't enjoy this one as much was because there wasn't much action. And all the mysteries in the book you already new the answers from the previous books. It was fun though to see your old favorite characeters progress. Like Aunt Fanny wasn't so immature anymore and Tony Tatterton really was a sick demented guy. I have to admit I always felt a little sorry for Tony in the past few books but not in this one.

Like many of V. C. Andrews' heroines, Annie has one forbidden love--her half-brother, Luke Casteel, Jr--, who she misses terribly when she is sent to her grandfather's mansion (Farthinggale Manor) in Boston to recuperate. While she's there, Annie is not only mistreated by her nurse (Mrs. Broadfield), but by her delusional grandfather, Tony Tatterton, who mistakes her for Heaven and Leigh quite often. Because she's isolated from most of her family, Annie has no one to really turn to, except a mysterious older man who calls himself Timothy Brothers and lives in the cottage nearby.\\"Gates of Paradise\\" is the only disappointing book in this series; the other four books--\\"Heaven\\" (#1), \\"Dark Angel\\" (#2), \\"Fallen Hearts\\" (#3), and \\"Web of Dreams\\" (#5)--are all terrific. I had a hard time liking Annie's character; she was too whiny and weak and nothing like her mother, Heaven, who was quite a fighter. Plus, the plot was a little dull with Annie confined to her room or her wheelchair. There weren't a lot of new secrets revealed either; most of them had been uncovered in the previous three books. So, what exactly was the point of this book?Despite \\"Gates of Paradise\\", the Casteel series is still one of my favorite series by V. C. Andrews.

The antagonism between Drake and Luke is never adequately explored -- it seems there could have been a lot of incestuous, sexual rivalry between them and that would explain Drake's inexplicable lies about Luke's supposed frat-boy feats. There is also no explanation about just why all Tony's servants love him so much, even though he's an elitist jerk and they know damn well what a disturbing lech he is.And just how is it that Fanny and Luke get to Annie's bedroom to save her, when it's unlikely they would have gained admittance without Tony's permission?And why do Our Jane and Keith never make an appearance?I feel like much of this might have been addressed by the original author."},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"Annie had a cruel blow when her mom Heaven and her \\"dad\\" Logan died.

Annie is exactly like me; wishing for her prince to sweep her away of to his castle, the eternal optimist. Even when they play their &quot;fantasy game&quot; it stirs something special inside. Luke is a perfect for Annie, they go together like two doves. When they're forced to be seperated by the car crash that takes Annie off to Farthingagle Manor, you feel them longing for eachother. It's so romantic! I don't know why I'm so affected by this book, but I am. If you haven't read it yet, go and read it now! It plays on your heartstrings, makes you fall in love with the characters. I LOVE it, and would read it another five times!"},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"I have two problems with this book. The first one is that the ghost writer did not use one single line of original dialogue throughout the entire story. He just rehashed the whole plot with Heaven again. If you read Fallen Hearts, you won't miss anything in this book. All the elements are there, and back again. Annie dies her hair blond, hmm....Somebody decides to go for a midnight walk and ends up in someone else's bed in the middle of the night. Sound familar? Tony completed deteoriated, the ghostwriter didn't even get the color of his hair right. And, he wasn't the strong, dangerous and intriguing character from the first book, he became a cookie cutter villian that spouted whole lines of dialogue from the previous books back at Annie when he was having a \\"moment\\". The ghostwriter blames this on senility. That sounds like an easy way out.The second thing is, as numerous other reviewers have pointed out, Annie is the most moronic, whiny, little fool. I guess Heaven and Logan really messed up there. I personally didn't care about what happened to her, especially since the same things from every other book VC wrote were just transferred onto her simpering, crybaby little head. What a horrible end to a genuinely touching series. This is one of the few VC Andrews books I never reread back when I was really gung ho for all these books.This is also the ghostwriter's ghastly debut. The good news is that he gets better. It would be hard to outdo this book with it's pure lack of everything. With this book, he could have just handed you a piece of paper directing you to the various pages numbers of previous VC Andrews books that he directly ripped off, instead of wasting more paper. A six year old with mad libs and a list of adjectives could have been more creative. But to give him credit, like I said, he does do better in some of his later series.So anyway, you probably don't want to buy this book. Get it in the library, before you go on a long plane ride."},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"I honestly liked this book, yet there were a lot of parts that irritated me. This was when Annie complained all the time. (Such as when she said, 'I miss this, and I miss that.. etc) There was a lot of repeating. I think we already knew that Annie missed her parents! However, more interesting parts consists of when she discovered Troy still alive after all that time she though he was dead, Tony being the lost and lonely person he was and how Annie managed to conquer it all and not let anyone stop her from being healthy again. I couldn't put this book down, so if you are weighing on whether or not you should read this book, I recommend it very much so. :)"},{"Title":"Gates Of Paradise","review":"I hated this book.

Perhaps that was unavoidable given that the author set out to recount the references to the grizzly bear found in the Lewis and Clark journals. There is a good deal of the author's analysis of the writings. Toward the end of the book the author takes to task those who have used the Lewis and Clark writings to advance their own views and agendas concerning the grizzly bear and the environment.

Here is his ultimate mastery of light and color.Although commercial illustration built his fame and fortune, Parrish's true love was landscape painting. Many excerpts from his correspondence attest to this fact and provide a remarkable glimpse into the background of the artist.There are several pages of photos of Parrish's estate, &quot;The Oaks&quot;, which provided the inspiration for many of his works. Now owned by the author, it is evident how these magnificent grounds are reflected in the paintings.The book concludes with 34 full page color plates of landscape paintings produced for the Brown &amp; Bigelow Co. from 1936-1963. Having been a Parrish fan for years, I found several new favorites here."},{"Title":"Maxfield Parrish: The Landscapes","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have been a huge Maxfield Parrish fan since the early 70's. His landscapes are my favorite. But this book has very few paintings from the artist and seems to focus more on the photos of the farm where he lived. I felt that I was very misled by the title 'The Landscapes'. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I thought it was a waste of money. I have seen more of his Landscapes in magazine articles!"},{"Title":"Maxfield Parrish: The Landscapes","review":"If I could have found a copy of this book to preview before ordering I never would have bought this book.

This book was a disappointment to me."},{"Title":"The Axe,","review":"To understand The Axe one has to read the entire tetralogy of the Master of Hestviken. Therefore this review applies to the whole, as well as the part. A memorable saga, not only of a good man gone wrong (not gone bad) in the incredibly harsh times of medieval Norway, but also of his soul through the various stages of Catholic spirituality and redemption. Sigrid Undset is a master of both historical and spiritual fiction, as well as a deserving Nobel prize winner in literature. A must read for serious soul searchers, but above all for serious Catholics. I felt I had insights into my own nature as a person as I read about Olav Audunsson and participated in his thoughts, troubles and dilemmas. A masterful work of literature. Norway is beautifully described together with its medieval traditions and beliefs. If you enjoy good and serious historical fiction from a Christian perspective, you must read Sigrid Undset."},{"Title":"The Axe,","review":"I had never read anything by Sigrid Undset until I read this novel, though I had wanted to for a while. Reading Undset sounded like a reading experience that couldn't be replicated, Who else is a female, Nobel-Prize-winning, Norwegian, historic novelist whose work is compared to Tolstoy's. Anyway, after reading The Axe (not even considered her best work), I would say she certainly lived up to my expectations.The basic plot follows Olav Audunsson and Ingunn Steinfinnsdatter (don't be scared away by the names). They were betrothed as children under rather mysterious circumstances and were then raised together. Eventually, the two fall in love, and want to finally get married, seeing as they were betrothed to one another anyway. Times have changed, though, and the powers that be have decided to marry them off elsewhere. Olav and Ingunn vow to fight for their marriage, and the remainder of the action is this intense struggle.The novel is superb. The writing at some moments, particularly the early love scenes, is truly sublime, with the lush imagery set up against the unique medieval Norwegian backdrop. I had to read a number of passages over and over just to reexperience their beauty. The moral scope of the novel also strikes me as particularly powerful and certainly invites comparison to Tolstoy. The events of the novel are all marked by a sin early in the novel which sends everyone into a moral tailspin. The characters are trapped in a moral maelstrom of their own making and in their struggle to find some sort of redemption is the ultimate meaning of the novel.The Axe is one of the best novels I have ever read. Sigrid Undset cannot be forgotten. I can scarcely wait to read the rest of the Hestviken saga."},{"Title":"The Axe,","review":"Sigrid Undset favored this work over her more popular Kristin Lavransdatter. But I found it more difficult to relate to the lives of Olav Audunsson and his lover Ingunn Steinfinnsdatter, and had to read the book several times before I remembered it as well as Kristin. There is an overall atmosphere of hopelessness and depression that makes reading the book somewhat agonizing. Yet, the characters, plot and setting are conveyed so realistically, that one feels as if one knows the characters. There is no doubt in my mind that this is truly a literary masterwork."},{"Title":"The Axe,","review":"I've read The Axe twice. It is superb. Undset's peers are writers like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.However, my edition, at least, lacks family tree pages. So here's some help for those who might be confused.1.OLAV AUDUNSSON'S ANCESTRYOlav Audunsson is the novel's hero. He was fostered by Steinfinn Toresson, but his parents were Audun and Cecilia. Cecilia was daughter of Bjorn Andersson and Lady Margrete, whose first husband was Erik, their children being Erik and Barnim. Barnim is important to the young Olav Audunsson.Audun was son of Ingolf and Ragna. Ingolf was one of five children of Olav Olavsson and Astrid Helgesdatter: the others were Helge, Halldis (who married Ivar Staal), Borgny, and Torgils \\"Foulbeard.\\" Foulbeard, who is still alive when Olav Audunsson is a youth, was foster-brother with Olav Half-Priest. Foulbeard sired a son, Arne, on a woman named Astrid. Astrid's brother was Benedikt Besseson. Arne was the father of Signe, Una, and Torgunn.Olav Olavsson was son of Olav Torgilsson and Tora Ingolfsdatter. Olav Olavsson's grandfather was Torgils of Dyfrin, a great estate that Olav Audunsson passes in the third novel of the Master of Hestviken quartet. The axe of the novel's title has passed down to Olav from the Dyfrin days.Astrid Helgesdatter was sister of Ingolf Helgesson.Olav Ingolfsson is an \\"old kinsman\\" of Olav Audunsson's; Ingolfsson's mother was Bergljot of Tveit, and his siblings include Kaare.Olav Ribbung is a great-grandfather of Olav Audunsson.2.INGUNN STEINFINNSDATTER'S ANCESTRYIngunn and Olav Audunsson become lovers in The Axe, their youthful desires coinciding with an ambiguous betrothal. Ingunn is one of four children, the others being Tora, Hallvard, and Jon, of Steinfinn and Ingebjorg. Tora marries Haakon Gautsson, who at one point might have married Ingunn. Haakon's sister is Helga.Steinfinn is one of five children of Tore of Hov and Aasa. The others are Ivar, Magnhild, Herdis and Magnus.Tore of Hov also sired children by his concubine, Borghild: at least two, Ragnhild and Kolbein. Olav Audunsson will kill one of Kolbein's sons, Einar. The other is Haftor.Aasa, Tore's wife, is daughter of Magnus, and her siblings are Hillebjorg and Finn. Hillebjorg married a man named Finn, and their son was Arnvid, an important person in the lives of Olav and Ingunn. Arnvid was forced to marry Tordis; their children were Magnus, Funn, and Steinar.If there are any inaccuracies above, I hope they can be set right! But I think the above is correct."},{"Title":"The Axe,","review":"While this is not in the same class as the Kristen Lavransdatter trilogy which brought Undset the Nobel prize, The Master of Hestvicken series is a beautifully told story of love set in 13th century Norway. Undset's descriptions and attention to historical detail are wonderful as usual, but the love between Olav Audunsson & Ingunn Steinfinnsdatter is ill-fated and heavy. In Book 1, The Axe, Olav & Ingunn are joined together as children and parted by family disputes."},{"Title":"The Axe,","review":"I moved on to the other, less well-known historical novel (4 volumes, this is the first) by Sigrid Undset after finishing Kristin Lavransdatter for the 2nd time and being in withdrawal. When I say the Master of Hestviken series is even better than KL, I should qualify that I am pretty impressionable about a book I have just finished. Many similar themes from KL--paying the price for young love--but following the life of a man from birth to death. The same beautiful details about life in midevil Norway, a little less of the interior monologues about religion and faith. I love both of SU's works that won her the Nobel Prize in literature. I am surprised that they and she are not more well known. I read somewhere that she personally preferred the Master series to KL, so maybe that colors my thoughts about which is better. If you love KL, definitely don't miss the Master of Hestviken. If you have never read S Undset before, you are in for a treat (if you like epic fiction set in earlier times, like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.) I want to reread KL and the Master at every stage of my life, because there is so much profound wisdom in her stories and reflections about the consequences of our choices. One note about the Master series--whereas the KL trilogy has a newer translation with a less stilted, old fashioned English, the Master series has only one translation that is a little challenging to get used to, with its old English expressions. However, you quickly get used to it and can enjoy the story. Also, I purchased Vol. 1 in hard copy, then was in a hurry to continue and read 2-4 on Kindle. I prefer to hold the real book in my hands, and you can find less expensive used copies, but instant gratification won the day.

Also, last year I read Undset's much smaller novel \\"Gunnar's Daughter\\" and was very pleased with that as well. I guess my expectations were too high with these first two examples, for I was a bit disappointed with this first book in the tetralogy. Don't get me wrong I liked it well enough, but I thought it just wasn't up to standard with her other work.

It is well-known that, in Being and Nothingness, Sartre promised to publish a treatise on ethics, the implication being that it would be based on the ontology of that work. Notebooks for an Ethics shows him struggling to fulfil that promise, but ultimately failing as his basic perspective changes. It is indispensable reading for anyone having, or seeking, a view on whether it is possible to build an ethics upon the foundations of Sartre's early existentialism."},{"Title":"The U.S. Merchant Marine at War, 1775-1945","review":"Felknor has put together a treasure which covers the role of the Merchant Marine in war from the privateers to the Murmansk Run through excerpts and even entire chapters from hard-to-find books. For example, the story of Raphael Semmes, Master of the very successful Confederate raider &quot;Alabama,&quot; comes from books published in 1886, 1900, 1913, and 1985. Fully 165 of the 335 pages of text cover the Revolutionary War to World War I period. Organizing convoys and strategies to overcome U-Boats and surface raiders were learned with great loss of life during the &quot;War to End All Wars.&quot; Unfortunately this knowledge was lost by the start of World War II: due to lack of foresight and stubbornest on the part of Naval leaders (both British and American). The chapter &quot;Inside Battles&quot; covers this topic with great insight and honesty. While Felknor's World War II chapters cover some of the well known stories such as the SS Stephen Hopkins, there are many not so well known, but just as poignant. Fascinating was Felknor's extensive discussion of Mulberries, Gooseberries, Lobnitz pierheads, and Phoenixes -- all part of the Normandy harbor created to supply the invasion. There's much more, all very well chosen. Bruce Felknor was a radioman in the merchant marine in World War II. I highly recommend The U.S. Merchant Marine at War, 1775-1945 as a very readable addition to your bookshelf, and an excellent reference book that puts the Merchant Marine role in American history in perspective."},{"Title":"The U.S. Merchant Marine at War, 1775-1945","review":"Bruce Felknor takes you into the real world of the merchant marine at war, drawing on obscure ship company documents and often letting the words of the seamen speak eloquently themselves.

It is by far one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read, and I read a lot of books.I found there was no suspense to the writing, since from the beginning, the reader was able to suspect what the outcome was going to be, and was proven right by the time you read the last paragraph. I personally found the book boring to read, because I guessed what the outcome was going to be, and every chapter confirmed my suspicions. I found the plot development to be very poor, with stereotypes imbedded in several characters, especially the main character.I don't wish to give away the ending of the book completely, but I will say this much-- when you base your whole plot on a madman, is there any plot at all? The author uses his &quot;villian&quot; as a crutch, using the character's lunacy as an escape route for any unbound plot threads.I personally recommend you don't waste your time on this book, if you're looking for a some good classics, try &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; or &quot;David Copperfield&quot;."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"Many fans and critics agree that Wilkie Collins' writing talent declined after the gripping \\"The Moonstone,\\" and his works in the 1870s and 80s are sometimes dismissed as misfires of once-genius mystery writer. Though part of the low estimation is reasonable (and some of the works in this era testifies to this opinion), many of them are still readable and interesting. And \\"The Law and the Lady\\" should be classified among those neglected pieces.Probably the first full-length novel featuring female detective, the novel follows the story of heroine Valeria, who marries Eustace happily in the opening of the book. However, she discovers behind the happy marriage a terrible secret, which involved an unsolved murder case in her newly-wed husband's past, and soon she realizes that her husband is not exactly what she thought. To clear her tainted (and his) family name, Valeria single-handedly embarks on a job of amateur detective.To fully relish the story, you have to remember several things: one of them is that the book is partly inspired by the real-life case of Madeline Smith, who, it was alleged, disposed of her lover with arsenic. Collins made use of this well-known, sensational case, changing the sex of the accused, and he deftly challenges many concepts embedded in morally strict Victorians. So, when Valeria appoints herself as a detective, her \\"job\\" (in Victorian society in which ladies are supposed not to work, with the possible exception of poorly-paid governess) starts to have another meaning. Collins, on the one hand attacking the insufficient laws of Scotland, which give its unique \\"Not-Proven\\" verdict to the accused when the jury cannot decide whether or not he/she is guilty, also challenges the morally rigid Victorian ideas about male/female concept. This is not to say Wilkie Collins is a feminist; but considering he never married (but, it is generally agreed, had two mistresses), his unique ideas about contemporary males and females are reflected in this seemingly starange work.And as a detective novel, \\"The Law and The lady\\" has still power to entertain us. Though its beginning part is a little shaky because of implausible situations, the book gradually gets you into the thrilling adventure of Valeria, who overcomes all the barriars on her way to the truth. Though the fact that Collins' best work(s) is \\"The Moonstone\\" or \\"The Woman in White,\\" this book is enjoyable. shows some version of Victorian ideas about the roles of males and females.By the way, it is argued that the first fictional female detective (including amateur) is also created by Collins in his short story \\"The Diary of Anne Rodway.\\" (1856) This short can be found in most of the collection of his short stories. But if you know another contender for the first female PI, let me know."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"Valeria meets Eustace, a man who seems to have few friends and lots of secrets. They fall passionately in love and are soon married. On their honeymoon Valeria finds out that Eustace married her under an assumed name...and that he was never acquitted of the murder of his first wife. Eustace immediately leaves her to protect her from his shame and disgrace.Her happiness crumbles, but she steadfastly believes in his innocence. She makes it her life's goal to prove he did NOT murder his wife, to clear his name. But if he didn't murder his wife, then who did? Women were not supposed to investigate these matters in those days, so she faces lots of opposition, even from her friends.Valeria is a wonderful, strong female lead and the reader can't help but cheer her on in her battles. Along her journey she meets some eccentric characters that brighten the novel, such as Major Fitz-David - a 'major' flirt, and the brilliant, eccentric disabled man named Dexter.I loved this book. After Part One I could NOT put it down...I needed to find out how it ended.It's hard to say anything bad about this book. The only negative to me was reading the views of society at the time. Women and disabled people were not treated with the respect they deserved, and it bothers me to read that. However, Valeria fights against those stereotypes and I greatly enjoyed her small victories.This book has a little of everything...mystery, suspense, insanity, secret diaries, romance, etc. If you enjoy books like Jane Eyre and The Woman in White, you'll probably love this book too."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"Wilkie Collins is most famous for his classic mysteries, &quot;The Moonstone&quot; and &quot;The Woman in White.&quot; Both were influences to 20th century mystery masters like Dorothy Sayers. In &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; first published in 1875, Collins focuses on the plight of Valeria Woodville who unwittingly marries a man previously tried for poisoning his first wife. Evidence and testimony could not convince the jury of his guilt or innocence, and an unusual Scotch verdict of &quot;Not Proven&quot; is handed down. He assumes a new name and conceals his tainted past when he marries Valeria. She, however, proves to be a very perceptive and resourceful woman who discovers the truth on her own. Unshaken in her love, she vows to clear her husband's name and reputation in order to secure their future happiness.*** In his signature works, Collins often frustrates the reader's patience with his lengthy narrative style. But &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; moves along surprisingly well. Despite some ridiculous and dated perceptions about the sexes (Collins frequently has characters and Valeria herself remark that she's &quot;only a woman&quot;), Valeria's actions prove she's admirably keen and the one to get things rolling.*** Collins should also get points for introducing the outrageously campy, scene-stealing characters of the lunatic genius Misserimus Dexter and his devoted, but moronic cousin Ariel. Missing both his legs, Dexter scoots around either like the &quot;new centaur&quot; (half-man, half wheel chair) or on his hands like a &quot;frog&quot;. It's this added element of circus freakshow that effectively ruffles the otherwise creaky Victorian setting."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"One of Wilkie Collins' lesser known works, THE LAW AND THE LADY is nonetheless a gripping read! Valeria's quest to acquit her husband of the murder of his ex-wife is top-notch Collins. Like token Collins' detective novels, the reader is taken deeper and deeper into the psychology of his characters. Meserimus Dexter is one of Collins' most frightening characters. His mental degeneration within the novel's gripping pages will leave you breathless. Valeria's involvement with the unstable Dexter is some of the most suspenseful reading you are likely to find in modern literature. Highly recommended to any Collins' enthusiast, or anyone looking for a great read."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"No, it's not &quot;The Woman in White&quot; or even &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, but it's still an excellent story! Collins has created another wonderful strong heroine, and this heroine is out to solve a mystery. Valeria Woodville's husband was tried for murder, and she is determined to prove his innocence, once and for all. During her investigation, she meets Miserrimus Dexter, who is perhaps the most fascinating character Collins has ever created. He certainly makes Count Fosco of &quot;The Woman in White&quot; look like a pussycat! He's the most enigmatic character -- just when you think you have him figured out, you realize you don't know anything about him! Ariel is another fascinating character study. She is worthy of pity, but pitying her is like pitying a pit bull; she turns violent at the drop of a hairbrush. Valeria herself is an interesting subject; she defies everyone, determined to prove her husband's innocence, but towards the end of the novel, she begins to behave a bit erratically. I won't say any more; you'll have to read the book to see what I mean. This is a great novel to curl up with on a rainy night, or maybe on a lazy summer Sunday afternoon -- sometime when you won't be likely to be interrupted, as you won't want to put it down until Valeria Woodville solves the mystery!"},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"Great mystery. It holds your interest from the beginning until the end! Wilkie Collins novels are all great!"},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"As a general rule I rarely enjoy the novels assigned in classical literature classes but I can usually appreciate the work for its merits. I was pleasantly surprised by The Law and the Lady because it is very readable, the first hurdle in making an assigned piece of literature more than just required text.Though it is tame by today's standards, Collins presents the relatively new concept of the &quot;amateur detective&quot; and even goes so far as to make his protagonist a woman, very unusual (and almost scandalous) by Victorian standards. To make the novel acceptable in the time it was published, Collins is very careful to temper his progressive ideas with plenty of references to Valeria Macallan's feminine weaknesses and multiple uses of the phrase &quot;only a woman&quot; but he constructed a foundation that scores of female writers and characters have built upon. Keep your eye out for parallels to the classic &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; story and how Collins treats the gender role-reversal of Valeria and Eustace.All in all, not an unpleasant book to read if required to do so. Experienced readers will recognize that, despite its faults, The Law and the Lady was very provocative when written and really jump-started the genre of female P.I.s that is so common and popular today. Valeria could be considered the great-grandmother of Kinsey Millhone or V.I. Warshawski."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"When I was a kid, I was obsessed with Nancy Drew. Not because of the characters or the plots (which even at 9 years old I knew were hackneyed), but because of the stuff -- secret passageways, crumbling old maps, Spanish lace shawls, whispering statues, jewel-encrusted automaton birds, antique lockets with hidden inscriptions . . .This book is the direct ancestor of that genre, although it was ostensibly written for grown-ups, not for kids. Collins seemed to have dreamed up the melodramatic plot and plucky female detective as an excuse to create fantastical settings filled with wondrous objects. It's a Gothic cabinet of curiosities, and utterly delectable.Here's a little sample, taken from a passage in which our heroine is searching an old gentleman's library for clues:\\"On the upper shelf there appeared, in solitary grandeur, one object only -- a gorgeously-bound book. . . . The binding was of blue velvet, with clasps of silver worked in beautiful arabesque patterns, and with a lock of the same precious metal to protect the book from prying eyes. . . .\\"Being a woman, . . . I opened the book, without a moment's hesitation. The leaves were of the finest vellum, with tastefully designed illuminations all round them. And what did these highly ornamented pages contain? To my unutterable amazement and disgust, they contained locks of hair, let neatly into the centre of each page -- with inscriptions beneath, which proved them to be love-tokens from various ladies, who had touched the Major's susceptible heart at different periods of his life . . . \\"Ah, bliss. And truly, this is not even the best of it. There are pages and pages of descriptions of the most outlandish objects, whose presence is the books seems designed merely to delight and entertain.A bit of a warning: If you are looking for literary merit of the sort found in The Moonstone or The Woman in White, you won't find it here. But if you'd like to channel your inner Nancy -- and go back to the days when a mystery novel meant creaky old staircases, dusty old books and delicious hidden treasures -- this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Law and The Lady, while not nearly as sensational or well-known as The Moonstone or The Woman in White, is widely accepted as the first story to feature a female detective. Valeria is not an official police detective-she is a woman who is determined to prove her husband's innocence of a murder charge. There is no great danger here, no wildly violent criminals or intriguing settings, and a superficial reader might find the book rather boring, especially after reading some of Collin's other efforts. However, the story not only boasts Valeria, a woman fully as determined as the first man to climb Mount Everest (and facing obstacles, in their way, almost as difficult as that gentleman surmounted) but Miserrimus Dexter, a brilliant but unstable fellow with the misfortune of being born without legs. The battle of wits between these two revolutionary characters is a fascinating look into the Victorian mind, where societal norms compete for a search for justice. Collins had an abiding interest in the marriage, divorce and property laws of England and of Scotland and the issues raised by these laws form plot points in several of his novels. The Law and The Lady in particular revolves around the unique Scottish verdict of Not Proven, Scotland allowing three verdicts in a criminal trial-Guilty, Not Guilty, and Not Proven (which some have interpreted to mean \\"Not Guilty, but don't do it again) and Collins uses the \\"Scotch verdict\\" to show how a person's life can be tainted by such a verdict, where a person goes free but is under the stigma of not being adjudged innocent. The verdict of Not Proven is still available in Scotland today, and there is vigorous debate on the advisability of allowing a person to go free with a blemish on their record. The Law and The Lady is an in-depth look at how that verdict may affect a person and their family. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Law and the Lady (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Moonstone is considered WC's best mystery novel. However, lately I've started reading Wilkie's lesser known works. The Dead Secret was extraordinary, and once again a Collins novel has captured my heart.In The Law and the Lady, newlywed, Valeria Woodville discovers that her husband married her under an assumed name. Neither her husband or his friends or family will speak about the deception bestowed upon the unsuspecting bride. The only thing Valeria's mother-in-law discloses is that she pities Valeria and will speak no more on the subject.Eustace Woodville, actually Eustace Macallen also will not reveal the reason for marrying Valeria under an assumed name. The topic is so painful to him that he abandons his bride rather than reveal the dark secret from his past. He leaves England and begs Valeria to forget him for her own good. Valeria does no such thing!The Law and the Lady is a detective novel, an excellent one, in fact. Valeria takes it upon herself to discover the secret that forced her husband to lie to the woman he so deeply loves and then abandon her rather than reveal the secret from his past.Slight spoiler coming up....Valeria's sleuthing reveal that Eustace Macallen was accused of murdering his first wife. A scottish court gave the verdict \\"not proven\\" He was not convicted of the crime, but the jury was unable to find him innocent. Eustace convinced himself that the scottish verdict would forever haunt his second wife, and she would always wonder if he actually did murder his wife.Valeria's belief in her husband's innocence never wavers. She is determined to prove her husband's innocence, even when friends and family advise that not even the best lawyers money can buy could ever change the \\"not proven\\" verdict.The Law and the Lady is the perfect novel for those who enjoyed The Moonstone or just enjoy detective novels.

Not knowing weather she'd be accepted, though wanted answers to her questions, she spends the summer in Boston with her biological family. During this overwheming quest, Mai slowy discovers and unveals the secrets of her past. She learns about all the hardships the family had to make. The amount of things they had to face in order to survive, as well staying strong as a famliy. Mai's visit may have brought back many painful memories, but it brought out alot from people. As well made the meaning of family, more important that you would think.Overall, I guess what the meaning behind this book is, is that it's important to know who you are, and that family is what bonds all of us together. It's like a spiderweb. Friends, memories, even bickering is what keeps it strong, and that, therefore connects the web together, making it whole."},{"Title":"Face in My Mirror","review":"I found this story to be pretty unique because it is written about a Vietnamese American teenager who is adopted by a Caucasian American family. She deals with racism in the small town that she lives in, majority of which who are Caucasian. From her feelings of not belonging, she goes on a journey to learn more about her Vietnamese roots. Throughout the book, the main character, Mai, is trying to learn about her past involving the mother she never knew. The book is written in a simple and personal way to where you feel close to the characters. With the author's simplistic style of writing, I believe that many young people can easily understand and get enjoyment out of it. I like the way that the author slowly revealed the secrets of Mai's past because it made me want to keep reading to find out the whole story. Other than learning the secrets of Mai's past, there are other stories in the book that are occurring at the same time which enhance the book."},{"Title":"Face in My Mirror","review":"I really enjoyed the book The Face in My Mirror by Maureen Wartski because it is a realistic tale about an adopted Vietnamese-American teenager, Mai Houston, searching for her roots. She begins her quest after a racially-motivated incident against her in her small Iowa town. While she spends her summer with her aunt, Lien, and cousins in Boston, Mai at first doesn't really feel welcome, especially by Lien, who seems to be very cold to her. During this time, Mai learns secrets about members about her family and falls in love. The book is well-written and moves quickly and the revelations of secrets will keep the reader interested. The book also contains realistic depictions of racism and its effects, family relationships, teenage life, the plight of immigrants and the influence of gangs. I recommend the book for young students starting in the sixth grade."},{"Title":"Computer Networking with Internet Protocols and Technology","review":"This is an excellent introduction to the application level of networking. Applications include protocols like telnet, mail, and the web. This is the heart of the book but there is also some discussion about the basics of networking at the physical layer including routing algorithms and packet structure.The organization of the book is interesting. It starts with a high level introduction to network, then goes into applications, and ends up with the physical layer. Either way, the text is good, though terse, and the illustrations are excellent.This textbook makes for a find way to learn the fundamentals of network applications and protocol design."},{"Title":"KEEPER'N ME","review":"Keeper 'n me By Sean PowellWithout ones culture Can a man live at peace with his soul for what he actually is? Can a Jew be a Jew without the knowledge of what is a Jew? An Indian trapped in a world where he is the only one with his looks. Can discrimination not take place? A man born Christian must know the ways of his religion before he can call himself Christian. In this novel Keeper ' n me a man must confront his racial color and become what he always was but never wanted to be. The story Keeper ' n is all about letting out feelings about ones culture. Garnet Raven is an Ojibway Indian who was separated from his family when he was just a baby. An innocent young boy taken away from his culture and tossed into a false perceptive of the world outside the reserve. The story progresses as Garnet Raven gains a false illusion of his heritage. He turns white, Hawaiian and black as he masks his real Ojibway feelings. He feels trapped and lonely since he thinks he is the only Indian in a city of blacks and whites. Later on Garnet is tracked down by his family and when released from jail. He manages to build up the courage to return to his family. As his culture is renewed Garnet becomes everything his Ojibway religion is. Keeper is a friend of Garnets family who teaches Garnet about his heritage. In trade for the knowledge Keeper asks Garnet for company and a friend. Keeper creates a meaning that pushes Garnet into an Indian man. A man he always thought he would never be. A true Ojibway. For years Indians through out Canada were forced into foster homes. They were stolen from their parents. I myself can not relate to the feeling of being taken away from my parents and thrown into the hands of foster parents. Richard Waganese who is the author adds a realistic feeling into Keeper ' n me. The richly textured dialogue takes you into the life of the Ravens. I take my hat off to Mr. Waganese for completing a difficult task of putting his speaking style onto paper. With in the novel I noticed a lot of symbolism of Garnets character. Ravens are strong, brave and courageous, those are the characteristics of Garnet. I learned from the novel that the powers of ones love and tradition can with stand any large mountain and over come any fear. Keeper ' n me is a wonderful novel about redemption and tradition. I am a Jew and I have gone through tons of religious aspects of my life not knowing where it would take me. Garnet managed to accomplish a difficult task on becoming what his ancestors were and more. He learned more things about his religion then most of his people knew and they weren't seperated from the reserve for 20 years. Richard Waganese did a marvelous job. A must read for anyone in the need of a laugh, a tear or a good time."},{"Title":"KEEPER'N ME","review":"I have just finished reading keeper'n me with my North American literature class. I am in grade 11 at centennial Academy in Montreal, Quebec. This book by Richard Wagamese is a great story about a man named Garnet Raven who goes back to his Indian home after being taken away when he was 3 years old. This story is the journey of a man who is a stranger to his own hometown. He becomes accepted and familiar with his home through the love and support from his family. This book taught me that you should find out who you really are and try not to be afraid of it. You should be proud of your culture and religion because it's a part of who your are. Garnet never felt like he had a place in the world until he went home. Garnet finds himself and learns about his people through an old friend of his grandfathers named keeper. There are all kinds of emotions in this book, sometimes it was funny, sad, or happy. So if your looking for a book that just makes you feel good inside, I definitely recommend Keeper'n me."},{"Title":"KEEPER'N ME","review":"I had to read Keeper 'n Me by Richard Wagamese for a North American Literature class at school, and I would have to say it wasn't the best book I ever read. It was humorous at parts, the way the main character, Garnet Raven, tries to get through his life searching for who he is and finally finding himself at twenty-five. What I didn't like about this book was that it was kind of slow moving, and not really the type of book I would usually read. But what I did like about it was the relaxed style in which it was written; it is almost as if the book is talking to you. The story also deals with a great issue in which all of us must face: finding out who we are. Some of us are searching for years to find out who we are, just like Garnet. I can also relate to the spirituality and contact with nature which is part of Garnet's culture, because I am a Mohawk and had knowledge of this sort of culture since I was a little kid. Altogether this book was alright, and my likes outweighed my dislikes, so I give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"KEEPER'N ME","review":"This book gave me a new perspective on what it means to be native, and what it means to honor yourself and who you really are inside. I also appreciated the warmth of the family love contained in the story. This book also inspired me to take on a vision-quest of my own.A few points in the book really touched my heart and played with my emotions. The phonetic language is cool at first, but gets a tiny bit tired by the end, as the book is all phonetic, every page, all the way through.Good spiritual lessons, especially for the lost soul. Not a bad book.

The story line is great, based on true events. Really makes me think of todays culture an todays children an our people..how we can keep livin the traditional life an still be apart of society but in our own way.

As a child Garnet Raven was abducted from his parents and village by social workers. He lost his culture and connection with his family. In despair he left his foster parents to search for who he is, he traveled from city to city. He reached Toronto he met Lonnie Flower who influenced him to adapt a black life style. It may seem that Garnet has discovered a new home and family until he is taken away from it because of possession of narcotics in which he serves a prison sentence of three years. Throughout those fifth-teen years he has been away from home, his brother Stanley has tracked him down. Garnet was offered to stay in White Dog territory. He accepts his invitation with his mother, he is convinced that it is possible establish the broken connection with his brothers (Stanley, Jackie) , sister (Jane) and his mother. Keeper is a guide to Garnets culture and traditions. In other words Keeper is Garnet's chance to learn how to become a true Indian and making up for the last fifth-teen years. My opinions on this book is that it has a good plot and multiple moral dilemmas that appeal to the youth. They provide several references on past events and what natives have undergone in the past. There are two narrators or \\"story tellers\\" in the book. It often led me into confusion most the time since the story was viewed through different perspectives. Another thing that I found difficult was the dialect, in which the writer wrote the whole book. It my shows that the story was authentic since it would read like an Indian would read it. It was quite difficult to understand what the narrator meant and in what way. Dispite how the writer presents the story it is still effective and interesting. He adds humor as a break from all the dramatic and touching scenes to give us a break and something to look forward to in the book. Great changes occurred through out the book, to the main character (Garnet) and the people around him. Overall the book was interesting but, it isn't one that can't put down cause I've been able to drop it many time willing to stop reading. It is mostly in the form of presentation that really disappointed me and brought about confusion."},{"Title":"KEEPER'N ME","review":"&quot;no matter how far from home I go i will always want to return there. home is not a place you can go to on a boat or a plain, home is a place inside of you.&quot; The wizard of Oz I recently read a story for my north American literature class called Keeper'n me. written by Richard Wagames.

This book is a summary of what was known in the field in 1994, and much has changed since then. It can however still serve as an introduction to the field of inductive logic programming, in spite of its publication date. Most of the current research and applications of inductive logic programming has concentrated on introducing stochasticity into logic programming and on how to incorporate reasoning with numerics into the framework.The authors emphasize the empirical aspects of inductive logic programming and its applications, but do spend the first few chapters detailing the theoretical foundations of the subject. The characterize machine learning paradigms as inductive, deductive, learning with genetic algorithms, and learning with neural nets. They rule out neural net learning as being a true learning system since it does not pass the \\"Michie strong criterion\\", i.e. learning must acquire new knowledge which must be understandable by humans. They do not elaborate on why neural nets fail to meet this criterion. Inductive learning of course is what they consider exclusively in the book, with inductive concept learning essentially consisting of the learning of how to recognize objects in the concept, the concept being a subset of objects in universal set of objects or observations. To define inductive concept learning more rigorously the authors employ the concept of a covering of an object, which means essentially that the description of the object satisfies the description of the concept. The object description is thus \\"covered\\" by the concept description. Notions of completeness and consistency of hypotheses are then introduced, with completeness being the requirement that the hypothesis cover all positive examples and no negative ones, while consistency meaning that it does not cover any of the negative examples. These ideas are then generalized to the case where background knowledge is present. Inductive logic programming systems are then defined as those that induce hypotheses in the form of logic programs. These systems are partitioned into those that learn predicates from scratch, called empirical ILP systems, and those that learn multiple predicates, called interactive ILP systems. The authors then discuss briefly the systems that were available at the time of writing. Only empirical ILP systems are considered by the authors in the book, with emphasis on the systems LINUS and FOIL, which were the dominant ones at the time of writing.Because of its popularity and effectiveness in logic programming, the authors employ Prolog to introduce the basic theory of logic programming. Other languages have been developed since then with ILP applications in mind, one of these being Progol. Symbolic programming languages, such as Mathematica and Maple, can also be used, and very effectively. The essentials of logic programming discussed in the book have no doubt been seen by the reader, and some familiar concepts such as Horn clauses and resolution are discussed by the authors. The goal of empirical ILP then is to find a complete and consistent definition for an unknown predicate given a set of examples and background knowledge. Concept learning is viewed as a search problem, with states in the search space being concept descriptions. The goal is to find states that satisfy a quality criterion, and a learning algorithm is characterized in terms of the structure of its search space, its search strategy, and the search heuristics. The structure of the search space is characterized by a \\"theta-subsumption lattice\\", which gives the structure of the search space of program clauses, and which can be searched blindly or heuristically. Theta-subsumption provides the basis for a \\"bottom-up\\" ILP technique, namely that of the building of least general generalizations from training examples relative to background knowledge, and a \\"top-down\\" technique of the searching of refinement graphs. These techniques and the technique of inverse resolution are discussed in detail by the authors. The idea of inverse resolution will seem natural to the reader familiar with the related (but inverted) procedure in deductive (propositional) logic. Inverse resolution inverts the SLD-resolution proof procedure for definite programs.Most of the book is devoted to an overview of the FOIL system and how it can be implemented to do practical inductive logic programming. The search routines used by FOIL are hill-climbing strategies, and the authors discuss ways that have been used to improve on these. Since this book was written, an ILP system called SFOIL has appeared that takes advantage of the view of induction of hypotheses as an optimization problem. Interestingly, SFOIL uses a generalization of simulated annealing to do this, based on Markovian neural networks. The authors also review the GOLEM ILP programming language, which is based on the notion of relative least general generalization, again a bottom-up search of the theta-subsumption lattice. Other ILP languages, such as MOBAL and MPL are also reviewed. In addition, the LINUS IPL system is reviewed, which exploits background knowledge in learning both propositional and relational descriptions. Deduction plays a major role in the LINUS system, as well as the transformation of relational descriptions to a propositional learning task. Both the FOIL and the LINUS systems are characterized with respect to refinement operators and refinement graphs, which allows a comparison of the expressiveness of their hypothesis languages and the search costs associated with these systems.The authors also discuss how to handle imperfect data in ILP, and show the role of heuristics in doing this. Random errors in training examples and background knowledge, sparse training examples, inexact description of target concepts, and missing values in training examples all need to be dealt with when using ILP, and various techniques are oultined by the authors to do this. Several interesting applications of ILP are given in the book, including medical diagnostics, finite element methods, qualitative modeling of dynamical systems, and predicting protein secondary structure. The role of ILP in bioinformatics has taken on more importance in recent years, and this trend will no doubt continue."},{"Title":"Inductive Logic Programming: Techniques and Applications (Ellis Horwood Series in Artificial Intelligence)","review":"Interest in inductive logic programming has waxed and waned over the last decade, but never fallen to zero.

The ads say you are saving $180.00, but it's not the same product. The cheap version has a cheap glued binding and no dustjackets. These books are too thick and heavy to be bound that way. With mine, the picture pages in the center just cracked loose and fell out. A 200-page novel that will be read once can have any kind of binding, but heavy reference books that will be used repeatedly are a different story. What looks like a super deal on eBay or Amazon Market is likely to be the cheapo version.Earlier printings are available used for about the same price, with dust jackets and some of them (not all) have a far-superior sewn binding. It's nice not to worry about pages coming loose, and to have a book that lays open flat. The ISBN does not tell you what you are getting. For example, the May 1993 reprint of Vol 4 has a sewn binding, but the otherwise identical November 1988 printing does not. Maybe there were complaints about the earlier printing coming apart, I have no idea. I don't know whether the set Amazon sells for $176.40 has a sewn or glued binding; my advice is to call Eerdmans and find out before buying. The text is always identical, as long as it's the \\"Fully Revised\\" version; I believe the last volume, Vol 4, was first issued in its fully revised version in 1988, the other volumes earlier than that.

Obesity has particular concern, because of the health risk associated with it, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, pulmonary and renal problems, surgical risks and degenerative joint disease. All in all obesity causes significant morbidity and also a decreased life-expectancy.Obesity is a major public health problem and recent data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in United States suggest that 22 % of children and adolescents are overweight and 11 % obese. Concerning overweight among the general population the survey revealed that between 1987 to 1993 the overweight prevalence increased 3.3 % for men and 3.6 % for women. The total overweight prevalence among American male is now 33 % and for females 36 %.This is an impressive book on a subject that is \\"close to our stomach\\". It is devided into six parts: Epidemiology, diagnosis, appetite regulation and obesity prevention, pathogenesis and types of obesity, complications and management with a total of 35 chapter written by 63 international experts from numorous professions. The editor is professor at the University of Gottenburg in Sweden with an interesting review chapter on the centralization of body far, besides from his imortant role as editor.The layout is good, the chapters easy to read and the editor did an excellent work in order to give an up-to-date review of this field with perspectives for further research and interventions. We very much liked the idea of including e-mail addresses in the list of authors for further personal communication with each author. We would like to see separate chapters on obesity in children and adolescents, in persons with intellectual disability and in persons with Down syndrome in the next edition.This book will become a resource book for professionals working in the area of clinical, research and academic work in the field of obesity. ..."},{"Title":"Tigers (Portraits of the Animal World)","review":"This is one of the best tiger books I've ever read. It has great facts, terrifically beautiful photographs, and many cool images in the photos, such as tigers fighting, pouncing, mating, and roaring so loud everyone and everything can hear them. Lee Server, the one who made this book, is an expert on tigers as well as lions, and if you want to learn about one or both of these animals, then you need to buy one of his books fast. Oh, and you will also be surprised at just how good a job was done on this thriller of a book, and anyone who likes nature or carnivores will enjoy it. I recommend it to all who like to read, as a matter of fact. It's near perfect and near mint.

This time when I came home for the holidays I decided I was going to read it, and once I really started, I could not put it down. I enjpyed the story line very much. I felt as if I was right there in the story with her. I only wish that it didn't seem to rush the ending. It left me wanting a sequel.

I actually didn't want to like this book, but as I read it, I just couldn't help myself. It was both enjoyable and interesting. As a teenager Damaris escapes an abusive alcoholic father and travels west with a wagon train. After an exhausting trip, she finally is able to settle in a small town. She finds several part time jobs and even a couple of good friends.After she establishes a routine in her new life, the romance aspect of the novel is introduced. I found it to be a bit boring and predictable, but I don't think that the romance is supposed to be the main focus. I think Damaris' struggle to overcome her abusive past is the main focus, with the Bible playing a pivotal role in both the novel and Damaris' struggle to overcome. Towards the end of the novel, the story manages to focus on Christ and forgiveness without being, for the most part, too preachy. Overall, this novel is a quick, easy read which won't disappoint readers fond of this genre."},{"Title":"A Woman Named Damaris (Women of the West #4)","review":"a women named Damaris is a wonderfull book one of the best I have every read. full of god love and romace and show's how god helped her through hard times. it's a graet book that show's a true realaship with the hevanly father.

She grew up in a home with an alcoholic and abusive father. She finally decides to run away. Damaris joins a wagon train heading west. When she finally reaches the end of the journey, she finds herself working for three people, all who are good to her. She boards with one of them, but she finds a true friend in Miss Dover, another of her employers, who helps her find what she has been searching for : her name in the Bible. With the search for her name, she finds something more, something that Damaris desperately needs : a relationship with God. Her faith helps her through many challenges, including her adoption of three orphan children. One of the things I love about this book is the connection to the Prairie Legacy series. (*Note* look at the name Lewis to find the connection!) Janette Oke fans will love this book. Even if you've never read them, you'll still love it!

As I read I realized how thin the sheet between this world and the spiritual world truly is. I'd always had faith in God but until this book never realized how protected we are, how powerful prayer is and how essential it is for the survival of all angels which protect us. I'd always felt alone in my struggles even though I always prayed. Now I know I was never alone. That we all have angels to watch over us. That they will never leave or forsake us any more than the Lord himslef would ever do. Peretti teaches us all that awareness and knowledge are power. Power to fight and overcome any obstacle through faith and prayer. Since reading this book my friend has gone home to Heaven. He changed my life by sharing the &quot;power of prayer&quot; with me.

Christians know the value of prayer but this book will only enhance that in your mind. Great reading....."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There is no doubt that this book contains a degree of excitement, especially if one reads it as primarily a book about the &quot;spiritual warfare&quot; of angels and demons, of praying Christians and the forces of evil in the guise of New Agers. But (and this is a big BUT) the book is largely negative and paranoid to the MAX. One has to first buy into the questionable idea that there is such a thing as a &quot;New Age&quot; consipracy to take over a town, a college, a corporation....the WORLD! (Yeah, right.) Then one has to buy into the idea that folks interested in this deviant form of spirituality are not only misguided and mislead but thoroughly evil as well. (Has anyone out there met any &quot;evil&quot; practitioners of Buddhist meditation?) In addition, the good characters are all too good, lacking real-life human frailties. The bad guys are all too bad, evil and rotten to the core despite their New Age spirituality. In short, this novel may capture one's attention because of its action, may merit praise in its emphasis on the merits of Christian prayer, BUT it is FATALLY FLAWED because of its incessant and UNREALISTIC PARANOIA. This is fiction, but not of a noteworthy or enduring sort. It is more akin to writing intended to undergird a predetermined ideological portrait of the world rather than a serious work that explores perennial questions of human existence. It is the fundamentalist Christian version of pulp fiction. And thank the God of the universe that there are serious Christian alternatives to fundamentalist pulp fiction."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"from the minute i picked this book up i didnt put it down, be prepared to spend the day in this novel -"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is amazing.

It seems as if the novel represents something Stephen King might write if he were a fundamentalist Christian, which might explain why I kept comparing it to THE STAND as I read it. While I quite enjoyed reading this book (it was difficult to put it down!), I think that \\"Satan\\" and \\"demons\\" would more likely influence humanity as portrayed in CS Lewis' THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS. That is to say, that the free will of humans would be more emphasized and that demons would tempt people more than possess them. I also found myself recalling Christ's words to \\"lover thy enemies\\" and wondering how this fit in with the angels slashing demons to shreds with swords. If the angels cannot love their enemies, how can we mere mortals hope to? While these criticisms may give the impression I don't like the story, I do.

I realize that some critics will want to debate the theology involved but that is quite ludicrous and pointless. It is difficult to find a 100% consensus in ANY church wherein everyone agrees with everyone else and the pastor theologically. What is most important is that Christians are in agreement about who, what Christ IS. This book is fiction obviously ...but biblically based and an extremely good read. No ...it is a GREAT read. In fact ...I'm going to read it again. But first I'll have to buy it again. I wanted everyone to read it so I loaned mine to several people. Well ...you know how that goes ...I haven't seen it since it was last loaned out. But the main thing is that I also purchased the audio narration which is very very well done by Mr Perreti himself ...some sound effects ...only his voice but again ...very well done. I have to give this one 5 stars ...if I could give it more than 5 out of 5 I would.If you haven't read it ...and are on the fence then I said JUST DO IT~~~~You'll be soooo glad that you did.I highly highly recommend it.Other recommendations for books dealing with spiritual warfare:You've ALSO just GOT to read his other book \\"This Present Darkness\\"This Present DarknessThe following book \\"GIFTED HANDS\\" is also a good read (not great but GOOD). The main thing is that it is a very inspiring story. I gave this book to my son on his birthday and told him that I also got him the DVD but he had to read the book first before he could watch the movie. My son (19 at the time NEVER reads) but he read this book cover to cover in one evening, said he enjoyed it a lot and was ready to watch the movie.Gifted Hands, Kids Edition: The Ben Carson Story (ZonderKidz Biography)Unfortunately there are very very few books out like Frank Perettis.It was largely because of \\"PIERCING THE DARKNESS and \\"THIS PRESENT DARKNESS\\" that I bought the book below, GUARDIAN ANGEL: 15 Year Old Sex Slave thinking that it might be of a similar type. I guess I ignored the fact that they say THIS book is NOT fiction but rather a true story as told by the author who was involved. So I didn't get all the behind the scenes angels and demons dialogues and struggles ...but yet I could see that there was a LOT going on behind the scenes in the battle for this young girls body and soul. This author, John Pryor is no Frank Peretti but ...I don't think he tries to be ...the story is so powerful that he doesn't need to be.Guardian Angel: True Story of 15 Year old Sex Slave Freed by an AngelAnother book that I'm going to recommend is \\"PREPARE FOR WAR\\" by Rebecca Brown MD. Now THIS was the very first book that I read which dealt with angels, demons, etc. It was pretty compelling too. The difference is that whereas Frank Peretti wrote fiction and ever pretended it was anything more and John Pryor wrote a true story and never tried to make it out to be anything more ...I suspect that Rebecca Brown is somewhere in the middle ...yet purports this entire story to be \\"TRUE\\". Now THAT ...is a stretch. Perhaps she took literary and creative license a bit too far in order to enhance the story. Many author's will do that ...but as a reader I demand honesty. If it's \\"based\\" upon a true story but largely fiction just SAY SO! If it IS a true story but you had to embellish or create a bit to make it a bit more readable and fill in the gaps then SAY SO! (At least Mr Pryor sticks to his mission in saying he would NOT embellish or create but just \\"tell the story\\" ...and he does it well and with style.) Having said that ...and making this comparison ...I will say that Prepare for War is a good read and it WILL make you think differently about spiritual things. ..But I treated it largely like spiritual fiction rather than a \\"true story\\".Prepare For WarI'm still waiting for one of both of Mr Peretti's books to be made into a major motion picture."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I could not put this book down once I started it. I enjoyed the mix of spirituality and religion with a dash of fiction and lots of suspense. I could see the angels and demons fighting in the supernatural realm for the souls of us poor mortals. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I felt like a veil had been lifted from my eyes while reading this.

Wow!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First heard of this book and how it changed people's ways of thinking on how the spiritual realm worked. Since it came from the '80's, I was hesitant. Checked it out anyway, and I was thinking one thing, since people couldn't take gritty Christian writing before Ted Dekker came about: how was this not controversial in its day? It probably was and I don't know about it.A mystery starts when a journalist takes a photo of something she should not have seen. That no one should have seen. With that one photo, two people are on a race against time to uncover what turns out to be an immense conspiracy to bring down Christianity and raise New Age in triumph. However, I was completely taken off-guard with how gritty the book was: a demon-possesed kid coming into church and starts spewing cusswords at a preacher's wife; said preacher finds degrading graffiti all over the front of his house; angels getting beaten up savagely by demons; a man with a past of heavy drugs; women claiming to be raped; demonic rituals and demons listening with anti-human glee; and more. This contrasted with some rather light humor was also surprising, as well as inspiring, and it got me thinkign about how closely the spiritual realm is connected to ours. I kept wondering how Frank could have conceived such a grand-scale conspiracy story from one little incident, yet I couldn't stop reading it all the way through and enjoying it all."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm only about half way through the book, but I'm enjoying it so far.There are definitely elements of \\"Christian cheese\\" that make me roll my eyes (i.e. demons are camping out in the University - brainwashing young minds!) BUT I have really appreciated the reminder that there is a spiritual war going on out there. My prayer life has been strengthened and that makes the cheesy parts worth it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book literally comes to life in the mind of the reader. The words come to life and you find yourself a part of the story. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll Praise His Almighty Name!!! There aren't enough words to impress upon you how much I encourage you to read this book and also &quot;Piercing The Darkness&quot; which is very much like this one including the same powerful Spiritual Warfare Angels such as Tal. Mr. Peretti's other books are fine but not on the level of enthusiasm as these two. HEY MR.

The description really helps one visualize the struggle. Whether this is how it is or not, spiritual warfare is real, I've seen it and fought it. Ephesians 6:12 is how it is. Since the battle has been won, it's simply a matter of choosing sides."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a great book to learn about the evil forces at wotk in the world. The story highlights how we must be aware of evil all the time."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With THIS PRESENT DARKNESS, Frank Peretti broke onto the scene by graphically tearing back the veil between our world and the spirit world. Descending upon the small town of Ashton, angels, demons, and strongmen engage in vivid spiritual battle and we, the reader, are able to see it all unfold. Ever wonder what exactly a guardian angel might do? Here's one possible scenario.While Peretti's theology on the subject may not be perfect (many of his ideas are pure speculation, but that's why it's &quot;fiction&quot;), he does most definitely give us a bold reason as to why prayer is so vital. Why prayer does, in fact, move mountains and can turn the tide in unseen spiritual battles that are taking place around us (as happens in the book of Daniel). For that reason alone, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS is worth reading.To be fair, this is not Peretti's best written book. THE OATH and THE VISITATION are both more sound, from a literary perspective (real character development, for example, isn't the best here). But before the LEFT BEHIND series, no other Christian novels were as widely read as this and its sequel. It is a true Christian fiction classic and a real page-turner that will have you burning the midnight oil. FOUR 1/2 STARS."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In the last 40+ years I have only read 3 books more than once. This is one of them and I have read it 3 times. There were a few years in between each read, but every time, I enjoy it as much as the first. If you ever question \\"Are there really angels on our side, is there a God, how does Satan and his demons get to us, are our bad habits encouraged by Satan, etc\\" this book will answer those questions and give you a mental picture of what they look like and what they are doing. Written as a story, it is captivating and awe inspiring. I'm a believer so I didn't need this book to convince me of anything, but, it left me with a feeling that angels really do stay right by my side and they and God are fighting for me every minute to help me stay away from the wrong path and keep me alive and well. The angels are the warriors fighting the Enemy every step of the way and your prayers give them strength. Keep praying and read this book. Or like me...read it more than once!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a wonderful book! Frank Peretti writes in a style that is engaging and suspensful. He weaves together a plot involving both a human struggle of philosophical and political agendas, and the spiritual battle occuring at the same time between the spiritual forces of good (Angels) and evil (Demons).It is this weaving of the plot between everyday issues and spiritual long term agendas that is the most compelling reason to read this book. The spiritual battles come to life in such a vivid way, that you may never view your life in the same way again! The images of how the spiritual battles are waged between God's Angels and the principalities of darkness, and how people are used for purposes beyond thier personal agendas, are presented in a manner which turns the perception of current events into something perhaps more than they appear to be.The book starts a bit slow, seemingly the day in the life of a small town, but once the plotlines start coming together you won't be able to put it down. The main characters are developed well, and are presented as real people who could be our neighbors. It is fiction all the way, so don't expect an academic thesis on the supernatural and Biblical themes of spiritual realms, simply enjoy the story and the message.I have given copies of this book to dozens of people and have not had anyone, Christian or Athiest, not enjoy the story. I highly recommend this book, as well as it's sequel: \\"Piercing The Darkness\\"."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Have you ever known that you are supposed to do something, but you can't seem to motivate yourself? Have you felt like the whole world is against you? Have you ever felt like what you were doing just wasn't what you wanted? If you answered yes, then you should definitely give &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; a try. This book gives a possible reason as to why we have these feelings.Frank Peretti gives us a tale of a small college town that has a war going on in it. It's not a war with guns and bombs, but a spiritual war. There are demons all over the town, making people turn away from God. The demons plan to take the entire town and rid the town of the angels that have come to help. It is a wonderful tale of good versus evil. It is very gripping and as my title tells, &quot;Frighteningly realistic&quot;. I'm sure everyone has felt like they should be doing something, but there is something that is holding you back. This book gives a very unique idea as to why that happens. Read it and you might look at things a little differently. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book (And it's follow up) more than once when I was an older teenager. It is written very well and I am about to purchase it for my kindle so that my eldest son can read it, after I do another reading of it myself. Yes, I want to read it again myself!If you like Christian fnatasy that also has a strong basis for teaching you that sacraficing for God is not actually...a sacrafice..it's freedom, you'll find this book right up your alley! Just as Jesus died on the cross (Sacraficed himself), so does this book put readers in the shoes of intense characters and tramatic experiences where they lay it all down for what they believe in. Some lay it down for God, some lay it down for other things.Make no mistakes, these characters are not all goody two shoes. They learn their lessons the hard way..just as we do. It can be a rough ride doing what you believe, stepping up your faith, and willing to give it all for God. This book does not hold back the mortal costs, but neither does it leave out the immortal gains (and losses) for these costs. This book brings you right into the horror of what many don't even realize is out there. Not only evil as defined by the word 'Satan and devil', but the evils humanity itself can and will do."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I enjoyed the book but as a Christian who cares about the bible, I was shocked by the theology of this book. It has almost nothing to do with the bible, yet people seem to take it seriously.I strongly caution Christians (espcially new ones) when reading this book. I also encourage non-Christians to lean what real theologians believe"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Very entertaining writing. Very bad source for determining a biblical understanding of spiritual warfare. Case in point, the role of the Holy Spirit is non-existant in the book and yet without the Holy Spirit in our lives we have no &quot;teacher, comforter, counsellor or guide&quot;. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are absent as well, which requires the ability of the believer or assistance of ministering spirits to accomplish God's work. Stick to scripture for proper understanding of how God works and the Christian response to Him"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Interesting that people are saying his characters are &quot;predictable.&quot; A sure sign of bad writing is &quot;unpredictable&quot; characters, which means, more likely than not, a weak plot and underdevelopment. I don't understand why people didn't just stop reading the book if it was below their literary caliber. What literary caliber that is I don't know, as the plot progressed so well and smoothly, with perspectives from so many different characters, not once losing the reader, that I'd call that some first-class writing. What I love about this book was the way it held me in suspense until I finished it all! You know it'll be a happy ending, but how that will come about keeps you riveted. Undoubtedly, it's dangerous to take the book as a Biblical parallel. It's a fictional work and uses convenient Biblical truths for illustration. But insightful-reminded me of the Screwtape Letters"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This work of fiction by Frank Peretti draws a picture of the underlying spiritual powers at war in this world. He draws his inspiration from the Biblical passage Ephesians 6:12, \\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.\\" The general plot line focuses on two main characters, a pastor and a newspaperman, who live in the small town of Ashton, where corruption and deception are threatening to creep in and turn the people to new-age occultism. The plot gripped my attention, and the characters were well developed. Clever twists in the story also kept me reading.Further, the book is a good encouragement to prayer, an often underutilized aspect of Christian life. The colorful portrayals of angels and demons is primarily speculation, but mostly harmless. I would recommend reading \\"This Present Darkness,\\" but one should make sure to keep the Biblical perspective on angels and demons in focus."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I think Peretti is the Stephen King of religious suspense fiction. This is one of his best, perhaps THE best. Very, very gripping and memorable. I would recommend it to adults but especially to teens as well. This story really shows the power of God.

It might be a good thing if this book creeps you out. Peretti provides an AMAZING look at the spiritual warfare that goes on all around us, every day. It's only by pretending this warfare doesn't exist that we get chumped out by the enemy. Reading this book is like drawing back a curtain; afterward, you probably won't see the random, mundane events of your own life in the same way again. Peretti's storytelling is captivating and rich -- as well as true to life. I've bought other books of his since reading this one, and I look forward into digging into the sequel."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"GREAT BOOK WOULD RECOMEND ANYONE TO READ IT.

A local pastor and a newly arrived, and troubled, newspaper editor slowly become aware of some evil forces working to take over a small college town.

For example, I often wondered what was meant by the angel speaking of the Prince of Persia resisting him for 21 days in the book of Daniel 10:13.

I think Hollywood could take some valuable lessons from the Bible, and this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I found this book hard to put down. The concept of spritual warfare is a difficult one for most of us, and this work provides a unique perspective, a story about 'real-life' in middle-America, and how Satan works to destroy all things good. I found it a real encouragement to my prayer life. A must read!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Hi,I've only read the first 20 reviews or so so I don't know if this angle has been presented yet, but here it is.Obviously, this is a wonderful decpiction of Spiritual Warfare! As a matter of fact I like this book better than the Left Behind books I'm still slogging through. (exactly how many are there?)The other angle I'd like to present is of gangstalking. The methods used by the demonic forces and their human adherents to run people out of town, destroy reputations and eventually kill people who aren't on board with them are very typical of gangstalking or multistalking.This form of harassment goes on at all levels of our society to dispose of people certain groups do not want around...pay special attention as to how the people who worship the demons use the leaders of the town to accomplish their objectives! Cops, judges, banks, and local businesses are brought on board and bought and sold to be of use to the sinister cabal. This is happening in real life, folks!The intimidation and terrorization tactics used by the human side of this group are very very typical of what a targetted individual of gangstalking goes through. The stalkers attack the targets career, then they attack their reputation, then they turn their friends on them, then the family, and finally they will destroy the target if nothing else works.I believe the real life counterparts to the terrorists of Ashton are satanists as well who are using this form of stalking as a means to an end to destroy the remnant of faithful people here on this Earth since the hour is late and the Antichrist is coming back.I do not know if Mr. Peretti knew about this sinister stalking when he wrote the book but his familiarity with their methods is beyond what any coincedence could muster. I have yet to read the sequel but I hope it continues to expose the tactics of the harassers.It is heartening to see the number of young readers as well! If they can see how gangs of greedy people come together to destroy anyone in their way maybe they will not be so unsympathetic and frightened when presented with it in real life. Maybe we will finally find some allies in the gangstalking community that aren't targets themselves!There is another book that is coming out just now about gangstalking. It's \\"1996\\" by Gloria Naylor. This woman had a spat with a bigoted neighbor who had govt contacts and she is still targetted to this day 9 years later! It is available from her publisher.This Present Darkeness is the real stuff! The only problem I have is with the rather childish depiction of the demonic forces...I think that the dark forces are our \\"worthy opponents\\" and some of these demons seem cartoonish in nature. The best part of the book is the simultaneous effects in the heavenlies to the prayers of the saints and the sinners. It was a great encouragement to see that a little prayer can effect much more than we'll ever know. God Bless."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Frank Peretti's work is a good example of what we Christians accuse the New Age movement of being. It is a book that is mostly derived from experience and not Scripture. Most of the spiritual warfare themes are those that were developed by well meaning Christians who had had experiences, and do not necessarily reflect the teachings of the Bible. Frank has gone out of his way to defend himself by saying that he meant the stories to be symbolic, but one cannot help but wonder if this was true when Frank wrote the story. The whole idea that angels actually gain some sort of empowerment from our prayers is pure theological hogwash. The idea that we need to pray and pray and pray and pray and pray or the angels will lose their power and the devil will get us is spiritually unhealthy at best, and almost downright demonic itself at its worst. Satan would love for Christians to become fixated on the devil and occultism, believe that they need to pray every second or the devil will get em, and see a demon under every rock. It is the classic strategy that says &quot;If you can't get them to go off the path on one side, push them until they go off the path on the other&quot;. This is not the best Christian book ever written. It might be good if you are practicing the occult, and need to have a fire lit under your tush, but basically it is an unbalanced pseudo-christian story that is full of culturally acceptable christendom, but perhaps not much true Christianity."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book was incredible. It really puts things in perspective. So often we lose sight of the little things in life that can lead us astray. This book helps to remind us all of how we should act and how others should preceive us as Christians. Thank you for selling this book and at a reasonable price. I borrowed this book from my boyfriends mother and had to buy a copy for myself to share with others. I hope many more people will find this book as inspiring as I did."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"i swear, when i read the whole Left Behind series, i thought that was good. but then i read this, & it totally blows my mind away! i love angels, & the way that they are described in this book is so awesome. i mean, when they draw their swords, it makes music. & when they fly it makes streaks of bright white light. & they're tall & handsome. & they wear white tunics with golden sandals. i just have a very beautiful picture in my head. i can only imagine what they are like in person, expecially what God & Jesus look like. i will probly break down & cry because they are just so beautiful! but, newayz, lol, this book is awesome. you should read it. it gets off to a slow start at first, but then you REALLY get into it. it's a must read!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After I read this book, I met several people who were very enthusiastic about it. They absolutely loved it! All exclaimed that this was a fabulous portrayal of spiritual warfare and the power of prayer. It was a great insight into the unseen conflict between the agents of God (angels and &quot;prayer warriors&quot;) and between Satan and his minions. Having read the book, I could certainly agree that it portrayed spiritual warfare and the struggle between the angelic and the demonic. However, when I asked these readers about the overarching theme of the New Age Conspiracy which defines the book, they were at a loss. These readers loved the action, the positive portrayal of the power of prayer and the triumph of the good; however, they missed the supposed great evil that motivated the wicked characters portrayed in the book. They missed the fact that all of this was written as a warning cry against something that has come to be known as the New Age movement. I see that many reviewers of this book in other places have also lost sight of this fact. Peretti's book is without doubt an action-filled account of the battle between spirtual good and evil. However, what is the nature of the evil portrayed? The evil lies in a deviant spirituality that uses meditation, that uses the guise of psychological methods, that is influenced by Eastern religious ideas and practices, etc. This is the evil. Really? The angels of God have come to this small town to fight against the insidious influence of some akin to Yoga, deep breathing exercises conducted to the chanting of Hindu mantras, and Tai Chi? This dubious battle gives the book an overwhelming feeling of unreality. The bad guys in this book--- the city officials, the &quot;liberal&quot; minister, the Psychology professor--- are unrealistically evil. One may claim that the meditative practices that flow from Hinduism and Buddhism and theologically in error and should not be followed by Christians. But to portray them as evil, as demonic? Do many people really believe such things? Or are pettiness, intolerance, and ignorance of the wider world suddenly now positive traits for Christians? One larger point to the success of this book is how little fundamentalist and conservative evangelical Protestant Americans know and want to know about the larger Christian world."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is not only one of the best Christian books ever, it is one of the best novels, Christian or secular that I ever read. It gives insight into the power of prayer and spiritual warfare. Peretti has carefully crafted this message into his story-line and colorful cast of characters. I found this novel as well as it's sequel \\"Piercing the Darkness\\" so captivating that I tore through each one in a matter of hours! This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who likes suspenseful novels. Although this novel is complete by itself, I highly recommend it together with the sequel."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I think that Mr. Peretti has hit the nail on the head with all his books. that we are truely in spiritual battle at all times . Things are not allways what they seem with the natural eye. I would recomend this book to everyone to read or lisen to like I do.. LeiLani"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have wanted an unabridged version of This Present Darkness on cassette for years and I finally got one. However, I tried to listen to it on vacation and I found I could only listen for maybe an hour at a time and then I would have to take a break to keep from getting sleepy. For a long drive the radio dramas for The Left Behind Series or any of the Focus On the Family Radio dramas would have served the higher purpose of keeping me from highway hypnosis. For shorter trips these tapes would have been fine and after the narrator settles in, he did some great voices. Peretti threw in some great lines that made me laugh both when I have read the book and when I listened to the tapes."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Christian Fiction was not a major niche prior to 1987, when Peretti released this novel. Because of this novel, that has changed. This book opened the eyes of many to the potential of Christian fiction, with non-fiction authors like Chuck Colson, Dave Hunt, Bob Larson, Paul Meyer, the late Larry Burkett, and the very successful Tim LaHaye entering the fray.The premise of the book is to show the spiritual warfare that influences what happens on earth. The main characters are Pastor Bush and newsman Marshall Hogan. It follows their battles in keeping a new age group from taking over the town.People have said Peretti is a cross between Steven King and C. S. Lewis. He does a good job of making his points on the importance and role of prayer, as well as what goes on behind the scenes. He also entertains while doing it. Some may debate his theology, but his skill as a storyteller is undebatable."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With this book, Peretti has shown himself to be one of the very few authors able to write a satisfying Christian thriller. Breaking into the fascinating realm of the supernatural, Peretti gives us a breathless view of the daily war waged between angels and demons.Where this novel fails is in its stereotypical view of angels and demons. While most Christians believe demons are fallen angels who have teamed up with Satan, Peretti makes the angels seem almost human while the demons seem more like dark, dirty renditions of the slimy green ghost in the hotel in &quot;GhostBusters&quot;. And the demons seem woefully inferior to the angels.Still, those moments are few, and Peretti's deft writing (which does get a little bogged down in the middle) keeps the action moving and doesn't allow such low-points to have much affect on the flow of the story. Highly recommended if for no other reason than as a prelude for the second book which is even better."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book really makes you ask yourself what is going on around you that you cannot see. It presents spiritual warfare as being so real that you almost think that you should be able to see the hideous bat-like creatures known as demons or the majestic, handsome angels. It is so vivid that you almost think that you should be smelling the thick stench of sulfur or even seeing a cloud of sufurous smoke. In my opinion, this book presents probably the most realistic sounding representation of spiritual warfare you could get. It is impossible to know for sure, but this book makes a very reasonable guess at the unknown.This book, as well as its sequel, \\"Piercing the Darkness\\", are extremely well written. They are intriguing and quickly pull you into the plot. They move along at a fast pace, but you can easily keep up with what is happening. Again, they are very realistic, so you don't find yourself scoffing at how ridiculous it sounds.This book is great as a stand-alone book, but it is made even better by its follow-up book, \\"Piercing the Darkness\\". I was not aware they they went together, and ended up reading them out of order, but even then they wee both great. Even so, they probably would have been a little better if I had have read \\"This Present Darkness\\" first.Overall, I highly recommend this book, as well as \\"Piercing the Darkness\\". They are both definite \\"page-turners\\" and well worth reading.These are the only two Peretti books with this style of describing spiritual warfare, but Peretti's other books are good also. For more good Peretti reading, I also recommend \\"The Oath\\" and \\"The Visitation\\". Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness is a Christian thriller. The story is about the town of Ashton, which is being taken over by a strange New Age cult. Pastor Hank Busche and newspaper reporter Marshall Hogan are trying to figure out the mystery, which grows in horror with every new discovery. Waiting in the wings are angels and demons, praying and working for their side to win the souls of Ashton and much more.This book scared the crap out of me. Some moments in the book made me whimper and scream out loud. Peretti is a terrific writer. I just hung on every page."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Of the Christian novels I have read, this is easily the best. The followup, &quot;Piercing the Darkness,&quot; is a disappointing sequel, and the famous &quot;Left Behind&quot; series left me cold before I had finished the first installment, being sadly predictable and written in such a superficial style that it seemed to have been solely aimed at a junior high school reading level. Peretti's style, however, is more advanced and draws in the more experienced readers among us as well as those younger.We humans are bound by our five physical senses. Beyond that, we have little idea what may be happening among the principalities and powers of the air. Scripture gives us a few glimpses, and long religious tradition has fleshed out some ideas, of what is going on between the powers of darkness and the powers of light. In this novel Peretti does a credible and intriguing job of putting names and personalities to the various characters and forces involved in the spiritual warfare around us and within us, and the story ultimately is unforgettable.My only quibbles with this excellent work are that the answers to these issues are a little too pat, the solutions to the problems a bit too neat. I am fully willing to admit that this may be my own lack of spiritual perception regarding the invisible realm, but it just smacks sometimes of being a bit too easy and convenient, as if the book too often allows its built-in deus ex machina to intrude on the action. Still, the book is well worth four stars and worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I realize it's fiction. But I think Peretti, through his writing, is giving us a great deal of insight into the spirit world. His angels. His demons. His humans!It's important to me that there's more to gain here than just a good read. If entertainment is all there is to it, there are thousands of well writen secular novels already. But Peretti's novel is edifying and affirming to me as a Christian, a Christian that believes there's more out there than just the sweet by-and-by.The Bible itself shows us that angels are among us. And Peretti shows us how and what they're doing."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness by Frank E. Peretti is about a small town called Ashton being taken over by unseen evil powers. Marshall Hogan, a main character runs the newspaper, The Clarion. He and his reporter, Bernice Krueger get themselves in a bigger mess than they anticipated. Along the way Hogan finds himself losing his daughter, Sandy and his wife, Kate. Bernice also takes her beatings, working late nights and weekends. Both of them trying to figure out what is going on in their town. Hank Busche is the local pastor and also is on their side trying to save people from evil spirits.On the other side working for Rafar, the evil Prince of Babylon, is Professor Langstrat, she teaches at the local college. Langstrat places control over young minds to do her will. Also, the local police chief along with many other big names in town are working for her. Half the town is battling against this evil presence while the other half is working with it making this a thriller.I thought it began slowly, and picked up the pace toward the end when the spiritual warfare began. The plot of good versus evil had great twists that I did not expect. The book was interesting and not as predictable as I thought it would be. It certainly opened up my eyes to the spiritual realm around me."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm very picky when it comes to what I like to read. I love spiritual warfare. Angels and humans vs. demons. This definitely fit the bill."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I know that it is 2012 and I am reviewing a book that was written in 1986 but this is a Christian \\"classic\\" that is worth mentioning to a new generation of people. I read this book years ago but and then decided recently to pick it up again and reread it. Since my memory is not great it was pretty much as if I was reading it for the first time. And boy was impressed! (Or re-impressed?)Summary:This Present Darkness by Frank Peretti is about the physical and spiritual conflict taking place in the little town of Ashton. In a physical sense, at least on the surface, it is a fairly normal town that has its normal problems. But then some weird things start to happen. A suicide, people leaving, weird new people coming, and so on. A pastor, newspaper editor, and newspaper reporter all get involved in trying to solve the mystery of what is going on. In the spiritual realm, the demons have a big plan to take over the town through a new-age cult and the angels must figure out a way to protect the Christians while also battling the demons from taking over the town.Impression of Book:My initial impression of this book is that it is well written book that explores an often unmentioned aspect of the Christian life: spiritual warfare. As other reviews of this book have mentioned, there are parts of the story that are speculation of how spiritual matters work so I would warn people against developing a theology of angels and demons based on this book. However, this is a fiction book and therefore should be considered just that... fiction. The main point of this book is to get people to pray, which is very Biblical.As for the story itself, I found it to be very engaging and entertaining. It was funny to read about a world pre-cell phone, mp3 player, computer, and email. But the \\"age\\" of the book did not distract from the story any more than a book set in the 19th century might. It was overall an excellent book. Peretti has a tendency to start slow and build to the action once the characters are more developed so the beginning is a little slow. But it quickly picks up and is well worth the read.What This Book Taught Me:The biggest thing that This Present Darkness taught me was the importance of prayer in the Christian life. I don't think prayer works quite like how the book makes it, but the overall importance (and often neglect of prayer) for Christians should not be missed. When I finished this book I found myself praying more and praying more earnestly.Conclusion:If you are a Christian I highly recommend this book. As I mentioned, the theology may not be 100% since some of the topics Peretti writes about is speculation, but that should not prevent a person from reading it. The main point of the book - to prayer - is illustrated through a powerful story and will no doubt challenge any reader. 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read this book multiple times. I love it. I cant wait to read the next one. As far as Im concerned it has been the best book i have read in my life. i love the way that Peretti describes th battle betweem angels and demons. it may not be an accurate account of actual spiritual warfare but i found that it was very creative. as one o those people who pray often i would like o think that my prayers are as benficial in spiritual warfare as they are to the angels in this book.As far as people being ridded o their demons and immidiately accepting o god i have seen this with my very eyes. thy are thankful and have hd their eyes opened to god. its nice to actually read something good now tht people are becoming unimaginitive and creating stories that just mimic others."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I loved this book. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. The loss of sleep was very well worth it. A very griping story that keeps you wanting to find out more. I would recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"At the outset, I'll tell you that I've become a Peretti fan. I've read The Visitation, The Oath, as well as the sequal to this book - Piercing The Darkness. In this book, as well as it's sequel, Peretti takes the reader in-and-out of both the seen and unseen worlds. I especially enjoy the way he weaves the real, but suttle, agendas of God-hating Leftists and &quot;I'm a god too!&quot; New Agers into his story.The reason I gave a rating of 4-stars instead of 5 is the fact that I found myself wanting to skip-over much of the unseen world content so that I could continue the story of the seen world. I realize that this defeats the purpose of Peretti's intent in having the reader experience both sides, however, I did find it aggrevating at times that so much space was given to the gropings and carryings-on of imps and demons. I would rather have only known that the demons were there behind the scenes, without all the intricate details. Another reader may see this differently, however.All in all though, this book is indeed worthy of your reading time."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Peretti's storytelling skills carry the day for this book, and it's a good thing because his writing skills are average. His characters are too predictable - what some people call &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;two dimensional&quot; - while the jargon and cliches that permeate the conversations grow old quickly. Overall, this was a fairly good novel, but not one that encourages a second reading."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Because this is one of Frank Peretti's first books the story is good, but very simple. I'd read this book years ago, but as i re-read (listened to audio) I realized that it is good but basic. Characters are not developed well, and must seemed to me they were in the story just to move it along. However, the book is entertaining and a good one to read when you have a block of time to become immersed in a book that you read just to be reading and relaxing.The strength of this story is that, while I am not sure whether is is strictly Biblical, we are reminded that we do not live in a world where all that is real can be seen. Peretti allows us to use our imagination while we get an idea of the spiritual battles that are taking place on behalf of the believer."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Peretti uses fiction to illustrate spiritual realities. He does so effectively in establishing his plot, characters, and setting. In the margin in one place in the book I wrote, &quot;What is taught has consequences.&quot; Truth liberates. This book shows how a lack of knowledge on spiritual matters can have adverse consequences.Prayer's power is demonstrated through the story line. He addresses the fallacy of what Hindus call &quot;karma,&quot; that a person can earn brownie points as opposed to the reality of accepting the Jesus and what He did.This book shows two worlds operating simultaneously. The physical world everyone sees is governed by the invisible spiritual world. Prayer taps into that unseen dimension for direct results in the material realm. By reading this book you see the interaction take place."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With it already being said: this book is a great door to realizing the spiritual battles that take place in our every day lives. I was disgusted to see the one bad review of this book. That person obviously has no grasp on the bible at all. If you believe that Wiccans and New Agers are not evil, well think again. That just goes to show you how fooled you really are. You're blinded by deceit so terribly that you can't even recognize the faults in your own beliefs. I am still in the process of reading this book and I must say that as much as it seems to be like fantasy, that fantasy is truly a reality. Take it or leave it this book shows us what's really going on in our lives every single day. If you have read this book and don't like it, I dare you to attempt at critizing this book with any truth of your own. How blind you are if you do not believe in the message this book is portraying. Read your bible!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The town of Ashton is where the main character, Hank Busch lives. The book is about the townspeople as well as Hank encountering all sorts of conflicts and struggles of life and dealing with them. Little do they know that everything they go through is all a part of the unseen awarness of the battle between good and evil.The book basically talks about the presence of spiritual warfare in our lives and how real it is. Although the book is quite lengthy reaching almost 400 pages, it is rather a quick read. I am sure that you will enjoy the thrill and suspense of the novel as well as the descriptiveness."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was given this book by someone who knew of my search for spiritual answers to the mysteries of the world in which I live. . . This book is awesome! ! ! It started me on a quest for identifying and utilizing God-given powers to make changes in situations that appear to be untenable. That's just what I got out of it. Buy the book - read it - then find your own truth. . . The book is a fun ride - from start to finish. . . I found myself caring about the characters, liking some, loving some, disliking others and having a personal preference for what needed to happen to others. Read the book - you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"THIS PRESENT DARKNESS is the story of something sinister in the town of Ashton, and two men who are concerned enough to find out more about it. This book is an account of what happens on two levels, the physical and the spiritual, the battles that take place in both realms, and the dependence each realm has on the other.Frank Peretti weaves an intricate web of characters, intrigue, and tension in this spiritual thriller. I was reminded of John Grisham's THE FIRM in terms of the numerous characters, the sheer number of problems and situations that arise, the insidious nature of the enemies, and the severe tension in this book. This book was packed with action, nevertheless information necessary to solve the ever-widening puzzle was doled out very slowly and only as necessary; there were many twists and turns of plot, and the spiritual aspect of the book was downright intriguing.Through all, Peretti manages to convey to the reader the vast importance of the spiritual realm beyond the scope of the book. Entertaining, yes. Eye-opening, even more so."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading the book and reading the other reviews, I found it quit commical that people take reading so seriously. Yes, it was trilling, Yes, it isn't writing on the same plane as Charles Dickens, and Yes, it falls short of conforming to exact biblical specifications that everyone thinks it should have. So what. The book was obviuosly written to entertain not to alter the state of the universe. So just relax,enjoy, and you'll make it through......and maybe even learn something."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There are very few books I read every year but this, Piercing the Darkness and Prophet by Peretti are some of them especially when I feel my prayer life is waning.

Get it now!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book really makes you think. It not only shows how dramatic and how real spiritual warfare is, it strongly shows the importance of prayer. I don't know for sure if that's really how it works with demons and angels, but I don't have any better ideas. I am a Christian and I encourage other Christians to read it as well because it has really changed my view of prayer for the better. Plus it's also just a really entertaining and thilling book.

This reporter moves from New York and buys a small paper. He starts learning and hearing about some strange stuff, and he just gets more and more involved and gets several threats and warnings to stay out and leave it alone. The plot unfolds and he gets deeper and deeper until he can't get out. As the plot unfolds, everyone realizes that their town is under extremely heavy Satanic attack! Marshal Hogan, the reporter, and Hank Busche, a pastor of a small church, get suited up for the biggest flesh and spiritual battle of their lives! I VERY HIGHLY recommend this book to any and EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was really great.

This Present Darkness is the Lord of the Rings for Christian fiction."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Frank Peretti keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat with his twist and turns of events.

I'm glad he's chosen such a difficult subject to write about because so few have. There are realms of life in co-existence with the 3-dimensional lives we know, and those realms have far greater impact on and importance to our 3 dimensions than most people realize. For a further, more authoritative explanation, 2 Kings 6 provides an excellent example of what I think Peretti is trying to illuminate. It's a sobering wake-up call to know that evil is real and has every human being on earth as its voracious agenda. It's a comforting concept and reality to know that God dispatches far more help than we ever ask for or imagine to empower us to be victorious over evil in all its forms with all its voices and masks."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"This Present Darkness\\" gives a vital \\"where the rubber meets the road\\" grip of the reality of spiritual warfare and the incredible power of prayer. A \\"must read\\" for pre-teens and teens getting slammed with the pressures to compromise moral standards and pressures to embrace the New Age philosophies. Not only does it expose the deceit of evil, but lays out an example of how it can be combated through prayer - yes, even at age 12!

The book is about the spiritual warfare that occurred in a small town when demons sought control of the town by influencing and inhabiting humans. The town's only chance of surviving was through the help of 2 newspaper employees, the prayers of a young pastor's small congregation, and the mighty warrior angels.I liked how Mr. Peretti illustrated the extreme good that can come from prayer. In the book, prayer strengthened many of the angels. I was also intrigued by the significant role that demons and angels play in this world. It had never occurred to me that demons have so much power and influence over the thoughts and actions of humans.

This Christian author went beyond the usual 'Christian writing guidelines' and actually grabbed my attention with a real story. Both stories and characters were believable and likable. He took a biblical subject, and shaped it into something we can understand. Although many would rate these books as cartoon-ish, I actually like the idea of spiritual forces fighting on my behalf. It also helps to look beyond the mean person to something greater, with it's talons dug upon his/her head. :)"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I didn't like the sound effects.

Reading it again twenty years later as an adult, I find I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did when I read it for the first time at age twelve. What I believed as a teenager and what I experienced as an adult, gave me two different perspectives about this book. Both times I've enjoyed it for various reasons: the action, suspense, battle scenes, three dimensional characters, detailed writing, an imaginative plot, and the underlying message of the power of prayer which I firmly believe in. Reading it for the second time, now as an open-minded Christian adult with a different way of thinking than when I was a teenager with preconceived ideas about the world, I find the author's views and opinions a little narrow-minded and prejudiced. As a reader I'm all for detailed world-building so as to really be able to engross myself in a book, but in This Present Darkness I often found the lengthy descriptions tedious and mind-numbing. I read this book in fits and starts and had to constantly put it down to read something else before picking it up again to continue where I had left off. Overall the idea behind the story is an inspirational and feel-good one and I really enjoyed the fictional part of the story. However, a lot of readers (including myself) might find the author's viewpoint outdated, stifling and biased, but as far as fiction and fantasy goes I genuinely think this was a worthwhile read.

The intrigue (obviously) is in having a window into the spirit realm. However, I had a problem with the angels having &quot;races&quot;. Correct me if I'm wrong, but angels are spirits, right?

It is the first book that I have read that dealt with spiritual warfare. I looked for references to this warfare in the Bible and found that there is a solid Biblical base for this story. Mr. Peretti takes the reality of spiritual warfare and comes up with a gripping story from it. It in an entertaining book and one that I always find hard to put down, even after all the times that I have reread it. Mr. Peretti is a very gifted writer. He makes the story so real that it is hard to NOT come up with the images from his work. I love this book immensely and have no problem recommending it to anyone. Even if they are not Christian or if they do not think that spiritual warfare is real. This one is a keeper for anyone's library."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Hypes Christianity with an overly-metaphorical 'spiritual' war that can only be resolved through intense prayer. Characters were stereotypical (the good priest; the 'ignores his family' working man; the 'young, good-looking' female reporter; etc.), and women earned their existence by being attractive, good wives, or witches. Treated all non-Christian religions (e.g., Muslim faith; anything new-age; etc.) as demonic. Writing was cliche-ish with overly dramatic swirls. I was hoping for a religious allegory or critique a la C.S. Lewis or James Morrow, but Peretti falls short."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have to hand it to Frank Peretti, he is a good storyteller, and the person reading this book will not be bored. Unfortunately, it is terrible theology, and the author is so paranoid and bitter toward New Agers and mainline Protestants, that this book deserves a place in hate literature alongside the &quot;Turner Diaries.&quot; I am afraid that some unstable person will read Peretti's books and firebomb a New Age bookstore. New Agers may be irrational and on the wrong path, but I cannot believe they are as &quot;demon possessed&quot; as Peretti thinks they are. It really scares me that so many reviewers here said they believe everything they read by Peretti."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is to literature what McDonald's is to haute cuisine; it goes a long way in showing how fundamentalists are blazing new paths in the 'dumbing-down' phenomena so prevalent in our culture. Was it written for 6th graders? Its cream-puff triteness and juvenile character development makes one wonder how it could have come from the same planet once graced by Sophocles and Dostoevsky. Even its theology is questionable. For Peretti, human evil seems not to be something inherent in human nature but rather a residual product of some cosmic spiritual struggle looming invisibly over everyone's heads. It amazes me how fundamentalists are so ignorant of the theological and cosmological implications of the biblical narratives they so militantly claim to be taken literally (e.g., the fall of man into sin.)"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First let me tell you that I would not even give this book a one star but it is required so I gave the lowest rating allowed. Each person is out looking for what will lead them to a better life. While looking over the book I found a message of hate and lack of tolerance. This book is a book written from the heart of one who seems to have the very termoil in his heart and wants to have the rest of the world pulled in. New Age religion is not so new, being as they clump Druids and Wiccans and the like into one group. When we go on the defensive then we teach hate which is not a value I wish to instill in my children. Each to their own and share what you like, listen if you will. But this is more of a fire and brimstone kind of approach and nothing I want anything to do with!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book shows a complete and utter ignorance of the spiritual realm. Worse still, it targets another religon, and makes it out to be evil, and the cause of all the said towns problems. Religious intolerance is the ONLY evil in this book! And I am so grateful to God that the spirit realm is none of the tripe, that this book purports. Nothing is more harmful than ignorance, except for the fear it creates. Surely the burning of innocent people at the stake, in the dark ages, by the church, should have taught us all, that religious ignorance, superstition and fear of the spiritual, only causes pain, suffering, religious wars and death! And then tell me where the real evil lies."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I enjoied the Christian Theme of this book but it was a waste of my time.

Of course, they had to buy their own or I bought it for them. My book doesn't leave my sight. :-) Please make a movie out of it. I'll be the first ticket buyer.

It does not get too preachy, which can turn off some readers, but it also reminds believers about the power of prayer. The book as a whole is amazing, with its tale of the ever-present battle of good vs. evil. It is the last 20 pages or so that really caught my breath. These last few pages are extremely powerful. I read this book for the first time a few years ago, and I can vividly recall reading the ending a thousand times, each time being captivated by Peretti's great story-telling techniques. A simply fabulous book. I recommend anyone and everyone to read this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Well, I absolutely loved this book, and its sequel, \\"Piercing the Darkness.\\" What can I say? If you want an accurate drawing of just what the driving force behind the New Age movement and all of its different practices are, this is the book for you. Peretti shows the link between this world and the other, illustrating just what goes on all around us, usually without our even realizing it! I would have to say that Peretti always spins a great tale with an excellent world view. \\"This Present Darkness\\" only proves my point. I couldn't put this book down until the end, and you won't want to either!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After a friend lent me this book, I stayed up til 4 AM finishing it while on spring break. After my parents reprimanded me, I gave my Mom the book and she stayed up til 5 AM trying to finish it. It really is an action-packed thriller. I found the story interesting, and thought the portrayal of spiritual warfare was a great theme.Unfortunately, on several points it seemed a bit too simplistic. I tend to shy away from &quot;evil conspiracy&quot; plots, and this definately had that, though it used the excuse of a demonic backing. I still don't buy it. Demons could conceivably be trying to mastermind world control, but I can't see them using a human organization to do it.While I wouldn't want to detract from the power of prayer, I don't think angels are fairies that get stronger if you clap your hands. I think it more likely that God sends the angels as the response to prayer. The doling out of energy by &quot;prayer cover&quot; seemed purely ficticious.I found the actual battles a let down. I know the good guys have to win, but they win almost way too easily. People casting out demons left and right...what happened to the ones who wouldn't come out in the name of Jesus that the disciples ran into? And these are supposed to be big bad demons? It almost made the bad guys look impotent, which I doubt was the point of the story. [Yes, I know good triumphs over evil. But, that doesn't mean evil capitulates instantly.]Probably the touchiest part was the portrayal of the evil characters. Of course the demons are evil; they are ugly and stink. But, the people are another matter. Basically, anyone who started getting involved in fortune telling, meditation, hypnosis, or lighting candles and wearing black got &quot;hooked&quot; by evil demons. (stereotypical involvement in the occult.) The personal responsibility was downplayed. These ills could be instantly cured through prayer and casting out demons. Now, I believe prayer can accomplish these things, but seldom as instantaneaously as is routine throughout the story. I found the portrayal a bit simplistic. Evil people have much more depth to them than is revealed in this book. I mean, people can be pretty corrupt w/o the help of demons, too. And, in spite of the meddling of demons, I think few real people are actually as corrupt as some of the characters that surface here. The characterization becomes black and white, like a fairy tale [with the exception of the reporters - they have strengths and weaknesses]. I would hate to classify this book as a fairy tale, because I think the author didn't mean it that way. I think, however, that he set his sights too high when it comes to such an involved theme as good, evil and spiritual warfare. This story is only the beginning. So much more could be written exploring in greater depth ideas that here are just part of a story.The story was great, captivating, and anything you could wish a story to be. My criticisms are merely instances when I felt that the story was a less-than-accurate, over-simplified version of the truth. I encourage others to read this book and judge for themselves. It would be worth your while."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The awesome thing about this book is that it captures Christianity at it's core, aside from Peretti's brilliant style of writing.Just by the opening paragraphs, you can tell he is a well educated writer.One of the most facinating things about this book, is that no matter how long ago it was written, it can never go out of style. It captures Christ's commission in a nut shell, being, to destroy the works of the devil, and set the captives free.Portrays true Christianity, to a world so anti-christian, yet open to the &quot;Un-Christian&quot; &quot;Non-religious&quot; teachings such as satansim, new age, witchcraft and etc., where Christianity is viewed as religion, when in actuality has nothing to do with religion but on the contrary is true relationship with Jesus Christ.In essence, this book might be a shocker to those who to their great misfortune and error have reduced Christianity to a mere &quot;old-tradition&quot; or religion, because it shows the power of God in action, and shows how christians can literally &quot;Kick some Devil Butt&quot;."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is an amazing book. Sure you could point to some flaws here and there, but I still unequivocally recommend it. Frank Peretti's books have sold extremely well, and after reading some of them myself I can see why. This is still, in my opinion, the best one I've read by him so far (I haven't gotten to a few of his new ones yet - I am going to do so as soon as I can, especially considering how good his previous ones were!).There are a few minor theological problems, but there are quite a few good points to the theology too. Sure, one could argue that he focuses too much on the demonic or sometimes gives them too much power, but one could just as easily argue the exact opposite for a lot of other books in Christianity. He does emphasize quite a few things that do need to be be emphasized, like the power and need for prayer and spiritual discernment, the reality of the demonic, spiritual warfare, etc.Although you could point out some technical flaws in the writing, this book is still a real \\"page-turner.\\" I should warn you, don't start this at night, or you will be up really late, because it is that hard to put down! I have re-read it at least once or twice and it was still good.I can't recommend this classic book enough. If you haven't read it, I strongly recommend that you do so."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Wow. That pretty much describes this tense thriller by my favorite author, Frank Peretti. It actually surprised me that this book was written in 1986 - it's not dated at all, and the things that the characters deal with are still very current. This book isn't for sissys - it's at times downright scary (especially for Christians like me who believe that it's all real.) This book is a page-turner - I couldn't put it down. Its fantastic and frighteningly realistic at the same time. I absolutely loved it, both as an enjoyable read and a frightening way of looking at posession, exorcism, and sin."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness takes place in the small town of Ashton, where trouble from the occult is brewing.

When I started to read this book my dad told me about how much he wouldn give to be able to read this book for the first time again. I was reading through it and the story was interesting and compelling. The transition between angel and human and demon is so captivating that I could not put it down. That is only the middle/beginning though. (...)

There is nothing like a book about spiritual warfare to snap you to attention! When i read this book , it made me realize how real evil is. It's incredible to me how one man's perspective can change another. My soul stirred when i read this, it gave me a wake up call on whose side i was working for. The characters in these books have so much to lose and even more they've lost, and yet, by the strenght of God they keep pushing. It's not only a testament to the power or prayer, but to the strength of endurance. I will say though, when i went to bed after reading that, i slept with my light on."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"An interesting concept, of which until Peretti has never been written of, to my knowledge. Many a Christian has wondered of the spiritual activity that takes place daily in heaven and earth, and whether this is a true interpretation of the events taking place in the spirit world or not, it does present itself to be very entertaining reading. Peretti's first novel, if I'm not mistaken, and by my judgement, his finest. I have read this book several times, and after each time I walk away with something I never received from it before, while still maintaining a degree of freshness, so as not to become a stale story. More than anything, I must confess that this novel makes the reader think - and I understand that that is a tired cliche at best, but I must strongly contest that it is in fact the case here. Prepare to be stimulated."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Peretti relies heavily on standard &quot;thriller&quot; techniques not to be confused with theology. I am especially botherd by his portrayal of mainline Christians as the tool of the devil. I don't think this is healthy at all for the church or the gospel. The only thing I find more disturbing than Peretti's theology is the evangelical church's response to it. Some say it is a &quot;revelation from God.&quot; It must be a new revelation because I don't see Peretti's world portrayed in the bible.I am also dumbfounded that people consider this the best book ever written. For me, it's not even close to Dickens, Hemmingway, Bronte, Fitzgerald and other writers of that caliber.Peretti has reminded us of the power of story. A well told story can be more powerful than centuries of systematic theology and biblical studies."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book helped me realize that demons are names subject to the name of Jesus! It has helped me understand just who I am in Christ and the benefits of being born again. Anyone who contradicts or do not beleive that Mr. Peretti is not a child God must not be. And for those who feel that the Third Person of the Godhead was omitted from this book really could not understand the bible. There is no way Mr. Peretti could have written this book without the help of the Holy Spirit leading and guide and showing him things he needed to know in order to give such vivid insight into the spirit realm. I was never really a book reader but now I am since there are Christian books like this one. This book was so informative that my Pastor is thinking of making it mandatory to the congregation to read it before becoming a member at our church.

Great book - you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As Christians we all fight spiritual battles, this book has really opened my eyes to spiritual warfare. Although this book is fictional I believe this book to be inspired by the holy spirit to give us insight to what the enemy is capable of and how we can defeat those spiritual attacks. Put your faith in Jesus Christ first and then trust him."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book certainly has an interesting perspective on spiritual warfare. It takes the words of the Bible and makes them extremely literal, in my take. The characters in the book are average, nothing super memorable about the characters. The strongest characters were Hank and Marshal, other than these characters, the others were a little underdeveloped and one dimensional. They came off somewhat weak as well, as the angels and demons had so much control over everything that happened. I believe the angels and demons had to much control. Every wrong thing that happened was because of the Demons and every good thing was from the angels. I believe this sort of perspective of spiritual warfare takes away from the problem of human sin. Hank mentioned at one pointed in the book that a certain character had to become saved not because of their sins, but because this was the only way of stopping the evil caused by the Demons. Meaning if you don't want bad things to happen to you or have a demon take total control over you, you had become saved. Not because of your own personal sin. Though the book did redeem its self near the end in sharing the whole Gospel truth. Also the use of Jesus name I felt was abused. The book sometimes seem to make Jesus just into a magic word that only cast demons away. Jesus name is more, I wanted to know more about the person of Jesus Christ, who was, and who he is. Not simple a word you shout to cast of evil spirits. I also believe the Holy Spirit should had more control over the believers life, I don't believe angels have that much direct control over someones life. There are several other things as well which I will not mention here. But overall the book is good at showing the power of praying and the importance of being in spiritual community, the importance of the Church."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Im 15 and love to read. I thought this book was a great read. It makes me think angels are really with me. It even gave me goosebumps. I like how he made there be personal demons attached to people. It made everything much more personal and intresting. Loved this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read this book, as well as many of Peretti's other books (Piercing the Darkness, Prophet, The Oath). Of them all, this one is the grand-daddy that &quot;started it all.&quot; (I will eventually review the others also.)The thrust of the book is Spiritual Warfare, including both &quot;the big picture,&quot; and how it affects individual people, and the power of prayer. The reader can see and listen to the people, demons, and angels, while the people in the story cannot see the spiritual battle going on around them, though it influences them and vice versa. In a nutshell, it brings home Eph. 6:12 (&quot;We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but... against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;)I would definitely NOT treat it as a textbook for spiritual warface, as this IS a fiction book, so some liberties are taken. But it is a good reminder that we don't see everything going on around us, and we need to be on our toes--after we've been down on our knees.I would also not recommend the book to young readers as some parts may be scary, or the concept too overwhelming. But junior highers and up would be fine, though I'd be sure to talk with them before, during, and after they've read the book about &quot;the reality&quot; of spiritual warfare, and that it's not just a fictional concept.As a side note, the second book, &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; dwells much more on the spiritual side. So much so that the angels and demons take on more of the &quot;main character&quot; roles than in this first one."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Frank Peretti is one of the best Christian writers I've ever read. He personally reads this abridgement of This Present Darkness in such a way that holds the listener's attention throughout the entire story.

Peretti uses vivid imagery to paint a picture of spiritual warfare that made me so much more aware. I have described scenes and characters from that book to make points about real situations. This book along with its sister \\"Piercing the Darkness\\" made my top Must-reads list on my new blog about Christian Fiction [...]. Working in books for years, I have not talked to a person who did not benefit from this book and enjoy it in the process. It is eye-opening, convicting, edge of your seat excitement, AND it is well written. Do not miss this masterpiece!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I won't bother giving a plot synopsis as other reviewers have. What I do want to say is that I have read this book a half a dozen times already, and I love it every time. The writing, in my opinion, is not particularly exceptional, but the story is so engaging that it makes the reader, this reader anyway, overlook that. The writing isn't bad, by any means, just not notably fantastic.The descriptions of the angels and the demons are vivid and add another level of suspense and excitement to the story. The characters all have their own personalities and I felt I got to know them as the book progressed. There is enough corruption and darkness to keep the intrigue and suspense flying, so the pages fly too.I have loaned my copy of this book to many people, and I will continue to recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've always wanted to read this book, but never got around to it for one reason or another. This classic debut novel by Frank Peretti does what C.S Lewis' \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" did for a previous generation: It brings spiritual warfare to the forefront. The book is about the spiritual battle for the soul of the town of Ashton. Rev. Hank Busche and local newspaper editor Marshall Hogan separately uncover a plot by the town bigwigs to bring New Age consciousness and demon worship to the masses.But alternating between scenes involving protagonists and antagonists are scenes where angels and demons duke it out for the soul of the city. There are breathtaking battles throughout the novel. There are also spunky characters like Bernice and sinister characters like Professor Langstrat and Rev. Oliver Young, and Chief Al Brummel.But some of the storyline borders on the cartoonish. Are we to believe that demons attack engine carburetors so that cars break down?On the other hand, the book does a great of showing how the angels of God rely heavily on \\"prayer cover,\\" that is, the degree of their effectivess is impacted by the power and consistency of our prayers. I loved reading about how Rev. Busche was feared by the demon world because he was always praying.I really wanted to give this book 4 stars instead of five because the cosmic conflicts with demons and angels often reminded me of Ninja turtle battle scenes. The book occasionally lacks the realism of C.S Lewis' aforementioned masterpiece. But the story line is amazing, and after this novel, scores of popular books on spiritual warfare came out. Jerry Jenkins also cites this book as a key influence on many of the later Christian fiction classics that were released, including the Left Behind series.Because of the book's unique historical importance, I decided to give it 5 stars (with reservations). I should also say that \\"The Oath\\" is still my favorite Peretti novel."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Review by Jill WilliamsonBernice Krueger, reporter for the Ashton Chronicle, finds herself in jail after being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She came to Ashton to investigate the supposed suicide of her sister. Now, she and her boss, Marshall Hogan, start investigating some strange occurrences in town.Hank Busche is a small town pastor who is trying to keep his argumentative congregation from falling apart. Little does he know, there are dark forces in town that are set on seeing him fail. As demons characters carry out their assignments, Marshall and Hank become more determined to discover the truth. But can two men fight a host of demons they cannot see? And why is the host of heaven standing around and watching? Aren't they going to do anything to stop this evil plot from taking over the town?Wow. This book has changed the way I think of angels and demons. There are many references in the Bible that lead me to believe there is a spiritual war going on around us that we can't see. But never have I read anything to give me such a clear picture of how that might look. In Daniel 10, Daniel has a vision of an angel coming to speak to him. The angel says in verses 12-14, \\"Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.\\"This has always amazed me. That God told this angel to come and talk to Daniel, but the angel got held up fighting some demon over in Persia. In the Bible, angels are sometimes referred to as princes. I believe this angel was talking about how he was fighting with the prince of the Persian kingdom, who was a fallen angel, or demon, since he was resisting one of the host of heaven. It's this idea that Peretti builds his story around. The idea that there are angels and demons waging war around us in a dimension that we cannot see. They can see us, but we can't see them. And in Peretti's story, the demons want to rule Ashton and the angels are there to make sure God's plan prevails.This Present Darkness is an awesome story. Marshall, Bernice, and Hank slowly stumble onto the truth and have to work together to save Ashton. I love how Peretti showed the angels as mighty warriors interacting with one another. I also loved how Peretti showed the power of prayer. I kept rooting for the characters to pray, already! This book was thrilling, scary, amazing, and brilliant. I can't say enough wonderful things about it. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life, if not over and over again."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I highly recommend this book. Very entertaining. The characters draw you in. But the what impressed me the most is the author's ability to make the spirit world real.

Very well done."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Ever have that feeling that somebody is watching you? That you are not completely alone?

I don't see how any Christian who sincerely reads this book could be inactive with their prayer life afterwards. Certainly, this book and its story line are all fiction. However, the possibilities presented and the practical principles developed within these pages, are perfectly inline with Scripture. Peretti places an emphasis on prayer and the fact that spiritual war is going on all around us. I have seen many Bible students become transformed and motivated after reading this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was the first Christian book I had ever read. What can I say? It's a classic. I remember feeling so energized, both as a believer and an author; I wanted to write something just as good. This book portrays spiritual warfare in such a way that you might want to look differently at certain things after reading it. But you have to remember it's fiction; I have heard about people who had taken this book too literally, which is of course not exactly a wise thing to do."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With this novel, Frank Peretti changed the landscape and future of christian literature... Not only was it extremely gripping, it inspired one to action. How acurate are his descriptions of the spirit world? Who knows?

I read this book 12 yrs ago when i was in jr. high and now just listened to the unabridged version... EXCELLENT!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A great book! It must be the best book I have ever read in my life!

But, some of you may find it very frightning........"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Geewiz...it's a book to read for those who LIKE to read. I highly doubt if it's meant to &quot;change the world&quot; or cause an &quot;apocalypic frenzy&quot; (as another reader wrote). I believe it's intention is to entertain but also make one think about the depth of their OWN spiritual life. Definitely a book to make you think. It's refreshing! Read it and enjoy it for what it's worth!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Ok first before any one gets upset I am a not an atheist, attend church, and respect evalgelicals and other faiths. I give this such a low rating because I thought I was getting a novel that was fiction in the realm of the Calling or the Book Of Joby. yes, I liked these two novels I enjoy a well written good vs evil novel. This book was written with not the general audience in line but the bible thumping reader in mind. In the first chapters alone you could tell this. I bought these by quiclky skimming a review of the The Calling by David Mack {Big mistake not to happen again} where a particular reviewer said this book was much better. Luckliy I bought this and another FP novel used. When I recived them they both had bible study group info stamped in them. I still tried them anyway. I belive these are good for the bible study group but not for those looking for a wellw ritten fiction book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I thought This Present Darkness was a good book that kept you guessing till the end. The characters were well defined and diverse at the same time. The book has plenty of action to keep you interested. The only problem with this book is that it drags on a little too long. But if you like action and and a good plot I reccomend This Present Darkness."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness is a book that will instill faith in the most passionate aetheists. It is about a small town, out of the way, that is being taken over by the occult. Angels work to rescue the town from demons controlling the occult. It really shows what prayer can do, and how much God loves us all."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read most all of Peretti's books and have found them all to be excellent. He really sheds new light on spiritual warfare. Draws one into the story while making one realize the possible severe consequences of &quot;playing around&quot; with the occult. While its not possible to see EVERYTHING that goes on around us in the spiritual realm, I feel that Peretti brings alot of the descriptions of the battle between good and evil in the bible into the realm of real, everyday life. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I felt that Peretti made a masterpiece when he wrote this book. The reality of what he wrote is amazing.Demons do exist and so do angels. They battle and God will prevail. Very well written.

Alot of people who read this book who are not believers in Christ or the bible may only think of this book as fiction or something that was a good thriller or entertaining, but they are wrong this book is about everyday life the struggles of people who walk not by sight but by faith in Jesus our lord. I loved this book I was struggling in my beliefs and in Christ but after reading this book I got a look into the world of spirtuality and of the battles of prayer and faith. Peretti had an annointing when writing this book God must have held his hand with every word. Thank you Lord and Praise to Jesus!!!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have not finished reading this book yet, but from what I have read so far it is an outstanding book. A friend recommended it to me after reading it and I have not been dissapointed yet!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"&#65533;The heavenly warriors mowed through the ranks of demons like blurring scythes. Demons began to fall out of the sky like meteors, spinning, smoking, dissolving.&#65533; This quote is typical of This Present Darkness. Frank Peretti writes this book to give it&#65533;s readers a better understanding of spiritual warfare. He incorporates complex characters and descriptive diction to make this book come alive.This book takes place in the typical small college town of Ashton. However, when a skeptical reporter and a prayerful pastor compare notes, they suddenly find themselves fighting a hideous New Age plot to subjugate the townspeople, and eventually the entire human race.Ashton is just another small town. It&#65533;s population nearly doubles when college is in session. Peretti does a very good job at describing this town and areas around it. This helps in understanding the plot.The usage of foreshadowing in this book heightens suspense and makes for a great climax. It keeps your attention throughout the book. A Bible verse on the back of the book contains the novel&#65533;s conflict: &#65533;For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world&#65533;&#65533; &#65533; Ephesians 6:12 (NLT). This narrative brilliantly reveals the truth of the spiritual realm through interesting, fast-paced action.The characters that Peretti uses in this book bring it to life. Powerful angels and evil demons fiercely battle over human souls. The main human protagonists, Hank Busche and Marshall Hogan, strongly pursue truth in their quest to save Ashton. And thinking that no one can stop him, the main human antagonist, Alexander Kaseph, tries to take over the town for his satanic mission. Kaseph is a formidable opponent to Busche and Hogan. Said about Kaseph: &#65533;This guy is a perfect cross between the ultimate guru and Adolph Hitler, and he makes Al Capone look like a boy scout.&#65533;The language Peretti uses adds to the intenseness of the story. &#65533;A low gurgling growl came from deep in his throat as his nostrils belched forth yellow vapor&#65533; gives a better description of the main supernatural antagonist.This book is good for anyone who likes a thrilling novel, or anyone who is interested in spiritual warfare. It ties in a Biblical view of the supernatural with a fast-paced narrative to compete with that of John Gresham and Stephen King."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness has placed itself on the top of my list! From the moment I started reading I couldn't put it down. Frank Peretti has a very intriguing way of writing.I have also read Tilly and The Oath...my next will be Piercing The Darkness.It's a great book and I recommend it to all readers!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book opened my eyes to the possible world beyond our eyes. Frank Peretti chose to write about angels and demons and I root for him all the way. Now, every once and a while I'll think whether some angelic Captain is pointing his troops toward some nearby town or if I have a specific angel of my own. I know this book is one heck of a lot of speculation but that doesn't bother me one bit. I like to take a walk on the wild side and that is what Peretti allows me to do with this book. This book might be shorter than the second book, but this one is by far better in my mind. Peretti saves his best plot and best characters for this book. But I can't say that I didn't enjoy the second book!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. I buy everything I can find by Frank Peretti."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness is by far the most thrilling/action and suspenseful book that's ever been written. Frank Perettis detailed view on the spiritual assaults that occur everywhere in this book will make your bones shudder. Never has prayer been so effective nor so important in everyday matters, mentally and physically. If this movie would go into motion picture production using the book as a direct baseline, using several of the computer/technological advances for the heavenly and dark forces, the movie would be stunningly extravagant! I strongly encourage anyone, Christ followers or non-believers, to read this novel, if you think you can handle it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This outstanding novel is an excellent personification of spiritual warfare, slowly building suspense up to its explosive conclusion.As a former small town reporter myself, I can appreciate the details of the life the characters lead. They were very accurate.This book also vividly describes the nature of angels and demons, but take it with a grain of salt, as it is fiction.The conclusion is mind blowing, and this was one of the few books I've read where I was so excited I had trouble reading.Check it out!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Though I've grown out of my \\"dramatic battles of angels and demons\\" phase, I still think this is a good book for the young-adult set. Though Peretti's moral focus is not as strong as that of CS Lewis' timeless classic \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" Peretti does have an ethical framework that prevents his flashy storytelling from turning into dangerous sensationalism. For example, Pastor Hank (the book's protagonist) is a loving husband and father, the head of a functional family, whose sermons focus on topics such as marital fidelity rather than fire and brimstone. Evil is seen not only in witchcraft, but in child abuse and drug addiction. Pastor Hank's flock has no political agenda. They use prayer and church debate, not violence and partisanship, to bring about the final victory. If you're looking for some hard-core moral instruction, go with Lewis. Otherwise, this book is harmless fun for those whose spirituality includes some dramatic flare."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book relates to the battles of spiritual warfare fought in our everyday lives. Frank Peretti is one of the best writers of his kind, if not the best. God has blessed this man with a talent very few people have today. A must read for any person who is interested in finding out about spiritual warfare with a story-like theme."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"What Frank set out to do, and what he occomplished is treuly wonderful. He brought the christian unseen world into a context that is understandable and enjoyable. As one other reviewer sia,d most xian literature is dreadfully dull and unredable. This, and Jim Walker's books are very readable. Some of the pheology is stretched, but I think it's done so to give the story life. I do wish some angels had been killed, and are demons ugly? Also, some of the demons asked who Tal was. They all knew each other! That whole temper tamtrem that was put in there could have been eliminated. I don't believe that newagers are trying to take over the world like he says, but it does make for a good read. If you haven't read the book do so! I think it can be appriciated by both christian and onchristian alike. Just don't think it's a perfect reflection of reality as some people appear to believe."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Go Peretti Go!

ScanlonAuthor of Where's my mate?,Born of the Spirit and Redeeming Catholics."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book, it apears to me, only apeals to those who have the strength and heart to believe truly in the word of God. It is an account of spiritual warfare and the constant strugle between good and evil. Any one who could read this book, and spend more time trying to be philisophical is a fool, and will probubly not enjoy the book any way. It shows how there are only two kingdoms in the world, Gods and the devils. Man is not, and will not ever be in control of it's own destiney. You either side with darkness or light, there is no inbetween. I loved it and find that it is still his best work ever. The purpose of the book is not to be the best liturary work ever written, but to show the inherent reality of spiritual warfare. It will enlighten and thrill any one who reads it with a pure heart and mind. The charachters are not shallow and develop into strong mature charachters. What I think some people have a problem with is that the charachters find christ and change from the inside out. They do not evolve from excperiance and loss, only through the changing power of God. He shows the truth in a dying world through a fasinating and action pact fictional novel, that has more truth to it then most things socety holds as true. With that said I leave you with one finall thought...&quot;For the saints of God, and for the lamb!&quot;"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The most helpful thing to remember when reading Frank Perreti's spiritual warfare novels, is that they are not meant as allegories. They are fictional, but not science fictional. They represent the world as Frank Perreti and many others (myself included) believe it to be."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Peretti's faith, and I admire what he sought to accomplish with the novel. The plot is certainly relevant. However, the characters are as thin as the paper the book is printed on, and the story is told rather clumsily. I understand that he's written much else since this novel first saw publication, so perhaps he's improved. I recommend the novel on content, but not on quality."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I WAS SKEPTICAL IN ORDERING THIS COPY BECAUSE IT'S AN OLDER BOOK, BUT; THIS BOOK WAS IN VERY GOOD CONDITION, NO DOG EAR MARKS, TORN PAGES OR YELLOWING OF PAGES.

I dont even know what theology means. I read this book and was captivated by the first sentence! I dont know how this person can give it one star and bad ratings, he/she appears to be a know it all, but i have one thing to say to this person, read it again and OPEN YOUR HEART!!! if you dont its no wonder you disliked the book. Search your feelings, take a day and relax all of this &quot;theology&quot; stuff whatever it is. Wake up and take a look at your self, This is the best book in the entire world and prpobably the best writer. Please read Eight Cousins by Louisa May Alcott, Thanks for the best book ever Mr. Peretti!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was an excellent book which I read several years ago, and continue to re-read. While I question the use of prayer to give energy to angels, the rest of it is very close to the reality of spiritual warfare. I know this from personal experience. This book serves not only to entertain, but to inform and awaken people to the unseen realities of this world. Prayer is powerful and works!The reader from U of DE need to re-read his Bible. The demons that the disciples could not cast out were because they were using the names of Peter and Paul, not Jesus the Christ. Faithful Christians find all things are possible through prayer in the name of Jesus.Regarding the non-christian religions, Christians KNOW there is only one way - Jesus. Bear in mind, it is God, the judge, who knows what is in each heart. All true Christians love (tolerate)the sinner, BUT it is sinful, and un-loving, to accept the sinful behavior. When your child is making a mistake, you still love him/her as you attempt to correct their behavior. As to fortune telling, witchcraft, New Age and other &quot;alternative religions&quot; being demonic that is the fact. Anyone who does not confess that Jesus Christ is their Saviour is on the wrong track, no matter how kind or well-intentioned. You may not like it, but denying you have a flat tire will not get it fixed.Enough theology; this is an entertaining and informative book on what we are really facing everyday, and I encourage everyone to read it, and more importantly the Bible."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The premise of this book was ridiculous, even if you're religious.

Someone suggested I might like Frank Peretti and so I picked it up when I came across it in the bookstore. I hadn't read anything like it before and what I liked was the way he showed the angels working as the human's prayed and needed help. It was like you were getting two adventures in one almost.The I think the book fairly reflects what's going on today as people of new age beliefs get into our education system and other places, Christian ideas are shut out while doors are open to everything else. Secular society is a mix of everything and people get to pick and choose. But in some places you don't get the choice of Christianity unless you're already Christian.I do like the way the Characters operated. Pastor Hank is a good pastor and has a helpful wife, clear lines of good versus evil are drawn and the angels were great and had distinctive personalities. Is it horror? I don't know. I would consider it occult/fantasy."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I first started reading this book I was about to dismiss it as being anti-religious. Continued reading proved it to be one of the most well written pieces of christian fiction I have ever read. The villain is truly an 'anti-christ' and has drawn a veil over the eyes of almost an entire town. It is a very compelling book that has to be read to be believed. I might add, it is well worth the read even if it is almost 700 pages in length. Perretti is an amazing author. I rate him at the top of my list with Terri Blackstock and Jamie Turner."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book opened my eyes to the reality of spiritual warfare and brought Jesus' warnings about such warfare into sharp focus.

I feel that this book is full of suspense and will probably keep the reader interested in what's going on in the lives of the people in the book.

Reading this book allowed me to see demons, spiritual wickedness in high places, principalities, and rulers of the darkness with their personal names. Anger was called Anger, a spirit being! Confusion was called, &quot;Confusion! &quot; He took what has been written to us biblically in spiritual terms and translated it so that we could see into the heavenlies a depiction of how spiritual warfare may be taking place! If you are a Christian, this book can raise your awareness and can help you to recognize these unclean spirits and stand prepared in prayer to rage war. Let God be praised!

I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN ONCE I STARTED!! this book will remain one of my all time faves and really makes you think, and believe, in angels and demons. the book revolves around the struggle to captivate a town by the demons and the war the the angels wage to free it forever from the Devil's grasp. NO matter what you beleive, Frank Perretti strikes a nerve in us all, and you will forever be changed by this simple story and the characters in it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"While reading this book I recognized myself and everyone else in the church to the person. Even though this is Christian fiction, it hits to the nearest thing any words can define of who and what we as Christians are fighting against everyday. This is happening to some degree in every city, country and town in the world today, just as it was happening in those fictional towns and cities when this story was written. After reading this book I was desperate to find the sequal to it. Frank Peretti is the best Christian fiction/fact writer in todays annuals of literary genius. He can tie a story of fictional happenings into a story so close to the truth of the attack by the enemy that is going on in every church of today regardless of it's religous or Spiritual denomination. i am looking for his next book. I have also read The Monster, The Happening and The Oath. If you haven't read them yet. you need to.

While this book certainly is not a theology text, nor is it meant to be, it is entertaining and engaging. While we should be careful not to let this book define our theology of prayer, angels, or spiritual warfare, we should be able to be entertained. I read this book a number of years ago and recently skimmed it once again. This book does do a good job of giving one perspective on angels and demons that is entertaining. This book is at least worth reading.

But most important, is an important revelation of the forces that are behind the struggles of all mankind.

With every page the truth slowly unfolds of the problem. Ever though no one knows about angels or demons, Peretti puts it in a great perspective.

Though it was hard to follow, it had a well thought out plot and had intresting characters and a cool conflict. Overall this book is worth reading and I would suggest it to someone who likes a medium action and intresting, mysterious read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a great book if you believe that Buddhists, holistic healers and pretty much anyone other than fundamentalist Christians are in fact Satan and are trying to take over the world. I won't deny Peretti's ability to write and develop page turning suspense, but this is a book you might want to just skip over if you have an IQ of over 70. Books like this are pretty much the most acceptable form of hate speech. So keep that in mind if you find yourself intrigued by the interesting title are dark cover art."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The good news is that this is an entertaining, competently written mystery-thriller. The bad news is everything else. An underground group of \\"New Agers\\" is plotting to take over a small town, and eventually the world. As far as I'm aware, there is no New Age \\"conspiracy\\" trying this sort of thing, and if there were it wouldn't be coordinated by anthropomorphic demons from the Christian hell. And if its practitioners engaged in human sacrifice (unlikely), they wouldn't be in business for long. Well and good; read this as a fantasy if you like, but how many people will take this seriously because they bought it in a Christian bookstore?I don't believe there's a racist element in this novel, as some reviewers have said. The blackness of the demons is most likely part of the same tradition that includes B-movie westerns wherein the bad dudes wear the black hats. There are, however, other types of intolerance here: of nature religions, Eastern faiths, certain modes of meditation, etc. I'm no New Ager, but Peretti seems particularly antagonistic toward them. (In fairness, I should state that the author doesn't use the term \\"New Age\\"; it appears in the blurb on the cover of the paperback. It's clear, though, that the phrase suits his purposes here.) There's something disturbingly medieval in all this, exemplified not only by the angels and demons fighting it out in the air around us, but also by the idea that a specific brand of Christianity is the Only Way. It's difficult to tell whether Peretti believes in what he's writing, or if he simply knows a lucrative market when he sees it. He certainly knows a gullible one, and he appears for all the world to be exploiting the paranoia and fears of nave churchgoers. Not to mention - and this could be serious - implying that we aren't responsible for our bad actions; they're attributable to nothing more than demons working through us. Somebody somewhere just needs to be praying, that's all.One can imagine the response from the Christian community if someone decided to publish a novel taking something of an opposite approach, that is, presenting New Agers as minding their own business (usually the case) and Christians as intolerant bigots trying to run everyone else out of town (gee, ya think there might be some historical examples of that?): accusations of libel and persecution, no doubt. (BL, Tucker, GA)"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Skimming this book was the most I could endure (unfortunately a \\"zero-stars\\" rating was not one of the options), and I can think of no better way to express my sentiments than to quote Bruce Bawer, the author of the excellent, eye-opening, and thought-provoking book *Stealing Jesus: how fundamentalism betrays Christianity*:\\"It cannot be stressed too strongly...that [*This Present Darkness*] is intended not as a fantasy but as a picture of the way the world actually is. It's a world in which the immensely human Jesus who preached and lived a gospel of love is replaced entirely by a fantasy Jesus who stands at the head of an army of beings with names like Triskal and Krioni who seem to have been dropped in from some Norse myth.\\"\\"As far as one can tell, all the humans in this book are white, as is the most prominent angel, who is tall, blond, Nordic, and handsome; the demons, however, are invariably described as black and hideously ugly. (Peretti mentions their blackness repeatedly.)\\"\\"Summed up neatly [in this book] is the way legalistic Christians...feel about the changes they're living through. Their modest knowledge of history enables them to believe that the past was simple, virtuous, and changeless; their undereducation makes it easy for them to be confused and daunted by what they see happening around them.\\"Bawer also quotes the theologian Mark A. Noll on this point: \\"[This book] shows an evangelical community unwilling to sift the wheat from the chaff in the wisdom of the world, unprepared to countenance the complexity of mixed motives in human action, and uninterested in focusing seriously on the natural forces that influence human behavior.\\"Bawer continues: \\"Peretti makes it clear throughout who the enemies are: ...churches that preach the oneness of humanity and universities that fill your children's heads with ideas that challenge the things you've taught them.\\"\\"Peretti does a very fine job of exploiting his audience's resentments, fears, and prejudices - their sense of intimidation by higher education, their desire for a \\"tougher\\" God with black-and-white answers, and their wish to believe that evil is *out there* and that they are the saints of God.\\"One scene in particular \\"is very effectively designed to reflect legalistic notions of family and church relationships out of control. In the legalistic view, the husband should be the unquestioned leader of his home, and the pastor the unquestioned leader of his flock.\\"The wife of the town's fundamentalist pastor is \\"in good legalistic fashion, consistently meek and supportive of her husband...\\"In a nutshell: \\"The plot of *This Present Darkness* is the stuff of paranoiac fantasy.\\""},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I actually found this to be a nice entertaining book. However, in the years following my first reading of it, I have been surprised how many Christians don't seem to realize that it's fantasy, not reality.It's a cool story, on the level with Star Wars, but it's far from a \\"Christian\\" book. There is no Biblical basis for much of anything in the book--no reason to believe that demons cause our emotions, or that demons specialize in certain emotions (eg, demons of fear, depression, etc), or that our prayers give angels strength, or much of anything else in the realm that Peretti has created.So while Peretti writes some pretty good sci-fi, I give only one star because his books seem to have the effect (whether intentional or not) of turning people away from real scriptural study and making them think they have experienced a revolutionary spiritual experience by reading a fictional book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm a Wiccan, yet I generally don't have a problem with reading Peretti's work. I basically take it in stride like when I'm reading Charles Williams or C.S. Lewis. To be honest, I found this book quite entertaining, and quite thrilling. Unfortunantly, Peretti's ideaology (not theology) is rampant with bigotry and paranoia, with a hatred for individuals like me that seems to burn like that of Hitler towards the jews.However, I still found the book entertaining.Oh, and for all of you Christian reviewers, I read this book, and I STILL practice Wicca. Literature isn't THAT effective, folks."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Peretti writes well. He is a good fiction author. However, his theology is far from Biblical. Show me from the Bible evidence for:* Spirits responsible for particular sins. Our own sinful natures are bad enough, we do not need blame it on powerful spirits resisted only by prayer. Where is human accountability?* Angels powering up on our prayers. What a way to minimise the role of prayer as we talk with God!* God's lack of sovereignty over issues. Turns out that all the bad problems in the world were because the saints neglected to pray hard enough.* Becoming a Christian as an end to ridding yourself of demons, as opposed to ridding yourself from the penalty of sin.On top of that, I really disliked his heavy handed approach to condemning the New Age movement. I agree that it's wrong, unbiblical and sinful. But as a fully organised movement seeking to control the world? Please! It was just as heavy handed as Peretti's Monster was against science. I found it incredibly unrealistic and an unfair portrayal of New Age mysticism. What about all the other beliefs opposing Christianity? Why is this the scapegoat?Despite Peretti's engaging writing, these frequently occurring errors and the heavy handed approach made it very hard to appreciate the story line and writing style."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book welcomes one to the future: where New Age religious thought takes over the Evangelical American Church. It is a prophetic tome (as opposed to a tomb) and it forewarns of the binding of astral planes. It realizes that extra-terrestrial beings are not an unrealistic eschatological expectation for those who understand the development of universal consciousness. It uses biting dake-bonoistic sarcasm and cultural epithets to expose the synthesis of genetic development and racial awareness. The era of Maytreya began on 11 August 1999. This was a time (due to behind the scenes work at NASA) when the possibility of planetary colonization took great steps toward popular acceptance. The fusion hasn't occurred completely as of yet but the steps are being taken. Technology is being embraced more and more. With Ted K's demise the enemies of progress have taken a fatal blow. 'Welcome to the future' is the thought that has come to some people's mind. Finis Dake & Bono both exhibit a close proximity throughout the fantastical plot. It's a future where one doesn't have to worry about silly political correctness. Perhaps some people don't get this. The satire is deadly serious in the text. Don't believe the hype. This text is the real deal. I can't admire something more.

Read This Present Darkness first time in 1991 when it was given to me my an aunt. Ever since, I have read every book he's written since that time, (except the children's books, although I do have 2 of them). I've read \\"This Present Darkness\\" 6 times over the past 20 years. My aunt asked for her the book back, so I had to buy my own copy here at Amazon. I got the 1986 printing my aunt let me borrow! I have purchased Peretti's latest title \\"Illusion\\" on Kindle and hardcover and currently reading it.This Present Darkness is about the spiritual warfare that is raging in the spirit realm. The object of this warfare is control over a small town, whose inhabitants are oblivious to what is happening around them and unaware that their prayers and spiritual belief is what will determine the outcome. In their reality, they see the principles of Christianity as being old school, with the pastor of a small church not being in touch with the changing times. The politicians have an agenda to rid the church and the town of this kind of thinking and teaching. To the rescue, comes the newspaper man, who has issues and doubts about his own spirituality and whether or not God even exists for him. As far has he's concerned, he's chasing a story, not trying to be a part of it. As he comes to terms with his spirituality, he becomes a threat to the demons in the spirit realm that are at war with the angels of God. The demons don't play fair and they show that by attacking the family of the newspaper man, and anyone that is a threat to them. Thank God for the old spinster that is a strong prayer warrior for God. If the people of the town would just start praying and strengthening themselves in the spirit, they subsequently will strengthen the angels in their battle with the demons of Satan, and save the town before it's too late. The strongman is on the way, and he has orders to take the town. Will he succeed at winning this small town for his master, Satan? Will the newspaper man be able to get to the bottom of what's really going before it's too late?"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is that it is used, and just a little beat up.

Incredible this was Peretti's first published adult novel.This set the standard for spiritual thrillers involving the thin layer that exists between the natural and the supernatural worlds. The latter being where angels and demons battle for our souls.Interesting how the New Age movement was behind the novel's protagonist and here we are now 20+ years later and universalism and \\"anything goes as far as God is concerned\\" are rampant.The novel starts slow as we meet the key characters, both natural and supernatural, but bounds along at great pace in the last third as the conflict escalates.Great how Peretti demonstrates the power of prayer and how it stimulates activity in the supernatural. Hooray.Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am currently reading it. There is so much going on in the world today, that people need to who we are truly dealing with."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was one of the best books that I have ever read. It is full of action, and it is very fast paced. Peretti writes in a way that I can picture being there (sort of like 3-D). He brings to light what so few people talk about- demons. Demons are here and they are attached to people, and the way he writes it makes perfect sense. Not only does he talk about demons, but he also talks about angels and the power of prayer. Praying matters and it does make a huge difference in people's lives. Shedding light on the need to pray was very prevalent in this book, and it makes you think and analyze your own prayer life. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I first read this book in the late 1980's. I thought it was excellent. I realize it is a novel, but it made me appeciate my new faith in a different way. I was happy to find it again recently through Amazon.

Makes you consider the ongoing battle for our souls in this life, on a daily basis. To see how they affect the fictional characters in this story allows us to consider how they affect us too. After I read this and began telling others about it, I found that many of my friends and family had already read and loved it too!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The books I like best I always reread at least three times--with time enough in between to forget a little bit of it--and I've reread this one three times and will probably go for a fourth time later. Ditto for his next book, Piercing the Darkness, but not for Peretti's following books. I read Prophet twice, so I did like it, but not enough for a third read. And the other Peretti books I didn't like at all. However, the first two books I cannot praise highly enough because they are what inspired me to write my first--and so far only--novel, Shadows, which I published as an ebook on Amazon (search on Jarpey if you are interested) because it was too long for traditional publishers to take a chance on. I mentioned Peretti in my preface. I am very grateful to him.Friends of mine who loved the first two Peretti books loved what I loved in them: the behind-the-scenes action of what was going on in the spiritual realm, showing how angelic and demonic forces influenced the characters' thoughts. Of course, this wouldn't have been interesting if the characters weren't real and interesting, but they were. The plotting was great, the action moved smoothly along, and there were no slow spots at all. Marvelous entertainment that inspired me, and my friends, to PRAY MORE. That's a book with a good influence! Bravo, Peretti!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"My fault. I wanted the book on tape and this ended up being a dramatized version and I was not thrilled. I don't think it was advertised as for what it really was or perhaps I didn't read well enough. Anyway, it was disappointing."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book when Peretti first wrote it many years ago. I had previously had a glimpse of the spiritual battles going on around us. Peretti put it together in this book. I've read most of his works. All that I've read are good. However, l believe this one is his best work."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I used to love to read mystery novels, stories full of suspence and intrigue. As a Christian I wondered if there was something out there I could feel comfortable reading, when I came across this novel in my church library.It deals with the struggle between good and evil. I saw where someone lessened this struggle by insisting what was portrayed as evil simply is not, but as a Christian familiar with God's Word I assure you it is forbidden in the Bible and is in fact evil. The story may take a bit to get into, but once you do it is action packed, full of suspense! I simply did not want the story to end! This story also is carried on in Piercing The Darkness, which I highly recommend! I actually enjoyed the second novel the most.Anyway, if you are looking for Christianity's answer to Stephen King, look no more! Good writing, good story, all from the view of a Christian writer. And I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was told about this book by a friend who insisted that it was a &quot;must read&quot; as she felt the story line mirrored much of my own life in unbelievable ways. As I read the book, I was able to relate personally to most of the story line. For an individual who often questions the &quot;whys&quot; of the world, the spiritual warfare depicted in this book helps one to realize that the battles in life are not of flesh and blood but rather of the darkness present that looms around us. While some of the battles between the evil spirits were at time a little slow moving, it did not take away from the story in any way, it just made me want to read faster to get to the next suspenseful scene. Another great book by Frank Peretti!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was wonderful. I haven't read much Christian fiction at all...actually, the only Christian fiction that I have read is the Left Behind series. I always assumed that it would be cheesy...among other things. I stand corrected...this book was better than most I have read in recent years and I could barely put it down...highly recommended."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is a Christian novel which has sold over one millioncopies. Although the story is fictitious, it brings home the starkreality of what believers face and encounter in everyday life.The scene is set in an American town called Ashton. Seemingly insignificant to most people, but to the strongman and his demons, there were great plans for this town.Yes, this is a book about Spiritual Warfare, angels and demons and good triumphing over evil.Enter the good guys:Hank Busche, a 26 year old Pastor of the Ashton Community Church.Marshall Hogan, editor of the local newspaper, the Ashton Clario; and last but not least, Tal, Captain of the angelic warriors, planning to thwart the assignment of the strongman and his demons.This book brings mome the importance of prayer cover, the reality of a common enemy and his schemes and deceptions, and the need of &quot;having done all to stand&quot;.By the same token, the vivid imagery and fight scenes described may be a little &quot;over the top&quot;.On the whole it is good reading and once you start, you'll find it difficult to put down."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Frank Peretti's THIS PRESENT DARKNESS transcends the normal realm of 'good verses evil' by blasting headlong into the Angelic Conflict. The reader is taken on a spiritual journey that is a virtual tug of war between Angelic warriors and demonic forces with a tiny American hamlet and its' citizens as the rope.Though Peretti does take some liberties with dispensational reality, the book flows nicely and story will keep you flipping pages long past your bedtime. Peretti displays his literary power in enticing the reader to press on with alacrity to see what happens next, only to be propelled further still into the abyss. There exists as well, much to be said for Peretti's ability to introduce seemingly mundane and miniscule segments of information only to have them later on, blast back into the story with enormity.Peretti did seem to have some slight lapses in research. Some things just weren't too logical, such as covertly searching real estate company records to determine property ownership when the logical source would have been the County Deed Records that are available to the public without the need for undercover work. However, such discrepancies do little to detract from the overall story.This is considered a classic novel of Christian fiction for good reason. This one is worth reading on many levels. The story is far from ordinary, flows nicely and entices the reader on to the very end."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book last year in 8th grade. Okay, I didn't just read it. I practically devoured it. I'm reading it again in 9th grade in my spare time because it is just that good. It has always been hard for me to get into a story, get interested in the beginning, but Peretti did an amazing job of capturing my attention from the very first page.My mother read this book in the 80's [in her Bible college days] and bought the 3 book set for me in 2003. I couldn't get enough. This Present Darkness is fantastic in every aspect; the characters are believable and well developed, the plot is planned perfectly, the setting fits the characters and the whole scenario wonderfully.Great book for young adults, Christian or not."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Ok, I admit that this is the first book by Frank Peretti that I have read. I could not put it down. The story starts off with a bang and keeps the reader interested in this page-turning epic of a novel.I've never been a big reader until recently, and I have read seveal books over the last month. From all the reviews I have read about this book, I knew it would be a great read. I was right. This book defines true Christian Story telling. The biblical themes are as real as the characters in this story. I look forward to reading Piercing The Darkness, Peretti's next novel!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness is a priceless, exciting example of Christian fiction. I loved the book, with its descriptions of spiritual warfare and the power of a prayerful believer. Anyone who is searching for the Truth of Jesus Christ or interested in His Power would be interested in seeing how this book portrays spiritual warfare. Anyone interested in Christian fiction novels would enjoy This Present Darkness.Peretti's story shows the power of prayer. Whatever you go through in life, you should go through it with prayer. Prayer keeps us connected with God, our Creator, who knows us best. I'll be stepping up my prayer life after reading this novel.This Present Darkness was a nominal novel. The story was always kept understandable. I loved the book and am glad I read it. Frank Peretti's This Present Darkness showed me the power of a praying believer. Go ahead, splurge, read This Present Darkness."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I wish I had read this book when I became a Born-Again Christian. It's helped me understand better the meaning of the Bible Passage, &quot;The fervent and effective prayer of a righteous man avails much&quot;. The book is a must have, it helps to understand the need for prayer in our Christian walk with God and to claim the Victory we have in JESUS when he died on the cross."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book, Peretti's first adult effort, constitutes a pioneering effort of Christian literature. Here Peretti delves into spiritual matters, both Christian fundamentalism and Eastern mysticism. He reaches down into our inner-most fears and touches us on a deep, almost primal level. He exposes those \\"things that go bump in the night\\". Peretti reveals a world within our world, one filled with powerful, malevolant creatures bent on world domination and the pure, righteous beings that oppose them. Both sides use humans and the human spirits as catalysts to achieve their ends. This book is about the most basic struggle between good and evil, as presented in the Bible: demons vs angels. It presents how fundamental Judeo-Christian morals and ethics help defend against spiritual darkness. And it expands upon the Bible to give a possible scenario on how these spiritual battles may be fought.Much of what Peretti has written about in this book is his own interpretation of how fundamental Christian Biblical teachings fit into this spiritual war. No matter what your faith, this book should get you thinking about how the world works. Are angels real? Are demons real? Can or does this kind of struggle exist right under our \\"work-a-day\\", oblivious noses? Peretti takes us on a journey to show us the spiritual battle that may be taking place everyday in America, with the fate of our very souls in the balance of the outcome. This book literally began the fantasy Christian genre, where everyday life is presented as a battle for dominion between good and evil spirits. Many books by various authors followed this one, with the \\"Left Behind\\" series being the most popular to date. I think fantasy and fiction fans alike will enjoy this book, especially if they keep an open mind about the possibility of this being truly how life is out there. Christian peoples of all denominations should enjoy and be encouraged by this book. The only drawback to it is the poor character development; often characters appear to be almost wooden or cardboard cut outs, often either really good, really bad, or really clueless, with little of the true complexity of mankind in place. But this problem is soon corrected in Peretti's subsequent offerings, such as the sequel, Piercing the Darkness. I highly recommend these books to any and all takers."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"it is 1254 am and i just finished this book finally. i was captivated since two days ago when i bought it. i laughed and cried. and my faith has increased. i understand Gods love even more. you have to read this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness is considered by many to be a classic of Christian literature and I would tend to agree.However the audio version is marred by overly dramatic music, silly audio effects and last, but not least, Mr. Peretti's undistinguished vocal tone and all too frequent bouts of really bad over acting. The producers attempted to compensate for this bush league performance by augmenting it via silly vocal effects. A better choice might have been to spend the money they paid for the music and vocal effects to get a really good professional voice actor instead. Due to their poor production choices this audio book sounds like the audio version of a comic book were it done as a high school drama department project. Reader, just so you get the picture, it was SO bad that I started heckling at about the mid-point of the second CD and didn't stop until the audio book was (mercifully) over. This is a pity given the weight and importance of the material being presented. These CDs will definitely NOT get a second listen!Deficiencies aside, if you don't have the time to sit and read the written version, the audio will serve as a (barely) passable substitute. However it doesn't truly capture how good the original printed work is!In closing, please don't let this honest review of the compromised audio book discourage you from avoiding this important material. \\"This Present Darkness\\" is a watershed work of fiction that sensitized this reviewer and his church to the spiritual war that ever surrounds us and the role that the Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve play in it. Whether it is listened to or read this is material that every Christian would do well to experience at least once and think about often."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I don't give five stars very often, but this book deserves it! Without a doubt, it's the best Christian fiction I've ever read. The plot is clever and the characters are well-developed. The writing style is excellent. Peretti's unique style sparkles, but never gets in the way of the story.Not everyone will agree with Peretti's interpretation of spiritual warfare (it IS fiction, after all), but his portrayal of the behind-the-scenes battle between angels and demons and their interaction with humans comes across as very believable. Whether you totally agree with Peretti's speculations or not, I believe the Lord has really used him to focus attention on the Bible's often-neglected teaching about spiritual warfare -- sometimes we Christians forget we're in a battle!An epic adventure that entertains as well as edifies and encourages (a little alliteration, there), This Present Darkness is a must read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Frank Peretti has a great grasp on what demons really are, and if you get nothing else from this book, you will GET the fact that demons are all around us, every day, in everything we do. Their subtle and complicated manipulations are handled deftly by Peretti as he intertwines a townful of characters to a nice and neat conclusion. You probably won't see your everyday situations in the same way, and the real value of the book is if it helps you make the right choices in those everyday situations."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I loved the story and the way it was told.

It's wonderful."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is my second time reading through \\"This Present Darkness\\" and each time I get reminded on how important the power of prayer is to our lives and spiritual survival. Peretti does a great job depicting the spiritual struggles between demons, humans, and angels. This is definitely a book that the devil does not appreciate. It is an awesome reminder that we have victory through Christ's Blood and becasue of that we can overcome the evil in this world. The books plot is not super strong, but it's the vivid reminders of spiritual warfare that makes this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book presents spiritual warfare in a digestible format. If you are struggling to understand spiritual warfare then this is a must read. If you lack prayer power and can't find the fervency to pray, this book will give you a reason to pray 24/7.

He also knows how to make a point. I feel that spiritual warfare is overlooked by many Christians. The reader must remember that this is one man's impression of what might be going on.

It is unbelievably gripping, and once you start it the pages keep turning. Although it is fiction, many of the messages and principles are very real. One can get a good spiritual boost from this book because it points out the power and importance of prayer. This book might be a little scary for sensitive people, but if you're willing to give it a try I feel confident that you will be strenthened--not to mention that it is a top notch thriller!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If you read some of my other reviews, you know I'm a Peretti fan. This was one of the first novels I read, and I really enjoyed it.This book chronicles the small college town of Ashton, and its struggling pastor Hank Busche, and local journalist Marshall Hogan. Unseen by them is the whole cool part of the story: Tal, Captain of Hosts of the Armies of God is leading a defense of the town from an attempted take-over by head demon Rafar, and his cohorts.The plot is more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it.Many people disagree with the theology of this book: humans having direct impact on the angel-demon wars by rebuking the demons by name...names, by the way, such as Lust, Fear, and Hate. It does bring the spiritual warfare side a little closer, and make you want to prayer more, but not too many people believe in this kind of conflict. But the Bible does tell us that our struggle is against the powers of darkness in the heavenly realms.It's a great action-read, and is also full of spiritual insight and teaching."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've read a lot of Frank Peretti's books. They have all healped me to believe in God more and more. A lot of devosions seem to go right into my ear and out the other, but Peretti's books set up a thrilling, fiction setting dealing with spiritual warfare.This Present Darkness, even though one of his oldest, is his best. It kept my attention the whole time. I felt like I was watching a movie. It doesn't matter where you are in life, if you're a strong christian who shows up to church every Sunday or a lukewarm christian. This book will effect anyone. My prayers have really increased ever since I finished reading this."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book, loved it, and now want to make a movie of it. There is a local town that has a college, churches, and the overall atmosphere of the town. I felt like I was reading about it while I was going through the book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This Present Darkness by Frank E. Peretti is a book I never wanted to put down. Everytime night I would read as much as I could before I had to go to bed. It has really helped me in my relationship with God. After reading this book, it is like my eyes spiritually were opened. You will never think of Angles and Demons in the same way.In the small town of Ashton everything seems to be going wrong, at least for the ones that know that something is going horriblely wrong. There are only two churches in Ashton, Ashton Community Church whoes head pastor is Henry L. Busche, and Ashton United Christian Church whoes head pastor was Oliver Young. Pastor Busche was quite new to Ashton the former pastor was run out of town, and it seemed that that was about to happen to Busche to. For he was being accused of kicking a man out of the church for commiting adulatry. Half the church was upset enought to get ride of Busche but the other half and one extra, which allowed him to stay, were either not bothered by it or not bothered enough. While that is going on Marshall Hogan, head man of the Ashton Clarion (a local newspaper) was discovering some pretty deep and dark secrets. The deeper he goes the more and more curious he gets. Everything seems to be connecting to Professor Langstrat, who teaches at the local College. She has private meetings with people, and the strange thing is they are mainly people in high power. Pastor Young is one of them. Some of the Christians have noticed that his sermons are not right and fufilling to what they need, so they go over to Pastor Busche's church. They can tell that the pressence of the Lord is there. Although Pastor Busche and Mr. Hogan find themselfs in some pretty deep trouble they keep pushing on and never giving up hope that God will perval.During the book you will be in constent wonder of what is about to happen and once the book it over you will be satisfide and in a more realization of the spirtual world that is upon us, always here and will never leave we just need to open our eyes and see the truth.I would recomend this book to anyone, but especially if you are struggling in your walk with God."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I would like to commend Peretti for his outstanding accomplishments in this book. Every page kept me on the edge of my seat. His characters were unpredictable, and, unlike many authors, he did not spend much time describing every detail of their appearance. The plot was faultless and interesting. I also believe he did a fantastic job with the demons and angels. The best part of the story, I believe, was the last page where Tal, a commanding angel, waits to hear the most frequently used phrase in the book: \\"Let's pray...\\"."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This novel will change how you think about God, demons, and angels.

There are some things about the book that seem a bit dated now, but at the time I'm sure Frank Peretti was breaking new ground in a lot of ways.This book was written at a time when the big enemy to the church seemed to be the occult, and it exercising influence in American daily life, and surreptitiously leading Christians astray; hence the main themes of the book.What this book did, that was unique in its time, was give a full-on view of the spiritual warfare that happens all around us as we fight the \\"good fight\\".I found the human characters engaging with a lot of depth. They seemed, for the most part, totally unaware of the battles raging all around them.It was very easy to root for the angelic characters, and I enjoyed seeing how Mr. Peretti described their militaristic tactics to win battles.The demonic characters were a despicable bunch, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever; as one would expect. But, they also had tactics of their own, and somehow expected victory against God's host.This book reminded me of how temporal and fleeting this life of the flesh really is. We must empower the ministering spirits that have been put in charge over us by praying and speaking words of authority in Christ.I would encourage anyone, Christian or not, to read this book.If you are looking for excellent Christian Fiction for young people, please try Vicki Silver Mysteries: \\"The Stolen Gem\\" and \\"Cruise Control\\" by Alissa Wood.Vicki Silver: The Stolen GemVicki Silver Mysteries: Cruise Control"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the very last page.

Sexism still exists, though women have more ability to move up science/math career ladders than in the present day. Same-sex relationships seem to be generally accepted, though heterosexism still exists (possibly more in older generations than younger?).Does it have explicit sex scenes?: Yes, several, all tied into the story and character development.

Pastor adds to his own important chapters contributions by six of the world's leading experts on their respective powers, e.g. China, Japan, Germany, etc. The book is clearly written and Pastor does an admirable job integrating both the contributions from the separate regional experts and the lessons from the past that aid our forecasts for the future.

As a woman, as someone who has worked to guide women over the last decade to better understand and reconnect with their bodies as a way of better understanding and valuing themselves, and as a graduate of a Master's Program in Women's Spirituality, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. In just over 140 very manageable pages, the author has brilliantly and beautifully illustrated the journey of a woman toward menopause in a way that invites the reader to re-envision her movement through and beyond midlife not as a road toward being even less valued, less beautiful and less powerful but rather, the opposite. It is informative in the physical, intellectual, spiritual and emotional realms of womanhood and ties them all together brilliantly. In fact, this recently became one of the books I recommend most to my clients and friends alike because I believe it is so important in the process of us re-envisioning ourselves and the source of our power, wisdom and beauty as women."},{"Title":"The Seven Sacred Rites of Menopause: The Spiritual Journey to the Wise-Woman Years","review":"Kristi Meisenbach Boylan's wonderful book \\"The Seven Sacred Rites of Menopause\\" has helped thousands of women cope with the emotional and physical challenges of menopause.

However, the idea is basically the same: an unrealistic, contrived and overly-romanticized story of suspense in which beautiful women, clothes, houses and scenery abound, and all the men are either handsome and rich, or brutes.This story is a playful diversion, a book you might read at the beach when you will be interrupted frequently and therefore don't want anything too serious. Its descriptions are lengthy and well-written, it's full of intrigue (and hints the attentive reader can piece together if astute), and also gives some interesting insights into the times. Certainly this is not great literature, but it's not bad as light reading.Contrary to the current feminist interpretation (which has persisted half a century and is now getting really old) that in anything written prior to the 20th century the author is making a statement about the social or economic bondage of women or their plight as second class citizens, well, is just bunk. Braddon did not believe that herself, and never once do her female characters tritely declare, \\"Oh, if only I were a man!\\" Nor do her men ever grab, maul or rape women. These stereotypes are uniformly thrust by Reviewers and English Professors onto great and mediocre novels alike, sometimes with merit and sometimes without, and serve to ruin the enjoyment of the characters for their own sake.Braddon's characters are finely, although not deeply, drawn, and present an interesting panoply of interacting styles. The heroine is surely a stereotype, but a delightfully multifaceted one. Lady Audley commits her many crimes not because she is an oppressed woman, but because she is a spoiled brat and a sociopath. She is not striving for women's liberation, her imagination could not conceive it. Rather she sells her soul for the purest forms of conventionality and social success. The cover painting, I believe, alludes not to her, but to Clara, as you will see in a fair description of that lady as the story draws to its conclusion."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Engaging book. Great expos&eacute; of nineteenth century English life. Words a a a a a a a a a a"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is a glorious story to immerse oneself! The author's approach of writing about these characters in a straight-forward factual way, gives the reader a chance to piece together the first secret that Lady Audley is keeping and eagerly I read to see what would come from the train collision confrontation that was sure to occur. Yet when it does occur, the author takes us away from that action, leaving us to find out with Robert Audley - the lawyer turned detective - what exactly is going on with Lady Audley and how many crimes did she commit to keep her secret(s). As the reader, I was intrigued by how the author makes it easy to know what is going on in the minds of the characters without actually detailing their thoughts, and I felt like this approach kept up the suspense of wanting to see the other characters realize the truth, which was strung out until almost the end.In addition to the excellent plot, there are side commentaries on the nature of women, especially their influence over men, and a strange condemnation of women's power which I found so odd because the main impetus for Lady Audley's questionable conduct came from a man. At least I think the fault of men was glossed over repeatedly, and I couldn't tell if the author meant that ironically or not. But it was very thought-provoking to think of how different the lives of many of these characters would have been if the men had made better choices. Not that Lady Audley is without fault.The writing in this novel is very precise and detailed; with a story that has so many intertwining motivations and agendas, and the author does a great job of revealing all the information at the right time without slowing down the pace. It's a highly entertaining read with characters that are complex and relatable. It's a suspenseful, pseudo-mystery (the reader often knows more than Robert Audley did) but there are still a couple plot twists in the end to make it interesting. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Very good example of a Victorian novel. I have not read Braddon before.

A quarter of the way into the novel, most readers will have already guessed Lady Audley's Secret, nevertheless, the characters have to go through the process of discovering and proving the secret.There are a few things that I thought were interesting, though some might think they were dated, such as the \\"denouncement\\" scene or the \\"attempted murder\\" scene or the \\"clean-up the mess\\" sequence of events. These scenes are classic sensational Victorian episodes that you don't see anymore in today's novels. On the other hand, there are some unexpected turns that will surprise the modern readerWhen the story comes to its happy conclusion, I can't help but feel sorry for Lady Audley. Her fate just seemed a bit extreme for my taste. This is a great novel you can toss off in a couple of days."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"It's easy to see why this tale was such a page-turner when originally written, especially since - like \\"Les Miserables\\" - it was serialized in the newspapers to hook its readership. Had this been a \\"blind\\" reading in which neither the author nor the year of publication were revealed, it could likely pass as the product of Mary Higgins Clark or other modern writers of suspense. The characters are each compelling and plausible in their own way; it's unfortunate that the made-for-TV film in 2000 couldn't do such an enjoyable story justice. The only twist I would like to have seen might have been a wicked streak on the part of George to frame his duplicitous wife for his alleged murder, then reappear in an amnesiac state shortly after her hanging. As written, the ending wrapped up a tad too neatly after such a pulse-pounding ride.Christina HamlettAuthor of Eire Apparent"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"I was very happy with the purchase of this book as I could not find it in stock at the two major bookstores in my area. It was difficult to put down. I would often find myself thinking about Lady Audley's situation while I was at work and could not wait to get back home to discover......... what was her secret? It is a hidden gem of the first water from the 1860's"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is a delightful Victorian Gothic novel, full of suspense and intrigue. Braddon's book has all of the elements of a good Victorian suspense tale: a country estate inhabited by the landed gentry, a pining lover, and a Victorian lady who is not what she seems.George Talboys arrives home from Australia to discover his wife has died. Robert Audley, seeing his friend mad with grief, brings George to Audley Court, his uncle's country estate. It is at Audley Court that Talboys mysteriously vanishes. As Robert investigates his friend's disappearance, it becomes clear that the prime suspect is the lady of the court, Robert's new aunt, Lady Audley. Beautiful and child-like, the fact that Lady Audley may be a cold-blooded murderer adds a particularly horrifying twist for a Victorian readership.Anyone who thinks that the Victorians couldn't produce a page-turner should have a look at this book. Braddon effectively creates a dark and suspenseful atmosphere. While she relies on particularly Victorian conventions to do this, such as stressing Lady Audley's hyper-femininity, the result is still sufficiently gripping, even for the modern reader."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Reviewer : N, Seattle : A classic tale that I had never read before and thoroughly enjoyed. This mystery stands with the best in the storyline, characters and resolution. I look forward to reading this again and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Mary Elizabeth Braddon (1835-1915) was a prolific novelist producing over eighty works during her long writing career in London. Braddon, along with the master of the genre Wilke Collins was a \\"sensation novelists\\". These novels combined elements of Gothic and detective fiction to make for popular novels. The sensation brings mystery and murder into respectable middle class homes making them shocking. Sex and unusual heroines also feature in these books.Lady Audley's Secret is Braddon's most famous work. It was published in 1862 becoming a bestseller in all classes of British society from the very rich and literary to the very poor. The novel is still fascinating to us in the 21st century.The Plot: Lucy Graham is a poor governess working for a doctor who catches the eye of the much older aristocrat Sir Michael Audley. Lucy is a fetching woman who possesses golden curls, a beautiful complexion and eyes as blue and deep as the ocean. Her cousin the lazy barrister Robert Audley is infatuated with Lucy disdaining the love of Alicia Audley the simple and sweet daughter of Sir Michael by h is first wife. Robert will later meet the woman of his dreams in the person of Clara Talboys the regal sister of his missing friend George.Robert's best friend is George Talboys who has made a fortune in the mines of Australia. While on a fishing jaunt George comes up missing. The search for George and the various revelations about his relationship with Lucy Graham Audley is the fuel which drives the complex plot. Robert learns that Lucy was George's wife at which time she was known as Helen. She and George were the parents of little Georgie. Lucy fled from George to search for wealth and comfort in a rich man's home. She becomes a bigamist when she weds old Audley. When George returns to confront Lucy it is believed, by Robert, that she murdered him throwing him into an old well on the estate. Phoebe Marks and her stupid oaf of a husband Luke own a bar with money given them for the venture by Lady Audley. Why do they have a hold over her so that the fetching woman gives them money? Another mystery for Robert to solve. Who was involved in the conspiracy against George Talboys?Is George alive or dead? Is Lucy a murderess and mad? To reveal the answer to these various questions is to spoil the reading experience for first time perusers of this excellent novel. Mrs Braddon writes in an easy to comprehend style accessible to modern readers. The book is fast paced, complex and keeps you guessing as to what will happen next. It is a true Whodunit? This is one of the greatest of the sensation novels and is a treat!Enjoy it and enter the world of Mary Elizabeth Braddon an excellent author!"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"The cover description of this novel grabbed my interest when I saw it in the bookstore, so I decided to give it a try. It's the first book I have struggled with in a while. And it's not because it's hard to read; far from it. The characters are, simply put, not interesting. I didn't care for a single one of them, not even the &quot;detective&quot; of the story, Robert Audley, or the &quot;enchanting&quot; and &quot;mysterious&quot; heroine herself, Lady Audley. There was some good bits of suspense, and a few bits of mystery, but because of the flat characters this really did little to compensate."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"I enjoyed \\"hearing\\" this book. The story itself is entertaining although you can figure out the plot quite quickly. I think what mad it best for me was Juliet Stevenson's narration. She played the characters well. I will look for her in other books. I love English Victorian books. I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Well, I do believe it has become some sort of a duty I feel I must fulfill, since reading this book, to let anyone who may consider reading it know, (that is, unless they must read it for a class, in which case they must just be strong, such as Jesus* acted upon learning he must die for all of our wicked ways, and trudge along warily), that this book is unadulterated soap-opera drivel, which, clearly, must be avoided at all costs. While the plot may be quite entertaining for a moment here and a paragraph there, in the hands of another writer, such as Oscar Wilde, who satirized and poked fun at this style of popular three-volume sensation rubbish in his excellent \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\", could have been a quite good read. Instead, we must wade slowly through the shallow rivers of lofty verbiage, forcing ourselves to stay awake at nights book in hand, shuddering at the mere thought of having read just one of two thirds of it and already knowing what will happen in the most predictable ending. Many people seem to enjoy this meaningless refuse, which only proves, such as I've expected many times before, that the masses clearly have no idea what's good and, of course, what isn't.*See \\"The New Testament\\""},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"The 1860s in England saw the boom of \\"sensation novels\\" which is best represented by the gripping thrillers \\"The Woman in White\\" and \\"The Moonstone,\\" written by Wilkie Collins. Immediately after the success of the former one, Mary Elizabeth Braddon wrote \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" which also became an instant bestseller, quickly making her a celebrity. But, in more than one sense, as you see later.The story of Braddon's book is clearly inspired by Collins's \\"The Woman in White\\" (especially by Laura's story), but it is quite unfair to call \\"Lady Audley\\" a poor imitation. (And remember, Collins's story is also said to be based on a French book recording actual crime cases). Lady Audley takes a more defying view on the Victorians, roles of women in particular, and that's the real reason she was such a \\"sensation,\\" and is again getting our attention now.The story goes like this: Lucy, a governess without family, is loved by Sir Michael Audley, a rich landowner of Audley Court, Essex, and marries him to the chagrin of some people who look at her as an adventuress. No matter how people think, however, they are living happily.In the meanwhile, George Talboys, after his long, hard days in Australia searching for goldmine, finally comes back to London, after many years, with money to make his wife happy. But when he encountered his old friend Robert Audley, nephew of Sir Michael, he accidentally knows that his beloved wife is no longer alive.Those two seemingly unrelated events begin to get entangled after George's sudden missing. Robert starts his own investigation, as if beckoned by a fate, and he, collecting evidences, gradually comes to one inevitable conclusion.And ... let me say this first; \\"Lady Audley\\" is an absorbing book, but absorbing not in the way a good detective story is. The \\"secret\\" in point is, one often mistakes, NOT the secret you can easily discover in the early stage of the plot. (You must wait to see the nature of Lady's secret at the end of the book, which is still controversial.) The story is melodramatic and sometimes predictable, but the real virtue of the book is the portrait of the strong-willed heroine, who dares to challenge the social codes of women in Victorian era.The book is full of action that you might find in any potboilers, shocking for the comtemporary people, which includes: murder, arson, secret passage, blackmail, you name it. But the way Braddon handles them is always steady and well-controlled, and at some places they look unexpectedly modern, reading like a movie script, anticipating the cinematic treatment in the early 20th century (this had been made into films three times in silent-film days, and once on TV even in 2000) Her book has many flaws, surely, but should be never called dull.Mary Elizabeth Braddon, when she was working on this book, was living with John Maxwell, ambitious publisher in debt, and she was the main provider of income. While living together (and John was still married to another woman in asylum, which makes an interesting parallel with George Eliot), she wrote with a frantic speed. Through 1861-62, when she wrote \\"Lady Audley's Secret,\\" -- and she was also writing for cheaper periodicals under false name! -- Braddon confesses that she wrote the Third Book (the final third part) of the \\"Lady Audley\\" in a fortnight. Considering the fact, the book is incredibly tight, and infallibly engaging."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"I read this for a Victorian literature class, and sandwiched as it was between the imposing density of Middlemarch and Dickens, it was a real holiday. &quot;Lady Audley&quot; was written for pure narrative pleasure, and it delivers big-time. I had no idea Victorian literature could be this tantalizing. It's really kind of trashy, falling into the sensational genre, but don't let that deter you - it'll keep you up at night AND provide the romantic bygone otherness of say, a Jane Austen novel. It's also an interesting window into Victorian femininity, undermining as it does the ideal of the passive angel in the house, and replacing her with a kind of femme fatale anti-heroine. (Everyone in my class enjoyed it, even the whingers who typically bemoan everything on the reading list.) A really good read."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"One of the most widely read murder mysteries of the 19th century is still a worthwhile adventure today. Mary E. Braddon delivers a thoughtful masterpiece of suspense. After craftily engaging her reader, Braddon gives one the illusion of knowledge. We begin to believe that we know and understand the &quot;secret&quot; and are simply waiting for the mystery to unfold. Yet beware! We are not as knowing as we think, the text is not as simple as it appears. Full of exciting twists and unnerving psychological profiles, _Lady Audley's Secret_ is a must-read thriller! As a birdseye view of Victorian England, it is superb. As a literary lesson in character development, it is unmatched. As an intriguing, can't-put-it-down plot, it is excellent. In a word, it is timeless"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"...I was suprised at how much I liked this book. I am not one for Victorian \\"sensationalists\\" preferring swashbuckling but Miss Braddon (as she was then called) is a great writer who gives explainations for her character's wild behavior. Considered quite a trashy novelist in her day, her stories are much tamer than what is on network television.Read, enjoy this escapist novel"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"A very readable Victorian mystery, I guess it would qualify in today's market as a cozy. I understand that Braddon was influenced by Wilke Collins, and therefore it is advantageous to also read The Woman in White, a generally more complex novel.In any case, the first half of Lady Audley's Secret is compelling in its set-up of the mystery that follows, and I read it very quickly as it kept calling me back to it. The rest of the book, while still interesting, is spent observing the Lady's nephew (through marriage) as he attempts to discover the circumstances of the disappearance of his good friend which he believes is related to the Lady's &quot;secret.&quot; The reader easily guesses much of the circumstance of the novel, although it's not quite as simple as it appears. It is also important to note that Braddon plots rather deftly and she savors the development of the novel's progression.I did have some trouble getting through the last 100 pages of the book, as there was very little left for the reader to do but follow around the nephew's movements as he attempted to prove his theory. And, while Braddon does offer a twist at the end, it is not entirely unexpected, and so is not as effective as it could have been. Still, there is much to like about this book; in contains all the elements of Victorian society and, as such, has several layers within which it serves its audience. Not a must read, but if you're interested in Victorian literature, this is a book which was a sensation during the author's lifetime and may well be worth a look into."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"It's unfortunate that opinions regarding the story, Braddon's style, and/or Victorian novels in general make the little star rankings lower for this particular edition.

A marvelous read - you will enjoy it if you like Victorian novels."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"During Mary Elizabeth Braddon's lifetime, she was most famous for the convoluted plots she hatched, and she hatched a nestful, publishing more than eighty novels. (She was also famous for living what was then considered a 'scandalous' life, and for having many of the major characters in her books do the same.)But when Thackery said, &quot;If I could plot like Mrs. Braddon, I should be the greatest novelist in the world,&quot; I don't think he meant it as a compliment. I think he was saying that she herself would be a great novelist, if only she could WRITE!That's the catch with this book, for example. The characters are memorable, the plot is extravagantly complex, the insights into what makes society tick, or not, are right on the money. But the writing style . . . well, to put it simply, there isn't any. No consistent Point of View. No deft turns of phrase. There isn't a sentence you'd care to quote anywhere in the book.If only there had been a Hollywood in her day! She'd have been a great screenplay writer, where style doesn't matter. That's why the story makes good movies and TV specials, and that's why it has long since dropped out of sight as a book.I sought it and read it because of a recent PBS 'Mystery!' presentation. It seemed so far ahead of its time in dealing with what we now call &quot;Women's Issues&quot; that I assumed-- wrongly, as it turns out-- that its disapearance from literary history was due to a backlash against its view of societal injustice. Well, that view was inserted by the people who wrote the screenplay for the BBC production that became the PBS special. It isn't in the book. The author totally condemns her central character and has no particular sympathy for her at all. It took a modern scriptwriter to discover that the story could be used as a metaphor for the oppression of women.No, I'm afraid that the reason for the book's disappearance from literary history is that it doesn't qualify as literature. Wilkie Collins' famous 'The Woman in White' explores basically the same theme, but does it with verve and style. In comparison, &quot;Lady Audley's Secret&quot; is flat and colorless. Any well-educated eighth grader could have done better.I give the book three stars nevertheless, for its characters and plot-- which are fabulous, in both meanings of that word."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"I read three Tasha Alexander novels with a wonderful character, Lady Emily Ashton.

I had never heard of the book and decided if Lady Emily Ashton loved it, it must be good! :) Thank You, Tasha Alexander, the author of those three books.I just finished Lady Audley's Secret and must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it. While parts of the book were somewhat wordy, the characters, plot and ending were fabulous. Lady Lucy Audley was easy to dislike.... A perfectly wretched and evil woman. Barrister Robert was easy to like even though he was lazy and took his life and position for granted. Baronet Michael was easy to see as blind/naive/lovestruck/foolish, but who wouldn't want a husband who adored you so much? He was such a mensch. George was.....interesting? Sometimes a bit high strung (the passage from Australia...can you say HYPER??) and somewhat depressing to be around (poor Robert!) And the plot held me until the end.....which I loved. The book's ending made me sigh and smile. I like that. It ended just as I wanted it to...which almost never happens for me.\\"Lady Audley's Secret\\" was an unexpected delight and I'm happy I read it.

After exhausting Wilkie Collins's collection of major works I hungered for something which would leave me again in page-turning heaven. So off I went to read this first and most famous work of Mary Elizabeth Braddon.Lady Audley's Secret left me disappointed overall. Oh its story of deep secrets, cunning, and hunger for lower class individuals wanting a piece of the aristocracy pie is rather interesting; Wilkie Collins would have approved. But unlike Wilkie Collins, Ms. Braddon doesn't have the gift of writing rich prose. While certainly easy to read, Lady Audley's Secret feels &quot;low calorie&quot; compared to the sumptuous works of Wilkie Collins. It left me wanting more.Wilkie Collins addicts will find Lady Audley's secret to be nothing more than a mild diversion. For those who have not experienced the likes of The Woman in White ... what are you waiting for?!? However for those who find the works of Wilkie Collins to be overly complex and cumbersome, Lady Audley's Secret should make for a fun read on a rainy day."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"One of the better sensationalist novels of the time, Lady Audley's Secret has all the various elements that make up this type of novel: a beautiful mysterious woman, investigations, intrigue, insanity, strange, odd experiences, blackmail, confessions, deception, and plot twists.Some critics have said that Braddon's prose isn't anything special. I tend to disagree. Braddon has an uncanny ability in Lady Audley's Secret to take the narrative into characters thoughts and insights as if they were \\"thinking aloud\\", which gives a little variance to the novel and adds a dimension that you couldn't get in the ordinary third person narration. This way the character's motive is revealed in a short monologue, and then shifts back to regular dialogue with other characters present. We see this often with the principle characters of the book, Lady Audley and Robert Audley, as we hear their inner musings about the other.Sensational novels put more emphasis on plot than on character, and this is evident in Lady Audley's Secret, but Braddon is able to do plenty with her major characters. One interesting quality is the way she takes the notion of the \\"blue eyed wax doll\\" female and turns it on its head. The funny angle to this is that Alicia Audley, Robert's cousin, who is disgusted and perhaps envious of Lady Audley's mannerisms, beauty and perfect charm constantly refers to her as this childish \`doll', which is a bit of an irony. Robert Audley, the other central character, is quite reminiscent of the typical worthy protagonist, but who is not faultless. At times, he seems to brood a little too much about the negativity of the world and his task he must do, but still he is a great leading character as we move along in the mystery. Neither characters are very deep so to speak, but they are entertaining to keep track of as the plot moves along.As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a tough book to review simply because giving plot details might spoil the read for others. I really enjoyed the amateur sleuth work of Robert Audley as he investigates the disappearance of his friend, George Talboys. This noble young man takes on the task of discovering what happened, but the puzzle gets more complicated the deeper he goes into his investigation, which is really Wilkie Collins\\"esque\\".As the book gives away in its title, there is a secret that is to be shared that lends much to the story's conclusion. But, I don't think that the secret is the same one that we think it is, and I would venture to say that there are actually two secrets in this novel that are of critical importance.A great novel, my first read of Mary Elizabeth Braddon, but I look forward to others!4 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"This book is a wonderful forgotten gem.

Today, of course, we would be more likely to call it a \\"thriller,\\" or a \\"mystery,\\" but that original term is important not only because it belongs to 1860s Victorian literature, but also because it maintains a connection back to the eighteenth century and the novel of sensibility that made made this kind of work possible in the first place. \\"Sensation\\" and \\"sensibility\\" refer to a novel's ability to provoke emotions in the reader, and certainly Lady Audley's Secret promises to draw us in as readers from the opening pages. Given these influences, Braddon plays self-consciously with the expectations of the nineteenth-century reader for much of the book, drawing especially from the conventions of the Gothic novel in ways that cleverly (and in a more indirect, subtle way than in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey) make fun of this fictional formula. Since most readers today are not familiar with the literature of that era, many of those references will be overlooked or misunderstood. Happily, the plot does not rely on them for advancement.The story itself follows the laconic barrister Robert Audley, whose friend George Talboys has just returned from colonial Australia as a rich man, having found success on the goldfields there. Upon his return, George discovers that the wife he had left behind in England has just died, news that sends him into a deep and lasting depression. When George disappears suddenly, leaving only a note that he has decided to return to Australia, Robert becomes increasingly suspicious that George has in fact been murdered. Robert finds his investigations hampered by his rich uncle's new wife, Lady Audley, a beautiful young woman who seems to have something to hide.Braddon's narrative is smooth and well-written, and she does a good job of drawing readers into the book's core mystery. But as with any such narrative, the ultimate success of the work depends on the pay-off, and this is where the novel is inevitably going to fall short for the modern reader. The canny reader will quickly work out the most obvious of Lady Audley's secrets, but she does have more than one, and when our detective-protagonist in Robert discovers this deeper truth the novel seems to shrink unimpressively from the spirit of subversion that marked its opening pages. So strong are the moral conventions of the Victorian that Braddon does not dare to challenge them directly. It's not hard to see why - just look at the lashing Thomas Hardy received some thirty years later for the directness of Jude the Obscure - but ultimately it does leave today's reader feeling a bit let down. Braddon's ending does manage to impart some hidden barbs at being forced into this ending, but they are subtle and easy to overlook, and certainly my graduate students did not feel that they rescued the text from disappointment.Despite this inherent sense of disappointment, I would still highly recommend this book to those who are willing to look past their contemporary expectations and understand this work within its context. It is a very easy and engaging read for a classic work of literature, and while Braddon will not go down as one of the great Victorian writers, this particular work nonetheless does deserve its place as a landmark piece of genre fiction."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Although a contemporary of both Dickens and Trollope, I found M.E.

I will not reveal anymore and spoil the read. I am looking forward to seeing the movie based on the book. ENJOY!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Perhaps I have watched too many episodes of \\"Deadly Women\\", but what haunts me only minutes after finishing this fascinating novel is how beauty and charm can turn an otherwise normal person into a monster. I'm not sure I would go so far as to say that Lady Audley is mad--regardless of the condition of her own mother--but certainly she is deluded and mentally ill at the end. No doubt in today's world she would be treated with therapy and medication before being labeled \\"mad\\" and tossed into a psychiatric institution.I wonder if it started when she was young and learned how her beauty gave her a veneer of goodness that induced everyone to love and trust her. No doubt after accepting the accolades thrown her way all her life she would begin to believe herself deserving of them, and thus find it unacceptable to live in poverty with the lower dregs of society, especially after being deserted by her husband, who seemed to think it reasonable to leave her alone to struggle to support herself and their child, perhaps forever.It bothers me that the character of George Talboys is somewhat glossed over in this story. He does desert his wife and child, promising never to return unless he can do so with a fortune. Does he indeed expect his wife to toil in poverty forever in the hope that he will return when he did not even give her that assurance in his own farewell letter? He is himself a very impulsive and callous man to have left her so cruelly and then returned with every expectation of finding her the same as the day he left. He was, of course, misled by her beauty into believing her character to be as virtuous as that of a saint, even though he had some inkling prior to his departure that it was not.In all honesty, I did not fault the lady for marrying to advantage when she did, under the circumstances in which she was left. How could she know whether George was dead or would ever return? I did have some qualms over her own desertion of her son, but the worst of her \\"madness\\" seems to occur when she is confronted with the past and becomes desperate to bury it forever, no matter what the cost. And by that time, she has become a monster.It begs the question of what would have happened had George Talboys never returned. She does seem to have made Lord Audley a very happy man (although deluded, but many people live happily in the face of such delusion), and although his daughter never fell victim to her charm, there was no open antagonism. Would Lady Audley's true character have been revealed in the end had her previous marriage never become known? I'm thinking she had some justification in her anger at George Talboys for condemning her actions without acknowledging his own, and that the author is unfair to let him escape relatively unscathed from the situation.Still, his sin stemmed from navet&eacute; more than cruelty, and her desperation to avoid the consequences of her actions made her willing to destroy anyone who stood in her way. But how large a part did his desertion play in turning her into this Lady Macbeth-like character? I suppose in Victorian times it was easy to assume that evil--or madness--arises from heredity (a \\"bad seed,\\" so to speak) and thus not cast any responsibility on circumstances or society, but I cannot do so. As long as society worships beautiful women and turns a blind eye to the cruelty of men, such \\"black widows\\" and \\"deadly women\\" will emerge to shock us with their villainy."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Lady Audley's Secret isn't much of a secret, really. Early in the book it was obvious what the \\"secret\\" was; and although I kept expecting some surprising twist, it never came. Although there was a \\"surprise\\" at the very end, by the time it was finally revealed it wasn't much of a surprise.Ok, so I've told you what the book isn't; now I will tell you what it is. It is a vivid glimpse at genteel English society in the mid-19th century. Braddon tells her story in a slow, detailed fashion; her descriptions of the various settings are particularly well done. The book is episodic in style, with each chapter telling its own short story and ending in a slight cliff-hanger that makes you want to turn the page and keep reading. This is no doubt due to the fact that the book was originally published as a magazine serial, probably with each chapter being an installment. Braddon keeps her story from being superficial or over-melodramatic by her in-depth probe of nearly every character. The various characters come under her microscope, where she examines and reveals their thoughts, feelings and motives in a thorough and thoughtful way.Besides the lack of any real mystery, the only other weakness I found was the sometimes-shifting POV and tense. Most of the book is told in the third person; however, this occasionally shifts, as the narrator seemingly turns to the reader and begins talking in the first person, still telling the story as a third person but using the pronoun \\"I.\\" Also, the book is told entirely in the past tense except for a few paragraphs near the end where it suddenly shifts to present tense and then just as suddenly shifts back to past tense.I didn't find any of these errors to be huge or glaring; the main reason I am giving the book only 3 stars is because, when all was said and done, it just wasn't all that compelling. Although it was a nice story, it was just that: \\"nice\\", but pretty forgettable and not one I'll ever read again.I'd recommend this book for devotees of Victorian literature."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"In Lady Audley's Secret, Sir Michael Audley marries Lucy Graham, a governess. She's a fragile-looking young woman of about 20 or so, whose outside appearance belies the deep, dark secret she'll do anything to protect. But when a young man named George Talboys goes missing, his friend Robert Audley steps in and resolves to figure out what happened to him. Robert, a dissolute barrister, has a strong suspicion that his step-aunt is connected to his friend's disappearance.I'm not going to give away (much) here, because it would spoil virtually the whole book and a lot of the enjoyment that goes with this reading experience, but suffice it to say that this novel was one of the great works of Victorian sensationalist novels that were published in the 1860s. It was sensationalist because it took the ideals of Victorian family-hood and turned them upside-down: it was nearly inconceivable that a woman could be capable of the acts that Lady Audley perpetrates here. Even today, this novel is still fascinating, filled with ghosts and murder and arson and bigamy. Braddon displays a wide range of outside knowledge, from Classical literature to literature of the time (she even mentions Wilkie Collins, to whose The Woman in White this novel is probably indebted), to history (the English Civil War), current events (the US Civil War), and beyond.The author tends to be melodramatic, which turned me off a bit, and her writing style just isn't that good (Braddon tended to write in fragmented sentences). But the story itself sucked me in, and after reading a few pages, I knew that I just had to read the rest. Its definitely true that Braddon is the master of writing plot, and everything ties together perfectly. While considered trashy in the 1860s, the novel contains a strong statement about women's roles in Victorian England."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"I first bought this book for my mother. She loved it so much she bought a copy for me and nagged me to read it.I am not the greatest admirer of Victorian English literature.

It was a great time. It is one of those books you look forward to reading while doing others things. When you get the chance, you'll read it no matter if you have ten minutes or a full day to yourself.I recommend this to all the Wilkie Collins fans, to all the Gothic readers and sensation seekers.

It is not &quot;Gothic &quot; as it is a mystery. There are no supernatural elements. However, it manages to creat appropriate mood and suspense and builds a web of mystery around its main character. The story is interesting to follow and it is also of interest to note how Braddon comments on the lower and upper classes of England. England of course being the usual location for such mysterious goings-ons! The story was put to the screen on PBS' Mystery Series. Also other good recommendations are The Woman in White and the Wyvern Mystery.

The only thing I think you should be warned about is that the mystery only encompasses maybe 2/3rds of the novel... there is a lot of build up and a lot of wind down, and although it won't be revealed here, I was disappointed with the ending. Anywho, what I *DID* enjoy was the way the main character (who doubled as the detective) didn't blindly solve his crimes, even once he'd come to a conclusion. He took the consideration and time to consider all the factors of the situation and how they would effect the people he loved, and made the right decision based on that.

Finally, I read it and I am very glad i did. Although you can figure the secret out pretty far in advance, the fact that the narrator/investigator spends the time trying to PROVE his solution to himself shows what a marvelous work this is. He doesn't go wildly off into the night telling anyone, he tries to get the lady to tell her husband of her own will. the slight touch of romance, and deep sense of justice and mystery lend this book to a long weekend's worth of reading."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Lady Audley's Secret is a wonderful novel, worthy of all the praise in these reviews.

The story was written very elegantly, with some very witty descriptions that I certainly found interesting and amusing. A bonus was that she used a nice handful of uncommon words, words that, although I've read many classics and Victorian era novels, I was completely unfamiliar with; so along with being a entertaining story, it was also a bit of a learning experience for me, and I LOVED that. I am a bit of a word-nerd, so excuse me if I was thrilled to learn that the word \\"ratiocination\\" means \\"the process of exact thinking.\\"Another pleasing element of this book was the way the character young Robert Audley developed as the tale progressed. He began as a care-for-nothing sort of man, then was stirred by meeting a lost friend, then was changed dramatically into a thoughtful man after George Talboys goes missing, to a clever and active man as he puzzles together the mystery, to a passionate man in love. I was practically in love with the fellow myself by the end of the book! Braddon really did a wonderful job portraying the character evolution of Mr. Audley, and it was the highlight of the novel.I was also pleased with the happy ending of the book; it made for a very satisfying finish that left me sighing and leaning back in my chair with a smile, eyes closed, envisioning it."},{"Title":"Lady Audley's Secret (Penguin Classics)","review":"Since this is one of those books that to tell too much of the story would ruin it, I'm only giving you the bare bones.

Braddon's style was very light and readable, not as heavy handed as some 19C authors can be and I really enjoyed her descriptions of the settings, particularly the very very old Audley Court and its grounds.

I will go with them. Anyway, onward and upward...the NASB Scofield is here, as a continuation of Oxford's augmenting of the original Scofield Bible, the 'original' of which(1917) has a cult-following among Independent, fundamental Baptists. So far, the Bible has been printed in KJV, NKJV, NIV, NAS, ESV, and the HCSB will be out in 2007( Note, March, 2007: the HCSB Scofield is out an in stores---all thumb indexed. :-( ). Oxford has done a monumental job, in my opinion, providing a great reference Bible in all the popular translations. I am reviewing the NASB Scofield in Burgundy genuine leather, which is a royal red Berkshire leather, very handsome, and a beautiful shade of darkish-red. Oxford Bibles are smyth-sewn, and will last. They are printed in Korea, and the Koreans only sew the bindings. The print is 9-point and nice. My only gripe with the print is the horrendous shade of red used in the New Testament---it is fire-engine red and hard to read. Eye doctors will tell you that red print is NOT good on the eyes, and I believe it. Oxford has withdrawn the NKJV Scofield Black Letter Bible, unfortunately. Anyway, these new Scofields greatly augment the original Scofield notes with needed charts, intext maps, and helps from soup to nuts. This is a Bible worth having in a very good, formal-equivalence translation. It is a quality product---won't fall apart on you and the bindings won't crack. This is a good investment, and an excellent tool to study the Word."},{"Title":"The Scofield Study Bible III: New American Standard Bible","review":"As any true student of the Bible knows, the languages of the Bible cannot be perfectly translated \\"word for word\\" into English. Additionally, just as in English a word may have various definitions based on the context, the same is true with Greek and Hebrew. Many schollars agree that the NASB is about as close as one can come to a true word for word translation. Having a good word for word translation of the Bible is essential for any serious Bible sudent.The causual reader will find this translation very easy to read, using modern English, but should have the understanding that there are a few passages where the full intent of the writer could not be fully expressed. Additionally, beacuase some words may have more than one possible definition, disagreement exists as to what the writer may have intended to say in a few passages. None of this changes the over all message of the Bible.If one wants to unlock some of the deeper meanings of the orginal languages, they should invest in a good Greek and Hebrew concordance as well, such as Strongs Exhaustive Concordance. You can even get a copy of the NASB with Stongs numbers. Vines Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words is also a good book to have.Any Bible claiming to be a 'traslation' that does not follow 'word for word', is really not a translation at all, but a paraphrase.The best paraphase Bible that you can get would be the Amplified Bible by the Lockman Foudnation which clearly marks words that have been added, (not translated), as well as alternate readings of the origninal languges in order to assist the reader in understanding the original writers full intent.Scofields notes present a popular premillennial view of Biblical prophecy which most evangelicals hold to be the correct view. That said, I have yet to find two students of the Bible who agree 100% with everything Scofield wrote.Other popular study Bibles go way over the top on their commentary and references making them hard to read. If I want a commentary, I'll by a commentary. When I sit down to read the Bible, I want to read the Bible. Scofield provides just enough notes and references to provide a better degree of clarity, without filling half of each page with commentary. That's why this reference Bible has remained so popular for so many years.All things considered, and many would agree, this is the best study Bible you can get.This Bible is bound with bonded leather, while not as good as genuine leather, is also much less expensive and is quite durable."},{"Title":"The Scofield Study Bible III: New American Standard Bible","review":"At the outset, recognize that different readers want different Bibles. E.g., a reader may want a coffee-table Bible, a devotional Bible, or a study Bible. The reader may want a Bible that gives the interpretation of a passage (regardless of the passage's literal language); or, the reader may want the Bible to translate the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic accurately, and to make up his or her own mind about the passage's meaning. One reader may be distressed if language favors the male gender; another reader may be distressed if the publisher changes the Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic canon text to make language more gender-neutral.This review assumes the reader wants an Updated NASB Bible. The Updated NASB Bible: (i) translates the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic literally; and (ii) follows the canon text with respect to gender. If the reader wants a Bible that gives a passage's interpretation, rather than the passage's literal translation, that reader may be happier with a Message Bible (or similar Bible), which gives a modern paraphrase of the literal translation. If the reader wants gender-neutral language, the reader may be happier with a New Revised Standard Version, which uses inclusive pronouns.First, the pluses of the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible.This Bible is beautiful. The leather is of excellent quality. The gold leaf is flawless. The pages are neatly-arranged, and the arrangement renders the Bible very user-friendly. The print is somewhat larger than the print of competing study Bibles, making the Scofield Bible more convenient for those with poor eyesight.Second, the minuses.Where New Testament language quotes a passage from the Old Testament, the NASB translation emphasizes the reference by using a different typeface: small capitalized letters. This is an excellent feature. However, inexplicably, Scofield rarely identifies the Old Testament passage that is being quoted. The reader is left frustrated, knowing that the small-caps language quotes an Old Testament passage, but with no convenient way to locate the passage being quoted (forcing the reader to do what I am doing: have both a Scofield Study Bible and a Zondervan Study Bible in front of him or her, and read the two together-a time-consuming, bulky, and expensive method that calls into question the rationale for buying the Scofield Bible in the first place).Also, the quality of Scofield's footnotes varies wildly. I bought the Scofield Bible because I compared its notes on one particular topic with the notes of competing Bibles, and found Scofield's notes to be more helpful than the others. I assumed that Scofield's superiority on that one topic would carry through the rest of the Scofield Bible.That assumption was incorrect.Some text that desperately needs extensive footnoting has little or none (which is probably how Scofield could produce a study Bible about the same size as a comparable Zondervan Study Bible but with larger print). As one example, Scofield has four notes in Mark explaining the Olivet Discourse; Zondervan has 29.Some notes are poorly-written. As one example, the note describing Judas Iscariot in connection with Matthew 26:14 says Judas was \\"One of the twelve disciples of Jesus who betrayed Him.\\" The note implies that there were more than 12 disciples, 12 disciples betrayed Jesus, and Judas was one of the 12 who betrayed Him. The note should read (simply to be grammatically correct, and without regard to the additional information the note would need in order to be more nearly accurate and complete), \\"One of the 12 disciples of Jesus; the disciple who betrayed Him.\\"Some footnotes contain interpretations that are simply incorrect. As one example, recall the Parable of the Landowner. In that parable, a landowner walls off his property, installs a grape press, and leases the property to vine-growers. The landowner sends a slave to collect the rents; the vine-growers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed. The same scene is repeated multiple times; the vine-growers beat some of the slaves, and kill others. Finally, the landowner sends his son. The vine-growers kill the son. Plainly, the landowner in the parable is God. The slaves are the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist. The landowner's son is Jesus. The vine-growers are the Pharisees (and presumably the Sadducees and Herodians). But, the note to Mark 12:1 maintains that \\"the vine-growers . . . are the O.T. prophets and John the Baptist.\\" I.e., according to the note, the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist-not the Pharisees (and Sadducees and Herodians)-persecuted Jesus and caused him to be crucified.Scofield's sloppiness and errors, such as those described in the examples above, render its notes on less-clear parables, discourses, and other material highly suspect.In short, while the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible may have some usefulness in one's library, and is certainly beautiful, the serious student would be better off buying a Bible with better references, more notes, and better note scholarship._______________"},{"Title":"The Scofield Study Bible III: New American Standard Bible","review":"I ordered this for my son, and it was just what he wanted and is very pleased with the bible."},{"Title":"It was on fire when I lay down on it","review":"With great wit and gentle grace, Robert Fulgham holds up a mirror so that we may see ourselves and our foiables more clearly.

There are, however, many fine pieces in this collection (including one commenting on the theme of his first book that is brutally honest). The mood is a bit darker in this second volume, but that is not meant as a perjorative description, it merely means that Fulghum shows a different side to his ponderings. If you liked his first book, you will like this one.

He is my mentor - the reason I began writing my first book that got its first contract. This book is almost funnier and better than the one before, if that's even possible, but only almost. This book inspired me and made me think, made me cry, and made me laugh. You can't ask for a better read than that!The title piece of the book talks about a man who was interviewed by the news for a house fire. The question posed to the man was how the fire, which was in the bedroom, from the mattress, had started. The man had answered that he didn't know how the fire had started, since the bed was in fire when he lay down on it. Mr. Fulghum talks about how we do that, sometimes: lay down on burning beds. This is, of course, a metaphor for us making poor decisions, decisions not in our best interests, when we know this is the case when we're making them.And that is the best example of what Mr. Fulghum's writing in all his essays and books I've read have been, including this book. It Was on Fire When I lay Down on It is a series of poignant memoir-style essays, each with their own metaphorical 'lesson' or moral to them... some are touching and moving while others are giggle and snort funny, but all of them speak to a bigger picture or a deeper meaning if you're willing to look beyond the implied. Well worth the read.I agree with some about his attitude about dogs. I am a dog lover. My Jake is my son, my furry fur-legged brat dog and I love him dearly, but I can't see discrediting an entire man and his entire library or work and contributions to literature, reading, faith and humor just because his opinions differ from mine on one point. The stories he tells are not graphic in nature about his dislike of dogs, so I take those with a grain of salt and move on to the other more poignant things with which I can relate. I will never agree 100% with anyone on everything, and this is simply a point of division in mind between me and Mr. Fulghum. To stop reading him for his personal opinions when he is doing no physical damage (it's just opinion), is something I'm not wont to do."},{"Title":"It was on fire when I lay down on it","review":"This was my first introduction to Robert Fulghum and meeting this humorous man was truely enjoyable.

I have virtually no marks in this book. It reminds me of the communicators who know how to play with an audience's emotions, but when they're gone, there's no substance. This book will move you emotionally, but it doesn't really leave you any better off in the long run.Fulghum has the gift of communication. He can tickle your emotions, but he just doesn't say much when he's through. His book is full of personal anecdotes. Nothing wrong with that, per se. A lot of storytellers have made a fine living that way. If that's what you want, escapism, then you'll find it in this book. It's just that Fulghum and I apparently don't have the same worldview or appreciation for the same things."},{"Title":"It was on fire when I lay down on it","review":"This book has touched me more than any other one I've ever read. I sometimes refer to it as my personal bible. Fulghum's ideas on the simple things in life always give me hope that life isn't as bad as I sometimes think it is. This book will make you think about things in a different way. Personally, I carry it with me wherever I go and use the stories to apply to some of the hardest subjects in life."},{"Title":"It was on fire when I lay down on it","review":"I started reading this book on an airplane...and in some ways I wish I hadn't. I was laughing and laughing at the sheer unexpectedness of this book, shaking the entire row with my convulsions. I think some were trying to figure out if I were laughing or crying, as I had tears running down my cheeks. The stories were a total surprise to me, for I didn't buy this book for the humor. I actually bought it because a friend had told me one extremely meaningful story out of the book, regarding the meaning of life. In essence, this story-ette is about a priest and his meaning of life, and a small mirror...he believes the meaning of life is to bring light to dark places, a game he used to play when he was a kid with sunlight and a mirror. That game has become a metaphor for his life. So I bought the book for that reason, for a few little pages. But now 1/2 way through the book, it has entertained me way more than expected.The book is written in article form, with each story-ette lasting 3 to 7 pages, so it makes for excellent bedtime reading. FYI, this book and the writing remind me of Bill Bryson, and his writing style."},{"Title":"It was on fire when I lay down on it","review":"I must confess that, when I heard that this was a bestselling collection of inspirational anecdotes and essays by a minister, I was prepared to be skeptical. I was expecting oversimplifications, sentimentality and proselytizing.In fact I found myself moved to laughter and sadness.It is indeed written in simple language, but it is the simplicity of the clever writer. Fulghum quotes from Horace in Latin and from the Septuagint in Greek, and describes attending a talk on chaos theory at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, but makes it all sound plain and easy.He mentions \\"Apocalypse Now\\" but not the Book of Revelations. He is a long way from original sin and Calvinism. I think the central message is that there is much good in people and you can bring it out by being patient and being nice to them. I was almost convinced."},{"Title":"It was on fire when I lay down on it","review":"Stories about real life that make you laugh out loud and put a smile on your face about how good life can be if you look at things the right way. lot's of quick little stories that are snapshots of goodness."},{"Title":"It was on fire when I lay down on it","review":"Robert Fulghum has a magnificent sense of humor, which contributes greatly to his skill as a writer and speaker.

Many are personal; subjects include: scientific uncertainties, parents, blood, public affection, marriage, religion, lemonade, travel, customs, blessings in disguise, and even yucky stuff----thanks mothers.

Fulghum recommends doing like the Thais and eating dogs. He bemoans the amount spent on companion dogs--instead of criticizing the millions spent on pursuits that have nothing to do with loving another creature. Instead of reviling love in the form it takes when we love our dogs, he could have put his energy into eradicating various forms of hate. I was forever discouraged from reading another book by Fulghum, which is too bad, since I think he has a lot of positive messages, too. I just don't get what he hoped to accomplish by that brutal assessment of dogs and those who love them."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I kept reading this story hoping that it was just a slow starter, but, alas it was not to be.

However, to quote the story - if you are looking for a beginning, middle, and end, you WON'T find that here. The idea behind the story is the story itself; not the denouement."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"There may be those who found The Colorado Kid unsatisfying, because it lacked the usual motifs and science fiction drama that new fans would expect from the author. Instead, King gives us a glimpse into the simple plain lives of northeastern residents and how they are momentarily interrupted, not changed, by strangeness. This is not the new sci-fi show, Haven, it is continuation of life and tradition even when adventure rears it\`s curious head into pedestrianalism. TCK is a worthwhile read and a pleasure to own."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am a huge King fan as well as a reader of most of the hard-boiled fiction he admires (Jim Thompson, Dan Marlowe). So how could a man as well-read in the pulp field give a fledgling press as well as its readers such an incomplete, unsatisfying non-event of a \\"novel\\"? As another reader pointed out, there are at least three anachronisms, products and businesses that did not even exist in the events of 1980 he describes. Where was the editor? The Fred Gwynne caricatures of Maine islanders have been served up to us ad nauseum by King for decades, and Steffi is bland and undeveloped, a heresy of writing any female character in this genre. If you want good hard-boiled mixed with the best of old-school King, go to the work of Joe R. Lansdale, read \\"Grifter's Game\\", \\"Two For The Money\\", and \\"Fade To Blonde\\" from this same series. This book does NOT accurately represent the fine offerings Hard Case Crime has produced. Like the early and current incarnations of Black Lizard Press, these guys are really onto something, bringing the excellence of the pulps to us at reasonable prices with handsome cover art. I give King 1 star for sending me to \\"The Name Of The Game Is Death\\" by Dan Marlowe, and for the Hard Case insert that offers a very good mail order deal, for what will hopefully be better offerings from the press in the future.Incidentally, King has written a noir masterpiece called \\"Delores Claiborne\\". Read that instead."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"It had to happen sooner or later.Stephen King, who has grown rich and happy on his writing fiction that the masses love and support, has turned his focus from writing popular fiction to writing something \\"with meaning.\\" He has felt the sting of the truck, and now turns his eye to his posterity.This means that, really, he isn't writing to please his Faithful Reader anymore; he is writing to please himself. To become the writer he wants to be remembered as.This isn't to say that The Colorado Kid is too literary to be enjoyable or anything remotely like it. It is a fun read written by the master writer King invariably is. But the story is apt to disappoint a lot of people because it is neither typical-King, nor typical-Noir/Hardboiled Crime Fiction. Instead of being a tight, well-plotted mystery, The Colorado Kid is a reflection on the mystery of life. It is a statement on how life's *true* mysteries aren't solvable--how there is no \\"story,\\" really, ever. And in order to show us that, King doesn't resolve his mystery. In order to show us that there is no story in life, he opts not to create one here.Or, he does, but the story he creates in The Colorado Kid is a frame one (the story is about the intern and her gaining acceptance by the grizzled newspaper vets), not the mystery indicated by the title.And so...Your appreciation of this book will largely depend on how much you rely on King to stick to his more tried-and-true formulas, and how much leniency you're willing to grant him in exploring his personal philosophy. Myself, I'm willing to cut him large amounts of slack--I figure he's earned it. Besides that, I kind of enjoyed reading The Kid, and I like the point that he's trying to make.But be warned: many, many people will be disappointed by this book, and decide that King is \\"losing his touch\\" or something like that. In truth, it's nothing like that. It's just that, King is no longer writing for us--he's now writing for himself and for his legacy."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I didn't like this book from the point when one character refers to American Idol. Later in the book characters refer to Blockbuster and Starbucks. That got me to thinking, were Blockbuster and Starbucks even around in 1980 (and in Denver)? So I went to each company's website. Starbucks was not in Denver in 1980 and Blockbuster was started after 1980 in Texas. So, besides the fact that I hate when books refer to name brands or TV shows unnecessarily, the author should at least check his facts."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"A body is found in some remote little town in Maine. A young college age girl and two elderly men, who all work for the newspaper, try to unravel who is and why he died.First off the cover has nothing to do with the story. Second--it's short (barely) 200 pages but it STILL feels padded. Third--you don't like the characters or care about the mystery. Fourth--King needs a good editor. Fifth--the mystery deepens and gets tedious as the novel drones on. Sixth--It gets annoying when every clue leads to a dead end. Seventh--it throws in a \\"twist\\" at the very end that made me want to slam dunk it into the nearest bucket!Pointless, stupid and with a truly terrible ending. Avoid."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Reading The Colorado Kid is like watching a porno and having the money shots edited out. When I first sat down to read it, the typeface was so big I wondered if it had been written for 4th-graders. That, the skimpy length, and the worst ending of about any book I've ever read easily make this King's worst, as well as that of Hard Case Crime.King thinks he is being clever, but really he could have just put THE END on page 78 instead of page 186 and saved us all a bunch of trouble. It certainly would not have affected the story any."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I read this long story/book in about two days, upon completion of which, I said to myself, \\"What was the point of that?\\"Not only was it not really a crime story, but it seemed more like a writing exercise for King and not a complete work. At the end [*SPOILER*], you still don't know if the dead man was murdered, what he was doing in Maine or how he got there in the first place.For all of King's explanations in the afterword, that lack of a conclusion really irks me. And apparently a lot of other readers as well by the looks of the previous reviews. My message to King would be if you're not going to deliver at the end of the book, then don't bother publishing it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"For this Stephen King book, you must remember this is a mystery book, not the typical King horror novel. With that aside... King takes his crack at the old 50s style pulp fiction mysteries with this book. The writing is well done and the story moves along nicely as it is really a conversation between three people that are recounting an unsolved mystery with a body known as the Colorado Kid. As a mystery book it is well paced and slightly reminiscent of the story telling put forth in \\"Dolores Clairbourne\\" by King. Typical readers will get frustrated with the unresolved ending but that's why it's a mystery and not a horror novel. Don't expect werewolves, vampires, or UFOs and you will be just fine and enjoy the actual text of the book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is the first King novel I've read in about twenty years, after devouring all of his novels up to the mid 80s. King's prodigious output is indeed amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, which is more of a novella really, about two old newspaper men that slowly relate a decades old mystery to a reporting novice. King stretches the boundaries of the hard boiled mystery/detective fiction genre here by just \\"letting the mystery be,\\" as Iris Dement might say. I had forgotten how good King is at creating vivid characters, realistic dialogue, and establishing a sense of place. King is to Maine what Steinbeck is to California or Salinger is to New York City. There is also a wonderful essay at the end of the novel in which King reflects on his refusal to provide closure and an easy answer to this one. My only complaint is his title here: The Colorado Kid sets up expectations of a western, not a profound mystery on a Maine island. Still, his book is a great comment on how the mysteries of real life are so seldom reflected in fiction."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The main problem with the book is the mystery of the Colorado Kid is not very interesting at all. Here's the gist...a man is found dead near the beach by 2 frolicking teenager back in 1980, the man had died choking on a piece of Steak. The mystery is that this Man is from Colorado and was supposedly there only a few hours before. Nobody knows who this guy is, not even the main characters of the book and by the end of the book I still don't know who this guy was. I had no emotional connection with anybody in this book and the fact they \\"needed to keep this hometown mystery\\" away from the Boston Globe is pretty laughable, first of all why would the globe want this stupid story (it's more of a Boston Herald-type story).So pretty much the whole book is a conversation between 3 people about a guy nobody knows and about trying to figure out why this guy died, but they can't because they don't have enough clues, only speculation.This book fails in 2 ways 1.) The story didn't grab me, in fact I'd rather hear about the church poisonings or the kids and the spaceship on the baseball field2.) The ending, but again since I didn't care about the story, I didn't really care about the ending.It's a short read so I would suggest,(if you're a King fan) , to quickly go through it and see for yourself...you're probably going to do it anyway/anyhow."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King doesn't always write horror. He's written along a broad range of genres, even if most of his stories wind up sounding alike. \\"The Colorado Kid\\", a throwback pulp mystery, is basically identical to a recent King novel, \\"From A Buick 8\\".Think about it. In \\"Buick\\", a large group of noble and hearty Pennsylvania State Troopers, all of whom talk exactly alike, take 500 pages to tell a very brief ghost story (weird things happened in a car that isn't a car) to a high school kid whose life is changed by the tale. In \\"Kid\\", two grizzled newspaper reports from an island off the coast of Maine, both of whom talk exactly alike, take 180 pages to tell a very brief murder mystery (a body is found and no-one knows who did it) to a recent college grad whose life is changed by the tale. \\"Kid\\"'s lurid cover illustration is nice, but bears no relation to the story inside, obviously.Your mileage from this book will depend on your patience for King's standard bag of tricks. If you like long passages where characters of disparate ages, backgrounds and educations, speak in exactly the same voice and all understand the same cultural and literary allusions, the book will be rewarding. If, on the other hand, you wonder how a 90 year-old islander can reference \\"CSI\\" while the girl born in 1983 knows the same 19th century poetry that he does, you might have issues. King spends so much time telling us why Steffi falls in love with the island that I was actually rooting for her to just leave at the end.The central mystery of the book is interesting, and that's even without the obvious supernatural solutions that King's name on the cover might lead you to presume. If you play with the clues for a while (the time frame and the Russian coin) you might end up wondering if, while focussing on the interplay between the pretty girl and the Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy antics of the two old reporters, King should have actually told the Colorado Kid's story instead."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I enjoyed this short story, but it was light on the usual Stephen King surprises and excitement.

He transports me to other realms, some obscure but all endearing. I delighted in the Colorado Kid as I enjoy putting on the old comfortable shoe of Stephen King's voice, but it lacked some of the suspense and plot development of his prior works. 'Acourse, it was only a wee book. I just thank my lucky stars that King's \\"retirement\\" was just a scare- a piece of me will die when I read his last book. I love you SK!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am currently reading one of my favourite novels of all time. That novel is The Colorado Kid by Stephen King.I love this novel. It's witty, light hearted and still has that sense of \\"What If?\\" that King is well known for. Being the curious sort, I went onto Amazon to see what others thought of the novel and was surprised.A lot of people hated it and one reviewer went so far as to call The Colorado Kid a complete waste of time. On one hand, I can see their argument; on the other, I just don't understand the negative reviews. King is known for doing things differently, doing things his way. Why should The Colorado Kid be any different?Hard Case Crime is a wonderful imprint that publishes new and old pulp novels of days gone by. Novels where there are crimes, gritty streets, criminals and ravishing beauties. Where the good guys don't always win and the story lines read like James Bond novels.When I first picked up The Colorado Kid, I wasn't sure what to expect. Never having read a pulp novel by King, I jumped right in and got my feet wet; and was treated to one of the best novels I have ever read.Our story starts with Stephanie McCann. Working for The Weekly Islander before she starts out into the big world of newspaper reporting, Stephanie is astounded to learn that Vince Teague and Dave Bowie, the two old cronies who run The Weekly Islander, are hiding a real unsolved mystery inside their gray haired heads. The two old men decide to let Stephanie in on the unsolved mystery, hoping that it will make her one of them, an Islander.The mystery revolves around The Colorado Kid, a man who was found on the beach one morning by two teenagers. He had been found with grease on his hand, a piece of steak lodged in his throat and a pack of cigarettes with one cigarette missing. No one knew who he was or how he had come to be on the island. He was wearing clothes unsuitable for cold island weather: A white shirt with no jacket, slacks and loafers with no socks.Who was the Colorado Kid? How did he come to be on the island? Did he meet with fowl play? As Dave Bowie and Vince Teague take Stephanie through all the mysteries surrounding the Colorado Kid, Stephanie will learn that not everything is what it seems at first and that answers can be a long time in coming. Will she find the answers she is seeking or will she remain shrouded in the shadows of mystery? Only the Colorado Kid knows for sure...Reviews of the novel were split right down the middle; King even says in his afterward to the novel that you will either love \\"The Colorado Kid\\" or hate it. There will be no ground in between. Thankfully, I am one of the people who love it.While some would complain that The Colorado Kid isn't a hard crime pulp novel, like it should be, I would have to agree. This is what makes \\"The Colorado Kid\\" such a treat. Instead of another potboiler like it's predecessors, King presents a novel about the mystery of mystery. You will understand what I mean when you read the novel and it will be well worth the read.King has done something beyond average here. It left me breathless. The novel reads like the hardest of crime novels but is something more: a commentary on the mystery that runs in our lives. \\"The Colorado Kid\\" was one hell of a read and I, for one, am glad that I went along for the ride. Hopefully those that left negative reviews will revisit this book and change their minds. Maybe, maybe not.Either way, King has put his own stamp on mystery, has done things his own way. Should we expect anything less from the King himself? The Colorado Kid is just as good reading it the tenth time as it was reading it the first time.Pick up \\"The Colorado Kid.\\" It'll take you an afternoon to read it and your life will be much the richer for it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I picked up this book, not because I'm a Stephen King fan (although I am), but because it was part of the new Hard Case Crime division of Dorchester Publishing. I'll admit, the variety of authors they've collected to write for them is extensive, and THE COLORADO KID just happened to be the first one in the Hard Case group to make it to the top of my to-be-read pile.I understand, after reading THE COLORADO KID, why so many people on here posted negative reviews. I understand, because just like the main characters in the story told me, a mystery with no resolution plain and simply pisses people off. People want a happy conclustion to a problem--whether it be why 9/11 happened, why oil prices are so high, why a young woman in Wisconsin was murdered, or how a man from Colorado went to work one morning and ended up dead on a little island off the coast of Maine only hours later.Not KNOWING, not having Mr. King spell it out for us, angered many a reader of this book. Should it have? Maybe. But I actually felt like there WAS a resolution to this story--that being that not everything in life has such a tidy ending as we want our stories to have. Of all the people who end up dead in the US every year, how many do you think go unsolved as to cause of death, or in the case of murder, capturing a perpetrator? Life--this roller-coaster ride that we get onto daily and hang on to since our very lives depend on it--is not black and white, and it sure as heck doesn't offer us up tidy conclusions at the end of every day.THE COLORADO KID is, quite simply, a character study of not knowing. We can get the facts, we can extrapolate what we believe happened based on those facts, but in the end, it's all a mystery.Kudos to Mr. King for taking an idea, running with it, and showing that he just doesn't give a flying fig if we get it or not. This book left me with questions, yes, and I actually thank him for that. A book that makes you think and question will always be worth more than a book that doesn't."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Sometimes it is just fun to read something that is well written. Not everything we consume with our senses has to be important, educational perfection. If that was the case many popular books would not exist. Stephen King gives us this novella as an offering that sometimes good writing is enough. No, the plot isn't much. No, the mystery isn't solved by a hard-bitten man in a trench coat. But what of it? I'm not sure the book would have been improved by the clich&eacute;d ending for which some reviewers seem to clamor.I gave this book 4 stars out of 5, because I liked it. There just wasn't enough book for me to say I loved it. And, you know, that's just fine with me."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'd argue that most Stephen King stories aren't so much about the horror or fantastic elements in the story so much as they're about how those horrific or fantastic elements affect ordinary people. King's great strength is taking ordinary characters, developing them a bit and then setting them down in some circumstance and watching how they deal with it. For some like Jack Torrence, they go mad. For others, like Roland the Gunslinger, they become a sort of anti-hero. But in all of these stories, the insanity of the worlds King creates are grounded by characters who feel authentic.For King, it's less about the destination and more about the journey. Let's see how these characters react to things, he seems to say.Such is the case with his latest novel The Colorado Kid.Really, to call it a novel is stretching the defintion, especially by the tome sized standard King has set with previous novels. Weighing it at just under 200 pages, this one might be better classified as a novella. Luckily, it's part of the Hard Case Crime series and is published to increase the visiblity of the line (it helped me with as I've read half a dozen of the other books published under this banner). Also, it's offered at a lower price to the consumer. So, if it only takes you a couple of hours to read, you're only out six bucks and not the price of a hard-cover.Now, I will warn you--those of you looking for a neat, tidy little mystery might want to look elsewhere. King acknowledges this in his afterward saying this novel will be one that fans love or hate with little middle ground. And I can see why. The story is one of a dead body discovered on a beach in Maine and how the investigation into solving that mystery affects his family, the people around him and two newspaper reporters who have kept the story to themselves all these years. The story is told by the two guys to a young female reporter so they can share the secret and keep it going. Again, let me say that this is not a neat, tidy package where thing will all be resolved in the end. King offers up some solutions and bits of answers, but there is no great denouncement or a smoking gun. In short--this ain't an Agatha Christie mystery where the culprit is denounced by the final chapter after a lot of red herrings over the course of the novel.Instead, what you get is a story of how the mystery affects everyone is comes in contact with. Some are forever changed, some aren't. And King's greatest strength--creating intersting characters, whether it be for two pages or 180 plus--is fully on display here. There is little or no supernatural stuff happening here, but instead an interesting little story that is a pleasant way to spend a few hours with a good book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Ok, I am seeing a lot of people unhappy with the ending of this novella. These are the people that need closure. That cannot come up with a satisfactory explanation on their own, or (gasp) consider that there may not be an explanation which is what King is trying to tell you.Rather than focusing on the great story, unique and loveable characters, many people are upset that someone isn't telling them where the Easter egg is hidden. I want to ask these people - If, (and I mean If) King had decided to tell you the ending, I want you to think (and I mean think) - Would he have written the same story? Or would he have changed the facts around to conform to that ending? What you are asking for is an entirely different story. The whole point of this story was to do exactly what King did. If you don't like the ending, that fine, but don't complain about the book - there is a difference.If you are watching an amazing movie, and the power goes off in the last 3 minutes, would you complain about the movie because you don't know what happened? Absolutely not...you would complain about life, and that is what King has made us do with this short, yet clever tale. We have learned that sometimes we have to complain at life.Read this book if you are a true mystery fan, for an alternative perspective. Skip it if you are the type to peek at Christmas presents.5 stars for another brave book from the man who taught me fear.Relic113"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I so looked forward to this book and felt led along like a puppy to an empty food bowl.

They way I heard it, the guys who started \\"Hard Case Crime\\" approached King to write the foreward to a novel. He responded by saying, \\"I have a book for you.\\" If you were starting up a new publishing venture and one the world's largest authors offers you a book, would you turn him down because it wasn't quite what your imprint was going to publish? Of course not. And they didn't. I, for one, am glad they didn't.As a librarian, I have had trouble trying to convince people who are not horror, or King fans, to read this, even though I am sure they would enjoy it. He has built up such an image of his work that when he writes something utterly horror-free it can't get a fair reading.For the quality of the prose, and the depth of the relationships between the characters, I have read few novels on par with The Colorado Kid.

Once I managed to get past the character development and plot development the story kind of hooked me and I finished the book in one afternoon.

At least if you want it to be told to you, or to watch it on TV. I can think of hardly any satisfying mysteries out there, just ones that titilate me into coming back to them.

What hurts is simply that it ends (can we admit that?), and that you want more (as does Steff), and that you have to once again say goodbye to a few more likeable King characters."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This another nice piece of work from King's Late Period- a period defined by a more subtle approach to horror and a willingness to experiment. While King has had a few failures in recent years because of this daring, but where he nails it, he nails it out of the park. Colorado Kid is a bit too short to be considered a major work, but it's a terrific way to spend an afternoon, and it's refreshingly free of some of the plot elements which had come to haunt his writing in recent years.Sure, some people are going to hate it. It helps if you don't expect a concrete mystery; just enjoy ride, and the various creepy bits accompanying it. Besides, it's only 6 bucks, how can you go wrong?"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am a true fan of Stephen King and will read anything he writes.I will continue to do so,that being said this is not one of his best efforts, and is not a page turner you just can't put down Unlike much of his previous books this is a short story but lacking that something you normally get from him.

If this had of been his first or second book I probably would not have looked forward to another."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Um, there IS no ending to this book. The crime remains unsolved, and the reader feels his/her time has been wasted. No payoff???

But that's perfectly okay. Stephen King has been around long enough and has paid enough dues to be forgiven for engaging in some harmless bait and switch.The Colorado Kid succeeds in doing what good fiction is supposed to do. It transports the reader from his or her own world to an alternative world of the author's creation. This book is written with such utter craftsmanship, the reader is completely drawn into the idiosyncratic island community of Moose-Lookit just off the Maine coast. Its residents seem real. Their conversation and actions are totally convincing.This marvelous page turner of a novel takes place in the present day. But it's about a highly suspicious death that occurred some 25 years before. Let me amend that last statement. The book is not so much about a suspicious death as it is about our reaction to the mysterious and the unexplained. We never do learn who or what killed the poor fellow who comes to be known as the Colorado Kid. But King's skillful writing gives our imaginations the opportunity to run wild as we confront the unknowable.The Colorado Kid distills good storytelling to its essence. One would be justified in thinking of it as a novel about mystery itself, rather than just a mystery novel. A solid 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"4.75 stars\\"I write to find out what I think, and what I found out writing \\"The Colorado Kid\\" was that maybe- I just say maybe- it's the beauty of the mystery that allows us to live sane as we pilot our fragile bodies through this demolition-derby world.\\"This paragraph at the end of Stephen King's mystery, says it all. I understand his message, and it is a beauty. While reading this book, and it is a very quick read, I was thinking, \\"What is Stephen King thinking? This is not his style. There is something more to this\\" Stephen King is giving us a life lesson, and I will leave it up to you to figure this out.Maine, an island off the coast of, Moose-Lookit Island. Stephanie, a post grad from the U of Ohio is putting in her time as intern on \\"The Weekly Islander\\", the local paper. She had almost left as soon as she arrived because the local dialect was so difficult for her to understand, you all know, \\"Ayuh\\" the Maineism we all talk about. The young lovely has hooked up with the owner and the main journalist-,Vince Teague and Dave Bowie. They are two old fashioned Maineiacs who essentially run the paper and know everything worth knowing. They are engaging Stephanie in small talk after a \\"Boston Globe\\" reporter left them, trying to dig up a mystery, a story that hadn't been told. Would these men talk to someone from Boston and give them the best story they know? Of course not, but to Stephanie, they will tell a tale and ask her to figure things out.Two teenagers waiting for a ferry find a man sitting on a beach. The strange thing is, he is dead, sort of tilting over a bit, and a pack of cigs falling out of his pocket. They call the local police who calls the doc and the two newspapermen. Ahh, the mystery begins, No identification, and not much of an investigation, It takes a full year for the body to be identified, and we are party to this telling. We hear the story and how some clues originally overlooked become so important. Stephanie does a credible job in keeping up with these men and their stories and linking one clue to another. What we don't see as this story continues is the underlying meaning of this all. The energy in this telling is one to remember.Anyone who follows and reads Stephen King understands that what we think is a certainty is never what it seems. I told you I was surprised in reading this book- it was not like any other Stephen King novel. I have to let you figure this one out . This is a \\"corker\\". Ayuh! Highly recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I love reading, but after reading this book I will NEVER read another Stephen King book again. I like my to have the mystery solved at the end. Did King even write this book??? If he did, he put zero effort into it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King is a generous person...I think that's one of the reasons because he agreed publishing this small press item- to help some small publishing house get bigger- in the past he showed examples of this; with his endorsements on book covers (to the extent that his blurbs were ruthlessly exploited) and as far as I know he sells scripts of his short stories to amateur producers et at a price of 1$ I don't think King would get any financial hit from Colorado Kid.Secondly, to the reviewer thinking that this would be a bad stain on the publishing house in the long term, no you are wrong sir! If SK did not publish this little pulp, I would never be aware of Hard Case Crime...now I just clicked on two further Hard Case Crime items... And that may be a long-term, solid gains on the part of the publishing house- King's name attract droves to the stores...The book is usual King with a strong prose, down-to-earth narrative, twisted King humour beyond any match and his unbeatable and uncanny ability to draw characters breathing next you with a stroke of few words. Speaking for myself, I prefer any so-so SK book (for instance his phone book with small notes just like in his short story collections) to a maudlin, indescribable, silly but \\"high-brow\\" American novel, say, Corrections where the man was talking to his s__t...And SK is blamed to write absurd fiction...For the closure, to the reviewer who blame King that \\"he should have stopped writing for all of us because he is publishing absurd fiction with ridiculous stock of characters for 20 years\\", then you should be more naive than I think because if you are still buying King books after being aware what kind of crap he has been producing, it is either that your span of memory is like that of a fish or it is rather SK's ability to create memorable and haunting writing even among that crap if there was any in the first place.It is very hard to boost a sleeping and not-welcomed-genre toa stand-up position singlehandedly and write numerous items, including classics, middle-of-the-road ones and some stinks in the basket; sell millions of books to zillions of readers around the world; garner various awards and universally labelled as \\"master of horror\\", or let's say, \\"a master storyteller\\"; however, it seems very easy to slap the man whenever a chance arises from the small PC in the office within only a few paragraphs for the laughable pity of paying \\"5.99 dollars\\"Go on, Mr King! You deserve your place against all the sling and jealousy flung at you..."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"When I saw this in the bookstore I was intrigued. I'm used to Stephen King novels as big as the Manhattan phonebook. This is small, the price is modest and it can be read in a day or two. To be honest, I haven't read a lot of Stephen King's recent work. I find it corny at best and at repetitive at worst. How many stories does he need to write about a haunted car?But he's the man who got me to put down comic books and actually pick up a real book when I was a kid. Stephen King used to keep me up at night when I was younger, sometimes out of fear and sometimes because the book was too good to put down. He instilled in me a love of reading I have to this day. Don't I owe him something?I began the book and hated it at the beginning. It's about two old newspapermen on an island off the Maine coast telling a young newswoman about a mystery from twenty-five years ago. Yeah, I get it. They talk with Maine accents. They kept getting sidetracked and I started losing patience. Crime fiction is supposed to move fast. It's like selling fish, you better move quickly or it's going to smell.By midway through, I started to get into it. By the end, I couldn't put it down. This isn't a formulaic mystery, it's a comment on the difference between fictitious mysteries and mysteries in the real world. In fiction, things always make sense. The plot has to be solvable. That's not always true in the real world, as the Zodiac killer and D.B. Cooper plainly show. King has used a crime-fiction imprint to give us an anti-noir, or a light if you will. He's given us a murder mystery with hope. I feel silly for having doubted him.The best part is how reading King's work is like going to your hometown and eating food you grew up on. He's not just a writer, he's Americana. He once referred to himself as the literary equivalent of a Big Mac with fries but I think he's being modest. He's not Shakespeare or Melville but he's made at least as significant a contribution to his genre as Bradbury or Twain. Something tells me our children and our grandchildren will be reading his work for some years to come."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This book was a gift for my husband. According to his insight, it held an unusual Stephen King presentation of an unsolveable crime. The book was quick reading. After the TV series, Haven, was on, he was curious as to the reference of The Colorado Kid. The book set up the basis for the odd occuring mysteries going on in the Maine harbor town. The book was not action-packed, but a mystery to be solved."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is an interesting story, almost. King is writing a story about what it takes to make a story a mystery. This story is not quite a mystery but still a great story. King's dialogue and storytelling is in high form in this novella. Great fun. But if gore is what you're after, go for another King novel."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Please note: This is a review of the audiobook performance only, not the actual writing.Jeffrey DeMunn may be a fine actor, but as a narrator, he's unbearable. A straight reading by DeMunn might've been listenable, but his attempt at the rural Maine dialect is brutal, and worse, makes the listener strain to understand what is being said. What he produces sounds something like a cross between a Mainer and an Irish brogue caricature, perhaps close to Chief O'Hara on the Batman TV show.Why the producers didn't get Ron McLarty to narrate is beyond me. For that matter, if anyone out there in Stephen King Land is reading this, why isn't Ron McLarty narrating everthing King releases on audio, old and new? Since Frank Muller's tragic accident, McLarty remains one of the only narrators who can convincingly add to a story through character voices. Plus, he's a native New Englander and has no trouble with the Maine dialect.Do not waste your money on this recording. The story may be great, and maybe I'll read it in print soon.

I enjoy the TV series, but did not enjoy the book. While the characters were interesting, the story was not compelling and there was no conclusion. There are many better choices when it comes to Stephen King's books. I am a very avid King reader, and enjoy almost all of his books (except the Dark Tower series). Just my opinion of course, but I don't feel that this is a good example of his work."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Now that was a mystery! A \\"true unexplained mystery.\\" Usually I can't stand open ended books or books that end with a cliff hanger, but this one I loved. There is something about the way King crafts his stories, with such rich characters and details that draws you into the scene and makes you feel like you are sitting right there hearing the dialog, that I really enjoy. I found this story refreshing in that it dared to tell a story where the ends weren't tied up neatly, answering all the questions and then used that story to make a point and clarify the two types of storytelling.I am very glad I started watching the TV show Haven, which motivated me to read this story that it is based on. It clarified for me why I can't stand books that are just \\"accounts of unfolding events\\" and end with cliff hangers. I get enough of that in real life when I escape while reading fiction I want a story with a beginning, middle and end.

The basic premise revolves around a body found on the beach by some locals on the way to school. The more bits and pieces that's learned about the corpse the deeper the mystery becomes. I have no problem with the story but the story teller is another matter.Jeffrey DeMunn is basically a good narrator but in this story he just tries too hard to capture the \\"down east\\" accent of Maine which results in a difficult to understand telling. Maybe if he wasn't so good at what he does, the audio edition of The Colorado Kid would be better.All in all, this is a good story if you're willing to invest the energy in translating Maine to English. bg"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King is in the position where if he bundled up his old junior high notebooks and sent them to his agent, publishers would bid on them.The is the only explanation for THE COLORADO KID.The plot is, \\"What if there was a murder with mysterious clues that made no sense at all? The end.\\" Gee, a mystery story with no solution! That probably isn't tried more than a hundred times a year by unpublished authors, to be met with form letter rejection every time (wouldn't Form Letter Rejects be a great name for a band?).Written so quickly that King places a Starbucks in 1980 Denver, and since publishers have been too embarassed to edit Mr. King for well over a decade, it stayed in the book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"King wrote this story as a vehicle to say that some mysteries have no conclusion. Fine, but those are the ones that don't become novels. The result is simply the impression that King copped out and just rambled on without knowing how to end this thing.The three characters are ok but can't contend with the pointless ending.Be warned, read the description and understand that the question asked on the cover does have an answer and that answer is NO."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"\\"Depending on whether you liked or hated The Colorado Kid (I think for many people there'll be no middle ground on this one...\\" -- that's the opening of King's afterward in this book and he's perfectly correct -- both that readers will be divided and that a defensive explanation is needed after finishing it. King is wrong, however, to believe that the story's lack of conclusion is best reason to be disatisifed.The best reason for annoyance is the story is not interesting. The mystery not engaging, bogged down in endless details (I now know more about charter airlines than I ever cared to) and delivered in an endless, monotone, conversational stream whose plot points scarcely earn their chapter breaks. A marathon storytelling session has worked for King before (in part 4 of Different Seasons, in several short stories), but here you remain detached, as nothing from the story is impacting the present moment.King scores a couple intellectual points about the nature of mystery, and of a story, but they could have easily been made in a more effective tale. In other words, just because King's mystery has too many loose ends, doesn't mean those loose ends need to be about an overcoat, charter flights and Russian coins. Blind alleys can be great, but at least make them creepy, unique, interesting alleys.Also, as another reviewer noted, the package seems deceptive -- a novel that's actually a novella, a hard boiled detective package about a stovetop yarn. Even the name, Colorado Kid, seems like something tacked on after selling the story to the Hard Case Crime series (there is a person from Colorado, but 'Kid' doesn't remotely fit)."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"First of all, I've read 10 books in the Hard Case Crime series and loved all of them except this one. I have also read all of Stephen King's novels up through \\"Misery\\". This is by far his worst book, judging by the ones I've read, and the worst entry in this series. If you're reading the Hard Case Crime series you might want to read this one to complete it, but it's a disappointment. Hope I'm not giving too much away, but the entire book is one conversation between three people about a mystery - if there had at least been a solution to the mystery at the end that would have been something. The mystery is uninteresting as it is - even more so without an answer."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"In the afterword of The Colorado Kid, Stephen King predicts the polarizing nature of this novel. Either love it or hate it... Unfortunately I fall into the latter category. King presents us with an unsolved mystery that remains strictly unsolved into the very end. He argues that the real beauty lies in the mystery itself and not in solving it. Such a premise might work in some instances, but it absolutely does not fly with this story. The mystery per se is quite pedestrian and unexciting, therefore completely failing to reel us in. Yet throughout the book I kept telling myself that things would definitely pick up. We are talking about Stephen King, for crying out loud! The master storyteller would certainly provide us with a completely mind-blowing and provocative ending that would make it all worthwhile. To my utter chagrin, however, this time the master storyteller truly let us down. After dragging us through a very insipid tale, he finalizes the book with a whimper, without solving the mystery at all. Highly unsatisfactory..."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King makes a point early on in \\"The Colorado Kid,\\" and it is this: people don't want to read about a truly unexplained mystery. They don't want a bunch of unconnected facts that don't add up to a definite answer. They want a \\"through-line,\\" a clear path leading from beginning to middle to end...they want a story.And in this book, King proves the point by detailing a true mystery. It may not make all readers happy, but it has all the hallmarks of a King novel: great characters, a plot that flows easily and freely from the pages, and of course it's set primarily in King's home state of Maine.The characters in \\"The Colorado Kid\\" are as skillfully drawn as any in King's novels. From the first few pages, I got a sense of reality and depth from these two old newspapermen, Dave and Vince, and their young protege, Stephanie. As the two men spin their tale of the Colorado Kid for her, we learn as much about them as we do about their story -- not only in what they say, but in how they say it. In this sense, the novel is classic King, creating depth of character through skillful handling of dialogue and a decpetively simple layering of story.At less than 200 paperback pages, \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is a quick read. It can easily be read in only a few hours, and the way King writes invites you to finish it all in one gulp, by leading off with a compelling idea, a man found dead on a beach with no identity and no clear reason how he got there or why he ended up dead. It's framed as the sort of story people tell while sitting around the dinner table, or at the local bar, or around a campfire, and in the end that's how it feels. It feels comfortable and easy and natural, as the best King novels (and even some that aren't as good) always do.If there is one weakness, it is in the way the book is packaged and sold. When I see an imprint like \\"Hard Case Crime\\" and a cover that looks like it could have come off of an old pulp Raymond Chandler paperback, I'm immediately thinking that I'm in for some hard-boiled crime fiction. I was actually enjoying seeing what King might do with a real crime novel, as Dan Simmons has pulled off so successfully in his recent Joe Kurtz books. Make no mistake, though, this is not crime fiction. There's not a gun or a gritty P.I. to be found. The heroes (if there can be said to be any here) are no Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe, nor are they anything like the modern incarnations of these classic characters, such as Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, Ian Rankin's John Rebus, or Simmons' Joe Kurtz. It took me a while to shift gears in my expectations for what \\"The Colorado Kid\\" would be like, and I had to abandon my hopes of seeing a writer like King playing within the bounds of the crime fiction genre pretty early on.Perhaps that's intentional, though. King clearly wanted to write about mystery here -- not mystery in the traditional sense, as in Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes (both of whom are called out directly in the pages of the book), but real-life mysteries, true mysteries which deserve the name because they don't have pat answers or ready-made conclusions. King is really playing a little trick on the reader here, taking the expectation of a fun but ultimately unchallenging mystery story, in which everything is laid out within its pages, and twisting it right around past the breaking point, revealing it as the fiction it is. When we're talking about real mysteries, King seems to be saying, life never hands us the answers that easily. He may not be playing within the bounds of the classic mystery story, but he clearly knows what the bounds are, and he's doing his best to break them down. He's coloring outside the lines here, and it's fun to watch.But beyond the genre constructs and fourth walls, \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is still a great story (even if King says it's not a story) and a very enjoyable read. It's the sort of book you can blast through in a single sitting if you're of a mind to do so, but you may find that it sticks with you for a while after you put it down. And that's what a good story is all about."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"\\"The Colorado Kid\\" is the story of mystery. It's the story of a mystery with very few clues. Since there's little enough story in this, you may want to avoid the rest of this paragraph as a spoiler.

They warn that they don't have an answer to why a married graphic artist from Boulder would be found dead on the beach with a hunk of chewed sirloin caught in his throat.They go on about the forensic intern who figured out where the Kid came from, what his last meal was before the Big Choke got him (fish and chips, 5 p.m.), and a few other odds and ends, quiz the intern several times where she thinks the story will go next, and that's it. Lower curtain. Raise the lights.Obviously, King has a reason for doing this, and he steps out on stage at the end to tell us. To him, Colorado Kid story is a metaphor for the mystery that surrounds all of us as \\"we free-fall from Wherever to Ain't Got A Clue.\\"Did it work? Not really. It was a fine-told story, and the garrulous newsmen play off each other like an old couple used to each others ways. Stephanie, the intern, is cute and has some moments when she's wondering if island life is for her and will she ever go back to the Midwest. And I got the message about Life is a Mystery, but from the Rev. King's sermon. The truth behind the death of the Kid is so impenetrable, so shallow, that it left us with nothing to chew on.

A Colorado man has X amount of time within one day to get to an island off Maine's coast where he is found dead.The elderly newspaper reporters speculate how he could have gotten there with their intern of several months.

Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"\\"The Colorado Kid\\" (a book Stephen King wrote for the Hard Case Crime series, a sort of return to the pulp fiction stories from the '30s and '40s) is a weak book, one of the weaker of King's career but it's not as bad as other S.K. books like \\"From a Buick 8.\\" The story is (after 184 pages) a mystery without an explanation. It presents us with a death, implies that it could be murder, than shuts the audience out. The book is narrated by two old men named Dave Bowie and Vince, who tell a young woman named Stephanie the story of The Colorado Kid. We hear exactly what Stephanie hears, know exactly what the two men know, and then are left out. Because (like the film \\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\\") we only get hints about what exactly is going on, that almost gives the book a haunting quality...But still leaves the audience unsatisfied. Vince and Dave tell Stephanie of The Colorado Kid, a man who was found propped up against a trashcan without any kind of identification. His cause of death is determined \\"asphyxia due to choking\\" (because a piece of meat is found in the back of his throat). The cops give up on the investigation, especially after the man is identified (his wife claims that he disappeared over a year ago), but Vince and Dave do not and begin to uncover many clues that seem to imply homicide. The man (never a smoker, according to his wife and the coroner) is found with a pack of cigarettes and a book of matches. One smoke is gone and one match is gone; The fact that cigarettes were purchased in Colorado may be a sign. Whatever it means, we'll never know. The book is entertaining and I read it in a couple hours, so it wasn't a complete waste of time. Entertaining, but too impenetrable.GRADE: C+"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"A quick, somewhat insubstantial novel, which feels more like a short story, \\"Kid\\" is a slight effort from King. The story is told through the voices of two old grizzled newspapermen as they relay the mysterious tale of the title character, a man who ended up dead on a beach. Considering King's love for hardboiled fiction, and given the cover photo, it's hard not to be a little disappointed in this. The story is extremely padded and often redundant. It feels like something King pounded out on a weekend. The central mystery will get you interested, but King offers no answers, which is his point. The best part of the book is actually his afterword, in which he tells us that the story of \\"Kid\\" is no less than a metaphor for man's primal existential quandary. I know King's point was to not tie things up nice and neat and give an answer to anything -- because that never happens in real life -- but people come to these types of stories expecting just that. I wouldn't call them wrong if they felt a little cheated."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"On the cover it says this story has never been in print before. The problem is that I a sure that I have read it before this printing, I just do not remember where or when it was. The story itself is very good and flows very well for readability. I enjoyed the story even though it is not one that you would normally expect from Stephen King's hand."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm one of the few people who neither loved nor hated this book. It was better than Cell, but it was more like a snack than a real meal. I didn't care that he didn't solve the mystery, but I did care that he didn't give us more to interest us on the way.I hope \\"Lisey's Story\\" is more fleshed out than King's last couple of books."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"As usual, Stephen King creates a good set of characters. However this is a mystery that doesn't have an ending. I guess that King was trying to experiment with this book, so I will give him 2 stars for effort. However, the experiment didn't work. Unless you are a fast reader who doesn't mind killing a few hours reading this book I wouldn't even try to read it. Slow readers may wish to ask Stephen King to return the day that they wasted reading this book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I predict that there are two types of people who read this book. King describes it as a 'love it or hate it' breakdown, but I suspect it's a division between those who at least fight the urge to continue to work on this story (do some internet research to check on the weather that day, see if there's any traditional significance to the Russian coin, whatever), and those who just put the book down in frustration.This isn't at all what I was suspecting -- no guns, no dames, no morally-immature gunsels making threats bigger than their hatsize -- but I actually liked it more for that. It's a story about stories and the people who tell them, about journalism that's never seen a television camera.I finished reading this about 12 hours ago, and I keep mulling it over, like a smooth rock in my pocket. King invites the reader to write his own story around this framework, without any of the reassuring \\"mustabeen\\"s that would make us feel we were correct. Nice job."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Once a constant reader and avid Stephen King fan, I vowed never to pick up another Stephen King book after his horrid and self-indulgent conclusion to The Dark Tower saga.But then I had a 5 hour layover and saw this book, so what the hey...Terrible lazy and sloppy work. The other negative reviews already say it all (come on, a Blockbuster or Starbucks in 1980?) And is anyone else completely sick of \\"Ahuh\\"? Gag. Garbage like this would never see light of day except for the power of King's name and his previous works.I won't make the same mistake in buying a Stephen King book again - or at least not until I check out the Amazon reviews!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"So, you read a murder mystery in the hopes that you can solve who \\"done\\" it first. Or just for the joy of a mystery that is solved. This book offers NONE of that. I would say one of the worst mysteries ever written. You will finish the book and wonder to your self \\"Why did I read this? What was the point?\\" It is the story of a young lady who is working for a small town newspaper. She listens to the stories the \\"old timers\\" tell her about the unsolved mystery of The Colorado Kid. And that is it. There is nothing else. The story of this mystery gets told and you are left with nothing. I would not pass this book along to any friend!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"As the author says, some will love this book and some will dislike it. It is essentially a study of three characters, two veteran newsmen mulling over an odd occurence with a young intern. The story's focus is really on their interplay and not on the \\"mystery\\". If you are looking for suspense or a gripping read, this is not your book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"When the author of a crime story needs an afterword to explain the meaning of the book and the intentiion of the author, his intention, there is something wrong with the book, and there definitely is something wrong with this book. It is not a crime story because there is no crime, only an unsolved mystery with no beginning of the commencement of a solution. And it is not a Kingian story either because there is no inner dimension, no deeper dimension in the character, the victim of the mystery, the dead person, nothing in anyway disquieting, because it is not disquieting to find a dead body on a beach, or in the street. It is only disquieting if there is some foul play somewhere and a deeper more sombre undersoul (like underground, well hidden and kept secret) meaning. In other words we are neither satisfied by the mystery story nor by the supposedly kingian story. OK the language is good. OK there is a great ability to give us the feeling of what a popular mind can be, see and feel, in one of these islands off the Maine coast. But we are even more ravenous at the end of teh book than at the beginning because we have been kept hungry all that time. And the subtle - is it subtle ? - allusions to Ms Maple, or Sherlock Holmes, or Ellery Queen, or so many others, do not erase the fact that we have been hijacked into a story which is not what the front cover of the book promised.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This story of a reporter being told of a real unsolved mystery was a quick read, but not what I expected. It wasn't a \\"Hard Case\\" crime in my opionion. I have read a few of the other novels from this line and did enjoy them.The ending didn't bother me like it did a lot of the reviewers and I won't give it away. His afterword justified his ending to me.If you go into this story looking for an interesting story that is not really \\"hard\\" just \\"interesting\\" you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The Colorado Kid is an original novel by Stephen King that is part of the Hard Case Crime Series. This series features original stories as well as classic pulp fiction crime stories from the past. Finding out Stephen King was writing an entry to this series, I was excited to see his take on the genre. There is no denying that King is a good author, and The Colorado Kid proves it because it is well written and I believe accomplishes everything King wanted it to. But that doesn't mean it is a good story.First, it is extremely short and can easily be read in an afternoon. So you know you aren't going to have a deep plot. What you get is a simple premise. Stephanie, the young intern pictured on the cover, is working for Dave and Vince at a small newspaper located on an island off the coast of Maine. I doubt she was wearing the close on the cover at anytime during the story. A journalist from a large newspaper is interviewing Vince and Dave about local mysteries and legends for a feature. After the reporter leaves, the two men reveal to Stephanie they didn't tell him everything. Vince and Dave then proceed to tell Stephanie the story of a man found dead on the beach 25 years ago.This story is full of details such as where the man was from, what he died from, how he got to the beach, etc. A few reviews I read hated the ending and King addressed the fact that there will be a lot of mixed feelings about the ending of the book. I for one didn't like it. I didn't like it because its not fair to the reader to basically write an essay on the nature of mystery and call it a \\"Hard Crime\\" novel. If King expects people to buy this book, he should give them something with some substance. I urge people not to buy this book because it is incomplete. It doesn't have a conclusion. In the afterword, King says he based the Colorado Kid on a newspaper article about an unidentified girl found in a nearby town. He also explains his theory about mysteries and their nature and that people want their stories to come to a tidy conclusion and that never happens in real life. Well, this book isn't real life, it is a story and it deserves a conclusion."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am a huge Stephen King...however I was very disappointed with this novel. It lacks the vivid imagery and intricate character portrayals typical of the King.I was very impressed with \\"Rose Madder\\", \\"Needful Things\\",and even \\"The cell\\" - these novels tantalized my imagination and made me hunger for more.....but the \\"The Colorado Kid\\" was quite boring in comparison. I was actually glad when I finished lol! Sorry Stephen! In Jamaican terminology....\\" Wheel and come again\\""},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I love a lot of Stephen Kings Material. This however was not a great book. it was interesting, but did not really peak my intrest. I only finished reading it cause I paid for it and hoped it would turn it self around. Like I said it is an ok book just not my taste I still gave it 3 stars, Cause i liked it. Just not as good as i thought it would be. I have heard others say it is a really great book, so it really just depends on if it grabs your attention."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Maui H.S.Wow, I saw the cover and said \\"What?\\" The cover has absolutely nothing to do with the book. The story was basically a narrative to a college newspaper intern they adopted into becoming a islander. It is the story of a mysterious death of an unknown found on Moosie Island in Maine. The final decision of the court was accidental death by choking, but the true mystery remains. Pieces don't fit, like the pack of cigarettes with a Colorado tax stamp found on a man that didn't smoke, and other little oddities that the two old newspapermen reveal. It is a short read, but gripping. As for the ending? I'll leave that up to you to find out. Great Work by Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm not the only reviewer to write this, so it's not much of a spoiler, but I cannot stand when I invest time in a book to have NOTHING solved in the end.I read this book because my husband and I have become fans of the summer SyFy series Haven, and the credits state that it's based on this book. I'm not sure how--the series isn't over yet, so I'm assuming that the case that somehow involves Audrey's mom is the Colorado Kid story, but that's the only connection I've found between the book and the television show.The book comes across as amateurish--definitely not the style readers have come to expect from Stephen King. I was hooked through most of it too, because it is quite interesting and kept me guessing as to what had happened. But then...no delivery. The reader is never given the conclusion and wrap-up. I know that is how the author wanted it, but I am all about closure and can't stand open-ended interpretation. Bleah."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I admit, I bought this for the tie-in to Haven, and enjoyed the story, but went into knowing it has no end. Typically, a 'mystery' story has a map that you follow that will lead you to the answer and this story doesn't. If you're cool with knowing that at the get-go and just sitting down and enjoying the tale? You'll dig this book - if not? I don't know if it's for you! He makes every story interesting, though, and this one is no different!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I enjoyed the book. I ordered it because on the TV credits, it mentioned that the new SyFy program \\"Haven\\" was based on this story. Even though there was not a close connection between the book and the show, I enjoyed the mystery. The item was in very good condition and I was able to play it as soon as it arrived."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"If ever a book could be called an \\"Anti-Mystery\\", it's \\"The Colorado Kid\\". At the end of the mystery, the detectives are still as baffled as when they started. There are enough unsolved mysteries in real life, we don't need fictional ones. I thought part of the fun of mystery novels is that the detective solves them in the end, \\"The Colorado Kid\\" doesn't do that plus there was no \\"mutant of the Week\\" as in the \\" Haven\\" TV series that is supposedly based on this book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This mystery could have been so much more had King wanted it to be. Instead of going out and creating the thing that I thought I migt be getting into, however, King created a book that made me wonder and keep wondering even after i was done. I would have been fine with the mysterious way that the story ended had I felt like it had finished well but, as with some King books, it had a lot of flaws.First, I felt like there were a lot of flaws in the waythis beast was delivered. The main charcters that told me the tale did not make me want to keep reading - they seemed like they had been created solely to do something but not to ever breath. Since I am a character person and love the way characters enhance a story, I was saddened by the way many of these people seemed to appear without so much as a reason. It made the thing seem mechanical and, when it seems this way, the reading slows to a crawl.The plot was one that I wanted to get into but, as i progressed, i felt lost in places. i THINK this happened because the problem i named earlier interferred with me taking in the story as a whole, and it hurt my attention span. I could see what King was creating - liking it was easy when I started out and sometimes that leaked out and the story got going again. But, all in all, it was not what I had thought I would get.Check this out and see if you like it by sampling pieces provided here and there. Also, some reviewers have given several things that answer all kinds of questions INCLUDING when editions of this will be released. I have to commend them for that and ask that you see my review as my opinion, noting I am no literary icon and my opinion is that of a reader reading.I would include more but I fear spoilers, knowing what they do to me. Besdes, you are the real voice that matters in the end. Check out what you see - hopefully you can find more here than I did."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"It was not up to the usual Steven King novels It was kind of slow and hard to stay interested."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I read enough reviews going in to know there would be a mystery with no solution. As a fan of the TV show LOST, I'm no stranger to this concept. I stuck with that through 6 years Hard to say whether I would have stuck had I known there would be no resolution. Still, I confess I enjoyed it all the way. It was nice having a respected author like King assure me that the attempt to figure out answers was the most important point of a good mystery. I'm now watching \\"Haven\\", the TV show based on this story. I'm not expecting answers to be handed to me there,either"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"If you have read King recently, you will notice that he regularly lets his own voice come through, somehow reflecting on the very art of writing stories. As the most prolific writer of the last century still going strong into this one, King has likely told most of his stories. At this point I think he spends more time reflecting on how stories work and why they work and then finding stories that let him explore that question.Plato once wrote that \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\" Paul Ricoeur has reframed this as \\"the unnarrated life is not worth living.\\" Do we give ourselves over to utter postmodern lack of closure or is closure still essential to being human. If King was a philosopher he might want to take on Ricoeur's assertion. Perhaps. His two protagonists who tell the story of the dead body, that is no story because it \\"has no throughline,\\" is a narrativist reflecting on the art of narrating itself. The story is an artifice. The question is what makes a story.One can read King's horror novels where characterization is flattened so that plot can resolve itself, or one can read his human interest stories in which character is the essence of rich evocation. The latter is true in The Montana Kid. This is a story about what makes a story a story and whether life itself is or is not something we can narrativize. And sly author that he is, King leaves us with Stephanie's story that is realized amidst the unresolved story of a \\"kid\\" that has no throughline.In the generations to come, when Kings novels become the subject of university courses--and they will-- the Montana Kid may well serve as King's literary equivalent to Kierkegaard's \\"My Point of View as an Author.\\" What good would it be for King to write an essay on his craft of storytelling? He is not an essayist. He is a novelist. So he has written a work the allowss him to grapple with the essential question he faces as a storyteller: what is it that makes a story a story and when it comes to art, is it better to evoke character (whether in writing or in life) or narrate your own life in order to give it meaning?I had the privilege of listening to the story on tape in a 6 hour car ride--marvelously read and realized. If watching an artist question the art of narrativizing while narrativizing intrigues you, then what better writer at the outset of the 21st century can guide the question than Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The woman on the cover as well as the blurbs on the back and front of the book have nothing to do with the actual story you get once you start reading. At no point does any female character in Colorado Kid slip into a slinky cocktail dress and start up the tape recorder. The nominal heroine, Steffi is pretty much a non entity. Her only role is to be young and listen to the two old geezers who tell the tale. She does nothing and is in no danger except perhaps of being bored to death.This is not a book, really. It doesn't even cut it as a novella. It's a vignette. It's a thin slice of life from small island Maine and has no business being in the Hard Case Crimes series. Stephen King in his very odd apology/defense at the end of the book cheerfully admits that some readers will be mad by the time they finish Colorado Kid, (you got that right, Steve-O.) because it's not a fully fleshed out work. He's not interested in solving the mystery as much as he wants to do a character study of Vince, Dave, and Stef. Even the dead dude, the Colorado Kid doesn't interest him much.Reading Colorado Kid left me feeling annoyed and cheated. I can't believe that the guy who wrote The Mist, The Reach, and Shawshank Redemption would actually publish something as half baked and weak as this.When an author obviously doesn't give a hoot anymore and appears to hold his readers in contempt it's time to quit. It's been said many times that Stephen King could write a laundry list and as long his name was on the cover fans would rush to buy it. Well, after 20+ years this fan is done. I'm taking The Kid back to the store to get my refund."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Whenever a popular author deviates from his established genre he is going to alienate his comfort-seeking base. Like a steak house serving a brilliant vegan tofu, the result will be underappreciated. The stuff found here is not, I suspect, what attracted the King faithful, although I don't count myself in their fold.In addition to breaking free of traditional King, Colorado Kid also deviates from the \\"Hard Boiled\\" paradigm referenced by the cover art. A distilled gem of period noire, perhaps? The perfect thing to make my flight fly by.But enslave oneself to preconceptions, and risk missing out on a wonderful little experience. One of the few post-Stand Kings I've read is Dolores Claiborne, and its narrative style reminds me of that remarkable work. Sure, Colorado Kid is a bit of an experiment, but the boldness of the experiment makes it all the more memorable. Sure, like Claiborne, this book is dominated by dialogue, but so what? King's embrace of dialogue as a window into the culture of small-town Maine is wonderfully executed. And sure, as others have discussed, the conclusion may well differ from what one expects, but what's wrong with that? This is a quick read by any standard; the investment required by the reader is modest at best. So take it as an experiment, but a successful one. Embrace it for what it is. Well written, memorable, a window into the unfamililar. I'm very glad I stumbled across it.Dan"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I've read a ton of Stephen King's work. This book, to me, was a watered down version of Buick 8. It has a slightly different meaning though. In Buick, the meaning was \\"you can't waste your life looking for things that aren't there.\\" In Colorado Kid, it seems to be a complement to Buick's message, \\"People are inexplicably drawn to mysteries (shurg) who knows why?\\" Well... I don't know. I respected the idea of \\"a story with no ending\\" when I read Buick 8 -- though that wasn't enough to have me like the story any better -- but here, I just didn't see the point of going where he'd gone before. Sure, King always goes where he's gone before as far as characterization and setting goes, but his messages are always different and thought provoking. Here, I already had an understanding of the story just by having read Buick 8. And that sort of killed it for me. I still loved the way it was written, I always do, but this was a disappointment. But you gotta respect the guy for doing it to us again here, he does what he wants to and makes no apologies for it. Read his Afterword and tell me he hasn't any guts."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I would say that Stephen King has earned his wily old codger wings with the publication of this Hard Case Crime novel. The Colorado Kid is unlike anything King has done before. For starters, this King fan didn't even know about this little red book until after it was published. It doesn't even look like a Stephen King novel, with its nour-ish cover and provocative tease line. It didn't read like Stephen King, either - not the first chapter anyway. My first impressions were in no way encouraging. When King starts telling the story of the mystery, though, I was intrigued - so much so that I didn't put the book down until I had finished it. I can't say I'm a big fan of the ending, but I don't have a problem with it either. King does an eloquent job of explaining what he has done here in the Afterword. There, he admits that readers will most likely either love or hate the book - and I think he's right, at least to a degree. As intrigued as I was by the story, I can't say I love it, just because of that ending. Those who criticize The Colorado Kid, though, have legitimate reasons for doing so.The Colorado Kid is the initial moniker given to a middle-aged man who turned up dead on the beach of Moose-Lookit Island (off the Maine coast) back in 1980 - just another John Doe to the local cops. He would never have been identified without the help of the two old men running The Weekly Islander; they did more investigating than anyone with a badge ever did. Over the courser of a quarter of a century, they've returned time and again to the mysterious death of this stranger on their little island. They've turned up a number of facts about the dead man, every one of which only seemed to deepen and complicate the whole picture of who this man was and how he came to die there on a beach far away from his home in Colorado.In these pages, the two old newspaper men tell the story of The Colorado Kid to Stephanie, a young intern there at The Weekly Islander. It's a rite of passage in a way, showing the young lady she has been fully accepted into the local island family. It lets the two vets test their young charge while also providing her with important insights into the twin arts of journalism and storytelling. I found myself just as intrigued as Stephanie with the increasingly confusing depth of the mystery; like her, I wanted a solution to clear up all of the confusing facts. And there we have the proverbial rub.Most likely, hard-boiled crime story enthusiasts will have more problems than Stephen King fans with The Colorado Kid - although a right many of King's most loyal subjects may well balk at what the master has done in this odd endeavor off the beaten path. As long as I was flipping the pages, though, I was fully engrossed in the story - it's not vintage Stephen King storytelling, but it's pretty darn good. The trouble only comes at the end, as it's a bit of a let-down. King's Afterword, though, puts everything into perspective and changes your viewpoint of the entire story - it's the saving grace that allowed this loyal King fan to really appreciate The Colorado Kid for what it is."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I was looking forward to reading \\"The Colorado Kid\\". Being a fan of Stephen King, and of classic mystery novels, I thought it was sure to be a fine novel.The premise of the novel: two elderly men, who run the newspaper in a small Maine town, recount the town's most unusual mystery to a bright young intern.King proves with this novel that he's not just a magnificent horror writer, he's a magnificent WRITER. His storytelling ability saves the book. The mystery, while it has potential, is written in a not-so-interesting fashion, and with the lack of a resolution, one might wonder why read this book at all.The size of this book - about 180 pages - along with King's writing make this a quick, fun, but ultimately unsatisfying read. It has a good message, though, as King tells us in the afterword: it's not the resolution that counts. It's the mystery that's the greatest part. And he's right."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Steffi McCann came from Cincinnati, Ohio to Moose-Lookit Island in Maine to do an internship on the newspaper \\"The Weekly Islander\\". Her elderly bosses at the newspaper, Vince Teague and Dave Bowie, have plenty to teach her, including the fact that, unlike newspaper stories, real life doesn't always have stories that come neatly wrapped in packages with a beginning, middle, and end. To illustrate that point, they tell her the story of a body found on the beach, the body of the man they call the \\"Colorado Kid\\".Early on in this short novel, Stephen King warns readers that the mystery of the Colorado Kid will not be solved. This may keep some from reading this book, but that would be their loss. \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is a wonderful example of what Stephen King does best - create characters that you care about and want to know more about, long after you've finished reading the book. Vince and Dave are the standout characters in this book, so well written that at times I felt that they were talking to me instead of Steffi. Steffi is not written as clearly (and the book cover, which I guess is supposed to be an illustration of her, is a distraction) but King does write enough so that we know her as a character. Readers will even come to know the mysterious Colorado Kid and wonder why and how did he travel from Colorado to Maine and did he really choke to death on a piece of steak or was he murdered?Perhaps the best part is that King does not answer those questions, but lets the reader draw his or her own conclusions. To further stir debate, King hints on his website that \\"The Colorado Kid\\" may have some connection to his Dark Tower series which opens even more possibilities and more questions in this reader's mind.\\"The Colorado Kid\\" is a multi-layered and well-written book and not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The newsmen characters in this story repeatedly tell us that there is no story here.

Anyone willing to rate this novel poorly either failed to read that section of the book, or simply did not care to. Stephen King reinvents (and more importantly, reinvests) himself in our eyes with this novel, just like he once did with Through the Eyes of the Dragon, proving he is not just a famous author but, quite frankly, a real human being. One that shares hopes and dreams and has more than just a semblence of being humane. Let us not forget that actors, writers and athletes (I'll even say politicians) are real people too, ones that were small children that cried and hoped and dreamed...and (point being) loved life, and clearly still do.

The characters shoot down any pausible reasoning, in order to keep it from having an ending.\\\\I will say this for King, I will remember this story, like it no, rember it yes, reccomend it, .........."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I know all books start out boring. The author needs to set up the characters.In this book the entire first chapter is a waste of time. In the book two oldmen tell a story to a young secretary and in the story that they tell leavesmore questions than answers. Stephan King got off to a good start and I wouldgive 5 stars if the author answered all those questions. I have read otherHard Case Crime books and most of them are good, so try one of those instead."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I enjoy Stephen King, especially on audio-book. This, though, was so boring that I quit half way through. I think that Stephen King was more interested in giving us a taste of Maine than he was in telling a good story. Don't waste your time like I did."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Picking this up, I thought it would be about an old, unsolved mystery that is finally solved. Spoiler - nope. It never gets solved. The story itself is based on the characters and how they live and dwell on old, unsolved cases, about how they can never just let them go. As a character study, it is interesting. As a story, a bore. I was frustrated by the end, felt like I had wasted a few hours of my life and for what? An unsolved case to remain unsolved? I see what King was getting at, I really do, but it still failed for me because at the end of the day I want answers and closure, thats why I read. Realistically, sure, there are unsolved cases, but we read to get that certain closure we cannot get in daily life, an escape with an ending. Will this story stick with me? Absolutely, but in a frustrating way. Bleh."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Unlike numerous other reviewers, I really enjoyed this novel. Although very different than expected, that is Stephen King's great contribution to the crime genre - something different. Any book that holds my interest and causes me to ponder the results long after I finish the book, is to me a good read. Here's my review:Stephanie McCann's three-month internship at The Weekly Islander placed her under the tutelage of two long-time journalists, the entire staff at the helm of the Moose-Lookit Islands newspaper. Vince Teague was ninety years old and Dave Bowie was twenty-five years his junior.After a frustrating luncheon trying to pull information from the two longtime writers, a Baltimore Globe reporter hightailed it back to the mainland. Following his abrupt departure, the two men decided school was in session for their young intern by relating the circumstances of a John Doe mystery that occurred on the island twenty-five years before.The master storytellers, the Islander writers and Stephen King, begin a tale about two teenagers who find the body of a man leaning against a trash barrel on the island beach. No identification and no clues as to how he got there, or why, were found at the scene.As the men slowly reveal the steps taken to solve the mystery, Stephanie soon realizes she is sitting at the proverbial feet of two of the best journalistic tutors around. As the story unfolds, it soon becomes apparent how quickly law enforcement can set aside a case when there is little to go on and other cases call for attention, not to mention the lack of interest by the two detectives from the Attorney Generals office.If not for the curiosity of Paul Devane, a young graduate student in forensic science undergoing a three-month internship with the less-than-stellar detectives, the identity of John Doe may never have surfaced. As it was, it took sixteen months to identify the body. However, could anyone ever explain how he came to be on the beach that night?In The Colorado Kid, Stephen King intertwines the story of the mysterious stranger with the obvious love and respect the two old storytellers have for one another and their desire to lead their intern into a deeper level of knowledge and desire for investigative reporting. King masterfully walks the reader through the investigative process in this apparently unsolvable case.Long known as a writer of paranormal thrillers, King also profoundly digs deep into the soul of man with gripping accuracy. He leads the reader on a compelling, thorough, and haunting character study. Once the reader begins this story, he or she may as well settle in, it is that difficult to close this book until the thought-provoking finish.The Colorado Kid (Hard Case Crime)"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I found the book as a whole to be pleasantly breezy reading. There is no serious plot twist or deep subtext. The point is to enjoy the art of story telling. You are supposed to sit back, enjoy the late August sunshine and the familial bond that is developing.For that reason it may have been better suited as a novella in a short story collection. With a reduced font size, and line spacing, it could have been shortened by fifteen pages or more. Tucked in, as a delicious extra would have leant it more weight. However, as packaged, it was bound to raise some hackles. It was packaged in a way that gave certain expectations. A certain assumption is made when that little orange/gold ribbon is seen. When the expectations and assumptions weren't met people were guaranteed to get mad.Maybe that is the biggest knock against this book. The author failed to deliver a book that fit into the expectations of the imprint's loyal readers. Then the publisher decided to publish it anyway.My biggest complaint was the slow start. It takes at least forty pages to get started. Not bad if it was an epic like \\"The Stand.\\" Not good when it is less than two hundred pages and readers are expecting a roaring blaze of pulp fun.It is no worse than any of Stephen Kings lesser works. Which means it is still better than the average. It is just a little slow and fails to fulfill conventional expectations. I would recommend picking it up at the library. It is no more than a quick read for an afternoon on vacation."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I love Stephen King's writing. His writing in this book is great, but the story does not deliver a solid mystery that you'll be happy with.The charachters are interesting, and the story seems to be going somewhere, but in the end ...well lets just say there is no end.Maybe that is the creative mind of the Great Stephen King. Maybe he did this for some strange reason, maybe fifty years from now someone will find hidden clues within the story that will make us look at this story differntly. But perhaps not.Nonetheless ...it's a quick read, a good beach book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King tries to justify why he doesn't have an ending by explaining the theory of newspaper reporting.Unfrotunately, this is a novel, and he needs an ending.King fanatics will no doubt find a way to call this brilliant storytelling and call the rest of us morons for wanting everything wrapped up in a nice bow.But the best mysteries are the ones where an impossible situation is set up and the resolution explains all, or at least enough to make us say \\"Wow!\\"All I said was \\"huh?\\"I haven't really liked anything by him since \\"The Green Mile\\", so factor that into this review."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The problem with being Stephen King is that you can publish anything you want and expect it to sell on the basis of your name alone. King could probably sell rewrites of his local telephone book if he put his mind to it. But just because you can publish anything you want doesn't necessarily mean that you should.Take \\"The Colorado Kid\\" as a case-in-point. The book, which is really a novella masquerading as a full-length novel, is a confused and ultimately unsatisying tale that meanders lazily through 180 pages of tripe before suddenly grinding to a halt. After reading it, one suspects that King had no idea what he was doing when he started writing and that he ended up the same way as well. Instead of tabling it, as he should have, he figured what the heck? and foisted it on this small publishing house, which simply couldn't pass up a Stephen King manuscript, no matter how mediocre it might be.The problem with \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is that it is both tepid and flavorless. Two old newspaper men sit around and chew their gums with their pretty young intern, relating a mystery that really isn't very interesting to begin with. Then, without warning, the story just ends. In a ponderous and tiring afterword King tells us that life is like that, with not much of a middle and certainly nothing in the way of a denoument. But most of us knew that before we picked the book up in the first place. Why can't King just give us what we paid for?I suspect its because he doesn't know how. For more than two decades, King has been publishing absurd fiction stocked with ridiculous characters and situations. Works like \\"Insomnia,\\" in which evil takes the shape of a giant fish in a rocking chair, aptly demonstrates that the man is well past his prime. It might be better for all of us if he just hung his hat up altogether.In the long run, this particular work may prove to be more damaging than helpful for Hard Case publishers, since it will be the first one that most readers buy. Because the book is so underwhelming, it isn't difficult to imagine a scenario in which might-have been consumers decide to pass on the hundred of other titles this company has in the works. Hopefully that won't happen. Hopefully other big name authors, like Donald Westlake and Lawrence Block, will be able to make up for the deficit created by this book. The thing is, those other books better be really good, because \\"The Colorado Kid\\" leaves a lot to make up for."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"First, this book has some truth-in-advertising issues. At 180 pages this has the appearance of a novel, and at $5.99 is almost priced like a novel, but the type is large and the lines are widely spaced and I estimate the word count to be about 40,000 words: barely a novella. \\"Different Seasons,\\" priced at $7.99, has just about four times as much content.Second, when a novel--I mean novella--is published by \\"Hard Case Crime,\\" with a cover illustration of a female reporter and the catchphrase \\"Would She Learn The Dead Man's Secret?\\" one might be forgiven for expecting this to be a crime novel in the mould of Dashiell Hammett. Back-cover copy which refers to \\"echoes of Dashiell Hammett\\" does nothing to dispell such an impression. Such an impression would be wrong.The book does not resemble Dashiell Hammett (and, despite being a story about the mysterious seaside death of a man with something inexplicable in his mouth, it does not resemble Robertson Davies' _The Manticore,_ either).Once you start to read the novel--I mean, novella--King does make it clear that the mystery is never going to be resolved. The entire book consists of two old reporters for a small Maine newspaper spinning a yarn about an unsolved mystery to a young intern. One might hope that the younger reporter will eventually going to solve the mystery after all, but the book, unlike the jacket copy, telegraphs plainly that this is unlikely to happen.Unfortunately, this just does not make for a satisfying book, and all of Kings' characters' philosophical musings about how life is like that does not change the matter.A short story can be a plotless \\"slice of life.\\" A full-length novel can be episodic and picaresque. But a novella really has to go somewhere and resolve somehow.Like King's unfinished online novel \\"The Plant,\\" this work leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It seems lazy, self-indulgent, and too transparently an effort to commercialize material that just isn't top-drawer.Like Stephen King, Jack London was a fabulously successful writer, a lover of \\"the terrible and tragic in fiction,\\" a storyteller whose forte was \\"strength of utterance.\\" Like King, he had trouble inventing plots. The difference is that Jack London bought plots--from no less a person than the young Sinclair Lewis.Stephen King could do worse than buy plots from someone."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The book was OK but not really a typical Stephen King novel. I had high expectations due to the TV show Haven but I was a little disappointed. Not enough wierd things happening I guess."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Really liked this book. SK creates such likable characters & I would love to hang out with Dave & Vince!I love how the end of this book provides a great transition into the TV series Haven.Good book!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"As an avid King fan, I bought this book to complete my collection. I found that it is essentially King in how the narrative flows so simply and how the reading is so easy. I was immediately caught up in the story being told and had a strong affinity for the characters after just a few pages, which is a typical King quality that I enjoy in his books. The book is a very short read, and thoroughly enjoyable, except for the ending. You'll have to read it to see what you think, but I was a bit disappointed.With the caveat about the ending, I would still recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Two aging journalists relate the tale of a body mysteriously appearing one day on the beach front of an island off the coast of Maine.

The whole time I was reading, I was wondering where is this story going?"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Been watching Haven - and wanted to read the source material. About half way thru - and clearly the book was just a jumping off point. Not some of King's best - but worthwhile..."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"For an avid horror/suspense reader and a long-time Stephen King fan, The Colorado Kid was an easy read. As usual, King focuses on getting to know the essential characters, in this case, the people trying to make sense of an unsolved cold case. The usual supernatural evidence, alien contact, and everything eventually leading to a big final twist, however, was missing in this story. Rather than writing from a place that knows all and sees all, in this story, King writes from a real place where real people may never know the reasons behind the actions of other real people. If you can read a book that asks you to accept the unanswered or be brave enough to search for the answers yourself, you will enjoy The Colorado Kid as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I decided to read this because the television show Haven on the syfy channel is based on it. I was not disappointed, it's a classic Steven King story told so that you feel like you're in New England and can almost smell the salt air just from reading the story told in the natives language. Anyone who wants to read a story that explains the ultimate mystery should give this a try."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"To be totally truthful, I was a bit angry when I discovered that, in the end, that \\"the truth\\" would not be revealed.Then about a minutes later (still in my car) I realized the reason; the novel itself is a parallel to the untold truth in the novel.I can't say any more without revealing too much.What I can say is that while I'm a relative neophyte to King's writings (I've only read \\"Misery\\", \\"Salem's Lot\\" and \\"The Talisman\\" ... I've also listened to the unabridged audiobook, \\"Duma Key\\") I read enough and heard enough and seen enough screen adaptations (for good or for bad) to know that \\"charming\\" is not an adjective that one would normally use to describe the tone of his works.There have been charming settings to be sure. Charming people aplenty.But tone? Not really. Not that I've encountered.That's another reason why this audiobook was such a treat. I didn't feel like I was on the edge of my seat with horrible fear. I was on the edge of my seat because a master storyteller was writing about 2 master storytellers telling an unbelievable mystery.It caught me and held me. And Mr. DeMunn's narration works perfectly.Well done, Mr. King. (Of course, I don't need to tell you.)"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I love Stephen King which is why I was so disappointed in this. The quick rundown is this: It's almost two hundred pages of story that could have easily been wrapped up in 100 (maybe even less). But it's still King and if your a fan I suggest you check it out for yourself. He has always been a fan of detail. His books are huge for a reason, because they have so much detail in backstory, geography and the description of events that there is a pretty good guareente that they will be weighing down your backpack.The story reaches to entrance the reader with the beauty of mystery (something David Lynch has mastered). Yet, the mystery that is given us is really, well, not all that interesting. Like I said it's a mystery that could have been summed up pretty quick but instead King decides to dop us hints every twenty pages or so. That's all and good, that's what a good mystery is supposed to look like, but what is in between is what makes this short novel drag. the characters sit and think how interesting it is that this case has never been solved. They stew over details we've already spent ten pages stewing over. They look back to evidence that we've already looked back to. It just feels like King had written a short story and tried to strrreeettccchhh it as far as possible.But, like I said, whatever he writes, I'll read and for as many books that he's has written a strike out here and there is expected. Sorry but just didn't like it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Let me start by saying that I really don't like Stephen King's novels. I read this as over the last summer I became addicted to the Sy Fy Channel show Haven which was apparently based on The Colorado Kid. The show is BASED on the novel. To avoid spoiling the book, I will sum it up the same way I have summed up many Stephen King books and movies: the story itself was great, but the end left me disappointed."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am willing to bet most readers chose this book because of the famous author. Stephen King is a very talented writer and that talent is minimally displayed in this book, although I have given it only 2 stars.King fails in his most important job of character development. All three of the main characters are immediately forgettable. I think King could have done better with developing his characters. Also, the trivial twists and turns are painfully dull.Reading the book is like listening to a long joke where at the end, it is not even funny and you feel as if you had been cheated out of the time you spent listening.However, if you are looking for 2 hours to kill (yes, I am a slow reader, so you can easily complete this book in two hours), the book maybe better than watching TV.Plot:Two Veteran Newspaper publishers in a sleepy town on the Maine coast tell a story of the most baffling death they had every investigated to one of their new promising reporters."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"A clever short, one I read in under four hours to give you some idea of its length, The Colorado Kid is less about the ending than the journey. King treats us to a day in the life of three characters and allows the reader to see the bonding between two elderly gentlemen and a young woman who is fulfilling an internship at their small newspaper. The story itself is one that relies on the reader to have patience and the ability to see what isn't there all the while making sense of what we are being told. If you're a fan of mysteries and the unexplained, this one could be for you. If you're a fan of tidy, happy endings with clear resolution....run. The closing thoughts from Mr. King were touchingly revealing, to my way of thinking, and left me satisfied with the conclusion of the story.There was a recurring point made between the lines that leads me to one conclusion never explored. I won't reveal that for those of you who've not yet read the story, but, would welcome discussion with others who've completed the tale. The possibilities make this a great read for crime buffs, I should state.For TV fans, this story is the basis (idea?) for the SyFy channel series, Haven."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is a perplexing book in many ways. When I first heard about six months ago that Stephen King was contributing a story to the Hard Case Crime series, I was pretty excited. He's had a couple of short stories in past collections that could readily be classified as being in the \\"hard boiled\\" mold, and I was envisioning something stylistically similar. Goodness knows, King can write in a variety of styles when called upon (see EYES OF THE DRAGON or THE BREATHING METHOD). Then, on Amazon, I saw a photo of the cover, and was ever more convinced that we'd be getting King Does Hammett, or at least King Does Westlake.However, THE COLORADO KID (despite a \\"hard-boiled\\" title) is fairly standard King fare...set in Maine, on an island, no less. It mostly involves two elderly newspapermen telling a young, female intern the story of a great, unsolved mystery that took place decades before on that little island. There is nothing hard-case crime about it, that I can tell. It's even questionable that there was any crime involved.It's a pleasant enough story, and has an easy manner and creates a nice sense of mood and place. It does NOT live up to its cover at all...in fact, the young lady in the book never holds a tape recorder, nor would I imagine she is dressed quite like the bombshell on the cover. It's a bit surprising that the makers of the book would mislead us so much, since this little novelette is their chance to draw in a mass audience to their likeable series of books.Putting the deception aside, the story itself is frustrating. I have read many books in my life that leave the reader dangling at the end. It's always a frustrating experience and often it is justified, but in this case, I felt as though King had nothing else to say other than \\"hey, sometimes you don't get answers.\\" That's true enough, but did I need to spend a couple of hours of my life to be reminded of something I already knew? There's no other real point to the story. It hasn't taken us on a journey of the soul or the mind. It has simply unspooled a mystery for us. \\"Look, here's something unexplained that happened. Nope, don't know why.\\"As always, King's writing is excellent and smoothly flowing. He's remarkably specific about the details of his surroundings in this book, and we really feel how living on this little island soaks into your soul and makes it hard to leave. We feel the chill in the air. We feel the small-town atmosphere. That's all well and good, and King writes with an ease in this story that comes from knowing and loving your setting and your people. But in the end, I have to admit I felt betrayed. King's Afterward doesn't cut it, as far as I'm concerned. Much like his on-line publication THE PLANT, which he abandoned halfway through, I felt like he couldn't be bothered. I paid for my regular installments of that story, anticipating a resolution. With THE COLORADO KID, I paid my money for a complete story, and felt abandoned.I am a HUGE King fan, and have read everything of his I can get my hands on, and will continue to do so. His good (and great) stories far and away make up for any little hiccups along the way. THE COLORADO KID is a hiccup."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This book suffers from the same symptom that M. Night Shaymaylan's The Village movie suffers from. You can't advertise and sell a book as being in a certain genre and have the \\"twist\\" be that the story is actually in another genre.If not labeled a Hard Case Crime story, but instead labeled a reporter coming of age story, it might have worked. At least at the two to three star rating level. But to advertise as a Crime novel and violate the zero-th rule, to have a complete story is worse than violating many of the other spelled out crime novel rules, like no character introduced in the last 10% of the story can be the killer, etc. The zero-th rule isn't normally spelled out because any writer and reader just knows that rule and normally would never think of violating it. By violating it Mr. King dares our wrath and deserves it.This story was quite a come down after I just read the excellent Bag of Bones."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"King has certainly demonstrated his ability to master various styles, and some of his previous works have included elements of the \\"hard-boiled detective genre\\" that this series is meant to emulate. However, there is very little in this novella that compares favorably to the writers King expresses such admiration for.The entire story involves two elderly newspapermen relating an unsolved mystery to a young female intern. The mystery itself is curious and somewhat interesting to ponder, but the brief length of the novel and the context in which it is written--essentially a long three-person dialogue--prevents much in the way of detail, character development, or motive. The idea, apparently, is for us to appreciate the mysteries of life, and recognize that reality is more complex than the standard detective novel with few clean wrap-ups. Towards this end, there is no resolution to the novel. What is more frustrating is the scarcity of information available for us to ponder. We know far more about the storytellers than the subject of the mystery, so how are we supposed to play with theories or hypotheses?As always, King focuses on setting place and defining characters. In this case, however, I found the asides and tangents annoying; if the book is going to be less than 200 pages, I would have liked more of it devoted to plot or details about the victim, rather than repeated comments about the young woman's attempts to impress the newsmen and their fondness for her. It is a fast read, but not a particularly enjoyable one."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"No Grit...No Teeth...No Real Mystery... Nothing Noir...How was this book even remotely relevant to the publisher, Hard Case Crime? It wasn't \\"Hard\\" when stereotypical New England duffers recount quaint and whimsically in their safe little newspaper offices the tale. And a \\"Crime\\" was never established. No danger... No peril...It was long on characterization, short on plot. And gripping plot and action is what sparks life in good mysteries--not King's folksiness. This isn't a new genre, or something ground-breaking, it seems to be exploring a self-indulgent fancy.I count The Green Mile as one of my all-time favorites, but this was a real disappointment. Hope his career doesn't end on this sad note"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried. It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery? That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book. I can't believe that I was asking too much. Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of \\"Welcome to Maine!\\""},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"For my money nobody, and I mean nobody, can do it like Stephen King. Sure, he has come up with a couple of stinkers. Cell was nothing more than a different version of The Stand. I could have done without Dreamcatcher. Deaperation left me flat and I just could not get into the Tommyknockers. I may be a fan, but I do not have blind allegiance.However, King shines with his short stories and shows us what an incredible writer he is. Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is probably in my top five favorite stories of all time. I've read it a dozen times, if not more, and will read a dozen more time before everything is said and done.I'm not going to say that The Colorado Kid ranks up there with the Shawshank. What story can? It's missing the heart that Shawshank had. Where Shawshank was a pretty large, sweeping narrative Kid is tight and compressed. But, it's good nonetheless. What makes The Colorado Kid such an enjoyable read is the dialogue.Very few authors alive today can write dialogue like King can. Most authors have to tell you how the character is saying something. It may be a simple \\"he said\\" or a \\"(insert one character here) screamed at (insert another character here)\\". Not King. He lets the dialogue and the pacing of the story do that for him. We know how a character feels when he or she is saying something. We know why they are saying what they are saying.Yes, I know that there are a lot of people out there that can't stand it when he writes the characters using a Maine(New England) accent. All that I can say is that you have never read Faulkner. Faulkner wrote the majority of his characters with a Mississippi or southern accent. Here's another little secret-King, when he is writing his short stories and stories set in his native state, is a regional writer. It just so happens that unlike some regional writers whose work rarely leaves the region King is read internationally. So, I guess it would be fare to call King a regionally international writer.In Kid, as with Shawshank, we get some very well developed characters. Vince Teague and Dave Bowie (ok, not the most inspired name ever ) are the aged newspapermen and Stephanie McCann is the newbie they have taken under their wing. By the end of the novel we know these characters like they were are friends and neighbors. We even get a sense of who the waitress at the restaurant is in only a few lines. This is the power of King. He can show us, not tell us, so much in so few pages. That's the power that King has with the written word.Some people may not like The Colorado Kid. King says so himself in the afterward. But, for anyone that likes a mystery you will enjoy it. Is it a mystery where everything is tidied up in a nice and clean at the end? No, not in the least bit. Sure, we get the sense that Stephanie will carry on at the paper, writing stories and news features for the islanders. However, the big mystery goes on after you turn the last page. King let's you decide for yourself why and how a man from Colorado ends up dead on beach in Maine. Maybe that is the point of the novel; nothing in life is ever as clear-cut as we want it to be.Read the Colorado Kid. It's a short read, but a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I love the Haven series on SciFI and had hoped it would be a little more like it.

Say what you will about Stephen King, you must admit he is a master at his craft. That being said, when I finished this book and read his afterward (always a highlight of his books, in my opinion), he said that most people would either love this book or hate this book, with virtually no one taking the middle ground.I'm one of those middle grounders.This book was written for the Hard Case Crime imprint, a publisher dedicated to writing little paperback mystery/crime books that hearken back to the old days. There was a crime, yes; there were a great many clues to the crime, yes. However, this book focused more on three characters who happen to be interested in the crime than in the actual crime itself.Now, ordinarily, this wouldn't bother me in a King book at all. After all, King is a genius when it comes to characterization. I will always maintain that his Roland of Gilead is one of the most interesting characters created . . . ever. But, for an imprint called HardCase Crime, I was expecting more noir and less conversation about the crime. And those characters he spotlights, while very charismatic, still seemed to be missing something to make them completely dynamic. The dialogue felt a bit too easy, and the characters a bit too obvious. I still loved them, nonetheless, but not as much as other King characters.As always, his setting is expertly rendered, giving you just enough to see the water, smell the air, feel the chilly breeze, taste the fish and chips, and hear the voices. Less is more, and King has a firm grasp of this notion.All in all, this was an entertaining read. Most of you folks could probably finish it in a day or two, and you'll keep turning page after page. But, I think King is right, by the end of the book, you will either love it or hate it. Unless you're like me, and see little things you both love and hate, appreciating the good and the bad. After all, few of us could ever entertain the notion of doing better than Stephen King at writing.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Sometimes in life no matter how much you know you still don't have what you need to solve the question.

Hundreds of people with shaggy dogs show up at his house, each with a dog shaggier than the one before. The story goes on and on, building tension as the man rejects dog after dog as not shaggy enough even though each dog is shaggier than the one before.Finally a man shows up with an unbelievably shaggy dog. You describe the dog's amazing shagginess at length. Then, the man comes out, takes a look, and turns up his nose. \\"Too shaggy,\\" he says.The point of the joke is the gigantic letdown at the end.\\"The Colorado Kid\\" follows this pattern to a T.But shaggy dog stories are still stories. And, perversely, King has written a meditation on stories by telling one that heads to a let down, because the central mystery, how did the body of a Coloradan end up dead on a Maine beach just hours after he disappeared from Colorado, is left a mystery at the end.King has violated a central tenet inherent in Hard Case Crime. The story has no plausible resolution. I credit King with writing it and I credit Hard Case crime for publishing a risky book.But I didn't like it that much."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"\\"The Colorado Kid\\" is Stephen King's contribution to the fine Hard Case Crime series. I haven't read much of King's recent work, but I love the Hard Case Crime series and was curious to see what King would do within this series. Unfortunately, the book was a bit of a disappointment, although I give King major credit for helping to bring attention to this series. The book starts with a bit of a riddle; two old journalists for a small-time newspaper on an island off Maine meet with a reporter from the Boston Globe. When the Globe reporter departs, he leaves $100 to pay for the lunch. The Maine journalists take the money and then ask the fourth partner in the lunch, a young female intern, to explain why she thinks they're taking the money. Their riddle is a test for the intern, as is the main \\"mystery\\" of the Colorado Kid.It turns out that the two Maine journalists, Dave Bowie (65-year-old editor) and Vince Teaugue (90-year-old founder of the paper), are mentors of sort to the intern, and they are trying to figure out whether she is worthy of their hard work. The intern is a beautiful 22-year-old midwesterner, Stephanie McCann. She's been at the paper for a few months, covering local happenings for the Arts and Things column. In other words, she's writing glamorous stories about barn dances and church picnics. However, she's eager to learn and actually seems to understand that these two old coots have some important lessons to teach her. Something the Globe reporter failed to see when he talked to the two old men about local mysteries. The more patient Stephanie asks the men if they have ever come across a true unsolved mystery, and they begin to tell her the story of the Colorado Kid, which takes the rest of the novel to unfold. The Colorado Kid was a dead man found on a beach on their small island. At first, it appears that he died of natural causes by choking on a piece of steak; no one is able to identify the man or get further information. However, slowly over time, the two journalists work the story and figure out who the man was, which unleashes a bigger mystery.As others have explained, \\"The Colorado Kid\\" doesn't contain many answers. The two old journalists explain to Stephanie that most people prefer mysteries with only one or two unknown elements. This book contain many \\"unknowns,\\" so expect some ambiguity. Unfortunately, the main \\"mystery\\" is not as compelling as I'd like and the two old journalists tend to blend together into one character (especially on the audio version I'm reviewing). The cover is also a bit misleading, as this book is not a sexy hard-boiled crime novel. However, I appreciated some of the ideas explored in the book; plus, I suspected a bit of a shaggy dog story from the beginning, so I was perhaps less disappointed than others might be. In the end, \\"The Colorado Kid\\" comes up short - a noble failure for a worthy press."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I was very much into the story. I feel it was well written and the characters were very well developed, as is always the case with Stephen King. I was held by the story and actually read through the book extremely quickly as I was \\"sucked into\\" the story completely. The only really problem I have is the ending. It seems Mr. King has come to the point in his life where he doesn't mind leaving things untied in his stories. He would chastise me for saying this as someone who doesn't understand or who puts too much stock in the ending instead of the journey getting there. Maybe so, but I still like to have endings a little neater than what we get from this book. I am not going to go into details and provide spoilers for it, but I was disappointed upon reaching the last page with where I was left by this ending."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Count me in on the 50% of this book's general audience who loved it (rather than hated it, as the author charmingly suggests in the afterword).I don't want to give away any spoilers,suffice it to say that this book, which contains noreal horror in the traditional King fashion,is a refreshing turn to the dimestore mystery novelof that fading age of pulp fiction.However, that being said, this is no nostalgic \\"re-enactment\\" nor painted attempt at revisiting the lost noir grittiness of the Raymond Chandlers of that bygone era; rather, it focuses on the sterling clarity of the present day, and sets the narrative stage on an island off the coast of Maine, where a young newslady is interning at a local paper, and listens to the two oldtimers who run it while they relay the story of \\"the Colorado Kid\\" to her. A story within a story, so to speak.This is an easy, short read, and I find it quite remarkable in subverting the standard tropes of the mystery genre w/such ease that the reader can't help but feel they are being guided by the hand of a master storyteller.Which, of course, they indeed are.I can only recommend this book to those with an open mind, and no expectations.At the book's end, you should find a rewarding outcome upon thoughtful reflection . . . I know the author did; and so did I."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I happen to be a long time fan of Stephen King and I grabbed the book as soon as it came out. But even Stephen King should give us a story with an ending.

Only thing I can see it copies is the two old newspaper men. Besides that let down, the mystery in the book is never solved. As far as I am concerned, this was a totally bad purchase."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is just a really fun story!!! Great characters and lots of surprising twists!! They developed tha TV show from this story."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"In The Colorado Kid by Stephen King, there is are three news reporters in a town where a murder happened twenty-five years ago. Stephanie was a very determined person by saying \\"Back on message, please, both of you.\\" She really wanted to know what happened in the murder. Dave and Vince are old men who are news reporters as well. They know almost every detail and fact about the unsolved murder. Stephanie is a young woman who just moved to an island off the coast of Main. This story is based in 2005 but the murder was in the eighty's. This book is a mystery crime case. Stephen King did well on flashbacks although all of the complex detail got very confusing and hard to follow. You sometimes would have to read the page over a few times to finaly understand it. The present time was easy to follow though. The problem in this book is that these three people were trying to figure out the mystery and explain it to Stephanie at the same time. People who are older would enjoy this book because it is to detailed and complex for younger children to understand. Mystery books are my favorite for example The Westing Game. There was always an unexplained thing in both of these books. I prefer when the mystery gets solved though. This book is different than other books because the mystery stays unsolved. I have never read a book by Stephen King and I think I will remain that way after reading this book. This author uses amazing detail and his writtings are smooth but when so much detail is combined, it gets confusing. The eggining of the book was good but it went dowmhill from there. I read this book the only way you canto understand it a little bit better. I read it in one chunk because if you read it in peices, you would forget it. Although this book was not the best, I bet that his other books that Stephen King wrote are better."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"It's a mistake to bill this novel as a mystery. It would be more accurate to say it is an unsolved mystery. I gave the novel 3 stars (more like 2-1/2 really), for the interesting characters, intriguing premise, and good pacing, but the ending just falls flat. Writers of unsolved mysteries (think Jack the Ripper or Lizzie Borden) give the reader their theories or versions of events -- that's the point of writing about an unsolved mystery, isn't it? If you are a mystery fan or a Stephen King horror fan, you aren't going to like this book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"If you've read the other reviews & comments here, you are forewarned that this is an odd book. The cover is misleading and it's probably overpriced. But I found it a fine antidote to the over-plotted, heavy-breathing, high-death-count word-products that dominate the fiction world these days.What you get instead are three surprisingly real characters shooting the breeze on a fall afternoon on a sleepy island off the coast of Maine, discussing a weird story from the past that ends up going mostly nowhere. Yet something quite important to the three chatters keeps percolating in the background, and that story definitely does go somewhere.If money's an issue, maybe your library has it... it's worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"For those who like a neat ending to their stories, you'll be disappointed. King doesn't offer a wrap-up here. What he does is explain a mystery and leave you with the narrators' guesses as to what happened. Their guesses and possitilities, mixed with a few nearly impossible elements of the story, are what makes this short novel so like so many other king novels. A sense of awe and wonderment. A story to make you say \\"hmmm?\\" Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I know Stephen King loves the pulp genre; so do I. The difference is that I didn't slap together half a novella and try to cash in on pulp's recent resurgence. King did.When King is good he's very good, but when he's bad he's self-indulgent and maddening. The Colorado Kid is an example of the latter. Three overly cutesy, annoyingly precious two-dimensional characters chug tea, cokes and coffee while recounting a not-very-interesting \\"mystery\\" from years ago: a man is found dead (he choked on a sandwich) and no one is sure why he was at the spot where he was found dead.The resolution? There is none. None.King just sets up the \\"mystery\\"--what little there is of it--and then types THE END. In a five-page afterword King explains that the story was meant to illustrate that we all live in \\"a web of mystery.\\"Oh brother."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Fans Of Spilane, Hammett and Gardner rejoiced when this line of books came out. Others wondered how Stephen King would approach the idea. This book is sort of like turning on The Maltese Falcon and getting Singing in the Rain. There is nothing wrong with the latter but it is not what you expect. In the Hard Case Crime line of books you have certain expectations of what will be between the covers. King delivers an interesting and entertaining tale and a good look at how many people see mysteries and why they are fascinated by them. But what you won't find in an actual crime. Not even a perceived one.An apprentice journalist working on a small Maine island is told the story of the Colorado Kid, and unsolved local mystery that isn't a mystery to most. Two old newspaper men walk her through the facts as that is all they have. There is no story to their mystery and nor real theories. But the way they relate the story is very entertaining. In the end we have a good tale but not one that works for most mystery fans. No crime. No real case. No answers. No theories. Not even a mostly-solved case (i.e. \\"I wonder what really happened to the money?\\"). If you approach this book as a Stephen King book you will probably be pleased. If you approach it as a Hard Case Crime title you will probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm a Stephen King fan from way back and have read just about everything he's written to date. Although this is a bit different from his horror work, I enjoyed it greatly. I definitely recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"There are two things that are apt to happen upon reading The Colorado Kid, the latest outing by legendary horror writer Stephen King. In fact, there are apt to be more than a few things that happen after reading the author's latest yarn, ayuh, and a fascinating yarn it is. King remains an underrated contemporary master of storytelling and if there is any question as to whether his talent has waned over the years after producing nearly 50 novels, including the unforgettable Carrie, The Shining, Cujo and The Stand, that query is properly answered here.What is often forgotten about King, despite the fact that he has singlehandedly changed and saved the direction of contemporary horror, is that sans horror he is an excellent storyteller. In The Colorado Kid, King lends his talents to a line of hard case crime pulp fiction novels issued recently by Dorchester Publishing, which include other authors such as Richard Aleas (Little Girl Lost), Max Phillips (Fade to Blonde) and Wade Miller (Touch of Evil). They are softcover dime store novel sized books your father probably carried in his coat pocket, and are designed to look like such with their Orbik drawn covers featuring sultry sirens and suspicious looking men in overcoats.Kid is the story of two old newspapermen from Maine who spend one afternoon telling their intern about a mystery involving a man who was found dead on a beach back in 1980. Nearly twenty-six years later the men tell the story in relish, but the more they explain to the inquisitive intern the less she understands. What baffles both the intern and the reader is that nothing makes sense, including why the man was on the beach, where he was from, what he was doing in Maine, how he got to a remote region of Maine as quickly as he did, and last but not least, was he murdered.The audience is apt to be confounded as King teases and rivets the reader to such an intriguing tale, all the while egging them on to solve the mystery before the end of the book. With King's talent for relaying New England dialogue, the tale comes off as comfortably as a fireside ghost story, and the reader is likely not to get enough in turning this case six ways to Sunday in order to solve it. What is also apt to happen is that the reader is likely to take issue with how the author resolves the matter, but that's neither here nor there as the issue is the mystery itself.King's protagonists, Dave and Vince, are old fogeys we've seen in previous works by this author, in particular The Storm of the Century, and his ingenue Stephanie is a variation on his previous heroines. All the same this short novel is a gem and King as comfortable and reliable as a favorite pair of shoes, taking us on a journey through not only an intriguing mystery but also once again the way of life of the New Englander, who keep secrets to themselves, say the word fair as fay-yuh, and the word ayuh as if a variation on the words Oh, yeah!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The voices are verily realistic. Their slang is captured with the author's skilful ear and concise writing. They are two gentlemen being attentive to their younger counterpart at a tiny news agency on a small island. The schooling is unique and the girl has to use all her senses to determine the flow and outcome of the mystery being told. Taking place on an island the rule differs from the mainland, the girl quickly realizes. She listens with great interest about two teenagers finding a dead man on a beach. Dave and Vince take turn narrating where questions from the youngest of the three are welcomed and duly answered. It is up to Stephanie to fill in the blanks alongside the reader. The lively banters in the language of the locals prod the storytelling forward with magnificent ease of smoothness. Mr. King has come a long way in capturing his audience's curiosity and this time it is no exception. Nevertheless, the ending might not satisfy a lot of people."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I just finished this book and I have more questions now than I did before getting started.Told with his usual flair for realistic dialog, King keeps you interested the whole time. However, when everything is said and done, you have to wonder why you ever allowed yourself to get involved.I'm a huge fan of his work, and this is the most let down I've been yet. I can see what he was going for, but in the end, you just feel ripped off."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"THE COLORADO KID doesn't sit on any fences. You're either going to love it or hate it.I love the Hard Case Crime series. I reviewed them in the Cemetery Dance newsletter last year. Briefly, they're a darned good series, with some solid novels from the past and some hard-hitting novels from the present. Check out GRIFTER'S GAME, THE CONFESSION, 361 and others.I think Stephen King has done a great thing for this little company, giftwrapping them this kind of instant publicity. They sure deserve it.The novel (novella) itself is a charming read. The two old boys will win your heart if you've got an ounce of countrified wannabe in your veins. I wouldn't call it noir, and I certainly wouldn't call it hardboiled, but back in the day a lot of books were written that didn't necessarily shoehorn neatly into any given genre. Who the heck says that THE COLORADO KID has to fit in any certain spot?This isn't a book for folks who want their knots tied up. This doesn't have the answers printed on the back pages. This is an anecdote, and a quiet little dissertation on the lost art of oral storytelling.Give it a whirl. It's a good read. It's a short read. And you'll want to check out some of the other books put out by this up and coming little company.I recommend them highly."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I found the style and pace engaging. It is the ending that leaves me uncomfortable. The reader is left wondering what the real story is. It is both frustrating and engaging. I keep finding myself proposing endings and going through what if scenarios. All in all I think this is what King was going for. If so, he achived it. For that reason I give it a strong 4 stars. BEWARE if you require a neat wrap up at the end this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is Stephen King in his most whimsical mood. Totally unexpected as I started the first CD, I met the three storytellers for this yarn: two old newspapermen and their young female intern.

They prove that the best mystery story is challenging and told colorfully with local accents.You will love this short book if you: 1. Love a real mystery who-done-it. 2. Believe Maine would be a great place for a visit, and 3. Love S.

She has grown quite accustomed to the environment, the people, and especially her two elderly superiors, Dave and Vince. She even considers them friends, of sorts. But one afternoon, Dave and Vince happen to mention a 25-year-old mystery, one that has never been solved...one that haunts them to this day. And so they begin their strange, twisted tale...Okay. This novel is bound to make some people angry. First off, it's not really a novel. Secondly, it has no plot; nor, in truth, does it have a resolution. It's main protagonist is 25 years in the grave. It's labeled a hard-boiled detective novel, when it is more a character study of the persistence of human curiousity (which would make a hell of a dissertation, by the way). Who, you might be wondering, would write such a \\"non-story\\"?Stephen King, thank God. In any lesser hands, the story would unravel; would never, in fact, even make it past the editor's cutting block. While \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is certainly mis-labeled, it is still a page-turning literary event (as are most books King writes, fiction, nonfiction, and apparently non-story). A haunting, incredibly accurate look into the way people treat unexplained mysteries, this is the proof of King's writing talent. After all, who else could keep you turning pages even after flat-out telling you the story had no resolution? Not many; certainly no one working the literary scene today. This book is a risk; maybe it will pay off, maybe not. The point is that it is a risk TAKEN, and not just thought about; \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is here for you to read. Judge it at your leisure. You'll probably enjoy it; it's Stephen King, after all."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"When I was a small child (actually I was fourteen and too old to weep over something like this), I was eating a delicious, authentic fried apple pie from some vendor in an amusement park.

It is good story up until it just \\"stops\\" being told."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"\\"The Colorado Kid\\" is a mystery story written by Stephen King for the Hard Case Crime series of paperbacks. As it explains on the back cover of the book, \\"HARD CASE CRIME brings you the best in hard-boiled crime fiction, from lost pulp classics to new works by today's most powerful writers.\\" King's effort would be in the latter rather than the former, but this novella really does not qualify as being \\"hard-boiled crime fiction.\\" There are lots of other ways of making an egg and you can knock yourself out trying to figure which approach would better fit this little tale.The original cover painting by Glen Orbik shows a dame (at least, it should be a dame given this is hard-boiled crime fiction) holding a microphone in one hand connected to a small cassette tape record she holds in the other. But while there is a young woman in the story, Stephanie McCann of Cincinnati, Ohio, who has come to Moose-Lookit Island to do an internship on \\"The Weekly Islander,\\" she would not qualify as a dame, and while she is a reporter, or at least training to be one, she never pulls out either a microphone or a tape recorder. The background consists of newspaper headlines painted over red, one of which talks about an \\"Unknown Man Found Dead by Local Teens.\\" This is the mystery at the heart of this story and beneath the title of the book appears the pivotal question, \\"Would She Learn the Dead Man's SECRET?\\" Talk about a leading question.The story begins at the end of a lunch that Stephanie is having with the two old men who comprise the entire staff of the \\"Weekly Islander,\\" Vince Teague and Dave Bowie. They were lunching with a feature writer from the Boston \\"Globe\\" who is looking for ideas for an eight-part series on \\"Unexplained Mysteries of New England,\\" and who has just left in a hurry to make the next ferry back to the mainland. Back at the office Stephanie learns that Vince and Dave had a local mystery that has never been solved, and to educate her as to why it would not have been a good story to give the guy from the \\"Globe\\" they take turns telling the story. Although they make it clear that there are reasons this unsolved mystery remains unsolved, both Stephanie and the readers expect there to be a solution at the end of the rainbow. After all, the reporters in \\"Citizen Kane\\" never figured out the meaning of \\"Rosebud\\" but Orson Welles still let us in on Charles Foster Kane's secret in the end. The only problem is that I read King's \\"From a Buick 8\\" earlier this century, so I know full well that solutions are not always forthcoming in the tales he has to tell.If this were a chapter in a collection of Stephen King short stories or novellas, then I think readers would be more forgiving after reading this one and I could have added another star to the rating. As a story of too old coots telling a young woman a local mystery, the story has its moments; it is as a hard case crime yarn that it falls way short. The back of the cover extols \\"The Colorado Kid\\" for having \\"echoes of Dashiell Hammett's THE MALTESE FALCON,\\" and besides the commonplace that police detectives are too distracted to do their jobs right, leaving it to others to clean up their mistakes, I have no clue as to how this statement would be both true and significant. I mean, come on, anything written in English can have echoes of Hammett's classic detective story, but this should be some sort of meaningful statement and not just the sort of name dropping you have to indulge in when hawking a Stephen King book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"\\"The Colorado Kid\\" is a story about the nature and attraction of mystery, rather than a story about solving one. That might annoy some people, especially those who got the impression from the book's cover that they were getting a more traditional mystery story. I myself thought that I was getting such a story. But because the book is only 180-plus pages in length, and fast-reading pages at that, I ultimately had no problem with the fact that no real solution is offered to the mystery at hand. The story is a little slow getting started, however, with a decidedly padded feel to its first forty or so pages.Also, the sultry investigator in the fetching summer dress seen on the cover is nowhere in the book; the female in the story is simply a young intern (no sultriness in evidence) listening wide-eyed to a couple of old newspapermen telling her a story during a lazy afternoon at the offices of their weekly newspaper. Oh, yeah, about that: how many newly-minted college graduates would generate any desire or enthusiasm at all for working at a sleepy weekly newspaper in a quiet fishing town as their first career-oriented job upon finishing school? But that's what our wide-eyed Stephanie decides to do here once her internship is finished. I found that kind of odd. Maybe Stephen King believes that everyone has the same soft spot for the romance of small-town print reporting that he does.In the end, though the story is about the lure of the unsolved mystery in our society, it might have been fun if King held a contest where readers could send in their own final chapters containing potential solutions to the mystery of the Colorado Kid. There's a lot one can do with that mysterious Russian coin, the suspicious apartment fire the next town over, and the other potential clues and weird happenings that pepper this strange little story.But, if one can forgive Hard Case Crime for not delivering the type of open-and-shut, hard-boiled mystery novel that the book's cover seems to promise, you should find the subtle, engaging story that King does deliver to be worth your time."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"But good writing nevertheless. Some mysteries are never solved, that doesn't mean the detection and puzzle can't be enjoyed. As with a lot of early paperbacks, we keep looking for the babe on the cover. (Does the wheel still turn?)"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"To be honest this book I've read mostly out of curiosity, since one my favorite TV series, Haven, is based on it. The thing is though that after reading the book I've come to realize that its connection to the series is so light that if I didn't already know it existed, I'd be really surprised if I ever found out about it. What the creators of the series did was take one of the many mysterious cases mentioned in the novel and built on it, while bringing at the same time to the forefront some of the secondary characters.But, let's take things from the beginning. In 1980 a young couple discovers on the shores of an island in Maine, the corpse of a man, to whom the authorities bestow the nickname The Colorado Kid. No one seems to know who he is and how he ended up there, while at first even his death is a mystery of sorts.We learn about the story of the Kid, as well as about some other strange occurrences and phenomena that have taken place in the region, through the collaborative narration of the two elderly journalists, who run the local newspaper. Their audience is a young and beautiful intern, who thinks that she has a lot to learn from the two men. The question is though, can she believe them? Well, that's not so easy to do since what they tell her, doesn't really make any sense. According to them, strange things have always been happening around there, which over the years claimed an important role in the local folklore: once a group of people fell victims to mass poisoning from drinking tea, an adventure from which only two of them survived, with one of them showing no symptoms whatsoever; at some other time an utterly deserted ship washed to shore and as the locals have it, it was some ghosts that led it there; and after that, the really unexpected happened, an Unidentified Flying Object was spotted by many people in the sky over the town.Stephenie, the young woman, listens attentively to the two men, she absorbs their stories and tries to discover all by herself and within her own soul, the answers to the mysteries that her mentors talk about. The two of them seem not only to want to test her analytical capabilities, but also to challenge her logical mind, and thus open her eyes to the realities that she could never up to that moment believe to exist.While reading this book the reader gets the feeling that somehow, somewhere there's a rational explanation for everything that's happening, but the mystery keeps challenging his senses and the myth keeps his attention alive and alert. Some of the answers will come to light by the end, some won't. But, one way or another, what matters most is the story, and this is a good one. The author is not interested in playing the fear card, he just wants to tell a story and that he does splendidly.If any of you have watched the series I'm sure that by reading this book you'll only recognize but a few points of reference: the two journalists, the landscape, the female version of the Colorado Kid and maybe one or two of the stories. However, I'd like to congratulate the people behind it for managing to create a whole world, with a pantheon of great characters and plots full of mystery, taking their inspiration from a short novel like this. They really did a great job."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"As a decades long, huge fan of Stephen King, I was really disappointed in this book. I think it's the first time this has happened. I have been watching every episode of the new series \\"Haven\\", which proclaims to be based on \\"The Colorado Kid\\". Because of that, I purchased the book thinking it would provide some background on the characters I am so enjoying in the series. Didn't happen."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Two old Maine newspapermen regale a young intern with the story of the only real mystery ever to present itself on their peaceful little island.Stephen King's entry in the Hard Case series of modern noir thrillers is neither a noir nor a thriller. Instead, it is a cozy little puzzle with no thrills and no sense of danger. The real mystery is that it was ever published. Of course, even that is not a real mystery. A writer of King's stature is popular enough to get virtually anything published, as he has demonstrated on occasion. The real question is: why would he allow this to be published?I do not think King is a lazy writer or one who does not care about his craft. I have certainly not read the majority of his work, but what I have read is almost always compelling and sometimes brilliant. I have seen some god-awful work from him, but, prior to reading this novel, I always found it among his short fiction. I can only conjecture that these types of old Yankee characters are so close to his heart that he deluded himself into believing that he had produced some quality work here and no one around him was willing to tell him differently."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This drivel is an insult to the Hard Case Crime library. It isn't pulp fiction, in fact, it just hasn't any style except more Z-grade Stephen King. To summarize the first 20 or so pages: waitress gets big tip. Next 25 pages, two old (but supposedly cool) codgers sit around and tease their young intern. Yessir, this is a real page turner! Problem is I'm turning several pages at once to see if anything gets interesting. It doesn't. One of my rules of thumb: the more hyperbolic major news media reviews, the crappier the subject matter. My theory continues to gain ground. Back in the Eighties, I was a Stephen King fan. Since then, I would say the only decent book he's written was The Green Mile. Occasionally, he writes something so bad (The Cell) that I've read it because I'm fascinated by the sheer awfulness of it. The Colorado Kid isn't even that readable. For example, take one of the main characters. For some inexplicable reason he is named \\"David Bowie\\". OK, sometimes he's \\"Dave Bowie\\" but then every time a \\"David Bowie\\" gets thrown in, I'm like WTF? When did he get in the story--oh, yeah, it's one of those old guys. So yo, Stephen, why don't you just name the other old dude, Keith Moon or something cool like that? Then you won't have to think so hard. Oh, and quit writing from a female point of view. It's just plain weird, man. Or is Tabitha ghostwriting this junk for you? That would explain a lot."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"What is interesting is how revealing The Colorado Kid can actually be. When given the chance to write something outside of his comfort zone, Stephen King wasn't up to the challenge. It ends just where it starts, nowhere. Calling it arty is just an illusion. The best thing about The Colorado Kid is the cover. The sexy, scantily clad beauty that adorns the cover is as enticing as any 50s-60s crime magazine cover, and for that reason, I decided to read this novel. It was barely better than a waste of time. For King to claim that readers will either like it or hate it is laughable. Stephen King has become the writer that talks too much, and The Colorado Kid could have been an excerpt out of one of his way too long novels of the past twenty years. Most of his over stuffed novels have one or two vignettes in them that barely have anything to do with the novel you might be reading. The Colorado Kid was probably already written to stick into one of his novels, but he probably couldn't find a way to make it fit, so he offered it up for this. I read his final comment at the end of the book, hoping to find an answer, but it wasn't there. He let us down. Again."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The ending of this book is definitely unsatisfying. Isn't the ending the most important part of a mystery novel? Some of King's stuff, I love. SomeI do not. This one did not do it for me."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This book was OK, but I found it hard to get engrossed in the story and the ending was somewhat of a lettdown. It's like wathcing a 2 hour movie with no ending."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This isn't a horror novel. It's published by Hard Case Crime, known for hardboiled crime fiction by old and new writers, which some would say is a crime itself, as The Colarado Kid isn't that hardboiled.It's about the telling of a mystery involving a man found dead on a bench, in a small town where strange men dressed in suits aren't usually found dead for any apparent reason. The tale is told to a young reporter by her mentors whom you get to know well; they're memorable characters, despite the novel's short length. Who is the dead man? How did he die? Where is he from? This book is not a mystery. It's not hardboiled. Hell, it may not even be crime fiction.In the Afterward, which he seemed to write knowing the reader would think \\"What the hell?\\" after finishing the book, King explains why he wrote what he did, how it came about, and that he has no regrets about it:\\"...if you tell me I fell down on the job and didn't tell all of this story there was to tell, I say you're all wrong.\\"He knows this isn't your traditional hardboiled story:\\"...even though The Colorado Kid is probably more bleu than outright noir, I think it has some of those old-fashioned kick-ass story-telling virtues.\\"And it does. There's a mystery to solve, but it's the telling of the tale that hooks you, not any mystery's solution. I don't think this book should've been published by Hard Case Crime, though. Maybe as a collection of short-stories, or in serial form in The New Yorker."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I don't recall ever reading a book that did not solve the mystery.... It was disappointing, to say the least, with a lot of facts, mysteries and speculations, to just come an ending that is not really an ending...just completely STOP."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This book was a real disappointment compared to the TV program, Haven, which is supposedly inspired by The Colorado Kid. The TV program is 100% more interesting."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I liked this story immensely; the open ending made me keep thinking about it long after I was done reading. My main thought is about why are we so sure the Colorado Kid took the ferry at all? The ferryman was said to have a drinking problem, so his placing of him on the ferry at all is suspect, and if he could have chartered his own plane, couldn't he have chartered his own boat? :)That being said, I specifically bought this because I love the show Haven and the credits say it is based on this story. How? The newspaper men exist in the show- barely, the bar is called the Grey Gull, and there is a picture of the Colorado Kid- that's about where the similarities end, so if you are looking for a story about \\"the troubles,\\" etc. you won't find it here."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"STEPHEN KING IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE WRITER. I HAVE SEVERAL OF HIS AUDIO BOOKS AND WRITTEN BOOKS WHICH MAKES MY LIBRARY HUGE. STEPHEN KING ALWAYS MAKES EXCITING READING AND I ALWAYS HUNGER FOR MORE AS HE PUBLISHES THEM.

BUT OTHERWISE THE DISCS ARRIVED IN INDIVIDUAL PLASTIC BAGS AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"In case you're wondering, this has barely anything to do with Haven (the tv show which is supposed to be based upon this story). Regardless, I enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"It was stated early on that the reader will either hate or love it, and somehow I came out neutral in that decision. As always, I like King's writing and his entry into the 'hard case crime -hard-boiled crime fiction' category just wasn't there for me. This was not Mickey Spillane or Robert B. Parker, but it was still a good read. Other reviewers have discussed the plot and the meaning of 'The Colorado Kid' title, and the non-clearance of the mystery, so I will simply say, buy the book and make your own decision. Worth your time and a few bucks."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'll admit, I've never been a Stephen King fan. But I think anyone who reads this would have to agree that without his name on the manuscript, this would've jumped from the slush pile to the recycle bin in a matter of minutes.It's really a short story padded to much greater length, sort of like an egg roll that's stuffed with nothing but cabbage. But what the heck; at least 90% of business books are guilty of that. What really irked me about this book is its outright laziness--aside from leaving the puzzle unsolved, there are some glaring anachronisms that even a junior editor should've caught.Overall, I get the impression that I've put more effort into writing this review than The Great Stephen King put into writing this book. Very disappointing, especially when contrasted with some of the other (older) entries in the Hard Case Crime series. Buy it if you must, but don't say you weren't warned."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The Colorado Kid is Stephen King's first novel since he announced his retirement a couple of years back. It's a paperback original, part of the \\"Hard Case Crime\\" line which has published a number of interesting originals as well as some choice reprints. King's book doesn't really fit in with the rest of Hard Case's releases (their attempt to shoehorn it into the hard-boiled genre with a totally inappropriate cover notwithstanding), though it is a mystery. It just isn't a hard boiled mystery like the other books they've published.Stephanie McCann is interning at a small-town newspaper, working for Dave Bowie and Vince Teague, the paper's owners and sole employees. One afternoon the two men recount the case of a man, dubbed the Colorado Kid, found dead on the beach. The crime has remained unsolved for 25 years (actually, no one's even sure there was a crime as there were no obvious signs of trauma on the body). The story Dave and Vince tell becomes a logic game they play with Stephanie, her \\"final exam\\". It's a quick, fun read told in a \\"sit down, let me tell you a story\\" tone, the sort of story that would have been printed in the Saturday Evening Post fifty years ago."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I enjoy the TV show \\"Haven\\" which is based on the book \\"The Colorado Kid\\". It was interesting to see how it came about and to meet a few characters of the show in the book. This book is not for everyone and definitely not a typical Stephen King novel. It makes you think and leaves you to keep on thinking about it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The Author Stephen King did a good job writing this e-book. As far as measuring up to any of his other e-books he could have gotten away with calling this a Short Story. The e-book was worth the $4.99 price tag. Having the same theme of a small coastal town off of Maine is a great idea and works for this story. I am an avid reader of the Hard Case Crime series, I think it is an excellent idea to group and categorize the small murder mystery books. They have an e-book of the month club that goes along with these e-books. I am glad Stephen King made an appearance in the Hard Case Crime series. I have and would recommend this e-book to a friend."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Though the story was interesting, this was a rather dry read and not what I expected from one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I first heard of this book trough the tv show haven .

I would also love to see Stephane in haven because she reminds me of Audrey a Liltle bit ."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'll admit, I only got curious enough to buy this book because I'm a fan of the Syfy show, Haven. If you're expecting anything about Audrey Parker, the Troubles, or even a town called Haven, you won't find it in this book.While it was a bit of a shock to realize just how much artistic liberty the writers of Haven took for their show that's \\"based on\\" The Colorado Kid, it was still a really good book. Definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is a different genre from King, known for his surreal horror suspense stories and movies. This is a fascinating recounting of a puzzling death on a Maine island. The story is told through the narration of two ancient newspaper reports to their young intern. I loved the recounting of the story by Jeffrey DeMunn, who interprets the tale of the two journalists perfectly in their charming rural Maine accent."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I picked this book up after watching several episodes of Haven, since the show is billed as being based on (or at least related to) the book. It was a quite unusual book.The pacing, organization, flow and story-telling devices were flawless. The story itself was intriguing and provided plenty to keep one's mind turning. At the same time, there was never any real action. The \\"event\\" around which everything revolved was the finding of a body - but there was no murder, suicide, accident or other definable action involved. I kept waiting for something, but I was never quite sure what. An interesting read if you'd like something different, for sure."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This was an interesting read. There are no answers at the end of the book but that is the whole point I believe. If you are looking for a long, detailed King then this is not it.

It's very indulgent, very readable and not very interesting. In a sense it's an anti-whodunnit whose point is too laboured. The central conceit is that the appeal of a good unsolved mystery is that there's a 'musta-been' solution that people want to accept is the case and which the evidence suggests but still can't prove. The concept is intellectually curious but dramatically unsatisfying. It's been a long while since I've read a Stephen King story, especially one written so comparatively recently, and it was mildly amusing to come across pop culture references that I actually understood (I mostly read his 70s-80s books as a young teen and so often had no idea about some of the things he mentioned)!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This was an interesting mystery story that purposely leaves the reader with questions.

I bought this hoping it would give me more of a backstory and details of the town and the characters but I was so wrong. I normally like King's work, but this failed me in every way.

The owner did not want to field complaints from hundreds of thousands of disappointed buyers.If you have never seen \\"Haven,\\" and are a Stephen King completist, then this is a worthy addition.

I knew that the TV show was only based on this short story. It added little to what I already knew. (Had I read it several months before it would have given me the name of \\"The Colorado Kid\\".) Only two of the main characters in the short story are in the Television series and I was disappointed to find them so different. Regardless of the television series, taken alone as a Stephen King story I was still disappointed and yet fascinated. The story asks a lot of questions and King doesn't really give all the answers. For me, that's both a strength and a weakness of this story. I had to laugh at myself though because King reeled me right in.I have read King novels that I loved and some I didn't care for at all and some were just too hard for me to follow. I think that is one of King's strengths. I absolutely never know how much I am going to enjoy or dislike his book. I think if you are a real Stephen King fan you will enjoy this story. If you are looking for background about Haven...remember that the show is loosely, very loosely based on the story. I am still asking the question of not WHO the Colorado Kid is, but what the heck was he doing in Haven?"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Rather discolored and scent???

It moves at a painfully slow pace, its characters are cardboard cutouts with no plausibility at all, and, worst of all, its \\"big surprise\\" is that it gives NO solution to the mystery it proposes. The cover has nothing to do with the book, and sadly the cover is by far the best part.I will try another volume in this publisher's series, but Stephen King should be ashamed of himself. And his lame and badly-written \\"Afterword\\" does nothing to justify this book's existence at all."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their \\"down east\\" mannerisms to life with language that rings of \\"Bert & I\\" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I have read other books in this series and simply put this novel does not fit in with the rest - or with the cover image the publishers have given it. King may be a great author (as the four pages of quotes in the front claim) but this is not a Hard Case Crime story.From the cover one would expect a fast paced, noir thriller, with a femme fatal, and probably some sex, maybe gun play or conflict of some sort. If this is want you want look elsewhere because you won't find them here. The pace is glacial, the characters dull, and the conflict non-existent. You might as well be reading a book about three people watching paint dry.

I'm a long-time fan of both crime fiction and Stephen King, so this novel looked like a sure thing to me! After reading it, however, I feel less like a fan and more like a victim of a practical joke. In my opinion, this is not a novel -- it's a piece of a manuscript that King should have kept in his desk drawer until he was ready to finish it.He sets up a nifty puzzle, then writes, apparently, until he reaches the minimum word count required by contract, then simply stops. After that, he has the gall to justify it in an afterword, explaining that an unsolved mystery is a metaphor for The Great Mystery of Life.That's all very well, if it's what King wants to do. But it should never have been published under the Hard Case imprint, which leads bookbuyers to expect a tale that adheres to the conventions of the pulp crime genre."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm not completely done with it yet, but it's OK so far.

The solving process is so repetive as if written for a child.The Cover to this book looks so good, like who is this raven haired beauty, she looks like she could cause some trouble but no!! She just solves a murder for a small paper that no one really cares about and is not that interesting.It's a short read that should take less than three hours, if your a true King fan your going to read it regaurdless of what I say, this is more for those people that have never read King because his books are too big, and they might see this and go I've always wanted to read a Stephen King, well don't pick this up get something earlier please.

After the first two chapters don't go anywhere, however, you realize that this is really just a short story exercise for King that never picks up speed. In fact, King says as much in his afterword: This book is a meditation on unsolved mystery. There's no crime, no sex, and no tension--all of which makes for a maddening pulp fiction book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is not one of Stephen's best books. It was too short to build any kind of storyline or get you that involved with the characters..dissappointment for me.."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"It may have quite the coup when Hard Case Crime was able to get Stephen King to write an original story for them. Imagine how much more of a coup it would have been if King had actually written a good story. The Colorado Kid features some of King's trademark writing, but is also another example of his generally weak writing over the past few years.This brief novel is actually a story-within-a-story. The framing story involves the two elderly men who run a small town paper on a Maine island. They have a young woman for an intern, who they proceed to tell the main story. Twenty-five years earlier, the body of a dead man was discovered. With no initial clue to his identity, events slowly unfold that piece together some of the mysteries of his life.Sadly, there are a number of problems with this book. What will stand out to most people is an ending that is more than a little dissatisfying. In an afterword, even King acknowledges that the ending will not please many people, but it is definitely the conclusion he intended. To me, the bigger problem is his inability to really draw us into this mystery. It is only related in an extended conversation between three people over two decades after the fact. We are too distant from the story to feel any suspense.In fact, this story only minimally fits into the pulp mystery genre that the Hard Case Crime line wants to sell. If not for the name value of the author, I doubt this story would even be published by them. King has enough talent to keep this work from being completely abysmal, but at best it rates a high two stars. This one is for his fans only."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This isn't so much a novel as it is a very long short-story (I read it in one sitting). Even though this is part of the new, straight-to-paperback, Hard Case Crime series, don't come to it expecting Raymond Chandler. It's not really classic Noir or classic King - it's something else. In his later years, Stephen King has grown more experimental. His characters have become older; the two heroes of this story are 65 and 90. Like \\"The Reach\\" and \\"Storm of the Century,\\" King sets this tale on one of the islands off the coast of Maine. The whole thing is told in flashback - a tale these two newspapermen tell to their young intern about the one unsolved - and almost unexplainable - mystery they've ever come across.Now, as most reviews point out, this story doesn't have a resolution; we never REALLY find out what happened to the titular Colorado Kid. In an Afterward, King is unapologetic for doing this; stating that it is a \\"love it or hate it\\" book. Well, I don't know if I LOVE it, but I certainly like it. The effect of the ambiguous ending is a lasting feeling of creepiness. So much of the horror in horror stories is diffused by explaining everything at the end. Here, there is no explanation - just a mystery."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldn't find a way to leave none. I feel like Stephen King cheated me, stole my money and wasted my time. There is no story - no conclusions and no ending. A man was found dead on a beach in Maine... I just saved you five bucks because thats all there is to it. This in one of the worst pieces of crap I've ever read, save your money and forget about this one."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Fair to good STephen King novel. A little different than his usual."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"THE COLORADO KID by Stephen King MAY be his last published novel. How apt what a sweet novel to take a final bow on if that is the intent. As seems to be the format of Hard Case True Crime an imprint of Liesure Publishing it is short and as others mentioned a quick read.This story is perfect for King to exit with for a few reasons obvious to fans not so obvious to non-fans. It is great because as in his best works it has King traits throughout. For instance his characters are realistic and plausible in their humanity. In fact the Publisher of The Islander Vince Teague and his editor Dave almost echo some of King's own remarks on the subject of writing and story telling/reporting. Another trait in the best King fiction highlighted by this story is an open ended ending. The mystery is not totally solved. Life is full of unexplained incidents and mysteries and this is definitely a case of art imitating life. Here there is the unknown but both in its length and ploting this focuses on the everyday and realness of life. Making THE COLORADO KID, I repeat an excellent coda for King especially with its relative thematic stirrings raised in FROM A BUICK 8 and its accessablity to the casual reader/fan.The last point I wish to raise in this review is a light rebuttal about the comments from reviewers critiquing the pacing of the story. In my not so humble point of view I think the pacing is dead on accurate and King is a master of pacing he has brought it up on his musings on the craft and I feel the pacing of this tale albeit slow makes instead of breaks the story.PS I had to tack on one more observation why this series is suitable for King's publishing twilight and that is throughout his career he has been accused by some as being a \\"pulp\\" writer and he finally wrote a \\"pulp\\" fiction novel;)"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I loved the premise of this book, the two old men telling a young promising reporter about a mystery. I loved the way the two men played off each other and the conclusion of the book was surprising. I have found this book most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I've always liked Stephen King novels and the flexibility with which he has been able to take his career. The Colorado Kid represents another interesting twist.This quick read is set in a small island off the coast of Maine, where two old newspaper reporters tell their young female protege the story about the only real mystery they ever encountered in their career.A man is found dead with no identification. Only through haphazard events is the identity of the man discovered over a year later (Surprise!--he's from Colorado).The real mystery, though, are the circumstances surrounding his death. Did he know he was going to die? How did he end up in Maine?Many reviewers here do not like the inconclusive ending. I did not like it at first, but greatly appreciated King's afterward, where he provides a suitable justification for his ending.I understand many readers' frustrations. Real life is already full of unsolved mysteries: where did my favorite pen go?, what did that guy say about me?, did Michael Jackson really touch those children?, etc. Most people read mystery books for the reassuring feeling they get when they find out all the answers at the end. King has not written The Colorado Kid for these people.Fans of Stephen King will read this book, but they will appreciate it more if they do not expect a happy resolution going in. The point is to enjoy the mystery.This is not my favorite King book, but I thought it was interesting and mildly enjoyable. Some will hate The Colorado Kid, but King says he's okay with that. After all, you can never be someone who is \\"on the edge\\" unless a few fans fall off every once in awhile."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King makes an interesting, but slight, entry into crime fiction with the newest original paperback in the quite good series of Hard Case Crimes. This story of two old newspaper geezers spinning a unsolved mystery for their newest intern (whom I suspect from the story neither dresses nor sits like her image on the cover) is just interesting enough to cover the length of this very short novel, and not one page more. It could have been fascinating to have a true noir book from King, with his own peculiar twists, instead of this meditation on tale-spinning and, for that reason, this book will dissappoint some. On its own slight merits, though, it is a pleasant enough read."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is a small book and easy to read in one sitting, but it packs a big punch. What King doesn't explain is more important than what he does explain. Like his last great novel, FROM A BUICK 8, this book is about the mysteries that don't have easy answers. Some readers may not like that in their fiction, though, even though it is more like real life than most novels. In real life there isn't always a third act that explains everything. The same goes for THE COLORADO KID. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The two elderly reporters of the Weekly Island and their intern Stephanie are discussing unsolved mysteries with a Boston Globe reporter. Afterward Vince and David tell Stephanie about a case they shared with nobody until now; the story of THE COLORADO KID, a man who in 1980 is found dead on a beach on Moose-Look Island off the coast of Maine.An autopsy shows that a piece of meat is wedged in back of his throat and the cause of death is given as asphyxiation. The two reporters know he is not an islander and nobody recognizes him. It is only luck that the intern who was with the police that night remembered a cigarette tax label on the cigarette pack in the shirt the man was wearing and remembers they didn't come from Maine. As police find the pack in the evidence room and see that it was bought in Colorado, the reporters send a picture to all the Colorado newspapers and that leads to the victim's wife identifying the body but that is not the end of the mystery, only the beginning and is one that has haunted the two reporters for a quarter of a century.Readers are either going to love this book or hate it but they will always remember it; that is the trademark of a Stephen King story. Like his horror novels, this work is very atmospheric with plenty of descriptions so that readers can see in their minds the events unfolding. The two elderly reporters are likeable old coots with distinctive personalities and an ability to tell a mesmerizing story that keeps Stephanie glued to her seat wanting to hear the whole tale just like the audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"A while ago Mr. King claimed to be ready to retire. I was sort of distressed as his books have brought me a great deal of pleasure through much of my life. I have taught Eng. classes for years with many of his books and consider him the modern Dickens, and have no doubt history will agree in some far-flung future.Sadly, over the past few years, a King story is a waste of money if not an out-and-out rip-off, complete with a whining self-serving explanation of an afterward that claims that this is just the way the story HAD to be.Save it for the rubes, pal. I'm a writer myself. Either remember craft and honesty (Hard-boiled? That crap? \\"Deah\\", \\"Ayuh\\" *PUKE* I've lived in Maine my whole life, we don't talk that way...) or hang 'em up like you threatened.The early Dark Tower books & The Green Mile got me through cancer & worse, years ago. And unlike some, I thought 'From A Buick Eight' was a gem. I hated 'The Colorado Kid' because it sucked, had a dishonest cover & promise, and showcased a lazy contempt for the 'constant reader'.When did you grow to have such contempt for your audience, man?"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I didn't think much of the story. If it had been a real book that I paid a lot for I would have felt ripped off. It seemed incomplete."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"So unlike any of Stephen Kings other works. Kept waiting for something to happen in narrative but it never did. No twist, no surprises. Boring narrative and story line."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I belong to the Stephen King Library and I have been reading his books for years but I had not heard of this book before. It was not the usual Stephen King but it was still a very good read."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Huge fan of Haven on TV so wanted to read the story that triggered the series. Really enjoyed reading it even though I am not a Stephen King fan."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This was Stephen Kings crack at pulp fiction and a great story. Done in the style of the 30's and 40's pulp right down to the end where you get taken for a loop. Who done it? I don't know? You'll have to read this one. Overall, I give it a 5!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Interesting short story.... I quite enjoyed it. I think maybe what you learn here, is my reason for not reading or watching the news ! I love the little old men in this story. It's short so my review is short to not give anything away. I liked the afterword from Stephen as well."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm not what you'd call a Stephen King fan. Never read any of his books before this one. I do like the SyFy TV show that was \\"inspired\\" by this book, but in relity I saw little connection. However, I like them both for different reasons. It makes me wonder if some of those bad movies 'based' on his books were just that, bad movies, maybe the books were better? That's what I always hear anyway.While reading The Colorado Kid I kept think what a great 2 act, three person play this would make. Great story telling, humor, some mystery, an easy production to do. Unless you wanted the musical, which, no one does.Looking at the cover, I have no clue as to how it fits into the story since it's basically a long conversation between three people about a guy who died 30+ years before, how he did or didn't die and how he got where he was when he died. I do not remember anything that would even suggest a cover like what's shown here? But I read it on my Kindle so I didn't see the cover until now.My wife read this first and didn't like it but I think she was comparing it to the TV show, I read it for what it was, an interesting short-ish story. My preconceptions of a Stephen King story were busted.. but that's what you get when you pre-judge someone."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The author realized that many of the readers of this book were not going to be pleased with it, as he states in the Afterward. He's right, as far as I am concerned.Even though the writing is crisp, as is to be expected from Mr. King, and there is quite an interesting storyline and a potential mystery, we're left hanging at the end, and I didn't much care for that. Make no mistake, the book is good, but if you like everything wrapped up at least a bit at the end, you won't care for the book. If you are one who just admires a tale well told and doesn't care how it ends, or even if it ends, you'll like it. This is a matter of personal preference."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I do understand why so many people didn't like this. No violence, no blood, no things that go thud in the night. Just a story. Just a yarn.Um. Yeah. What were you looking for, anyway? Misery, Cujo, Blaze... just tales, just stories, just yarns. Same of The Old Man And The Sea, The Grifters... fill in the blanks.Frankly, I was rather taken by this story. It is a breeze, simple but not simple minded. I didn't need Constant Writer to explain himself at the end, but that was kind of fun, too. The point of the existential writers, for so long, is that there is no real end to a story, nothing truly satisfying. Sometimes, things merely stop.Then again, I thought that No Country For Old Men was indeed the best film of that year, and remains on my top *number* list, so I guess if you liked No Country, you'd like this. If not, then not."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Definitely not King's best, but an entertaining read none-the-less. The story follows a tale told by two elderly Maine island newspapermen to their young protege about a mysterious death on the island that was never solved. The main story revolves more around the process of attempting to solve the mystery and the young protege's finding herself and deciding on a course in her life than the actual mystery itself. All in all I found it to be a quick read that was hard to put down and found myself satisfied at the end even though many would find the conclusion to be less than satisfactory."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I must begin by admitting I'm an avowed Stephen King fan. I am deeply drawn to his writing. I especially enjoy his ability to personalize his characters so completely, they could be sitting in the same room with me. This is no less true of The Colorado Kid. This novella followed suit featuring some of the best of his compelling characterizations of both people and place. While this murder mystery is a slight detour from King's tendency toward the \\"horror\\" genre, it has no less the eerily creepy feeling King is so skilled at conveying. I not only enjoyed this story, but hope to check out other of the Hard Case series, prompted by the quality of this little retro-literary turn with Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Speaking only for myself, the publishing event of the year was not HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. Believe me, I love the thought of thousands of school-aged children standing in line at midnight to buy a book --- but I wasn't there. However, I gladly would have stood in line way past my bedtime to pick up a copy of THE COLORADO KID by Stephen King. What's not to love about a new King novel, a paperback original published by the newly indispensable Hard Case Crime imprint?It turns out that the book was nothing like I had expected. It's not a hard-boiled detective novel --- no faces through the window, no sex beyond the sultry Glenn Orbik rendering on the cover, no gunshots, either on or off the page. What THE COLORADO KID is, however, is a finely rendered mystery with a gently philosophical touch that, incidentally, contains some of King's best writing. Yes, even this late in the day, The Man is still The Man.So what can be expected from a reading of THE COLORADO KID? It is, at its essence, a discussion over coffee, kind of the New England equivalent of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, wherein the elderly editors of a weekly newspaper serving Moose-Lookit Island off the coast of Maine take an interning reporter to school with the account of a death occurring more than a quarter-century beforehand. The deceased was discovered on Moose-Lookit with no identification, though he later became known as the Colorado Kid; his death was apparently the result of choking on a piece of steak. But with the \\"how\\" solved, the questions raised in the minds of the newspapermen --- related to the journalistic w's --- remain.THE COLORADO KID is the story of that investigation, told in retrospect. There is charm to the narrative, not the least of which is the result of King having a bit of fun with the reader. He very implicitly interjects himself into the narrative throughout the novel --- all I will say is that it is self-evident from the first page --- but this work is not a mere piece of whimsy. Some of King's best writing is contained in the very last paragraph of this fine work, but please don't skip ahead to read it. It is built entirely upon what has gone before, not only in THE COLORADO KID, but also in King's entire body of work. And for that alone, I would have stood in line at midnight.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This book was barely in good condition and being charged over $16 dollars for a paperback is unheard of.

I can make up my own ending. Thanks PSM"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"With a great cover painting and retro design and typography, King's entry into the Hard Case Crime series looks like a delicious slice of literal pulp fiction. But the story within the slim volume is neither hard-edged nor, when you come down to it, necessarily about crime. It *is* an effective trio of character sketches, with a couple of stock King Maine oldtimers, ayuh, playing tutor and adjucator to a Pretty Young Thing who is considering making the tranistion from outsider to local.This is some of the breeziest, least forced prose King has produced in years; a real sense of fun and fondness for the characters and the audience is evident. The result is enjoyable reading but, in the end, just too lightweight, even if one sets aside the author and the series title. Even the hodgepodge of clues King throws out seem designed to amuse as much as infuriate. A lot has been written about this being a mystery without a solution; the real weakness is not that a solution isn't given but that the clues are so preposterous that no attempt to construct a plausible solution seems worthwhile.It's an easy ride, though, and the book itself is worth having for the design alone."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I enjoyed this story a great deal. A different genre for Mr. King, but still filled with great characters and a well-planned and executed story. It was for me a quick, easy read. If you love King as much as I, do read this book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Pretty good, though not enough happening. A little boring. Where's the leg work? Just sitting around yammering isn't true Mike Hammer or gumshoe detective form. Although dissapointing I felt the need to continue reading. Stephen King is my favorite writer, he should stick with what he does best."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"At the end of the book, King says \\"You will either love this book or hate it, there is no middle ground.\\" and I tend toa gree with that statement. I enjoyed this book very much. I was glad it was as short as it is though, as there is not much information to give, which is what makes it a horrible newspaper article. No ending is possible for a LONG time after, if ever, which is left up to you to decide what does or may or could happen in the case of the Colorado Kid. Does our reporter friend gain any more knowledge as she ages, or does she have to pass the information ona s she gets older to another who may take up the case, nothing is given away freely. This was great, as are many of the other HCC series, they needed a big name, got one, and he delivered a VERY interesting yarn."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This novel by Stephen King came out in October of 2005. It's the first new novel by King after he completed his \\"The Dark Tower\\" series, which he claimed would be his last writing. It's wasn't. Not by a long shot. In fact, he's got a new novel, \\"Cell\\", coming out next year. I don't know who said it, but some guy said that Stephen King can't stop writing. It's like breathing to him. That guy's right.So now we've got this novel, \\"The Colorado Kid\\". It's published under the Hard Case Crime label. Hard Case Crime is dedicated to publishing both old, lost pulp stories and new stories by modern authors. The books are selected and edited by Charles Ardai. \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is Stephen King's contribution.It's a rather short novel - only 164 pages of actual story. The story is unique in that it's told in the format of a conversation between the three lead characters. They are newspaper reporters (and the sole staffers) for a small Maine paper called \\"The Weekly Islander\\". The two owners are old men named Vincent Teague and David Bowie (yes, really). The third person is a young, 22-year-old woman named Stephanie McCann. Stephanie is a post-grad student that comes to work at the small, island paper for 4 months. The story begins in August of 2005, 3 months into her work. After having lunch with a reporter from \\"The Boston Globe\\" at a place called The Grey Gull, during which Vince and Dave tell him about some unsolved local cases from across the past few decades, the three Islander reporters go back to their paper. Stephanie has a column called \\"Arts 'N Things\\", where she (not so enthusiastically) covers the local art scene (which isn't much). She, Vince, and Dave go outside, sit down, and drink Coke. Vince and Dave then tell Stephanie of an unsolved case from the 1980s that they had withheld from the Globe reporter, because there were too many unknowns. This is what makes up the bulk of the novel: Vince and Dave telling Stephanie about how a man was found dead on a beach, what they know, what they don't know, and their guesses as to what might have happened. They go back inside near the end of the novel and get back to work on the paper.A lot of readers might feel cheated by the fact that King gives no resolution to the crime. They believe that a story, unlike real life, should provide answers. These people miss the point of the story.The story is not about the murder. It's about Stephanie. While Vince and Dave do most of the talking in this story, Stephanie is probably the only character whose thoughts that we get any (or at least primary) insight to. We follow her as she listens to Vince and Dave, makes guesses, and asks questions. The story is not about the investigation of the murder of the Colorado Kid. The story is about the journalistic education of Stephanie McCann as she learns to think like an investigative reporter.At the end of the novel, Stephanie is a little wiser and has pretty much decided to stay at the newspaper after her trial period ends (the island has the Internet and Direct TV, after all). We know she will make the decision to stay, because, near the end, King briefly breaks narrative flow by mentioning that Vince will die six months later (February of 2006), and Stephanie will cover the funeral service for the paper. Presumably, Stephanie will then be given more duties at the paper.King does mention near the end of the novel that Stephanie knows \\"a certain young man\\" back home named Rick, \\"who would have to be dealt with if she decided to stay\\". While not explicitly a boyfriend, it seems odd that Stephanie, who King had characterized as having a sharp mind, would even be associated with someone who \\"would not take the news well\\" because \\"that wasn't how the story was supposed to go\\". Let's hope that Stephanie deals with that \\"messy\\" business well. Wait. Of course, she does. She's still around, six months later.Despite that out-of-character passage, Stephanie is a very enjoyable character to read about and get to know. She has a good sense of humor, and she can't help but find some horrible things amusing. She's my kind of girl.There is some cursing in this story, but it's mild by Stephen King standards. Most of it comes from Vince and Dave, but even Stephanie lets out two curses. Don't be too concerned about kids reading this book. It's harmless.Don't be fooled by the front cover painting by Glen Orbik. It gives the potential reader the mistaken impression that Stephanie is an investigative reporter or a police detective that investigates the actual crime. Also, there's no indication in the novel that Stephanie actually tape-recorded anything. On a personal note, Stephanie doesn't strike me as the type of girl that would wear a dress or nail polish.Don't be fooled by the description on the back cover either. The \\"graduate student in forensics\\" is not Stephanie but rather a young man that had contact with Vince and Dave about the case back in the 1980s.I got this novel at a discount. Knowing then what I know now, I gladly would have paid full-price for it. It's a good character story. It's Stephanie's story. Get to know her."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Man I like Stephen King's work. I mean, I really like Stephen King's work. One of the greatest writers of our time, period.

You know the Who: the victim, You know the When: timeline of the victim's death, but you will not find the How or the Why.

This was a very intriguing read I highly recommend it if you are in the mood for a mystery that keeps on giving."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King pulls a fast one with his Pulp-Mystery, The Colorado Kid, dragging the reader into the tale with an intriguing mystery that begs to be solved. A man that no one seems to know is found dead on an island off the coast of Maine, with no identification and sparse clues as to how he came to be there.In typical King fashion, he grounds his story with interesting but believable, hometown characters that could easily be the people next door. However, I had a hard time believing that Stephanie McCann, a University of Ohio student, working as in intern at The Weekly Islander, the small newspaper for Moose-Lookit, the town where the tale takes place, would give up on the life she had known and her husband to be just so she could stay in Moose-Lookit and work for the newspaper. I was also disappointed in the way King ended the story. I know why he did it, especially after reading his notes on the subject, and I think he's probably right, but I was still disappointed.The Colorado Kid is a good, fast read that I'm sure you will enjoy.- Bob Avey, author of Beneath a Buried House"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm not sure how many stars to give this book. It isn't the mystery story I thought it would be. In fact, it shouldn't be a Hard Crime book. It has some interesting things, however. Nothing is solved. We learn the identity of the stranger is who was found dead on a beach, but nothing really about him.The cover of this book is misleading. Better it was a beach scene with an empty litter basket on it! There is no sexy broad in the story."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Even though i'm in my 30's, i love pulp fiction! I grew up reading Howard and Lovecraft and through working in a used book store i picked up on Jim Thompson, Charles Williams, James Cain, David Goodis, Charles Willeford, and more.Even though this doesn't seem to be 'strictly' pulp (it's more in the weird vein), i still recommend the book and urge you to support the Hard Case Crime series."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm not sure that Mr. King has the chops to pull off a really fun hardcase crime novel anymore but the \\"Colorado Kid\\" is an appropriate showcase for his admiration of the genre. When you finish you know he's read the right stuff and can at least mimic with a degree of originality. His point in the novel is a perfectly valid one. I would recommend it be read by crime novel enthusiasts if only for a healthy reflection on the desire to know whodunit."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Remember writing reports in Jr. High School that needed to be a certain number of pages? I'd always stretch nothing into something by making the font bigger & expanding the margins to \\"fill-up\\" space.Well? seems that Stephen King has done the same thing here- a low page count, huge text (and a cover price not worthy of the purchase).WTF? So Stephen King, as he explains in his afterword, tells us of a newspaper article filled with mystery and unanswered questions sparked the writing of this book....SPOILERS-SPOILERS-Story: two wizened veteran reporters sitting around, saying \\"Ayuh\\" and other local coliquialisms, explaining to an intern/reporter a story of a man's dead body that was discovered in 1985 which remains (somewhat) an unsolved mystery. This body is found hundreds of miles from where he lives- apparently died from choking on a piece of meat, has a package of cigarettes on him (but he's not a smoker), and has a foreign coin in his pocket (which cannot be explained). THE END.Boffo- that's it.So, King was enthralled with an old newspaper article & wrote this crap story?What's next? I can just picture Stephen King stuck in his bathroom with nothing to read but the ingredients to a bottle of shampoo, he'll come across 'Magnesium Stearate' and 'Malic Acid' and think to himself- WOW HOW MYSTERIOUS! My next novel will be about these unexplained ingredients! Gimmie a break."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This book is dreadful. It's easily the worst in this series. It's definitely not a hard boiled novel.But someone please correct me. How can there be a Starbucks in Denver in 1980?"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Fans of King expect chills and horror--that's not at all what you will find in The Colorado Kid. There is a mystery and a few chills, but mostly this is a story of human beings who are well drawn and so real, after reading their story I feel that I know them. Since I once lived in Maine, I know how absolutely accurate is their speech and manner. King tells us their story with love, in careful and endearing detail. Quite unusual and not what you expect, but really worth-while."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King is in his tower and and he's bricking himself inside. \\"The Colorado Kid\\" has more to do with launching the Hard Case Crime series than it does with King switching genres. As a King fan, I was excited about the possible new flavor of my favorite medicine, but the only thing different about it was the label on the bottle. In fact, \\"Colorado Kid\\" is almost a carbon copy of \\"From a Buick 8,\\" simply swap the cops for journalists and the Buick with a body.Not that I didn't like the book. I would have given it a four-star rating if it was marketed as just another King novel, instead of slightly changing my expectations and then not delivering. It's a fast, guilty read. Like skipping the veggies and going to the ice cream. The ending is good. I can see how some people may object, but I think the reader has a certain amount of imaginative obligation every time a novel is opened. It is definitely a partnership between author and reader. Besides, King was getting his readers ready for the ending of \\"Cell.\\"The biggest flaw in \\"Colorado Kid,\\" is the first sentence. Once you get past that, it's all fire-lit storytelling. A good read."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"If the sheer volume of the last three books of the Dark Tower series were a late night alcohol binge of reading, Colorado Kid is like a Jagerbomb of a novel. Short and hard-hitting. King is right, people will love or hate this work, because unlike an Agatha Christie novel or a Sherlock Holmes story, there is no specific ending. But in keeping with the genre he is writing in, noir, or the grainy, pulpy detective story, its all about atmosphere. Don't come to this novel looking for a CSI mystery. Come to this novel to hear the waves crashing on the beach in front of the Colorado Kid, or the local salts speaking in their own patois. That is where this novel's beauty lies."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I listened to the audiibook version of this book which was very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. The story is about a young college age reporter who takes a summer job on an island off the coast of Maine who is drawn into the story of a local legend about the death of an \\"outsider\\" from Colorado (hence the name of the book) whose body turned up on a local beach many years ago... obviously murdered... but the case was never solved.... by the two elderly male owners of the local newpaper who employed her for the summer. By King's standards this is a very short story but in my opinion it is a great short story by one of the top, if not the the top fiction writer(s) of our time. The audiobook reader does a SUPERB job with the dialect/accent of the story's locale which for me ADDED GREATLY to the story. I highly recommend the audiobook version."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Another reviewer wrote, \\"What King doesn't explain is more important than what he does explain. Like his last great novel, FROM A BUICK 8, this book is about the mysteries that don't have easy answers.\\"And therein lies the problem. I've seen precisely this before -- just a handful of years ago in From A Buick 8. There is nothing new here. Not only is the theme nearly identical, but it's presented in the same fashion too -- through the words of the prototypical King \\"geezer.\\"It's a well written, fast paced read. King always is. It's just not much of a story, and it's nothing that anyone who's read Buick 8 hasn't read before."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I can appreciate how some readers may find Stephen King's foray into crime fiction slightly frustrating. However, expectations regarding the resolution (or lack there of) is set early in this short novel and repeated constantly through out the book. Stephen King's mystery in \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is just as it is billed: a mystery. Stephen King knows what he is attempting is going to leave more than few readers frustrated, but he does try hard to set that stage early. \\"...there must be a story in that...and then you find there just isn't. That it is only a bunch of unconnected facts surrounding a true unexplained mystery. And that, dear, is what folks don't want. It upsets em\\", says one of the characters before launching into the tale of the Colorado Kid.The premise of the story is simple. A man is found dead on the beach 2,000 miles from home with no clues as to why he is so far from home. Two aging newspaper men (Vince and David) tell their newest young apprentice (Stephanie) what they learned about the case that happened 20-years ago. The reader knows that the mystery has yet to be solved. Although the official report lists the death as natural, the facts of the case leave that explanation in question.The ending of the story did not bother me because as I said the expectation is set early and the reader should expect it. I appreciated what Stephen King was trying to do and I also enjoyed the intimacy of the three characters sharing a moment in time trying to unravel facts and put them back in a logical order. Once again Stephen King creates some likeable characters quickly. However, the book did move slowly and it isn't until about midway through the book that the reader really starts understanding why this story is noteworthy to Dave and Vince.It is also interesting how similar the theme and style of the story mimics \\"From a Buick 8\\". Whoever liked that novel will have no problem with \\"The Colorado Kid\\". Both books try to create an allegory to the unexplained nature of life and the fruitless time spent trying to make sense of events and actions. Both books are also set-up as a campfire story. In \\"From a Buick 8\\" it is told in confidence by a close knit group of highway patrolmen. \\"The Colorado Kid\\" is slightly more intimate but again is a story as told by a third party. Finally both stories remain mysterious when they are finished. There is no nice neat bow placed at the end."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"For some reason I can't figure out Stephen (he is my God) King has decided to write some kind of pulp fiction sort of novel. It doesn't work. He's a great writer, but this is not his genre. Not by a long stretch.He has written good mysteries before, though. Shawshank Redemption was terrific. But this one just kind of sits there."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Another solid novel from Stephen King. His range and imagination truly amazes me. King has written horror and fantasy and now tries his hand at a good old-fashioned pulp-style mystery. The result is a fun, interesting read.In looking over some of the reviews for \\"The Colorado Kid\\" it seems that people have two main complaints about this novel. (1) the lack of resolution at the end of the book and (2) the lack of action. In my humble opinion, these things are more than made up for by the strengths of the book. In particular, King's ability to write characters that feel 'real'. That is, he does an excellent job in capturing the essence small town people. He gives his characters personality and the little quirks that make them seem like someone you might meet in a small town.The main characters work for a small town newspaper on an island off the coast of main and are telling the tale of the Colorado Kid (the nickname given to a man found dead under stange circumstances along the beach) to their intern. Throughout the book, they discuss what they know, what they think, and what other people think. While the tale of \\"the Kid\\" is an interesting enough mystery, the real power in this story is the characters, King's description of small town life, and in King's study of human nature. In particular, our need to try to understand the world around us."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King first gained famed as a writer of the horrific and macabre. Books such as CARRIE, \`SALEM'S LOT, THE SHINING, IT, etc. are what King is best known. However, King isn't just a great horror writer. In my opinion King is not only one of the most popular American writers, but he's also one of the best. King can write a great yarn in about any genre and in fact when he's writing stories that seemed to be more based in reality (such as DIFFERENT SEASONS or THE GREEN MILE) his talent truly shines through and one day King will be studied and canonized next to the likes of Cooper, Poe, Faulkner, and Hemingway.Take THE COLORADO KID for example. THE COLORADO KID is a classic detective story, but the detectives in this tale aren't hard nosed policeman but a couple of charming local reporters and their brilliant and beautiful female prot?g?. The two reporters are Vince Teague and Dave Bowie. They've been running a little newspaper out of Moose-Lookit Island, Maine entitled THE WEEKLY ISLANDER for over thirty years. The duo aren't just co-workers but are best friends. Stephanie McCann is a grad student who has traveled from out West to do her internship and during her tutelage has fallen in love with the small town island. Steph is a great student and Vince and Dave are glad to take her under her wing because they know they aren't going to be around forever. After an afternoon in which Steph observes how the duo evades a mainland reporter's questions about the biggest mystery they ever came across, Vince and Dave tell Steph the real story that was the biggest mystery they ever discovered, THE COLORADO KID.The back cover of the book claims that THE COLORADO KID echoes THE MALTESE FALCON and indeed it does. Like all classic pieces of crime noir, THE COLORADO KID raises more questions than it answers and through the process we are introduced to some very memorable characters. Following the characters as they attempt to unravel the mystery is what draws the reader into the story and with a fairly simple plot, this is quite a feet.I thoroughly enjoyed THE COLORADO KID. There are some who are disappointed with the story's ending, but I found it to be quite realistic and just like the ending of many classic pieces of crime noir fiction. I also found Vince, Dave, and Stephanie to be some of the most memorable characters that I've met in Stephen King's writings. Unlike many of King's characters, these three seem like real people and not like a human representation of some idea, whether noble or horrific."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is a rather risky novel for King, who--as he admits in his afterword--knew going in that he was going to infuriate a good many of his fans. The Colorado Kid is a a slow, philosophical, almost meandering tale more interested in exploring the nature of mystery rather than a mystery itself. Utterly actionless (the whole story proper gives us three people talking in a room for the length of this short novel), the book takes on the very enigmatic topic of why people do, or don't, respond to the mysterious. Do we need to have some kind of resolution, even if the answers are not completely spelled out? Or can we live with simply not knowing and having absolutely no closure where a mystery is concerned.King's novel--short but probably not as short as it could've been (the vagueness of plot and unresolved plot threads would've worked much better as a short story) is still an intriguing, thoughtful, evocative tale that will grab you and fascinate you if you allow yourself to go with it.The biggest trouble here is that the book really doesn't belong to the Hard Case Crime line, and fans of true hardboiled or noir fiction are bound to be even more put off than King fans expecting another horror novel."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The Colorado Kid is a slow, thought-provoking novel more intent on highlighting the nature of mystery itself than it is giving us a concrete plot. Though virtually actionless, the story is highly atmospheric and unsettling as two old men relate a bizarre tale to a young woman, a tale full of questions but no answers. Twenty-five years earlier a man apparently set out to die--either by his own hand or by that of some unknown killer--leaving behind a series of clues that are so puzzling no one has ever been able to figure them out.King takes a good many risks going out on a limb where he knows many of his loyal readers won't want to follow. This is an intriguing, enigmatic novel worth exploring even if it leaves you full of questions with no real closure (which is the point of the book)."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Let me start by saying that I LIKE Steven King. I have read everything he has ever written, starting with Salem's Lot years ago, and this is vintage Steven King. The two old geezers in Colorado Kid could easily have been transplanted from Milt Crossen's store in Salem's Lot.The problem is that this was not supposed to be vintage Steven King, it was supposed to be vintage pulp fiction. The pulp fiction genre is clearly defined by the likes of Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm and Micky Spilane's Mike Hammer and, even back before that by every rawhide-tough cowboy that ever graced a Louis L'Amour western.So, if you sat down to read a Steven King book, you got up satisfied, but if you sat down to read a pulp fiction novel... well, then you got up disappointed. Too much Steven King, not enough pulp fiction."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"....not typical Stephen King, and i should know, as i've read damn near all of his novels, minus the nonfiction ones. Realistic characters, decent setup, and a very good nonstory. King is telling us, the Readers, just as he did in From A Buik 8, that not all stories have happy, well defined endings. Sometimes, things just aren't settled so nice and neat. A brilliant lesson on real life.Hawksmoor...From The Bleed."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Having lived in Maine as a graduate Student, and working with the \\"locals\\" who took me in, I very much enjoyed this story. The characters brought to life everything I enjoyed about my experience there. It also brought up memories of the prevailing sense of mystery that exists on the Maine Islands. Should you take a trip to any of these islands, you cannot help feeling that gnomes live there or that some dark mystery is unfolding without you knowing exactly what might be going on.That's exactly what Stephen King does here in \\"Colorado King\\". Something is going on, but you are not sure of what it is. The mystery lives and permeates the air, but never completely reveals itself. It taints us, infects us, but able us to live in wonder. That's what I like about the book and that's what you get in this story. Stories can stick to you like glue, and that's a good thing.It's a fun, fast read, encouraging you to relax by the coast of Maine with some solid people. Pull up a chair and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The concept is great. Lurid cover. New and reprinted mysteries. And Stephen King for the first title! It cannot fail! That it does is because of the book itself. First, let me tell you, I am not a King fan. Rather, I used to be one, I lost all interest in him when he expanded into meaningless balloons of literature. So it was encouraging to see the length of the book. The beginning is wonderful. The book has a nice old fashioned touch to it. It follows classic lines of two people telling a story to an admiring co-worker, a woman. (Is that her picture on the cover? I had a different idea of how she looked from the book). A perfect ghost story technique! I can bet if a new writer tried this style, no agent would touch the book with a ten foot pole, it is that ancient. But in King's hand it becomes very palatable. Avoiding exaggerations and adolescent cursing-which have become the hallmark of Mr. King's writings- the story moves along till the end where he packs up his gears, shuts down the barn door and goes to sleep. What about the readers? Not every story in real life has a beginning, middle and end. But, please, give us a break! A mystery has to have an end. Sometimes even the most fantastic one would do instead of none. A good morsel of steak(!)that's so well done as to be unchewable-literally."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I guess King knew readers were either going to love this one or hate it. I fall into the love group. This is the Anti-Murder She Wrote type of story where the puzzle does not fit. Ellery Queen would be lost on this murder. This is King thinking wayoutside the box. Sometimes I have trouble with King gettingtoo wordy. Well this is a fast paced story that moves and hassome delightful dialog between the \\"old\\" reporters and the\\"new\\" girl."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Reader is trying to impress us with his completely fake and awful accent. the story is lost along with have the letters in the American language."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ.

I would like to suggest that Hard Case publish some of John D. McDonald's Travis McGhee series, they were wonderful reads, such as: Darker Than Amber, Pale Gray for Guilt, The Deep Blue Goodbye, Nightmare in Pink, Freefall in Crimson, The Green Ripper (I think he won an Edgar for that one), and The lonely Silver Rain are among my favorites. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King should just give up already, he is boring and wortheless ever since IT. The king was be dethroned. End of story, this is a fact. Also, DT 7 was a joke, can you even believe it? I just don't even care about that one because one time I was reading it but then it was so very boring and then I didn't want to have bought it but I already did from the store so what a waste of money anyway huh? Oh yeah, its not very solid in the plot either, really though, he just puts in a cheap ending too."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Nothing to do with the Haven story as we expected.

I am not a big horror fan so have not read much Stephen King; I have little basis for comparison to his other works. Without the connection to the television show, I would not have read this at all. I read the \\"Afterward\\" FIRST, which prevented my total disgust by the end of the actual story! Without the prior knowledge, I would have probably burned the book. More questions about the titular character were raised than answered. I was able to enjoy the interplay between the characters, because that's all the book was.

I book did keep my attention but I was never sure where the author was going with the story line. Then the way he finished the book was a cliff hanger. There was no answers to the story line. He left you hanging like he might write another book.I was told that this book is what the TV series Haven was based on. Personally I dont see it other than the name of the missing person is The Colorado Kid.It one of those books where you need to read it for yourself in order to make an opinion."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Thank you, SyFy's Haven! You got me wanting to read this!Well, for a horror master, this turned out to be quite tame. No real horror at all (except cringe-worthy times of \\"reflecting\\" on a different area's accent) and, for an author not afraid of using any given cussword, this wasn't only mild in the lanugage department, there also wasn't much in the ratio as a normal King book I've read. But those are minor details.What's this about? 2 newspapermen tell a new woman about the most enigmatic case they've ever worked on, giving specific details (at times, overbearingly so) as to why it's so strange for them.I wish I could say much about this story, but unlike other novellas and short novels of his I've read (like Carrie and The Gunslinger), this felt lacking in King's potential storytelling method and style. Really, it's nothing but a story being told within a story, and not evenin the same way as the famous scene in Shakespeare's Hamlet, just giving detail;s, making snide references, checking that the men did certain investigatory details, make a couple jokes, but ultimately, no real resolve. So, the story's tagline felt misleading, but at least one good thing cam out of this novellum.It gave birth to a really good SyFy show, Haven."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King has a writing style that just seems so comfortable to me. This book was no different. I almost immediately liked the characters and the mystery being unraveled.

My wife and I both liked this story."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen king is best known for horror, to state the obvious. This is a mystery story that makes you forget you aren't reading horror. The character development is Kings typical A+. Because it is engrossing, you don't realize until you are done that there is no action, only narrative. And although you have been warned from the start that there is no satisfactory, neat, wrap up, it is still a shock when that's exactly how it ends. If you can't stand an unsolved mystery then this book is not for you. But if you value a good spin that leaves you saying \\"I bet this is what happened,\\" then you will enjoy this book. And be sure to read the afterword."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stayed up way too late. I had to know. Stephen King never disappoints me. You'll have to think about this one.

I am not entirely sure WHY I enjoyed it. I love the mystery... but I hate not being able to figure it out."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Still I blame the King!:) He has given us so many multi-layered nightmares, freight expresses and multi-plotted frenzic masterpieces in the past that whenever he sits down and writes a minimalistic story (in his own standards) with minimal characters and minimal but always a decent storyline with his unimitable trade mark prose we instantly start to moan and groan. It is not all that frustrating; if you keep your expectations DECENT, ie not look for a SHINING or DARK TOWER or a mindless adventure pack like MIKE HAMMER or SIN CITY, but you want to read a very good story, then this is the book for you...If you call this boring, then try Mr. Grisham's latest snoozefest the BROKER! If you call this upruptly ended without any clarification, then try Mr. Koontz's despisable THE TAKING and see how one can write the cheapest end.To those who criticse the cover: The pulp fiction covers never reflected the story- imagine that there is a very handsome and athletic man on the cover, but the dedective could be easily a balding, almost fifty, granddaddy type with a belly size of a truck tyre. Go figure?"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'd have to say, no disrespect intended, anyone rating this book 5 stars probably needs to broaden their literary horizons. I'm no snob, I've read everything Stephen King has ever written and know he can be a brilliant writer. However, I also know he can sometimes be a pedestrian writer with some ridiculous plots. The plot of \\"Colorado Kid\\" isn't ridiculous, it's just boring.The characters in \\"Colorado Kid\\" are worse than boring, they are irritating caricatures. The \\"green\\" journalist and the two wizened old journalists. None of these characters are developed beyond broad strokes and the knee-slapping rhetoric spoken by the old journalists wears thin very fast (I've read a lot of King, and seen my fair share of \\"ayuhs,\\" but enough already!).Given the shortness of the book, it is amazing how S-L-O-W it is and how long it takes to tell what amounts to next to nothing. Structurally it is sound, King is an excellent writer, but, like another reviewer, I finished it with no satisfaction beyond having actually been done with it. \\"Colorado Kid\\" is no worse than a number of short stories King has done over the years, but as a stand alone novel, it leaves a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Wow. I never thought I'd see this. I've been reading King since I was a kid and have always enjoyed his books, defended him against elitist snobbery, but never again. I feel like I should get my money back, that this is just shy of fraud. In any case, it is laziness of the highest order. The story isn't finished or brought together as all mysteries should. Also, he didn't make any effort to fact-check, and his editor must have been asleep (probably bored by the story). Example: The story is set in 1980, and the character does three things that couldn't have happened then. First, he has a Diet Coke. Nope. No such thing in 1980. Second, he and his wife enjoyed renting movies at Blockbuster. Nope. No Blockbuster in 1980. Lastly, the character runs out of his office for a \\"real coffee\\" at Starbucks. In Denver, 1980. Nope. Starbucks existed, but was one store in Seattle. Laziness."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"It made me want a deeper longer version that might tie into the TV series.

Just read it!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I was looking to see how this might tie into the TV show Haven. As far as I read it really doesn't but was still interesting."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King's The Colorado Kid reads like a tame episode of that defunct television series, Unsolved Mysteries. King, more known for his horror tales than for his mysteries, delivers no real chills or frights in this very short tale (especially in regards to King's standards). What he delivers is a soft mystery that doesn't really hold any true resolution for the reader.Steffi is a young reporter for a small-town newspaper. She has just started her job a month or so ago, working for the two elderly men who own the paper. She's an arts and things column writer, delegated to those stories no one really cares about, especially in small New England towns (is there any other setting for a King tale???).Soon enough, Vince and Dave tell Steffi the most baffling story they've encountered during their long career in journalism, one that involves the body of a dead man found on a beach with no identification on his body save for a pack of cigarettes and a piece of steak stuck in his throat.The story itself isn't incredibly interesting. What makes it worthy are the twists and turns created by our old journalistic couple (you can totally picture Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon playing these two). They weave through the story so naturally, it's just like hearing someone telling it to you face to face. King has always been a master at dialogue and this book proves that he hasn't lost his touch over the years. In fact, his talent has only gotten better.The story never offers a real conclusion for the reader, which might annoy some readers. And the fact that this isn't really a hard tale goes against the mandate set by the 'Hard Crime' series (which this book is part of). Regardless, for what it is, The Colorado Kidd is a fun story to read, all the while being somewhat forgettable as well. This sure isn't one of King'S best, but it won't be remembered as one of his worst either."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I got this book after watching the first season of Syfy's show \\"Haven\\", which is supposedly based on this book. That being said I was extremely disappointed in the book. The story itself was ok, not what I'd exepect from King, but I managed to finish it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Writing mysteries is different from writing horror stories. Mysteries turn on logic and sanity, which are not only NOT required for a good horror story, they can actually get in the way. So it should not be surprising that Stephen King has never excelled at mystery. That, coupled with his recent fascination with the \\"I-Guess-We'll-Never-Know\\" school of plot resolution, makes \\"The Colorado Kid\\" a short but unsatisfying read. Not a disaster, since King's talent for creating suspense is in full force here, just unsatisfying, since it is suspense leading up to nothing. The book is being sold as the kind of hard-boiled crime tale that John D. McDonald did in his sleep in the 50s, but it isn't -- not by a long shot. If anything, it's a shaggy dog story by a high-profile writer who loved the old Gold Medal paperbacks of the post war era, who is lending his name to help launch a new hard-boiled imprint. The cover blurbs try to invoke the ghost of Dashiell Hammett, but the book has as much in common with \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" as the exquisite painting of the dark-haired femme fatale with the knowing expression on the cover has with the 22-year-old blond fawn of the book. For all the story's uncertainty, Dashiell HAMLET might be a better analogy anyway. King certainly sets up an intriguing central mystery, but that's all this book is: a set-up, with a couple of painfully belabored clues along the way (and about a dozen digs at \\"Murder She Wrote\\" for good measure...though whether King's annoyance with the show springs from its faux Maine setting or the fact that it actually presented a solution to its mysteries each week is anyone's guess). Without spoiling what little is there, suffice it to say that the parallel time-tracks and non-resolution shtick worked a lot better in King's \\"From A Buick 8,\\" whose story had a forward momentum (two, in fact, one for each time track) as it actually took place, instead of a 180-page remembrance drawled out by the Pepperidge Farm man. \\"The Colorado Kid\\" can be read as a time killer -- a lunch hour or commuter train ride kind of book, quick to read and about as resonant as yesterday's crossword puzzle. But even die-hard King fans shouldn't bother making room in actual quality time for it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I must admit. I am not Kings biggest fan. I like the way he writes characters, but for years, I haven't been able to put my finger on why I don't like his books. After reading The Colorado Kid, I realized what it was. King is a lazy writer. He can tell a good story, but he doesn't follow through. His typical way out of a jamb is to make some inanimate object talk. Bleh. You can tell when he is done with a story. It just ends.This book is no exception. The story rambles through the mouth of a clich&eacute;d old time reporter teaching a young'un the ropes. King tells the story, he doesn't show it. I kept waiting for the narrative to stop and for the action to begin, but it never did.And the ending! Someone, his editor, agent, family or friends, tell Mr. King that mysteries are supposed to be resolved. He doesn't resolve this mystery. That was the only reason, other than the fact that I had a 7 hour flight and nothing else to do, that kept me reading. I got to the end and I swear I almost tossed the book while on the plane. There is an after word trying to justify his ending. I didn't get past the first sentence. Authors don't write justifications for their books unless they know they are guilty of something.If I could take away all the stars on this book, I would. Even one star is one too many."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I was terribly disappointed with this King release. Could a creative writing student done better? Perhaps. It was by far the worst published work I've ever read. It was unreadable. Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed. The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere. The book seemed to be published on his name alone. I have been disappointed in S. King for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch. I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I've read just about everything Stephen King has written, and without a doubt, this is the worst book (non story) he has ever written. I'm wondering if he can still write. This is, by the author's own definition, a non story. Boy, is he ever right! No beginning, no middle, and no end. Just a lot of words. I'm willing to give him one more chance. If his next book (Cell) is anything like this one, it will be the last Stephen King book I ever read."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The Colorado Kid is one of the best and most satisfying books of 2005. At 183 pages, it eschews plot and violence in favor of an engaging meditation on the nature of mystery, which is, as King states in his afterword, simply a more accurate word for \\"reality.\\" (If you're looking for the grit and twists of classic pulp, this isn't the book for you.)Many of the book's chapters are almost self-contained stories, resolving with some relatively satisfying revelation. But these revelations are not final--they are one step in the greater and more mysterious story, one quick peel of the onion. It is not, King suggests, superficial and transitory answers which should preoccupy us, but rather the real and human characters involved in them. As the main character observes, persons involved in mysteries are not literary devices but individuals who act and react. They should not be dismissed as mere vessels for evidence.The Colorado Kid debuted in paperback, so at $5.99 it's the cheapest new book you'll pick up anytime soon. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The most disappointing book that I've read in a very long time. I know that one shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but this one was highly deceiving. By the title, the cover and the description, I thought that Steve King was writing a pulp mystery novel. He certainly didn't do that.What he wrote was a very long drawn out, sermonizing, story with one dimensional characters that one didn't care about who were telling a long, drawn out story that didn't go any where.Granted, some of the early pulp mysteries had one dimensional characters and no plots; however, those are not the stories that we remember from the Golden Age of Mystery.Mr. King didn't do this small press any favors when he wrote this book. I certainly won't be interested in anything else in their line."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"If you are looking for the definitive HAVEN story, this is not it. Some of the characters in this short story are the same and that is all they have in common (period) This is an interesting SHORT Stephen King story BUT not worth the money being asked for it. If you can find it in the LIBRARY then it is worth the trip, otherwise borrow it from a friend. I would say $0.99 is a fair price, but the kindle price is way to much and the used prices are out of sight. If you are a King collector, fine, otherwise, wait and find it in a used bookstore or, like I said, borrow it. The story id about a 3 star and that is what I rated it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I liked this story mostly because it sort of does leave one hanging. That's the mystery of it. However, I think I like the TV show loosely based on it, better. I bought and read \\"Colorado Kid\\" because I wanted to know about the Colorado Kid in the show. At this point, the name and a couple of the characters are all it has in common, but I still like \\"Haven\\" better."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I got this book hoping it would give me some more the back-story to Haven (SyFy show based on book). Well it really didn't help me much there and it wasn't the best story. But I still did enjoy reading it. The only thing I wish was that there might have been a bit more of hints to why the Colorado Kid was in Maine, or even some more theories on why by the characters. I guess that was just left more to the reader though, which is fine by me.So if you want to get this hoping it will give more info for Haven, you probably won't learn anything of use. If you are looking for a mystery with a solution, you also out of luck. But if you want a shorter mystery story that could leave you thinking of the possibilities, this should be good for you."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"As I read this enjoyable page-turner, The Colorado Kid, some sixteen years after opening my first Stephen King book, it occurred to me that King might just be the wisest fiction writer ever to live. Who else delivers so many small, unexpected grains of wisdom in his books? Who else could work so many life lessons into the otherwise limiting genres for which he is best known? And yet King does just that, and he does it every time, The Colorado Kid no exception. I won't point out what I'm talking about, but if anyone who has ever read Stephen King truly stops to think about it, the fact comes clear.The Colorado Kid is yet another \\"post-retirement\\" release from Maine's favorite son. In its fast-moving two-hundred pages the facts of a beguilingly unsolved (there's a hint there for you) mystery is told to an interning journalist (hey, from Cincinnati, no less) by two veteran newsmen, one in his nineties, the other a mere slip of a boy of sixty-five. The story concerns the discovery a generation back, in April 1980, of an unknown and for a time unidentifiable man found dead on a local beach. The body appears to have fallen victim to natural causes, and yet yields no identification, only a handful of clues that set off more questions than answers. The tale---not a story!---of who this man was, where he was from, and why against all logic he came to be alone on a beach in Maine, as well as how he met his most unusual death, is explored by the two old journalists and the intern, and for those learned in the Zen maxim about \\"the tale being journey sufficient in itself; the end unneeded\\" The Colorado Kid should be a pleasing read. For others..."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is a tedious novel. It's only 180 pages long and I still had to push myself to bother finishing it. This is really nothing more than a short story padded out to short novel length and that's one of its many problems: The central mystery is uninteresting. The way it is written, 2 old men telling the story to a young woman, allows for no real action or confrontation. The 2 old men telling the story are irritating and long-winded, having much difficulty coming to a point, there is no resolution at the end and no point in the story being told. This is not a 'hard-boiled' crime novel as the cover suggests.I'm not really sure what this book is besides dull. Stephen king is a wonderful writer and it's enticing to see him try a new genre, but if anyone else had written The Colorado Kid, it would not have been published in this series."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I brought this book on my Kindle because of the show Haven...I am also a Stephen King fan...for the most part...the story was just ok and I didn't find it had much if anything to do with the SciFi series...if that is why you want to read this..do not waste your time...it really isn't worth the seven or eight bucks..."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Since the show \\"Haven\\" first aired I have been trying to find a copy of the story on which it was based. I have to say I was not disappointed. It is as eerie as the show and as with a lot of Mr. King's work, it leaves you with more questions than answers. If you haven't read it or seen \\"Haven\\", I heartedly reccommend both. But if you are not a King fan, maybe you won't get it. LOL"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I bought this older book since it is the basis for SfFy Chsnnel's \\"Haven\\" series. While the TV series is a bit different, and deals with many more mysteries, I found the book was an easy and good read. Steven King's story telling leads the reader just as the two older gentlemen of the local newspaper lead a person in the story as they reveal the details. I was lead to 'discover' certain ideas just before they were revealed in the narrative. This lead me to keep reading, looking for the ending of the tale.How it differs from the TV series, what happens, how it ends, well, that's up to a reader to discover - the most pleasurable part of it all."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I have no problems with a story that has questions unanswered. As a matter of fact, the story of The Colorado Kid is an intriguing one. If executed properly, it would make a wonderful addition to the new Pulp series. However, the execution is frightfully dreadful. The whole setup, with the two jolly old guys and the wide-eyed intern, is embarrassingly contrived. I literally cringed at many parts of the story. After writing so many books that range anywhere from mediocre to brilliant, it's amazing that Stephen King is still capable of writing something that's so reminiscent of a high school sophomore's first attempt at novel writing. I read this book on a flight from Washington DC to Southern California, I wish I had opted the in-flight movie instead."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Three characters. One room. And not one bloody thing happens.At times this book feels like an endless one act play starring Ye Small Town Maine Stereotypes; at other times it's more like being stuck in some airless retirement home. Is King trying to entertain anyone except for himself? Maybe his fans enjoy this stuff, but pulp noir readers would be better served by any other title from Hard Case Crime."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I gave this book 2 stars - not because it was a bad book, but because it's only about 2/5 of a book. The story itself was more a a local color character study, and an easy pleasant read. The problem is the story was about a mystery, and finished up leaving it a mystery. In other words, the story went absolutely nowhere.King doesn't follow his own advice. One of the aging reporters in the story explains that nobody wants to read about a mystery that doesn't have a conclusion - leaving a story open ended leaves people thinking the writer failed his job, and they'd be right. King crapped out on this one - although in his self-important preening he takes the view that he did it right. No, Steve, you didn't.So, you get a quality 2 stars for the 2/5 of a book. You want the other 3, then get back to work and finish the damn story."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"King says in the Author's Note section of The Colorado Kid that people are going to either love this book or hate it outright. No middle ground. I think he's pretty close to being right on here. The Colorado Kid is not going to make a lot of Stephen King junkies very happy. But...the fix is in. Just like heroin or nicotine or sugar-laced junk food snacks, Stephen King is an addiction that a lot of us have (myself included) and it's good to get a little jolt from our favorite author once in a while, even if it's just a little blurb to tide us over until his next masterpiece comes along. Well...and I say this lovingly, having been a Stephen King junkie for more than half my life now, having read pretty much everything he's written...The Colorado Kid is like the '05 version of Gerald's Game. That's not a good thing. Gerald's Game is probably the only Stephen King book I would never read again. Why? Because it is crap. Written in a two-week period, it's was pushed out at a time when Steve-O had a glut of work going on and dollar-signs were in the air. I get the same feel from The Colorado Kid but not as much. This effort seemed more like Steve-O flexing his writing muscles after the long bout with The Dark Tower and threats of retirement. Bottom line is this: The Colarado Kid is readable and mildy entertaining and for us King Junkies a great chance to hear our favorite author's voice...and that's it. Those who think this is a clever mystery or an attempt at art are trippin'. This is an over-bloated short story with no real resolution. If you think about it, what other author would have gotten away with a book like this? Who? If this was someone's first novel it would never have been published in a million years, so let's not mince words with favorable reviews and hinted-at nuances that aren't even there. Please. Steve-O will be back with something much cooler than this, but like I said, in the meantime, The Colorado Kid was the injection, the filched smoke, the midnight snack until he produce something of substance. Enjoyable read, and nothing more.Dig it!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Steven King said you will either hate this story or love it. I loved it.In a world where far too much of the \\"news\\" is a media show, and the truth seldom gets much attention, it is refershing to read a story about the passion, of real news people, for the truth. While writing in the pulp-mystery genre Steven King manages a charming story about the value of mentoring for both the apprentice and the advisor - and about knowing as much of the truth as possible, even if you can never print it.It comes across as a quickly written story set in a style uncommon to the author - almost a throw away, except that it bears all of the marks of craftmanship I have come to expect in a Stephen King novel."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am perfectly happy when stories do not always end with a resolution, but in a series called \\"Hard Case\\" that is all about the mystery, King failed to deliver. This book is three people sitting down and talking. Nothing happens. The entire plot is told in this dialogue. It was very unsatisfying and tedious to read. SPOILERS AHEAD>>>> Though the idea of examining the mystery itself is a noble one, this was not the place. King's Afterword redeems him somewhat, but he fails to understand why readers might pick up a Hard Case book or a mystery book. If he wanted to examine mystery, he should have written a short story about it and included it in one of his own collections or sent it off to a magazine. This story could have been told in about 30 or 40 pages, but it drags on for 180 with no resolution. That's just cruel to do to your readers! If it were beautifully-written, I could forgive him for being so self-indulgent, but the dialogue seems stilted at times, and the silly interjections of the journalism business or the relationships between the characters was distracting and poorly written. I love a good mystery, but this has made me never want to pick up another Hard Case novel, as I'm afraid of what I might find."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Perhaps this story was too subtle for me, but I think it's the writer's duty to provide some kind of resolution. The mystery was not in itself profound or engaging enough for me to want to speculate about it afterwards. We don't know enough about the victim; there is no emotional connnection to him. If Mr. King were not already a famous writer, this story would never had gotten published, because it's a slow burn and flouts the conventions of the genre."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This is not a hard-boiled crime. In fact there's not clear indication of a crime at all, just an unexplained dead person. And it's certainly not hard-boiled. The recounting of an unexplained death 25 years later by two senior citizens is more a study in quirky New England personalities than anything else.Also, it really irked me that characters living in 1980 refer to Diet Coke, BlockBuster Video and Starbucks coffee respectively two, five and seven years before they could have ever even heard of them. (maybe King couldn't afford hiring a fact-checker)If you're a King fan, you might like this. If you're looking for \\"Hard Case Crime\\" (as I was) keep looking, there are plenty of great examples of those in this series. (Girl with the Long Green Heart is great!)"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King, The Colorado Kid (Hard Case Crime, 2005)When you pick up a book from Hard Case Crime you expect, well, a hardboiled crime novel. Be warned, therefore, that such is not what you get with Stephen King's The Colorado Kid at all. In fact, the closest thing to which I can compare it in King's massive oeuvre is Dolores Claiborne, but without quite as much violence, adult themes, what have you.As with Dolores Claiborne, much of the story is told in tale, in this case by two old newspapermen talking to an intern. The story itself deals with the body of a man found dead on the beach. No one knows anything about him, and the bulk of the tale deals with the two newspapermens' quest to get information about the body.It's exceptionally short for a Stephen King novel, which some people will no doubt welcome, and exceptionally calm for a Stephen King novel, which will no doubt be welcomed by others. Those looking for hardboiled crime novels are advised to look elsewhere in Hard Case's roster, but those who read King know that, at the very least, they'll get a passel of interesting and well-drawn characters and a readable book by picking this one up. ***"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"A light, quick read.Not much happens, other than a trio of reporters discussing an unexplained \\"crime\\" that may or may not have happened 25 years prior.But then, I always thought the magnificence of King was in the character development, interaction and dialogue - with the plot coming in a distant second. My only complaint is that nothing about the jacket, synopsis, or, especially, King's history, would give the reader an advance warning that this is anything less than a typical novel.For what it is, it is done well. Perhaps reminiscent of a scene from the Great Gatsby, for example, when the characters sat about sweating and chatting on the porch. Very well done, but incomplete if marketed as a novel.I like King - so, for me, seven bucks and a couple hours does not leave me feeling cheated.*in way of a little postscript to other reviewers: do I remember wrong that King had a character reference something to the effect of \\"maybe the guy stopped at a blockbuster to rent a movie\\"? Interesting, since BB was not around til 85, and then only in texas for a bit.

Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I've finished this book in 4 readings, on the train to work and back.

Not even letting me assume some kind of ending... It just leaves you flat in the air. I am a King fan.. reading the dark tower series and other novels,.. but this one simply was a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I'm a long-time fan of King's and an admirer of the Hard Case Crime series. However, unlike peanut butter and chocolate, this book is an example of two great tastes that don't taste great together.This was the first of the Hard Case books that didn't deliver damsels, double-crosses, and tough guys. It reads like something King had hidden in the bottom of his trunk from back in the early '60s, and updated minimally for 2005. There was no tension, no thrills, and I had no interest in reading it after page 75, but pushed through the last 100 pages anyway.I think all fans of tough guy fiction and horror books should steer away from this book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I've been a Stephen King Fan ever since I read Carrie. I loved The Shining with it's big old hotel high in the mountains and the madness that took place there. The Stand was a novel of epic brilliance.King has said that he doen't mind going for the gross out, and that's what Dreamcatcher did for me - grossed me out. But still, there was a story, a tale of the supernatural - or at least the unknown.Then comes the Colorado Kid. What can I say? It left me flat. When I read a mystery I eagerly wait the denoument. I want answers, a brilliant explanation. With the Colorado Kid, all I got was more questions. At the end I still wasn't sure if the death involoved was accidental or murder.I think Dorothy Parker said it well: \\"This book shouldnot be easily put down, it should be thrown against the wall with great force.\\"Come on Stevie. You can and have done far better than this!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I can identify with all you rabid Stephen King fans out there, as I am one myself. Most of you would agree that the master of horror couldn't write something uninteresting if he tried. This book has few bright spots however, and none of the \\"I can't put this book down\\" feel that is common to most of Mr. King's work. It is short enough that readers should make it through to the end, but what is waiting there to reward them is no prize. Mr. King's popularity sets him into a unique place. He can publish anything, and book sellers and loyal fans will eat it up. Because of this, I think he is toying with his readers, as an experiment. What he hopes to learn by this experiment is beyond me, and I am not happy to have been a part of it. Read this book if you feel you must, or if you have read everything he has ever written, but be warned, it is not up to his usual standard."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Believe it or not, I first saw this book in my local grocery store and the words \\"First publication ANYWHERE\\" grabbed my attention. A new book by Stephen King that hadn't been promoted half to death? Or had it - and I'd just missed it somehow?I also couldn't believe that a Stephen King novel would be published as a paperback its FIRST time out, let alone with a cover that featured a scantily clad women with a come hither look in her eyes. Not the typical cover one would expect on a King novel.Clearly, this was not meant to come across as a usual Stephen King work (which is probably why there were still some copies left).Your reaction to this one may well depend on your expectations. If you are hoping for \\"typical\\" Stephen King writing or a horror story, this may not be to your liking. I'd argue that NOTHING King writes is completely expectable or predictable. I'm glad that he is willing to go out on a limb and take chances with his writing, even though his name alone can sell books. He could write plenty of stinkers and still make a pretty penny. His readers are that loyal.So I was delighted to find that this book was actually enjoyable, although it may still seem baffling to some readers, including those familiar with the tropes of pulp fiction. It has echoes of vintage pulp fiction but veers off in totally unexpected directions, challenging the reader to keep up - and to figure out what is being said, underneath the veneer of the story itself.The basic plot focuses on the discovery of a dead man, no identification, very few clues to be found. But the plot itself is only a starting point for an examination of the unknown and the nature of mystery, whether in real life or fiction, so don't expect any nice, neat ending. But if you like books that force you to think about what the author was trying to accomplish - and why- this one will do the trick.While I'm a bit baffled as to WHY the publishers of this book (Hard Case Crime) are trying to revive pulp fiction, it is a daring and bold experiment and it will be interesting to see how well they do.I'd always thought of the form as dated until I saw the movie L.A. Confidential which was both steeped in film noir elements with plenty of hints of pulp fiction thrown in, making for a wonderful mix.Maybe pulp fiction STILL has plenty of life left in it, especially in an updated form. I'm game - I'm buying more of the books in this series. The covers alone are a hoot!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am a hard boiled detective fiction fan, not necessarily a Stephen King fan (although I have read several of his books). So, I fit one of the two categories of reader who will pick this book up in first place. Yes, I am one of the people who read and hated this book...and Mr. King knew this was coming: This was his rationale for writing an apology (called an Afterword) which goes on to EXCUSE and EXPLAIN his thin purpose in writing this schlock. I was always of the mind that good writing stands on its own. This book, obviously, does not...and even its author knows it.Mr. King broke the tacit trust in the writer/reader relationship (that promise of delivering what you advertise) by penning this \\"road to nowhere\\" and veiling it as anything more than self indulged meanderings. As a book, it fails as work of Mr. King (although not a fan, I do like some of his work), and it fails as a hard boiled crime novel. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY READING THIS DRIVEL. Learn from my mistake, as I regret my lost money and time."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Stephen King says in the Afterwood, that you will either love this book or hate it and I think nothing could be more true than that statement. I'm sure there will be lots of one star reviews, maybe as many as the five star ones for the simple case that the book does not have closure or isn't a supernatural or horror themed novel like so many of King's others. For the record I wouldn't call The Colorado Kid a masterpiece like I would King novels such as It, Christine or Misery and its not a book you read and immediately give it to other people telling them they have to read it like those masterpieces were, but I would still rate The Colorado Kid five stars in quality and thoroughly enjoyed the read.If you want a Stephen King book with expectations of a frightening tale that will keep you awake for nights, or a book with a beginning, a middle and a conclusion that wraps the story up in a neat little package than you will be disappointed with the Colorado Kid. The Colorado kid is the story told by a young female recent journalism graduate who has moved to a remote island off the coast of Maine who recounts the tale of the being told a story and being tested for future employment at the same time by her two old men colleague/bosses at a small regional newspaper called The Weekly Islander. The story revolves around the mysterious discovery of the body of a man from Colorado on one of the island's beaches who by all reasonable logic should not have had time to make it to the island from Colorado let alone have time to die there.Length wise this book is around isn't that long and only takes a couple of hours at most to read. Stephen King has published many short stories in his collection of short story novels that are the same length as this. If you have a flight that will take a few hours or want something small and light to carry in your backpack than this book is ideal."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Coming in at just under 180 pages, this is a rather short work for Sir Stevie. I read this book in a weekend and it made for a good read. Passed the time.Is this your typical Stephen King work? No. As he says himself in the Afterward, there will be those that hate it and those that love it. No middle. However, I find myself in the middle. I neither hated it, nor loved it. Although, I do give it 4 stars.The story and mystery are excellent. The characters are characters you will like and relate to and cheer for. But, as the author even says himslef, he didn't solve the mystery on purpose. He did this mainly because he was interested in the \\"mystery' itself, not the solution. The mystery itself is a good one.The story has the beginnings to a great King novel. But, alas, you must finish the mystery yourself on this one.I have read many of King novels (and see I have not written many reviews here for them) and I am almost always never disappointed. If you enjoy King or you enjoy a good mystery, not a solution, but a good mystery, you will enjoy this book. However, if you have never read King before, this is not a good place to start. Why not start at the beginning with Carrie? Read a bit more of his earlier work, then come here to this one.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"A mystery that never develops. An ending that made me throw the book accross the room in disgust. They can refund my money, but I will never get the time I wasted back again."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I generally enjoy Stephen King books (and LOVE many of them), but this was horrid -- it's astounding that he can tell such a boring tale in so short a space (though the \\"story\\" -- and I use that term loosely -- is about four times as long as it needs to be).Here's my question, and then I'm done thinking about this book: King goes out of his way to mention that the dead man and his wife watched some movie from Blockbuster before he died. Now, he died in 1980. Blockbuster didn't open its doors until 1985. Is this one of King's notorious research (as in lach thereof) screw-ups, or is this some kind of clue?In the spirit of The Colorado Kid itself, I will ask only the question and not even attempt to answer it."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I will never EVER again buy a book just because his name is on it. Waste of money. He is selling a short story for almost the price of a novel. Nice way to make money but it is the last time I fall for it. To the used book store it goes so some other sucker can read it, but at least it will be 1/2 price. Still a waste of money at 1/2 price."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"When a man is found dead on the beach of an island off the coast of Maine it is quickly classified as a case of accidental death. Only some minor local interest is raised when it turns out that the victim had no identification whatsoever on his body. Vince Teague and Dave Bowie, two reporters from The Weekly Islander, do all that is within the power of a local newspaper to find out the true identity of that mysterious guy, but without much luck. Years later a missing link is found by a graduate student in forensics, but the news story is as dead as its main protagonist. Nobody seems to be interested in yet another case of an unsolved crime. But maybe the real reason is that the truth beyond the mystery is too hard to face. Because in the end when you eliminate all impossibilities, what is left, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.Although Stephen King in a way apologises -by means of adding an Afterword to The Colorado Kid- for having produced an atypical mystery novel, it does not really rings well to the average reader. It is easy to claim that this is due to the fact that the story has no real ending, but I think it quickly becomes clear that the problem lies much deeper. The rather flat and colourless depiction of the main characters does not really help in getting the reader emotionally involved. Whereas a good writer can still cover this up by a well composed plot, it is exactly this lack of storyline that adds to the misery and makes reading it so unsatisfactory. It really blows my mind why it takes more than a third of the book to come to introducing The Colorado Kid. Maybe when Hard Case Crime asked King for a story, the only thing left in King's drawer was a short story. Adding a lengthy character introduction might have made it into a book, but certainly not into something King can put into his hall of fame."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I love Stephen King's work, but every once in a while, I get disappointed. This is one of those books that did disappoint. I was captured by the story's potential and quickly read the entire book in one sitting.Here is where the \\"however\\" comes in . . .Without giving away the ending, I can only say that, to me, there was no ending. What could have been a great plot twist, ended flat.What could have been a great short story, had me shaking my head and asking, \\"WHAT??? Is this it?\\"Sorry Stephen, but that's what I felt. (It will not discourage me from getting \\"The Cell\\" as soon as it is released."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Typical king. just short. not quite what i expected from a king book but was definitely entertaining. need more to read@"},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I appreciated the drawn out tale with **spoiler alert** no conclusion. The characters were engaging as all King characters are and the story was well told. Good book."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I am a Stephen King fan going back years and he never disappoints. Whether its a nail biter or just a good mystery I love him. This was really good ."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I supposed this book will polarize many readers. They will either love it or hate it. Personally, I quite enjoyed it. The best way to go into the book is not to have any expectations. Begin reading and let Stephen King take you on a journey. This is one author that you can trust to deliver. Although I was not in love with many of his recent books, I still respect his mastery of the craft. The Colorado Kid had a lot more hits than misses for me and was one of the better reads of recent King releases.This short crime mystery is published under the Hard Case Crime label has some very memorable characters and dialogue. As it begins to unfold, the story becomes more and more fascinating. Some will argue that King's weakness has always been his endings, and for those readers, this book might top their list. However, as King writes in the afterword, it was the journey that I enjoyed and did not need the ending tied up so neatly. I felt more than satisfied with King's little tale. One's imagination, the theater of the mind, can be just as effective, if not more, than having everything spelled out. So, for me, this was a delightful read that I whole-heartedly recommend. Just keep an open mind, don't struggle, and let the story pull you along."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"The book was a disappointment. Not the usual King book. There was no conclusion by the end of the book, which he warns at the end."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"Mystery fans will pick up this book because it's a mystery. Stephen King fans will pick it up because it's Stephen King. Of the two sets of readers, the mystery fans will be the once more likely to enjoy themselves.The Colorado Kid is a quick-read mystery, nothing more and nothing less. Don't expect the supernatural; don't expect the in-depth characterization contained in King's longer works. If you read the author's afterword, you'll discover that this book delivers exactly what King wanted it to: a light read with darker undertones, a shorter piece of fiction that inspires more questions than it answers. From that standpoint, the broad strokes King uses to \\"paint his picture\\" deliver masterfully upon the book's simple promise.From my review so far, potential readers might assume I did not enjoy the book. Actually, I enjoyed it very much. It was fun, fast, and fascinating. I appreciate seeing one of my favorite authors trying his hand at a different genre, and I think he executed it well. Once I realized that I shouldn't expect \\"typical King,\\" I settled in and just let the story be what it is. For Stephen King fans, this might be the key to appreciating the novel.I give The Colorado Kid 4 stars instead of 3 because it kept me reading and questioning. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because, although the framing story (2 older reporters telling the tale to a newbie) is neat, I suspect that seeing the tale unfold \\"in real time\\" would have been more interesting."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"As an avid fan of Stephen King, I have read most everything he has written. This book was enjoyable, I was cruising along, reading, snacking, and then BAM it was over. I hated that, and that's why the low rating from me."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"At just below 200 pages, this book certainly wasn't an epic and really didn't have the space to be a King classic. However, it was a decent, quick read. Some might be disappointed with the ending, and I would usually be one of those people, but this time it just worked."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"I understand the experiment Stephen King had going with this book. \\"Is it possible to write a book about nothing?\\" The answer, at least in this case, is a resounding NO. Mr. King tried to write a book who's merits stood strictly on the narrative. As he repeatedly said throughout the book, there is no story. \\"There is no through-line.\\" It is a highly unsatisfying book, not because there is no solution to the mystery, but because there was barely any mystery. It was so mundane. At no point did I really care to figure out the mystery. If Mr. King had given me something to sink my teeth into, then maybe I would have been interested and I would have gotten involved. Instead, I finished the book, just to finish it. As the kids say, EPIC FAIL."},{"Title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"\\"The Colorado Kid\\" is a mystery written by Stephen King. The three main characters are two older men and a young woman, all newspaper reporters, and the story is told through a conversation between the old-timers and their young employee.Years before, and unsolved mystery took place in their small New England town. The Colorado Kid was found propped up beside a trashcan on the beach, a piece of meat stuck in his throat and likely what killed him. The unsolved case sparks theories as to what happened, why he was found thousands of miles from his Colorado home, and if he suspected what was coming his way.I'm a huge fan of Mr. King and loved reading this story. [I hope others won't be upset that it isn't in his usual horror genre and will enjoy this novel for the great read it is.]"},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"I really liked this book a lot, the majority of this book is how to draw TONS of different poses! i didn't even think about drawing some poses that i do in everyday life.And she shows the difference between the anatomy of a human body, and the manga body! which i thought was a total plus! One of the only things i was dissapointed with was the facial expressions, it didn't show how to draw them at all, and thats what i really struggle with! It's a great book for learning all about different poses, anatomy and posture, but not a great book for expressions."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"This book is pretty good, except it as a huge part on girls but barely anything about boys. Don't get me wrong the girl part shows a lot of different poses and there really good. Its just if your looking only for boys you shouldnt by this book."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"This was my first purchase outside of the official How To Draw Manga collection, and I chose this book because of the promise of emotions and facial expressions. But despite the official description and even the text on the book cover, this book did not live up to that implied promise.This book focuses heavily on how to draw bodies, and the advice it gives is sound and helpful. The tone of the text is occasionally arrogant but generally constructive. But almost all of the \\"emotion\\" shown in the book is through body language and posture; indeed, half the drawings don't have faces at all.If you're looking for simple anatomy lessons or an assortment of poses, this book could be helpful. But if you're looking for a reference for facial expressions, this is not suitable; you would find more facial expressions by picking a random book from the How To Draw Manga series."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"When I bought this book I was expecting to see an explanation on how to create different emotions and body frames. Well...not exactly. The emotion information they shared wasn't really helpful. Just showed a bunch of odd faces.As for the body. It had many different poses to put a \\"female\\" character in that I have to admit were really cute. But it would've been nice to get a detailed explanation how to get all the different positions. They didn't have any on males, but they did draw out the different sizes of a male's body. Not really helpful.Then they gave a little info on the hands and feet and the other pasrts of the body and yeah. That was pretty much it. They did have a few pictures of different kind of men and women in the back. But it really wasn't helpful.But hey, if you're wondering about doing different poses for your character. This is the book for you. They have different pages of positions for miles."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"Let's Draw Manga Bodies & Emotions is for Fine Art figure artists, as well as for Manga artists.No book covers everything, but this book supplements the other books in your library with some very important, unique material.A key focus of this book is body language -- how to communicate emotion and attitude with posture and gesture. In addition to providing drawing guidance, this material can also trigger ideas for how to pose live models.The author's illustrations, showing ball-jointed croquis and their corresponding completed forms, simplifies and isolates the gestures and postures, and illustrates the relationships between the croquis and the finished forms.Other sections of the book focus on hands (which many artists find quite difficult to draw) and feet, and on the relationship between croquis, muscle, skeleton, and finished form. Cube and cylinder drawing techniques are included.Head and face angles are another important area that the book focuses on.A unique contribution of this book is its discussion of body proportions. Most figure drawing books address the normal human proportions of seven or eight-head high adult figures, and variations for younger figures. This book shows how to deviate from those \\"normal\\" proportions in order to obtain alternative graphic drawing styles.The book ends with some material on fashion and on a variety of character types, styles and ages.I would recommend this book for any figure artist's library."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"I have several books of how to draw and this one is firmly in the middle of the pack usefullness wise. Some of the shortcuts to figure construction are worthwhile, but like many of this genra of how to books, it spends too little time on storytelling and too much on pin-up drawing. Still, it is better than just about any Christopher Hart book."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"This book is nice because it teaches how to convey emotions through drawing body language and covers body proportion nicely. I only wish it was a workbook with space to draw in."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga","review":"This is one of the best books i have purchased from amazon. This book has good instruction And it has about 40 skeleton poses (standing And sitting) that you can replicate and put clothes and a face on. I think doing this made me a better artist because it really helped with my anatomy. The only downside is all the examples are female so im still in the dark when it comes to the male figure. Dont waste your money on American Author how to draw books. only buy ones by Japanese Artist! i own about 15 books and every one written by a American Artist was bad especially Christopher Hearts Shoujo book where the images were so bad i could of drawn it better myself. The only American book i have faith in is the one Mark Crilley is making this winter (so i heard) because hes a legit published manga artist and has made over 100 videos talking about how to draw.The truth is no how to draw book will make you amazingly good at drawing, only your pencil and hard work will give you the real improvement. This book does give you some things to practice drawing and some pointers on anatomy. If you really want to get good at drawing manga buy a sketchbook and try to masterfully replicate 300 characters from Animecharacterdatabase.com. Just click on random female or random male and copy draw 300 times and make sure they come out near perfect. Once you finish you will know how to draw eyes 100s of ways and you will know how to draw lots of different clothing styles. I only got about 150 characters drawn using this method and i see a drastic change in my original character ability.

Just a good read."},{"Title":"Miss Buncle Married","review":"I just adored the first book in this series, Miss Buncle's Book. It was one of the most charming books I've read all year. Miss Buncle Married, the sequel, takes us on a rollicking journey to Wandlebury, the town that Barbara and her recently acquired husband, Arthur Abbot, have moved to after much searching for just the perfect place.Just as Barbara and Arthur are settling into their new home and married life, Arthur's nephew, Sam, comes to visit and finds more attractions in Wandlebury than just being the dutiful nephew. This is when the fun truly begins!D.E. Stevenson is a master at creating small villages with a group of eclectic characters that the readers can't help but fall in love with. The author truly has an eye for quirkyness and humor that delighted me throughout the book. Her character development is excellent. This second in the series introduced some new characters that I hope to see more of in the next book, The Two Mrs. Abbotts.Miss Buncle Married hit the spot with me and I really enjoyed my time with Barbara, her family and neighbors in the little English village of Wandlebury. 4.5****I am so thankful to Sourcebooks for re-publishing these books that were originally published during the 1930's. D.E. Stevenson is an author I had never heard of before and would most likely not have crossed my \\"readar\\" if it weren't for Sourcebooks.Disclosure: A review copy of the book was provided by Sourcebooks/Netgalley in exchange for my honest opinion."},{"Title":"Miss Buncle Married","review":"I've enjoyed D.E. Stevenson for years. Her books are some of the few that go into my library to read and reread. I \\"discovered\\" Miss Buncle's Book this summer when one of my daughter's friends told her she needed to read this book. To my delight a new edition was just being released at Amazon and I ordered it immediately. I loved this book and was soon rereading it. Could hardly wait to read the next book! Had to wait a few extra weeks for Miss Buncle Married to be available, but it's equally delightful. It will be saved among my books for when I need a cozy book to reread. Most books are not worth a second read. This is! A plea to the publishers...MORE PLEASE! Now I'd like to read The Two Mrs. Abbots and The Four Graces. These in older editions most of us cannot afford!"},{"Title":"Miss Buncle Married","review":"I ended up loving this book just as much as the first one for the exact same reasons. It is a charming story filled with humor, fun characters, and a plot with a couple of twists and turns. Now that Barbara is married she moves to a new town with her husband and so a whole new group of interesting neighbors are introduced. I loved reading about Barbara and her husband settling into married life and getting to know their new neighbors.We also get to meet Sam, a relative of Barbara's husband. Sam is a handsome young man who comes to visit the newly married couple and falls in love with one of their new neighbors. Of course Barbara feels it necessary to meddle in the relationship and some funny scenes are the result of that meddling.These books written by Stevenson are easy comfort reads that had me smiling the whole way through. I loved reading about the characters in this little town and the dramas that they dealt with. I highly recommend both this book and the first in the series, Miss Buncle's Book, they are both fun reads."},{"Title":"Miss Buncle Married","review":"I recently rediscovered D.E. Stevenson after many years. This visit to village life in England between the wars is a charming respite from modern day life. The narration is wonderful with one reader creating voices from dignified old lawyers to irrepressible children. If you enjoyed the Cranford books or TV series, you will like these characters."},{"Title":"Miss Buncle Married","review":"Ordered this immediately after reading \\"Miss Buncle's Book\\". Just as heartwarming as before, D.E. Stevenson spun more charm into this story as Mrs. Abbot, formerly Miss Buncle, moves with her husband to the little village of Wandlebury in order to avoid more tiresome bridge parties. They move into the dilapidated Archway House, which Barbara turns into a warm and wonderful home by the sheer force of her imagination, and meet their neighbors, whom Barbara catalogues with interest. It's a very sweet and cheerful book, one you won't be able to resist after the first, but lovely in its own right."},{"Title":"Miss Buncle Married","review":"It seems almost impossible to top the wonderful 'Miss Buncle's Book' that starts this series. I do recommend you read that first, since the Buncle novels do follow a sequence and the most pleasure and understanding can be gathered from them by reading them in order. What makes these books 'wonderful' is the wealth of characterization and 'telling' detail and, most of all, the amusement the author provides to the reader. In the early going, homage is paid to Dickens with a side-splitting portrait of an old-fashioned country lawyer. Set in the 1930's, these books do not seem dated except for the single aspect that plot lines include: young woman meets man, young woman marries, young family ensues. The problems the characters confronted in this story are related to setting up housekeeping, moving house, meeting new people and finding one's place in a new community. The story lines move along splendidly, with the cliff-hanger being 'who will inherit the wealthy but irascible old relative's fortune?' Most of the possible claimants do not look promising! This book is fine reading, perhaps more for feminine book lovers than for most men due to the extensive 'domestic' scenes presented."},{"Title":"Miss Buncle Married","review":"It is almost as good as the first was.

I had read many of the Miss Buncle and other books by this author a great many years ago and found a reference in the newspaper, El Pais, that the publishers were reissuing the books.

I've read it four or five times over the last 30 years, always around December 21st, weeping again and again as the portrayal of Bushman Hans Taiibosch in New York touches the wellsprings of my heart. This extraordinary man, alone in a foreign land bearing the unique depth of his own stone age culture and tradition within his heart, sharing it's dances and bearing a universal identification with the suffering and joys of all persons, in his own hidden suffering and love becomes an icon of Christ. Without the slightest hint of religiosity or doctrine, Sir Laurens Van Der Post weds anthropology and theology in a fascinating narrative that conveys this true synchronistic event from his life. Perhaps more than any white man on earth, Van Der Post knows and loves the vanishing Bushman people. His journey reveals the lasting power of that culture to affect modern civilization who have become incresingly cut off from and uncomprehending of our ancient past. We have betrayed the indigenous peoples within our own selves and in the world by seeking to own it and control it rather than belonging to it and loving it. The geonocide of the the first peoples all over the world is ultimately a genocide of us all. Yet there is hope. As the narrative brings Hans Taiibosch to life through the eyes of one whom he loved, the reader is confronted with human capacity to betray the Beloved over and over who even so, refuses to give up on loving us. An extraordinary portrayal."},{"Title":"A Mantis Carol","review":"A poignant story that successfully does the improbable and sifts the essence of the kalahari desert culture of the bushmen with the epitome of western culture in New York.A moving tribute to what makes us human through the eyes of both cultures.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Promises to Keep","review":"George Bernau's PROMISES TO KEEP is a political novel published in 1988, based on the facts of President John Kennedy's assassination in 1963. President John Cassidy is the main character who escaped assassination and was wounded and hospitalized for major surgery that saved his life but needed more surgeries to restore his health fully. While recuperating Vice President Ransom Gardner now acting as Lyndon Johnson was in charge and had to see Cassidy on his sick bed from time to time. While the Vietnam was on the debate as to who would become president in 1964 was going on and only the candidate that would end the war was sought for.The captivating story was written in simple narrative. It was full of intrigue, suspense and drama. It was quite good story telling of a sorrowful time that America passed through. The role played by Ransom Gardener was distant from Johnson's in 1963. Sullivan's role as dectetive is interesting and memorable."},{"Title":"Promises to Keep","review":"Bernau presents a fascinating \\"what if\\", wrapped around a moving plot of intrigue with an array of believable characters.

George Bernau explores the possibilities (with all names changed - JFK is now John Trelawney Cassidy). Bernau creates a very plausible scenario as to the chain of command and the problems faced by Cassidy and his family, and the Vice President. The novel also explores the mystery behind who did the shooting, and the disappearances and \\"accidental deaths\\" of those who get too close to the truth.

The reader who takes true enjoyment out of consuming good literature is the reader who will most appreciate this literary novel. Stewart has a large quantity of whatever it is that allows good writers to articulate cleanly the observations that we all make casually, unconsciously, every day. There is a feeling of victory when reading an author who describes something where the reader can say \\"Yes! Yes, it's exactly like that, I just never knew how to say so myself.\\"Beyond being just that, of course, the book contains a collection of compelling characters and situations that widely affect the reader, invoking sensations ranging from joy to betrayal, from heartbreak to hope, from humor to emotional (and even physical!) weariness.I gave this book out to several friends for the holidays and have already (three days later) started hearing very positive feedback. If you truly enjoy reading and you are looking for your next book, consider this one."},{"Title":"Flood Summer: A Novel","review":"While the major publishers are paying fiscal homage to the bland conglomerates by purchasing and publishing bland fiction, university presses have been picking up the aesthetic slack by publishing some of the best literature in translation and, thankfully, the best of American fiction. There is no better illustration of this phenomenon than SMU's publication of Trent Stewart's Flood Summer, a book of a quality that eighty years ago would have earned it the right to be published alongside Thomas Wolfe and hailed the advent of a fresh talent mentioned with the likes of Fitgerald, Faulkner, and the rest of the writers who left Main Street behind in order to write about it. This is a book with its own pace, without a 'hook', a real novel, with intelligent prose, acute observation that takes place naturally within the scope of event and action, and sentences the rise up like water moccasins coiled in trees above flood water evoking the best of Conrad and Cormac McCarthy."},{"Title":"Flood Summer: A Novel","review":"Unable to put Trenton Lee Stewart's feast of a debut novel down, I devoured it in three sittings. Rather than summarize Flood Summer's menu of events, I'd like to rave about the book impressionistically.During its initial chapters, in a scene inside a neck-deep flooded house in the country, the image of a poisonous water moccasin swimming toward the main male character Abe, with its head raised like a frog's, is just one of Stewart's dozens of creepy forget-me-nots. The sheer length and audacity of Stewart's suspenseful description of Abe's swimming, slipping, and sliding around, trying to avoid snakes and free his best friend's mother from where she's wedged, drowning between her car and a tree -- this section is absolutely spellbinding. Afterward of course the novel must go on. But Flood Summer refuses to \\"dry up,\\" thanks in large part to Abe, a larger than life yet one-hundred-percent three-dimensional Arkansan. Bookish, a lone wolf, he lends the novel Biblical/Lincolnian stature.In his Appalachian Gothic thriller-cum-love story Stewart gives us Abe's parents and working-crew buddies all rendered with the sculptor Duane Hanson's tough loving care. Then, too, there's the dark, exotic newcomer in Hot Springs, Marie, equally sculpted, complete with her train of characters, including the unforgettable waitress/newlywed Laine. I was especially taken with Stewart's portrait of Marie's \\"single\\" mother, also named Marie, who has now disappeared but was once totally under the thumb of a sleazy drug dealer who had set both mother and daughter on a wild car trip to pick up moonshine from a blind treacherous redneck, \\"Uncle Brady.\\" Given \\"chick lit\\" and the preponderance of strong female characters in this decade, Stewart's portrait of Mama Marie as a vulnerable woman is extraordinary. She is one of the most enigmatic, disturbing loose cannons I've encountered in current American fiction. As a lost \\"damsel in distress\\" minus the sappy connotations, she represents a negative capability her hard-as-nails orphan daughter must find and understand before committing herself to her own true love Abe.Thankfully, Stewart avoids an obvious sappy ending, with Abe and Marie tying the knot. Yet the novel's end is exhilarating, with its suggestion that a flood of feelings will eventually sweep all characters upstream.The only serious current American writer who can match Stewart in the Nail-biting Suspense Department is Donna Tarrt in The Little Friend, which gives us chapter after chapter of controlled plot-driven mayhem. All the while we know what's ultimately going to happen, but moment by moment Stewart and Tarrt pull wondrous wool over our eyes.Five cheers to Trent Stewart! Flood Summer is a first-rate first novel, the best thing that happened to Arkansas -- and to this reviewer -- since Noah rained Bill Clinton down on our heads!"},{"Title":"Flood Summer: A Novel","review":"Excellent character development and realistic dialogue. A terrific read.My kids (age 9 and 11) devoured the Mysterious Benedict Society as well."},{"Title":"Flood Summer: A Novel","review":"Flood Summer was terrific. Mr. Stewart is a writer of the first order. His character development is impeccable. This is not the type of novel with some definite plot that needs to be resolved in the end. It is a finely written story of characters who struggle to understand themselves as they stumble through life. The prose is subtle yet deeply meaningful. This is the best and most memorable novel I have read in 3 years."},{"Title":"Flood Summer: A Novel","review":"Set in small town Arkansas in the mid-90s, this book is replete with rain, mud, even a prodigious flood, snakes, nasty rednecks, trailers, and Southern bimbos. The author's intent is not to disparage rural Southern life. He creates two very sympathetic characters who are attempting to find themselves in this environment and the debris of their experiences.Twenty-something Abe, working as a roofer, is a thoughtful type who didn't adjust well to college and now lives alone in a trailer with his books and cats. However, it is a devastating summer flood in which he nearly drowns attempting to save another that disturbs his uncomplicated life. On the other hand, twenty-year-old Marie was literally abandoned at age ten by her drug running mother because she was late for a delivery. Marie returns to her hometown after essentially being on the run for all those years to assist her father in a bookstore, but maintains an impenetrable toughness that belies her striking beauty.A chance meeting with Marie's childhood friend Lainey results in her meeting Abe at a local swimming hole. The attraction is immediate, but Marie's wariness is a constant issue. The book is basically an observant examination of two tentative people feeling their way to some point that neither really can define. In addition, both Abe and Marie must cope with their families - fathers mostly. The author has a great talent for the dialog of those trying to understand their lives and connections to others. The Southern vernacular and way of life is a constant backdrop, captured most perfectly by the character Lainey. The ending is perhaps not all that could be expected, but there seems to be promise."},{"Title":"Flood Summer: A Novel","review":"Our family loved The Mysterious Benedict Society.

Once again the erudite scholar David Sylvester has written about his friend in a way that makes all other collections of images and gossips about Bacon pale in comparison. This book is a true &quot;retrospective&quot;, not only because if can look at the entire output of this enormously gifted painter, but it puts Bacon in a perspective of comparison and study of influences that span all of art history. Sylvester manages all this with his usual eloquence of writing style. This book is an academic treatise, but is is also a biography that looks carefully and thoughtfully at the mad mind and paintings of Francis Bacon. Highly recommended for Bacon devotees as well as those who still seek to understand the past century's art journey."},{"Title":"Looking Back at Francis Bacon","review":"A truly excellent addition to any art enthusiast's collection of artists' books and mongraphs. This piece is a must-have for any fan of the artist's work...it fills in quite a few holes regarding Bacon in relation to his work and his working process. Even if you are unfamiliar with the artist's work, you will find Sylvester's prose will easily entice you into taking a good long look at one man's dark, yet triumphant take on humanity and the world we live in.

But the use of a surreal and fanciful story is for the purpose of perspective and comment on what we as people tend toward in life. Through satire, we can see man's self-destructive tendencies and our desire for purpose to the extent that we are happier believing in lies than accepting what may be a truth of meaninglessness. Thus, the cat's cradle - a meaningless game with no cat and no cradle - just a bunch of X's in string. The characters and story line are entertaining, even if you wish to ignore the social, religious and political comment. Though to me, the message laced in the story is what makes this book outstanding. For those unfamiliar with Vonnegut, the Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titans are were I recommend you begin..."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a book about a writer (Jonah) who wants to write a story on the day the atomic bombings during World War II. He requests information from the family of the man who invented the bomb, but soon finds out that there is more to this man than meets the eye. He finds out that man developed a chemical that can wipe out the entire world as we know it. On top of that, Jonah discovers a very mysterious religion that unfolds as the story progresses.This book is an excellent read with many un-expected twists and turns. The more you read, the more the book develops and the more in depth it becomes. It is a mind bender that makes you take a second look at many of today's religions, and the beliefs that go along with them."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Are humans foolish enough to turn a gentle geniuses' idle curiosity to the end of the world? Cat's Cradle isn't anti-science, it's anti-people. This is a richly comic motley crew of characters and situations that forget plausibility in the service of the high art of low comedy. K.V. takes a stab at religion, industry, dictatorship, science, poverty, cold war espionage, the military, classism, love and devotion, and as always human foolishness and folly.The pace is quick, witty and full of more unexpected turns of plot than so few pages have a right to. All of it skewers with perfect timing and aim. Vonnegut's wild, satirical side at the edge of control. Classic."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Quite possibly my favorite book.

Now I find it at #13 on my all time list (I did Listmania!). It's not that I don't love this book. I do indeed. It's just that it seems so... 5 years ago. Since then my tastes have ripened (pretentious, eh) a bit, and have left little books like this one seeming, well, a bit sophomoric. Still, it is thanks to books like this one that I graduated to bigger and better things such as the work of Thomas Pynchon, Robert Anton Wilson, and Phillip K Dick. So like a girl who's outgrown the puppy love of her high-school sweetheart, and who now favors older men, I've moved on from Cat's Cradle, but I won't forget it.What a terrible review! Do I even know what I'm talking about? This is a great book. Anyone who disagrees is flat out wrong. And stupid too."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Using ridiculous concepts and items such as ice-nine, an island run by a peaceful demagogue, the invention of Bokonism but it's banning in the public sphere in order to reinforce it's name and aims into people's minds, and the numerous questionable career practices people engage in from Ruler's whore, to Ukrainiane's midget exploitation of trade secrets through a love affair, to heir of the ice-nine throne, Cat's cradle utilizes these somewhat phantasmagoric items and ties them in to a workable, though absurd environment with absurd and warped thinking about interpersonal relations and how status and symbols play into them.Sounds kinda like our world, eh??? In fact, it's very analogous to our world and just as a cat is easily amused and full of schizonphrenic ponderings over a cradles motive and purpose, we humans jump around at once significant and then insignificant images and movements through vast re-interpretations relative to the socio-historical context of the times. Once thinking that we've found our quenchable thirst for play and/or food by capuring that pattern of yarn strung together to form a cradle, it is morphed into a new dimension of complexity and mysteriousness.Instead of releasing that which is patently false and which can destroy us (i.e. ice-nine), we humans hold on to these farcical notions. Maybe the key is to create our own farcical analogies and conceptual vision of reality to makes sense of the underlying farcical framework upon which we are evolving. This is what Vonnegut has once again done expertly.&quot;Life is all but a game&quot;, and as with anything it's not about the result but the journey traveled in playing that game and dealing with the competition, our own farcical, subconscious conceptions!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"plain out and simple best book ever. Kurt did a great job. this book needs 6 stars"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The book Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is about 180 pages published by Dell, this is the first time I've read anything by Vonnegut. I thought it was such a disturbing book. Everything I've heard about him, though, seems to be true. He's a brilliant satirist. Well, this is a story, a satirical effusion of sarcasm, about that subject - The End of the World. The irony here is that the guy who was really the father of the atomic bomb didn't wipe out the earth on his first try using the fiery, nuclear holocaust. So he tries again with this substance called Ice-9, with spectacularly better results. I thought it was a very incomplete yet complex story portraying the end of the world, yet I still found it enjoyable. War, religion, capitalism, Americanism and the implied hatred that the entire world has for it, politics -- Human Nature are all targets of Vonnegut's caustic satire. It's an interesting story, but it's more interesting as a macabre, yet humorous, linguistic feast. As I read this book I couldn't help thinking of that Robert Frost poem, Fire and Ice. You know... Some say the world will end in fire, some say in Ice. I thought this was appropriate considering the man behind the atomic bomb was like an attempt to end the world in fire, and Ice-9 was like an attempt using Ice, yet all done by the same man. In the end I found that this book was an excellent read, at least once. While it has the potential to be a favorite re-read, I would not give it overwhelming praise such as guaranteeing it. I found some parts humorous and others quite depressing, but it was well written and had a fairly easily followed plot, if not incomplete. So I would recommend you definitely read this book for yourself, and you be the judge, don't just take my word for it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had heard so much about Vonnegut since my freshman year in High school. I know now that I will become a hard core fan of all his books. I'm an avid reader of all science fiction novels and this one is definitely one of my favorites. This book is by far a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. There are also alot of great charcter introduced in the book and alot of funny scenes. This was my first experience with Vonnegut and I enjoyed every moment of it. When I first saw the cover of the book I thought that it would be interesting and it was. It was not so hard and it was not very easy either. I love the way he satires religon and science. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love lies and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name only once in the entire book. We are told in the begining of the book that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures he finds religon, falls in love and becomes a president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn&quot;t be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Cat's Cradle is one of the most absurd,and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of these incredible people, places, things and ideas in Cat's cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages. I haven't read any of Kurt Vonnegut's other books but I know that I most certainly will. After checking this book out from the library I went and bought my own copy. I strongly recommed this book to anyone over the age of four-teen. There is no reason not to buy this masterpiece of modern literature. SO IF YOU READ IT WAS AND DIDM'T LIKE IT THAN READ IT AGAIN. IF YOU READ IT ONCE AND ENJOYED BUY IT AND READ IT AGAIN."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Jonah, the main character, plans on writing a book about the day that Hiroshima was hit by the a-bomb, but not about the bomb itself: he wants anecdotes, stories that happened to people on that particular day. To pursue this idea, he gets in touch with Newton Hoenikker (son of Felix Hoenikker, inventor of the a-bomb) and many other characters related to Hoenikker's life. We see that his interest shifts slowly from the day the a-bomb hit Hiroshima to the Hoenikker family. This wild information chase leads him to an island, San Lorenzo, where Frank Hoenikker (another son of Felix's) is one of the top dogs - his title exactly, I can't remember.Anyway, before dying, Felix had invented ice-nine, a chemical product able to &quot;teach&quot; water molecules to assemble themselves in a different manner, the way oranges can be piled up in a different manner in a crate.This tale, also revolving around a religion thoroughly explained - called Bokononism - gives us an apocalyptic view of ourselves, and takes to the extremes many things we take for granted. And still, for some reason, you just can't help laughing at the bitterness and harshness with which this story is written.This is without a doubt a must-read, and is one of the best-ended books of all time.

The character's are great, though Kilgore Trout isn't in it, and it is easy to follow.

This is the perfect book for fans of Breakfast of Champions and Welcome to the Monkey House."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's comic vision of the apocalypse is rich with originality and freshness: every short chapter has at least one inspired joke or set-piece. It's so tightly crafted that you feel like you're reading several different books in one; even though it's less than 200 pages, it manages to successfully satirize everything you can think of -- religion, politics, science, culture, media -- and still finds room for sympathetic characters and a coherent plot. The biblical parody, especially the Books of Bokonon and the whole Bokononist religion, is just ingenious. Even funnier and more relevant now than it must have been in the sixties."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I am a high school sophmore who read my first Vonnegut in eighth grade.

From the praise, and encouragement, I recived from my AP Language teacher I assumed it would be fantastic. The novel itself was very sporadic and difficult to follow. I understand that this is Vonnegut's style of writing, but it did not appeal to me. On any normal occasion I would have given the book a two. However, it did have an interesting plot. Having an apocalyptic theme and the technology that was introdced made it more compelling. In my opinion, this story gets a three to three in a half as a rating. If you enjoy books that require a bit more thought then normal, then I highly recommend the novel. If, however, you enjoy page turners that need little to no thought process to understand the plot, I would not recommend it.

I recommend this book to teenagers and younger ages."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle falls way short of expectations. Vonnegut has been said by others to be a satirical genius, but all his humor is lost on me. The story chronicles a man named Jonah, who attempts to make a novel regarding August 6, 1945, the day the first atomic bomb was dropped. He then decides to write to Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the creators of the atomic bomb, to ask him what happened in his house on the day that the atomic bomb dropped. Jonah then on his way to do another story passes through Illium, New York, the place where Dr. Felix Hoenikker conducted the majority of his research on the atomic bomb and ice-nine, a form of ice that has a melting point of one hundred fourteen point four degrees Fahrenheit. While in Illium, he interviews many who knew Dr. Felix Hoenikker, including his former boss, about what the man who created the atomic bomb was really like. Another story then takes Jonah to the Republic of San Lorenzo, where another one of the sons of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, Major General Franklin Hoenikker is prominent in government. When the president, Miguel \\"Papa\\" Monzano falls ill and dies the logical choice to succeed him is Major General Franklin Hoenikker. Major General Franklin Hoenikker then strikes a deal with Jonah for Jonah to become president in exchange for Jonah marrying Mona Aamons Monzano, the most beautiful woman in San Lorenzo. At San Lorenzo, Jonah also finds a new religion, Bokononism, which admits to containing only lies. Despite this all the poor inhabitants of this dreadful island are devout Bokononists. The vast majority of Vonnegut's characters are utterly implausible, ranging from Zinka, a Ukrainian midget, Newt falls in love with, to Philip Castle, the homosexual one time fianc&eacute; of Mona Aamons Monzano, to Bokonon, a man who created a religion consisting of only lies and turned himself into a saint and the President of San Lorenzo into a villain. While the entirety of Cat's Cradle is a parody against religion, technology, government and society in general it is not comical at all."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book wasn't bad, but it seemed a bit lacking. I don't know. Call me a Philistine, but it didn't really have much in the neighborhood of character development. Or conflict. Or most of the elements of a story, for that matter.Granted, it was an entertaining read, and I can see a smile on Vonnegut's face upon reading this. He would probably look at me and say, \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" Was that the point? Was I supposed to come out of it with a nihilistic outlook? The story was short, simple, and it lacked depth. I found it lacking.Read it if you like, or don't. I don't see anything particularly compelling about it, and I am enjoying my new book much more.Harkius"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The end of the world...Yawn! Suffice it to say that I moved through the pages of this book very slowly."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The 60's paranoia doesn't get more sharp, more funny and more smart than Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\". But, unfortunately, this portray is still somehow up to date than ever. Published early in that decade, this novel concerns on the fear of a chemical war and the end of the world. One of the characters is a scientist who fathered the Atomic Bomb and also developed something called \`ice-nice' that is able to freeze all the water in the world. When the novel was published the world was living the edge of Cold War - hence the interesting metaphor. This is also a cautionary (and very funny) tale about too much power and too much desire of ending the workd. Vonnegut's tone transits between the regular science- fiction and black humor that add more layers to the book. If for one side the characters are plain, on the other, what remains, the fear of a nuclear war or something like it, is very relevant and contemporary."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"An easy read that led to Vonnegut's Anthropology B.A. The story evokes questions regarding mankind's ignorance when faced with scientific achievement."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I am of the opinion (so far) that Cat's Cradle is one of Kurt Vonnegut's best books, if not the best book he has ever written. It was the first book I ever read by him and certainly was not the last.Cat's Cradle spans a tail narrated by a Scientist in search of what is at first only a biography of the man who created the atom bomb. This simple endeavor quickly escalates into a world ending climax. As the story grows closer and closer toward it's end, it becomes more clear of what exactly will happen...although this is never totally revealed.The book provides a lesson about humanity's inevitable fate of self-destruction and self-doubt. There also lies a message about religion's role in all of this."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut knows how to draw your attention, and it's often only after you've finished the book that you realize the level of seriousness that he was trying to portray.Having read Slaughterhouse-Five, Breakfast Of Champions, and A Man Without a Country, I was excited when heard about this one from my friend Eric.It's about a guy writing about the day the bombs were dropped on Heroshima and Nagasaki. He's also telling his story of how he converted to Bokononism.In real life, Vonnegut is a notable humanist, and the cyncism of man-made religion is evident in these pages. Bokonon is a religious leader who follows a few basic steps to creating a good religion. He lives life as an outlaw voluntarily, and he admits from the beginning of the Books Of Bokonon that his religion is all lies.The plots seems to shallow out a bit in the middle (only slightly) but by the end you are flying through pages to find the ultimate fate of the wonderful and crazy characters.Dark humor on par with Catch 22, it is difficult to decipher what is meant as farce and what is absurd, but overall a highly entertaining read, and a very good take on organized religion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't know whether to categorize the book as political, adventurous, anti-religious, satirical or philosophical (perhaps all). This being my first Vonnegut novel, I can say with personal conviction, that I am a staunch Bokononist. The journey of Cat's Cradle is one of absurdities, cliches, wisdom, luck and chance. What I find intriguing is how Vonnegut manages to balance the seriousness of the atomic bombing of Japan, and the foolish life of a scientist, who helped create it. I do like the characters and feel they all have their moment of catharsis. Somehow they all feel relevant to the story, yet John(the main character) never seems dull."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read. Vonnegut continues his outlandish writing style of satire and suspense with this short (but very well written) novel."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is a must read. It is a very short book, with almost as many chapters as pages. It reads like book crack and you won't be able to stop till your finished. If you haven't read other books by KV then this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you have never read a Vonnegut book before, this is the one you want to start out with. It's a great book for any occasion, but it's perfect if you want to get acquainted with the author and his dark humor. It's a very easy read, fast paced, and a cleverly written story. Some of his other books that I've really enjoyed were Slaughterhouse- Five, Sirens Of Titan, Mother Night, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, the short stories in Welcome To The Monkeyhouse, and Breakfast Of Champions (don't read Breakfast of Champions until you've read some of the books previously mentioned, or else you probably won't understand where a lot of the material comes from)."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"For those who haven't read Vonnegut, you must read this book! This short, simply written novel manages to reveal the latent absurdities in our most cherished institutions: politics, religion, and science.The novel centers around ice-nine, developed by the idiot savant Dr. Hoenikker (sp?). Hoenikker invents it as something of a game, but its first use will cause the oceans to freeze and the devastation of the world. We see clear parallels to the nuclear bomb and the rationalizations of its creators: according to them, they are advancing &quot;pure knowledge,&quot; and the consequences are not their concern, even if it results in worldwide devastation.The novel also targets religion in the form of Bokononism, a religion whose own creator admits that it is &quot;foma&quot; (lies). Even so, the Books of Bokonon cited throughout the book are absurdly sweet and insightful. The Bokononist practice of &quot;boko-maru,&quot; or merging of soles, also seems to be one of the rare ways to achieve genuine pleasure with one's fellow man. We see how religion, even where it may be technically false, may give great peace to its believers. When I first read this book in high school, I was tempted to become a devout Bokononist myself!Vonnegut always emphasizes the importance of family and genuine interhuman relationships, rather than the abstract absurdities of &quot;granfaloons&quot;: nations, parties, sports teams, etc. This short, spare novel tears apart such granfaloons, and through it, we may see a glimmer of what is genuinely important in our lives."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's CradleBy: Kurt VonnegutReviewed By: J. GagnierPeriod 1Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is a very good book. It is about a man who is trying to write a book about the day the atom bomb fell, and the people that constructed it. He soon found out that the chief designer of the atom bomb was a strange man named Felix Hoenikker. He mails Two of Dr. Hoenikker's children, Angela and Newt Hoenikker. Later on he finds out about a chemical called ice-nine, then the trouble starts.I really liked the way the writer worded the book. He wrote about how the world came to an end and the events preceding it. I enjoyed the way that he presented his personal opinion on how man makes things to complicated. He wrote about an imaginary religion called Bokonon that is nothing but \\"sweet lies\\" according to the founder of Bokonon himself.My favorite part of the book was when Angela was talking about ice-nine. I like the idea of ice that has a melting point of 114.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately if such a substance were made the end of the world would be it's effect on humans and nature alike."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't want to spend too much time writing a review of what is, in essence, a classic novel. This is my first reading of Cat's Cradle, and my first time reading anything of substantial length by Kurt Vonnegut. The simple reason I don't want to spend too much time reviewing this book is that it has already been reviewed countless times, especially by people far more familiar with it than I am.SPOILER ALERT! This is a short book, and it's almost impossible to avoid spoiling even the ending while trying to discuss significant aspects of the work. Also, this book has been around a while, meaning it's highly unlikely you won't have heard at least a capsule summary of the plot. That said, the following two paragraphs reveal details near the end of the book.There were only two things I found disappointing in the story: First, there was no speculation nor explanation given as to why there would suddenly be purple-mouthed tornadoes all over the place. Perhaps that was just the author's speculation about the knock-on effects of all the Earth's water suddenly converting to ice-nine.Second, there was mention of a strange nimbus (\\"lavender corona\\") surrounding the \\"weird plug\\" of rock sitting on the back of Mt. McCabe, and it wasn't clear if this was some strange phenomenon or not; the narrator spoke of his desire to visit this formation, to climb it, but he never reports doing so. It's an unexplored detail, and in such a slender volume, such things make me wish for more.The writing was excellent: literate, trenchant and witty. This is my first foray into Vonnegut, so I have no other points of reference to go by.The Rosetta Books edition of this Kindle e-book seems to fall somewhere between the ultra-cheap e-books (free or $0.99) and the premium e-books (with list prices close to those of the print editions) sold by Amazon -- both in terms of price and in terms of general quality. This edition was mostly decent, but had some typesetting issues with punctuation (wrong type of quote or apostrophe used -- open quote instead of close quote, for instance). Further, there were several cases where it was obvious that the text was obtained using OCR of a print edition, and this manifested frequently as the wrong letter in a word, or a letter like \\"m\\" being replaced by \\"rn.\\"I was never unable to determine what was truly meant in any passage, but the handful of flaws in this e-book could be easily corrected."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I expected Cat's Cradle to be a hilarious satire, but what I got was a book that is mildly funny, but extremely deep with a true message about technology and science and what could become of it. One could call Cat's Cradle a number of things. Satire, philosophical literature, science fiction, even subtle horror. I call it a masterpiece. I finished it in a short period of time, but I still think about it, and what might happen in the future.Slaughterhouse-Five, while great, is nothing compared to Cat's Cradle. Kurt Vonnegut was and is a brilliant man, and he will be missed, never to produce another masterpiece again.If you have not read anything by this amazing author, Cat's Cradle is the perfect place to start. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE TERRIBLY DEPRESSED, as it will make you more depressed. This is one of the most depressing books that I have ever read. Nonetheless, it deserves five stars."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's CradleKurt VonnegutISBN#: 038533348X304 pagesPublisher: Dial Press Trade PaperbackCat's Cradle offers a pessimistic outlook on human society, religion, and politics, but does it in such an ironic, lighthearted yet dark way that the reader won't be able to put it down. The protagonist John, who is only referenced by name once in the story, attempts to learn from the children of the fictional scientist Doctor Felix Hoenikker about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It is revealed that the late Dr. Hoenikker, who was one of the top minds behind the bomb, created another weapon before his death. This substance, known as Ice-9, is a form of ice that freezes at room temperature. If it comes in contact with water it will force its molecular pattern on it, and freeze it into the diamond-like Ice-9 as well. The only known samples of it were given to Dr. Hoenikker's three children, Newt, Angela and Frank. Through a seemingly random series of events they eventually encounter each other on the poverty stricken island of San Lorenzo; ruled by a merciless dictator where everyone belongs to an illegal religion known as Bokononism.These beliefs are central to the novel. A man named Bokonon sought to create an escape for the miserable people of San Lorenzo, and so he constructed a religion of \\"foma\\" or lies, which he himself calls lies at every turn. Ironically it seems to make perfect sense. These lessons, which are often in the form of short poetry or Confucius-like statements, are interspersed among the chapters of the novel by John, the narrator, who has realized he too is a Bokononist.Cat's Cradle's deceptively simple writing style masks the deeper messages it offers including lessons on love, pain and human nature. These seemingly innocuous sentences blend together to create both a compelling story, and a valid view of both events in the past and those likely in the future of humanity. In short, this novel is an enjoyable read brilliantly choreographed by one of the greatest American authors of our time."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Dr. Asa Breed, scientist from the research laboratory of the General Forge and Foundation Company, had this statement to say about Dr. Felix Hoenicker, one of the founding fathers of the atomic bomb as well as the creator of \\"Ice Nine:\\"\\"I told you all this in order to give you some insight into the extraordinary novelty of the ways which Felix was likely to approach an old problem.\\"The statement could easily become non-fiction if the word \\"Felix\\" was replaced with \\"Kurt Vonnegut.\\" Vonnegut is a master of spinning a crazy web of seemingly random events that poignantly, clearly spell out a very clear and crystallized point.Vonnegut is a crafty-sneaky writer. Two skills, which many writers have individually, but few have in tandem, set him apart from other writers. First, he has the ability to present his story as an unrelated series of random events. The \\"hero\\" seems to be victim of merciless random forces that confront him with strange events and experiences. However, the story remains tight and coherent and Vonnegut's points are amazingly clear.Second, in the true science fiction tradition, Vonnegut makes bizarre, incredible and completely fictitious creations seems completely plausible. Taken together, he seems to repetitively beat the reader over the head with rather salient life observations hidden behind bizarrely incredulous premises. With the exception of \\"Slaughter-House Five,\\" Cat's Cradle may be Vonnegut's best demonstration of these two most characteristic skills.He starts the story with the narrator giving a brief explanation as to why is called Jonah (which he is never referred to as for the remainder of the story):\\"...somebody or something has compelled me to be certain places at certain times, without fail. Conveyances and motives, both conventional and bizarre, have been provided. And according to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place this Jonah was there.\\"Similar to other Vonnegut Heroes (Billy Pilgrim, Rabo Karabekian are two), Jonah passively and seemingly haphazardly drifts among nonsensical events. For Jonah, the terminal destination is President of the island republic of San Lorenzo. During his journey, he meets a motley cast of characters seemingly unrelated. For sneaky Vonnegut, they are related, many of even them belong to his own karass.Secondly, Vonnegut is the master science fiction writer. Two science fictional concepts that Vonnegut creates in Cat's Cradle are the scientific invention of \\"Ice Nine\\" and the religion of \\"Bokononism.\\" Both Bokononism and Ice Nine are the centerpieces of the novel, so they had to suspend the reader's disbelief, or the story would die. With Ice Nine, Vonnegut needed to create a scientific discovery that was capable of destroying the earth. He did it, and explained in a simple and believable manner. Very clever. The religion of Bokononism includes its own philosophy, last rites and vocabulary (karass, granfalloons, pool-pah, foma, wampeter, etc). Similarly, he defines religion as \\"better and better lies\\" intended as an \\"instrument of hope.\\" On San Lorenzo, everyone is a Bokononist, and Jonah becomes one over the course of the story. Most of the Bokonon philosophy is presented as short statements, often only in short, Confucius-like statements and often provided to a calypso beat. My favorite Bokonon saying is: \\"Maturity is the bitter disappointment for which no remedy exists, unless laughter can be said to remedy something.\\"The story provides some insight into the extraordinary novelty of the ways which Vonnegut is likely to approach an old problem. Cat's Cradle asks the tough question of what is morality in an existential world. The ultimate answer, unfortunately, is self-destruction."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"What Kurt Vonnegut can do with the written word amazes me. Cat's Cradle is both a rambling diatribe of apt social observations and a finely crafted novel at the same time.Centering around a dead man, Felix Hoenikker, the scientist credited as being the father of the atomic bomb, the story reflects on the lack of social responsibility of a society so invested in killing and war that consequences aren't measured. This man, Hoenikker, didn't just create the most powerful WMD ever used, Vonnegut also suggests that he created a substance that could teach water molecules to bond in a new way - a way in which life on earth couldn't process. ICE-9 is this substance and the narrator stumbles through the story knowing of the substance but not knowing its true significance as he tries to unravel the events of the day of the bombing of Hiroshima,Another social statement of the book is in regard to religion. Inventing Bokononism, a belief system of total falsehoods with punishments for disobedience merely to make the religion seem more important, the protagonist brings order where there was never order needed before. It cuts to the heart of organized religion and satirically shows that manipulation of belief and twisting of the social construct are necessary to build a classed society. Brilliant.Throughout the story, a wide cast of disparate characters rush past, unconnected - - but for Vonnegut this is merely a ruse - - they are all tied together by the end in an intricate web of cause and effect, of influence and reason.I don't know if this was my favorite Vonnegut novel, because the one I'm reading always seems like the best one at that moment.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've just finished Cat's Cradle and I have walked away with a sense of low self-esteem. I, however, will not allow this feeling to pain me that much. Intuitively, I know this is a natural reaction many have had after reading Vonnegut for the first time. You see, after you have had your first experience with the man you gain an important insight. The insight is simply this: Vonnegut is more intelligent than you are and he revels in it; this, I am convinced, is what makes his writing outstanding. The reasons for this correlation are easy to find for they lie, laughing up at you, strewn across the pages of this book. On the surface, Cat's Cradle is a chronicle of the last days of humankind. Its nameless protagonist, a writer, relates the tale of how he set the events that eventually led to our demise in motion. His recounting makes our departure from this planet seem like an event in the best interests of everyone involved with the planet Earth. For support, Cat's Cradle happens to rail against every absurdity present in modern day, western civilization. All the things that make us suck as a collective are satirized brilliantly here folks: blindly ignorant nationalism, blindly conformist religion, and of course, politics. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut has authored a book that has its finger on the pulse of the western human condition and I relate to and like it immensely. For the first time, exemplified in this little novel, I can see all of the attributes that have made Vonnegut a champion to high school and college students for over forty years. I am no longer a college student but I am more of a cynic now than ever before. For those of us who can not turn a deaf ear to the discord around us, Vonnegut's writing will always be there, saying \\"It's okay. I understand\\"."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Wow.P.S. In &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut tells us everything we ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask, about foma, ice-nine, and Bokononism. In the telling, he leaves us mesmerized with his sadly warm, warmly sad vision of mankind, and of mankind's pathetic proclivity for trying so hard to believe in known lies, and in unknown truths.The story is told by Jonah, who is researching the life and times of a great physicist, Dr. Hoenikker. Hoenikker is one of the more prominent fathers of the atomic bomb, yet he has an image of being a childlike, saintly figure who lived his life enraptured by the cerebral, celestial music of the spheres. He may or may not have been a saint, (this is never fully resolved,) but he definitely was directly responsible, in this book, for at least two devices which are foolproof, sure-fire, results-guaranteed means of totally annihilating all life on this planet. Doesn't sound much like a saint, you say?!?!? Well, all I can say is, you need to read this book.As the story unfolds, we meet Hoenikker's scared, lonely, grown children, whose fates are locked together by the terrible secret of ice-nine. Jonah travels with them to the little-known, Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo for his research. Once there, he discovers the bizarrely sensible religion of Bokononism, and his life is changed forever.&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is crammed with a curiously concatenated cornucopia of consistently compelling creative conundrums. A word of warning: you may want to wear some kind of metal helmet while reading this book. Otherwise, you will risk scratching a hole in your skull from scratching your head all the time, trying to understand all the brilliant ideas in this book. There are just tons of insights into how we interpret reality, how we interpret fiction, and how we sometimes do the second of those activities, when we should be doing the first... One character is a professional book indexer. She goes through manuscripts of books for a living, and creates indexes for them. Sounds like kind of an odd profession, eh? Well then, how do YOU break down dreams, or reality, to make them easier to cope with? What's YOUR strategy for this basic human need? Or, for another example -- another character is one of Dr. Hoenikker's grown sons. He was called &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; as a child, because he happened to have a few fairly furtive mannerisms. As an adult, he basically lives a James Bond life, making or breaking kings, and consorting with beautiful women on a lush, island paradise. Did his dreamlike adult reality grow out of the real nightmare he lived out as a mocked child? Where did one start, and the other stop? This is the kind of question that Kurt Vonnegut raises in this book. Every sentence has meaning. Just amazing. An infinite number of thumbs up."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I am a disc jockey and this past week I read a news story on air about the US government dropping powder onto thunderheads which dried up the clouds and greatly lessened the strength of the storm; now our government is planning on testing the powder on hurricanes. This actual event drove me to search out my copy of Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and re-read this hilarious, thought-provoking, doomsday tale. It's filled with eclectic characters: a dwarf with an ugly sister, a mad scientist, spiritualist, bicycle manufacturer, South American dictator, losers and misfits. It's peppered with cliches that only Vonnegut can get away with. It introduces a fantastic religion that makes perfect sense. He even creates a new language. But at the core is the chilling fact that the U.S. Marines have induced the scientist to invent Ice Nine, even though he knows the inevitable outcome of this substance. It's a merry ride that Vonnegut takes us on. One of his best books, and that is high praise indeed. A very fast read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I first read Cat's Cradle on trip through Illinois heading for Chicago. I started laughing out loud almost immediately and the others in the car had to hear the 'funny part'. Soon I was reading the whole book out loud and all of us were laughing our heads off constantly. This remains for me the best example of Vonnegut's use of black humor to make a serious point. The characters and plot line are as original as anything he ever wrote and the humor is still as fresh as ever. This is wonderful, hard edged writing, a kind of modern day Jonathan Swift tale that mingles science, religion, philosophy, political upheaval and human nature at its most extreme. The book keeps us laughing and leaves us thinking."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle was an intriguing and thought-provoking book, but it was rather dark. Throughout this book, author Kurt Vonnegut shows his morbid view of the world, including a dystopia and a ninth ring of hell. The story is about how the narrator, an author who is writing a book about the atomic bomb, meets the children of one of the scientists who helped build the atomic bomb. Little does the author know that the scientist had created something much more dangerous than the atomic bomb. His fate becomes entwined with the children, a midget, an introspective genius model builder, and a clarinet prodigy, and he witnesses the end of the world as the powerful weapon, ice nine, freezes all the water in the world.Vonnegut comes up with brilliant ideas as well as sneaking in his own advice on living through the holy man Bokonon, whose self titled religion has poems, songs, and scriptures throughout the book. The author vividly shows his prediction of the future in this book, and through his eyes, there is no hope for mankind. As a warning, this book might disturb more sensitive readers and is most definitely not a children's book. Also, Vonnegut has the bad habit of going off on a tangent that is not always necessary. Vonnegut uses the narrator/author named John as a representative for himself, such as both of them went to Cornell College and were members of the Delta Upsilon fraternity.Kurt Vonnegut was a soldier and prisoner of war in World War 2, and was one of the survivors of the Dresden bombing, which was the theme for his other book, Slaughterhouse-Five. His mother also committed suicide on mother's day when he was 22, which might have helped give his writing the macabre twang it has."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you like the writing style of Kurt Vonnegut, then this is the book for you.

Most teenagers fear this assignment, and I was one of them, not wanting to HAVE to read just for the sake of writing down notes and listening to what the teacher had to say about the author's words. But once I began to read the text, I was engrossed in Vonnegut's phrases and the satires he used to describe every day life. Among other books that I have read during my school years, this was the only one I truly read for content. I enjoyed the ways Vonnegut criticized scientists, and the way he described the made-up religion of Bokononism. His intelligent understanding of the way things are run in the world made it perfect for his words to capture the obsurdity that is really shining through. I loved this book and plan to read others by Vonnegut, and I thank my teacher for finally assigning a book that caught my attention."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A great satire of the cold war, american life, and banana republics, as well as religion and other sacred cows.

Definitely one of my new favorite books..."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The relative lack of solid character development alone might scare off the type of reader who feels compelled to know the protagonist's favorite kind of vegetable spread as much as the underlying premise of the story itself, but in what is easily Vonnegut's most concise verbal bitchslap of organized religion and the perils of modern technology, don't expect a warm fuzzy feeling upon completion.Now, I wasn't even a twinkle in my old man's eye when this book was written, but the apocalyptic, (most likely) Cold War-inspired storyline upon first glance seems similar in tone to some other pieces from that general time period. In \\"Cat's Cradle\\", Vonnegut is quite successful in a short period of time (this is a quick read) to churn many of the constant fears in the modern world and turn them into an intelligent, cogent storyline that is in fact rather direct in its delivery. Many writers and many stories have touched on these topics but often delve (usually unintentionally) into sounding \\"preachy\\" and \\"overzealous\\". Vonnegut's wit and humor allows an otherwise mad genius to spin a tale as if Kurt himself is your friend, and not a fanatical know-it-all professor.Again; the concept of scientific progress causing the slow but apparent evaporation of the very humanistic element we pride ourselves on as a species is far from groundbreaking. However, to do so and wrap it around such biting political and social satire (to create and explain \\"bokonism\\" seemingly on such a whim is simply...awesome) is another thing entirely.The story itself is both humorous and rather appropriate for the times. Futhermore, as I hint in the above title, this is one of the darkest books I've ever read, but it should be."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is simply another notable chunk of evidence that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. was clearly the biggest genius who ever lived.The most dangerous substance in the world: ice-9. What a great idea for a book. And most folks who read this come away saying something like, \\"You know, I thought of that exact same thing a long time ago!\\" Unfortunately for themselves, they didn't develop the idea and send it to a publisher. Ha!Hard to pass this one by -- pure entertainment."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"There are some books I feel every teen should read. Especially in light of recent current events. Today's children & teens sometimes have no real concept of how lucky they are to live in a free society.This in such a book to remind them that things could be so different!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"What can a thoughtful man hope for mankind on Earth, given the experience of the past million years? Nothing.\\"Having just finished reading and lovingSlaughterhouse-Five, I wanted to move on to other Vonnegut works. I picked up Cat's Cradle a couple days later, and couldn't put it down. I was hooked from the beginning. I didn't find this book nearly as witty as Slaughterhouse Five, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's an engaging look at the ultimate futility of mankind to make the right choices at the right times. The story is also filled with themes and morals for the reader to discover (e.g. ice-nine was created to put an end to mud, and the Bokononist cosmogony says God created man from mud).I'm not sure which I liked better, this or Slaughterhouse Five; the only thing that I know for sure is that I will be getting another Vonnegut book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read Cat's Cradle back in the mid-'80s when I was in high school, and I liked it. On a whim, I dug it out to see what I'd think of it now that I have a few decades of pessimism under my belt. The verdict: it held up quite well, and I remembered why I went on a Vonnegut spree 20 years ago.This is not a book for everyone, especially those who prefer \\"feel good\\" fluff. This is a dark comedy, and such things are an acquired taste. Likewise, this is not a book that you read for the plot so much as for its character studies and (especially) its social commentary.Some of the impact of this book will quite likely be lost on younger readers who are not hip to the social circumstances of when it was written. Much in the same way as new viewers of Citizen Kane or readers of On The Road often go \\"what's the big deal?\\", Cat's Cradle is best enjoyed if you take into account what was available (and \\"acceptable\\") by comparrison in its contemporary setting. Certainly, America has its share of sardonic authors blasting the complascency bubble (Twain and Bierce, for instance) but Vonnegut shrewdly skewered the copascetic bubble of the early '60s in a way that was either shocking or refreshing, depending on your mind-set. Such things have increasingly become the norm, but Vonnegut was at the vanguard, and I think many authors delving into dark comedy and social parody take their cues from him.Vonnegut's prose is a pleasure to read, full of wit, wry descriptions, and a \\"voice\\" that just flows off the page. This is also a quick read that quite likely will lull you in and make you want to go just one more chapter before stopping for the night.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I enjoyed this subversive, satirical, nihilistic, and absurd novel. It is definitely a bit odd and won't be for everyone. Historically speaking, mankind has done some catastrophically stupid things. I'm not sure Vonnegut would agree, but I think there is still hope for humanity.My favorite quote from the book: \\"What makes you think a writer isn't a drug salesman?\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut was one of the literary voices of my generation, even though the seminal events in his life occurred as part of my father's generation.I love this book! I've read it many times and often think about Bokononism when the world seems too bizarre. There are so many positive reviews on this book that I have little to add other than a bit of advice: Read the book out in the open on a warm night. If you have access to calypso music, turn it down very low and have a jar of dark rum nearby."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is by far Vonnegut's best work. For years I preferred Slaughterhouse Five, but after rereading Cradle this month, I'm now of the opinion that if you're going to read any Vonnegut, this is the one."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I absolutely love, love this book! Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite writers - when it comes to irony, no one does it like him! Vonnegut's roots as sci-fy writer provide an imaginative setting for the story, and his sharp wit is simply irresistible. One of the favorite of Kurt Vonnegut's books."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of those novels that I constantly recommend to friends, always giving away copies when I have them. I'm a huge fan of Vonnegut, and this is my favorite of his novels.

I was a little disappointd holding this one in my hand compared to my old copy from back in the day."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"One of Vonnegut's better works. I was glad that he managed to put together a coherent story. The creation of Bokonism and the concept of ice nine is good stuff. The characters are just as cartoonish as ever. Nicely done, overall, and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Back when I was in high school and college (shortly after the dinosaurs died off) Kurt Vonnegut was probably the most read author among my peers, followed closely by J.R.R. Tolkein and Hermann Hesse. Of these three, Hesse's novels addressed the spiritual restlessness of the 1960s, Tolkein was like a few hits off a bong that allowed the reader to experience an entirely different world, and Vonnegut, well he was the one who best expressed the frustration and lack of faith in our leaders and government.Vonnegut, followed closely by Mark Twain, was the greatest satirist this country ever produced. He took on all the topics of the day with a wit that was as sharp as a rapier's edge. He had the ability to make you laugh and squirm at the same time. His passing a few years ago left a void in American literature. (\\"So it goes,\\" to quote another of his books.)Cat's Cradle is one of a handful of Vonnegut's books that rank among the best of 20th century literature. Re-reading it after a couple of decades is to immerse oneself again into a familar stream. I'm glad I had the chance to read Cat's Cradle years ago. To read it for the first time now, in the post-9/11, post Cold War era, must seem a bit daunting. Without the background of living through a time when nuclear missiles were poised to reign down annihilation on mankind, some of Vonnegut's bitter humor is lost. Put it remains a powerful voice.In a mere 300 pages and 100+ very short chapters, Vonnegut manages to construct a novel that pulls together the threads of a uniquely dysfunctional family, an outlawed religion, a banana republic dictatorship on a small Carribean island, a secretly created substance that can destroy the world, and ... well, so much more that you wonder how he will ever pull it off without unraveling all the various threads. Somehow he does it and, in the process, turns those threads into a tapestry of human folly. That's the true genius of Vonnegut. That his unique voice and vision will still be around a century from now seems inevitable!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Who am I to even try and review a book by Kurt Vonnegut?I come to Cat's Cradle in 2011, about 40 years after everyone else my age has long since read the book, and I can see now why, more than likely because of Bokonism, it was so popular. I'm not sure why I never read the book before (not even the connection to the Grateful Dead was enough to get me to pick it up), but my guess is that it maybe had something to do with the connection Kurt Vonnegut had to Science Fiction and that wasn't a genre I was into at the time. Anyway, I don't feel bad for having waited so long because I think I appreciated the story now more than I would have then.My review in a nutshell, and these are not shameless lies, is that Cat's Cradle is frightening story full of wit, wisdom and insight and is a work of genius.\\"No damn cat, and no damn cradle.\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The best novel by one of the best authors of our generaltion.Well, perhaps he and Bokonon, I guess ."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"He created the religion of Bokonon,and I am now a follower.Something was using him as a vessel because Kurt was kind of a jerk as a human being,but boy could he write interesting books."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My first Vonnegut.

I really enjoyed the book back then but now, free from the pressure of study, I've found it even more delightful. Read it if you like Black Humour with a dose of Science Fiction. Cat's Cradle has a special blend of tragedy and utter silliness that will keep you engaged to the bitter and ridiculous end - it leads the reader to think of the absurdities of human civilization and how the highest of ideals are most often brought undone by basic human weaknesses of character in both leaders and followers. The narrator is not preachy or judgemental because he fails to notice himself stumbling into the whole mess until it's too late - and then hindsight proves completely worthless. Cat's Cradle is a short novel and the chapters are brief, so it's a good book to read when you don't have much time. Despite its brevity the story is jam packed with interesting characters, important themes and absurd events - plus an actual hook."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Easy to read short story reviewing religion and society. A lot of things to consider through easily digestible format. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you've never read Vonnegut before, just search for his name and buy them all. I think Cat's Cradle is awesome- it will take you to places that you didn't even know you wanted to go and make you glad you went along for the ride. Several extremely funny parts (expected), great necessarily ridiculous plot, and sooo many memorable lines. Who else can insult religion, monarchy, midgets and a variety of races without being insulting?"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read Slaughter House-5 in college and thought it was fun and goofy with a little humanistic existentialism thrown in to give it some depth. My reaction to Cat's Cradle now is similar, but I had not realized how pessimistically cynical Vonnegut was about our species. Yet, despite his doubt about our worth, Vonnegut did not give up on us.I have admired Vonnegut's personality as much as his writing. He struggled with depression, but managed to have a brilliant career. He survived the horror of the Dresden firebombing and turned his horror into inspiration for art. His Masters thesis was rejected by the University of Chicago, but he forgave the University and became a supporter (after the degree was granted for his literary accomplishments). He had a love/hate relationship with his hometown, and loved to lampoon and praise Hoosiers and Indianapolis in his books.In my one chance meeting with him, he tousled the hair of my two little boys and took it with grace and pleasure that we didn't know who he was.He once said in an interview that he'd rather laugh than cry, \\"because crying was so much more messy.\\"False Prophet, a Legal Thriller"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I come to Vonnegut late, as I plow through a long list of recommended books. I was pleasantly surprised by the economy of Vonnegut's prose, which, along with its sharp wit, deft plotting and wicked characterization, lends a sharp sting to the satire even half a century on. Other reviewers have cannily summarized the plot; I will add only that the new reader will find in concentrate here many ideas greatly diluted in Vonnegut's followers, not the least of which is the evident wisdom of Cat's Cradle's faux religion. The protagonist's cleverly shifting point of view veils but never completely obscures his writerly role, as it shifts from researcher, to reporter to fatalistic memoirist. Were it not for dated epithets regarding race and disability, CC might have been written yesterday."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I think it's been 30 years since I first read this book and for some reason was craving Vonnegut. It's time to start loading up, how I missed his clever and witty writing. Keenly insightful by using outlandish and bizarre scenarios. I can't wait to get another!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is a well-known excellent writer. He wrote several great books that incorporate human life and emotions. One of his best works was A Cat's Cradle. This book talked about the contradiction between illusion and reality and how people valued it in their societies. It also showed the topic of science vs. religion in modern society. Vonnegut's creative style of writing made this book an interesting read. All of these reasons make A Cat's Cradle an excellent book to read and a beginning for the understanding of the world portrayed in Vonnegut's many writings. The plot of A Cat's Cradle involves humanity and the contradictions that exist in modern society. Vonnegut focuses on the theme of illusion and reality in this book which were also explored in his previous novels, Mother Night. He came to the conclusion that illusion becomes reality in people's lives. A gloomy world is depicted in this novel to show the reality of life. This book is basically about one man who wants to write a book about World War two. It leads to his investigation between the topics of science and religion. The science part of this novel discusses an atomic bomb and a fanciful \\"ice nine\\" poison. The religion part of this novel discusses the widely followed religion of Bokonism that said that God is \\"utterly indifferent.\\" The topics this novel discussed were written very humorously. Every chapter had a joke at the end. It was an easy and very interesting read. The characters were exciting and easy to follow. A Cat's Cradle questioned topics of humanity and life in a very interesting and joyful way. Kurt Vonnegut's book A Cat's Cradle was an excellent read. Its theme was creative and questioned certain topics that really never discussed. Like all of Kurt Vonnegut's books the chapters are short and discuss short segments of the main character's life. After the reading the book, it makes the reader question their own life and humanity in general. The way the book is written keeps the reader consistently involved in the book. I truly enjoyed this book especially since I have read other books by Kurt Vonnegut. I hope you decide to read it and then read other selections by Kurt Vonnegut, an acclaimed and highly recommended author."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This wacky tale of a journalist who witnesses the end of the world is a wonderful satire filled with memorable imagery and witticisms. Since this is the first Vonnegut book I've read, I don't know if it's his best, but I certainly think it's a fascinating read. The use of a cat's cradle string-game as a metaphor for various ideas and things is quite astute and sparklingly new, even though the book is from 1963. This book is definitely for anyone interested in zany literature that challenges the status quo, of any sort."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. The end-of-humanity theme is presented in such a humorous manner, that you can't help but love it. The characters are great, and Bokononism, the fictional religion of most of the characters, is a constant entertainment. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if you enjoy other Kurt Vonnegut books (my personal &quot;other favorites&quot; are &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; and &quot;Galapagos&quot;."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I'm not going to write a lengthy review, but I must say that this book, among other Vonnegut writings, has changed my way of thought. He's the cynic with a heart indeed and with a type of humor that will &quot;blow&quot; your mind. I highly recommend this book if you want to have a new perspective on life."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"CAT'S CRADLE is categorically brilliant, a magnificent piece of fiction, and Vonnegut is enormously talented. CRADLE is doubtless one of the most imaginative, thought-provoking, and entertaining books I've ever had the immense pleasure of reading. I whole-heartedly recommend it to readers of all ages and backgrounds."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Well, maybe not quite, but it's certainly the first one I've gotten so involved in. I related to the characters' dilemmas so well it was rather frightening. The absurdity/satire, while not for everyone, is also right up my alley. I also spent a few days carrying the book around with me everywhere and whenever I'd see one of my friends, I'd show them some part about Boknononism and tell them &quot;This is just what I was trying to say when you were telling me I was nuts!&quot;Engaging reading."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I just finished Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. This is my first Vonnegut book and I'm most definitely a fan now. He has the incredible ability to interweave serious issues into a humorous satire. There were times I laughed out loud, and then I wondered why I did. He forces one to search deeper and to question our beliefs and the consequences of science, religion, capitalism~everything. The books of Bokonon were some of my absolute favorites, even though it was a ridiculous religion; it certainly contained many roots of truth. It is a very very fast read, I didn't want to put it down. However, you wanted to savor every word and think about every chapter. DO READ IT!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I enjoyed reading this short novel. Vonnegut satirizes everyone and everything. Read it for the satire on religion (Bokononism); read it for the satire on politics (San Lorenzo); and read it for the satire on education and the arts (&quot;keep looking at all the Xs but can't find the cat and can't find the cradle&quot;).I had the same enjoyment reading this as I had while viewing Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, and reading Heller's Catch-22, and reading Tom Robbins' novels."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Love this book and you say its a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. Hate it, and its just another cheeky Sci-Fi farce. There is a lot of faux scientific gobbledygook to cut through, but there is also fine characters and funny scenes. Across the spectrum of his work, Vonnegut's glory comes in the stories he weaves from fantastic situations. He uses science fiction without being a Sci-Fi writer the same way Flaubert used romance but was not a writer of romantic novels. Vonnegut may not be the scholar's darling now, but he will be after his death. He is a true American stylist in the tradition of Twain and Nabakov. Cat's Cradle is among his best books. It is in the very American tradition of combining wit and innovative style with a solid storytelling."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"At the nagging of a friend I finally broke down and read a novel by an author unknown to me at the time, Kurt Vonnegut. Although a relatively popular novelist you must understand I am merely a fifteen year old. When I picked up Cat's Cradle and started reading it I instantly began an obsession with the book. I flew through it in the matter of a day. Vonnegut's portrayl of a lonely soul that gets lost on a trail that leads him to foreign lands, but more importantly, leads him to discover a part of himself that relays back to man's most primitive instincts. The way Vonnegut portrays the main character is a direct and personal satire of the attention span of the average person. The main character starts off on a seemingly simple task, and get's caught up in something greater than all of mankind. Personally, my favorite part of the book came with the main character's obsession with the island princess. Vonnegut spent the whole book building up an empire of personality, and personal traits, only to bring it down with the stroke of his fingers. All I can say is, I can't wait to read another."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut wrote the novel &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; with his unique, brilliant writing style, sarcastically relaying his pessimistic messages. This book, like others by Vonnegut, uses satirical, seemingly spontaneous, black humor and extreme sarcasm to relay his cynical messages about religion, science, and life in general. In this story, a writter is researching the life of a strange scientist Frank Hoenikker, the inventor of the atom bomb. His research takes him to the obscure island of San Lorenzo, where the people are secretly devoted to the faith Vonnegut created called Bokonism. The ideals of Bokonism question the validity of all religions, while the writter's research conveys messages of science's malevolent effects on society. This book is very entertaining, funny, and thought provoking, and everyone should own it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This novel surpassed my expectations by far. I was expecting your normal hero novel, good vs. bad. This was not the case once so ever. It was a masterpiece narrating the journey the family of Alfred Hoeniker, pioneer of the Atom bomb. Obviously, this wasn't based on any true story, but was so amazing and really makes you consider everything you have ever believed in. I recommend this novel with passion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I very much enjoyed this Vonnegut book, although probably not quite as much as the other two that I've read, Breakfast of Champions and Slaughterhouse Five. Nevertheless, this book was witty throughout, and at the same time inspired my thoughts on the fragilty of life, the meaning of fate, and our &quot;abuse&quot; of science and the power it gives us (and what it can take away from us!)A great Vonnegut book, in my opinion, and a must read for any fan."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Full of irony and humor, Kurt Vonnegut's Cats Cradle recognizes human potential, and mankind's ability to achieve mass destruction. At a period of scientific advancements, and a terrifying World War, Vonnegut uses the confusing character of Felix Hoenikker. Behind his innocent nature, Hoenikker is the creator of the atomic bomb and ice nine, which kills nearly everything in the world. In a twisted way, Vonnegut confuses the reader, because Felix is not what people conceive as an evil person. His playful humor, is merely a play on words of his conception of the world filled with human stupidity. Unlike many authors, Vonnegut relays the truth of our perfect technological world as it is not always perceived. The book's excellence is expressed by Vonneguts relentless emphasis on human stupidity, still running ramped in the 20th Century. Through his carefully planned irony, Vonnegut relays that man's technological advancements combined with indifferent, careless, stupid people are enough to destroy the world. However, as intelligent and excellent Vonnegut's perception of our world is, it does come across as a terrifying reality to some. Some readers may not be able to accept these dangers that surround us, and the capability for Cats Cradle to actually occur. Never the less, Vonneguts greatness and intelligence cannot be overlooked, no matter how terrifying his book appears. Clearly, I believe that every adult, who ever thinks about our future, should read this novel. The book answers many questions of what mankind is capable of accomplishing. If I were to rate this book, it would be an immediate 10."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I thought Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut was a creative, entertaining, humorous and unique novel that dealt with science, religion and politics. The narrator is a writer aspiring to compose a book about what people were doing the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. He begins his investigation through communicating with one of Frank Hoenikker's (the father of the atomic bomb) three children. His investigation brings John, the narrator from Illium, Illinois to San Lorenzo to finally the destruction of the world. John meets Frank Hoenikker's three children on his way to San Lorenzo. Here, he found his religion and becomes president. John encounters the end of the world due to a substance known as &quot;ice nine&quot; invented by Frank Hoenikker.Cat's Cradle was an intriguing novel. The ideas of Bokonists were fun and also the way Kurt Vonnegut connected all of his characters. His short and witty chapters made the reading go by quickly. His style of writing and creativeness kept me hooked.I recommend Cat's Cradle for ages 14 and up."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is a fantastically witty narration of an author's bizarre encounters as he goes about collecting material for his book, The Day the World Ended. Through the voice of the narrator, Vonnegut lampoons organized religion and creates an imaginative science fiction story in which a new atom called &quot;ICE NINE&quot; that has the potential to destroy the world. Vonnegut's ideas are expertly assembled to create a masterpiece of science fiction and humor that holds together and is extremely entertaining."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is an apocalyptic interpretation of the world's future. Written from the perspective of a free-lance writer, John, Cat's Cradle cleverly links a scientist's disfunctional family to a Caribbean island living under the illusions of a religion grounded on lies. Pursuing substance for his novel, The Day the World Ended, John contacts the family of Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. Consequently, John travels with Hoenikker's children to a Caribbean island, falls in love, assumes the presidency, and witnesses the destruction of the world. The text flowed very well; terse chapters maintained the reader's interest. Witty conclusions exemplified how humans are connected through intricate links. Vonnegut's varied settings, ranging from suburban New York to an impoverished Caribbean island, certainly maintain the reader's interest. Vonnegut also refrains from narrating the novel with an omniscient voice. On the contrary, John is ignorant about human relationships; this naivety evokes humor. Two themes the novel served to exemplify, illusion vs. reality and the destruction resulting from unrestricted science were prominent. To comprehend these themes, readers should be in the adolescent or adult age groups. The reader must also bear patience to see how obscure events string together at the novel's conclusion. With patience, readers will relish this ingenius satire."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The novel Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is a prime example of the science fiction genre. The novel contains a perfect blend of scientific logic and literary fiction, making it both believable and entertaining at once. The story is the fictitious memoirs of a writer named John, who is doing research for a book he plans to write about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. His curiosity spurs a chain of events, and he soon is caught in the middle of the intricate web of secrets and lies of the Hoenikkers, the children of Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. John soon discovers that the children possess a synthetic compound called Ice Nine, an isotope of H20 whose unique structure gives it properties unique from any other material on Earth. The discovery of Ice Nine proves to be the turning point of the novel, and Ice Nine ultimately plays a key role in the conclusion of the story. I found Cat's Cradle to be an insightful and brilliantly composed novel. Cat's Cradle has the captivating plot that is characteristic to science fiction novels, but it separates itself from other novels in its genre with its sense of reality. Despite some of its far-fetched aspects, while reading Cat's Cradle, I couldn't help but think that it was a true story. Vonnegut's detailed characterization, believable setting, and blend of fictitious occurrences and historic events make the novel seem as realistic as an autobiography. Vonnegut also did a great job using irony and black humor to express the hidden themes of the novel. Cat's Cradle offers a cynical and insightful view into the worlds of religion, technology, science, and government. Although I consider this novel to be one of most well written works of science fiction ever composed, it does contain a few minor downsides. This book is written in an odd format, and it is set up as a collection of interconnecting anecdotes. Although this format gives Cat's Cradle a unique and interesting feel, it can make the plot confusing to understand at times. The only other downside is that the symbolism and hidden meaning of many of the events and people in the novel can be difficult to decipher at times. For these reasons, I would recommend this book to people ages 16 and above who read at a sophisticated level. I would certainly recommend this novel to anyone who has an interest in science, as well as anyone who is interested by politically and socially ironic literature."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonneugts Cat's Cradle is carried along by a group of captivating characters, which include a scientist, Dr. Hoenikker, and his 3 awkward children. A religious man, sugar giants, and a beautiful woman are all found on San Lorenzo. These characters carry the reader from Ilium in the Midwestern United States, to the small island of San Lorenzo in the Caribbean, to the ultimate destruction of the world using a new, mysterious substance. The symbolism portrayed makes this a wonderful book that will absorb a reader completely. This book is recommended to anyone 15 and older."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is an accomplished text that masters the essence of a new religion, and hazards of science through a sarcastic and humorous tone. The novel comprises a curious man gathering information for his novel on The Day the World Ended. While interviewing the family of a doctor that contributed to the discovery of the atom bond, the narrator stumbles into a society where religion is based on lies and human stupidity is universal. By surrounding the character in a new civilization and faith, Vonnegut engulfs the reader into his masterpiece. As the lead role, John's arrival at the island of San Lorenzo and his discovery of Bokonism paves the way for his commitment to the awkward religion. John develops a relationship with a childish midget, his stringy six-foot sister, and their public shy brother that unfurls him into a mysterious world. This unique novel tours the reader through a separate dimension. With his unpredictability and ability to create suspense, Vonnegut creates a sense of curiousity persuading one to continue reading.

His creation of the character of Bokonon and the religion of Bokononism, and also the moral of the story makes this book immortal."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"cat's cradle... a completely warped reality packed into a rather small novel. out of all of vonnegut's novels, this one truly blows the mind. it's one of the few books that fully utilizes vonnegut's witty and excellent satire to poignantly reveal things about humanity and religion and government that one only suspects. this is a true literary masterpiece... it resides in my list of favorite books of all time. the ending is vaguely disturbing and absurdist... it's just really frickin' great. everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I spend a lot of time reading, being in college.

The way Vonnegut touches on every aspect of history and renders it bluntly and humorously is just one amazing aspect of his work. This novel, for me, felt like more of a &quot;story&quot; in constrast to his other novels. It's nonetheless witty, thought provoking and intelligent. It clearly shows Vonnegut's genius to criticize humanity and yet not make the reader feel like he's only contributing to the problem. A most read for anyone who needs to think about everything."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"THe was one of the Craziest Books I ever read.

Scientific inquiry will find it, but the implied conclusion is that it's not worth searching for in the first place."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I recently re-read Cat's Cradle and loved it,again.

Vonnegut is not only a genius of wit and satire but a master judge of the pitiful human pathos. He may be a tad Cynical but then A little cynicism is a good thing.

Makes you think twice about cults"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Reading the other reveiws here is beginning to give me the feeling that many of these people aren't reading the same book that I have read numerous times. &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is quinteissential Vonnegut. He blends humor (Admittedly not as much so as his other novels)with his trademark apocalyptic visions of doom. This book is as hard edged as any of the satire he spilled out in his other novels. This book ranks in his top three and is far better than Bluebeard or Hocus Pocus (Don't get me wrong, those two are great as well.) But if you can say that this is not one of his better works than you simply weren't smart enough to grasp it. It's nothing short of pure genious"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Far be it from me to imply that &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is not a good time. But for some reason it has come to sit in Vonnegut's pantheon next to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House.&quot; And again, it's not that it doesn't work; the odd little tale of island romance in the midst of revolution and the ultimate freezing element, ice-9 has plenty of terrific moments. But ultimately, the book feels cold and clammy; where elsewhere Vonnegut contrasts the sad and the funny here he chooses to club you with pathos and neglect to explain much of anything. Overall, a good read, but check out &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; or most of his other early novels before shipwrecking here"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The end of the world as seen through Vonnegut's eyes and yours as you will read and re-read this book for years to come.The Grateful Dead took icenine as the name of their music publishing company.I have read all of Vonnegut's works and still come back to Cat's Cradle every few years, enjoying it more each time"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of those great books that I recall reading when I was younger that made reading fun.

It left a huge impression on everyone who read it when it was first published. I just read &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; for the first time, though, and I must say I was disappointed. I am a huge fan of Vonnegut; I read Slaughterhouse-Five and Hocus Pocus before &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; and several others since (I hope to have read all of them by the next millennium), but I think that &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; was the least impressive of all, especially after just having finished &quot;Hocus Pocus,&quot; his best I have read so far. &quot;Cradle&quot; lacks the emotion and wit of 'Slaughterhous,&quot; or &quot;Bluebeard,&quot; and the tremendous humor of &quot;Hocus Pocus.&quot; He seems to take the story just a tad too seriously, which is strange because this is his most bizzare and unrealistic story. Of course, simply having been written by Vonnegut, it's inherently better than about %99 of all books ever written, but if you're going to read just one or two Vonnegut books, this should not be it"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is the third book that I have read by Vonnegut. I also read Sirens of Titan and Wampeters, Foma, and Grandfalloons, his Autobio. Look, he's witty, but not deep. He is a cynic. If anything, his writing displays the fragility of human existence, and the fact that not a lot of people know what the point of everything is, including him. You will most likely reach a point, about half way into the book, where vonnegut is absentmindedly continuing the exposition while your saying to yourself, &quot;get to the point already.&quot; The other thing is that he is never uplifting. Nothing revolutionary here."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle has little to offer but Kurt Vonnegut's very pessimistic assessment of religion, politics, and love. The characters are just \\"types,\\" and so incompletely sketched that we can't care what happens to any of them. The plot brings together an assortment of these characters - for no apparent reason at all - to an island for a doomsday scenario. After the scenario plays out, we receive from Vonnegut the valuable intelligence that all of mankind's effort is meaningless and absurd, and that the best we can hope for is a good laugh at the joke that God has played on us. Most readers will have no reason to trouble with this inconsequential work."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"We ordered this product more than 30 days ago and it still has not arrived.

The novel was written just after Khrushchev and Kennedy resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis. Cat's Cradle is loosely based on a father of the Manhattan Project, the scientific thrust of America to design and build the nuclear bomb that was eventually denoted on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The narrator set out to write a book called \\"The Day the World Died\\" by interviewing the surviving members of the scientist's family, but a push into Bokononism changed his frame of reference.Many consider Robert Oppenheimer the father of the nuclear bomb, but here, the man is Felix Hoenikker, a scientist at the General Forge and Foundry Company in Ilion, NY. There are elements of Oppenheimer in the fictional scientist of Vonnegut's novel, but Vonnegut based Hoenikker on a scientist he knew from his job at General Electric. Hoenikker is survived by his three children: Newt, a dwarf, Angela, a thin, horse-faced woman, and Frank, a drifter. The narrator also learns that an even more dangerous invention of Felix Hoeniker may exist, a substance called Ice-Nine.The 'vin-dit,' a sudden shove in the direction of Bokononism, occurred in the shop of a maker of tombstones in Ilion. The town of Ilion in Cat's Cradle is based on Schenectady, NY - one of the tri-cities in Eastern New York State, along with Troy and Albany. The proprietor of the shop was Avram Breed, quite a coincidence because the narrator just finished visiting the foundry operated by Asa Breed. Both Breeds were brothers. Even more coincidental was the story of a gaudy tombstone ordered by an immigrant generations ago. The name of that immigrant is a sensational detail in the story.Foma is the cornerstone of Bokononism, something that the author believes is true of religion, politics, and maybe even science. Bokononism is also forbidden in the country of San Lorenzo, yet it is also the national religion of the country. San Lorenzo is a fictional country in the Caribbean Sea which serves as the location for the second half of the novel. The national leaders of San Lorenzo secretly practice Bokononism, as do most of the people.There was probably a time, before I was born, when people used these made-up words from Cat's Cradle in everyday conversation. Using them today will get you a lot of blank looks, but the philosophy behind the novel is timeless. Cat's Cradle is vintage Vonnegut, capturing the concern of the student protest movement about the direction of post-war society, with a slight twist of dark humor that makes the novel a Vonnegut classic. Along with Slaughterhouse-Five, Cat's Cradle is easily one of the decade's most influential books, and one of the century's most thought-provoking novels."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A great book with an original voice and unlike most books, it actually has something to say. A classic by all measures."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Great book and for a great price. I recommend the Cat's Cradle on Kindle version.

It damns the scientific community for creating these weapons without thinking of the impact that they have on the world. The weapons of chioce in this story is an element called Ice-9, which intantly freezes everything it comes in contact with. When it is used it freezes the entire world slowly. This novel makes one question the use, creation as well has the wisdom of thse weaons. But does so with a sarcastic smirk."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a strangely written book. It is a tale of discovery, a quest for knowledge, and also the end of the world. I feel that Cat's Cradle is a great book, although I am not familiar with the rest of Vonnegut's work, I have the need to read more of his work after reading Cat's Cradle. The characters in the book have a varying depth to each other, and at times it seems like some characters are constructed in a somewhat shallow manor (Angela), some are deeply based and have a lot of back-story behind them (Frank). I really enjoyed the plot as well, this book truly takes the reader on a ride, where they have no idea where the ride will end. It was a great feeling, after reading this book, to look back to the beginning and remember that the main character (Jonah/John) had originally set out to write a book.The book begins with our main character (Jonah/John) setting out to write a book about the day in which the nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Jonah's task is to gather as much information as he can about the so-called father of the atom bomb (Dr. Felix Hoenikker). Hoenikker, however, has passed on, so it is up to Jonah to obtain information on the doctor, through his three children (Newton, Franklin, and Angela). After correspondence with Newt, Jonah travels to the research lab where Dr.Hoenikker previously worked, and we are introduced to Dr. Asa Breed. Breed talks with Jonah about Hoenikker's work habits and his behaviors. And then, the topic of Ice-Nine comes up. Without giving away too much, Ice-Nine is capable of causing the end of the world. In a quest to find yet even more information about Dr.Hoenikker, Jonah attempts to track down Frank Hoenikker, who is believed dead. The search for Frank leads Jonah to a small remote island. The rest I will not spoil.Perhaps the most prevalent theme in the book is Bokononism, a fictional religion. Bokononism really is the backbone of this book, especially the elements leading up to the climax of the book. I will give away this much about the book, Bokonon teaches that all religion is lies, and that there is no way to truly know what God wants or what his will is. The purpose of the whole Bokonon angle is irony. I will give away no more.Cat's Cradle could very well be considered a masterpiece. Plain and simple."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is Vonnegut's commentary on the 20th century - from overreliance on science and its callousness to religion and how political mismanagement makes spiritual revivals necessary. Best of all, Vonnegut is clever and thought-provoking chapter after chapter. His ideas, while they may not seem seminal today, are ever-important.The story is based on a writer's research for a book cocnerning the dropping of the atom bomb. Vonnegut's roots in scientific curioisity are everywhere in his writings, and crucial here. He creates his comical cast of characters around the story of the atom bomb's fictional father - his midgit son, a 3rd world dictator, American imperialist, a former Nazi physician trying to expiate his sins, and a number of scientists, each defective in his own way and each unwilling to embrace moral responsibility to society.Vonnegut's narrative flows like a biblical text that is seemingly frivolous, yet seems to tackle serious subjects with the utmost gravity. This is vintage Vonnegut - tackling human weakness and tragedy with satire."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle was the first book by Vonnegut I'd read, and I was definitely not disappointed. Unlike a real, \\"empty\\" cat's cradle, this book was filled with irony, wit, and hard truths about society that ring true even (especially?) today. If Cat's Cradle wasn't so damn funny, it would be chilling ... his end-of-the-world scenerio is devastatingly simple enough to be real. Amidst this tale of impending doom, Vonnegut makes the reader think about religion, politics, and science with an increasingly cynical outlook.This is an amazing book and a fast read. Give Cat's Cradle a shot if you have the chance: you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you're interested in learning about the stupidity of man and why religion is useful as an art form, this book is for you. Vonnegut entertains us with an apocalyptic tale about three kids with a dangerous new form of ice invented by their father who helped build the atomic bomb. Through their shortsightedness, the world is frozen and almost everything dies. Of course, no apocalyptic tale can exist without some commentary on religion and Vonnegut doesn't disappoint. He introduces us to a new religion built on top of \\"foma\\" a.k.a. lies. Which makes humans just actors in a play about the struggle of good and evil; how entertaining!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut received my vote in the MENSA BULLETIN poll of the best fiction books of the 20th century. I still remember the November 1972 day I came across it in the Wichita, Kansas Public Library. It was a green cover hardback misfiled at the end of the sports books with the games and crafts books. I surmise that someone filing books thought &quot;cat's cradle is a string game, therefore, Vonnegut's 'Cat's Cradle' must belong here.&quot; I am glad that it serendipitously came to my attention. It was and is an eye opening and thought provoking book. It remains one of those books that I enjoy revisiting every few years just for the pleasure of becoming lost in the joyous meditation of reading. Harlan Ellison thought Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; should have won the HUGO AWARD as best science fiction novel of 1963. I agree. More than science fiction, it transcends the genre and moves into literature. Bravo, Kurt Vonnegut. Job well done."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Regarded by many critics as the book that put Vonnegut on the map, it tells the tale of a man and the obserdity of religion. Vonnegut makes up his own religion (if L Ron Hubbard can do it) and his own vocabulary to illustrate that the world is the way it is because of the way we persive it and if you were to alter your perception maybe you might change the world. This book is a must for any Vonnegut fan and an easy, insightful, mesmurizing, thrill ride that will make you laugh and cry at its truth and at its absurdity."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My dad told me to read this book and I looked at him like he was crazy. I hadn't read a book any harder than Harry Potter and MAD magazine for the last few years, why would he expect me to read this mumble jumble. I agreed to give it a try and sat down and read the back. It sounded like a intersting book so I decided to read the first chapter or so. After about an hour of reading I realized that I could not put the book down. One thing about Cat's Cradle is that it is very well written but it doesn't have a high diffuculty of reading, so a boy like me could read and enjoy it. Cat's Cradle is a very fun and a feel good book, but it has suspence and drama that keeps tou on the edge of your seat. The book features a whole made up religion, started on a crazy made up island and crazy characters on the island and even a crazy substance that could end the world, all this coming from the mind of Kurt Vonnegut, who wrote the wonderful tale. I think that if there is 5 books that everybody should read in their lives, this should be one of them. Cat's Cradle is just so imaganitive it just makes you want to be inside the book. So if you haven't read this book, I suggest you jump out of your seat right now and go to the library and read Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. It is a great book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wanted to kill myself after reading this book. Kurt laughed laugh, pissed on love, and destroyed the nerves in my mind.

I am assuming it is supposed to be satire but is too outlandish to take seriously and not funny enough or outrageous enough to be good satire. Overall it was mildly amusing but I was expecting much more based on all the great reviews.It is too lightweight to be put in the category of great books it is rated alongside!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Did I read the same book as other reviewers who thought this was narrated by 'a scientist', that John was in a world-wide search of ice-nine? That think his name was Jonah? It's like these people reviewed this book and didn't even notice the basic facts yet felt the need to comment on the satire, ironies, etc. I sometimes wonder if these people read half the books they review. By the way, his name was *almost* Jonah because unlike the bible character who defied God's will and was punished for it he decided to embrace God's will for his life and 'go with the flow' of wherever 'coincidences' took him.This was written during a time when you didn't have to dig deep into a book to look for a possible hidden message - tv has caused us all to look at everything through 'LOST' eyeglasses. You don't have to look for clues or hidden meanings - they are clearly stated. This is a simple satiric view at religion, politics, relationships and the good old USA. I also think it was a tad prophetic in dealing with Bokonoism - the total acceptance of a religion whose own creator admitted it was a made-up religion based on lies smacks of today's Scientology movement.Characters not too deep but this is typical of Vonnegaut - their reactions are more important than their depth. I thought it was a good story and I laughed at obvious satires his characters missed. I wanted to see how it ended.This reminds me of the movie 'Back to School' where Rodney Dangerfield paid Kurt Vonnegaut to write his book report on Kurt Vonnegaut's work: the teacher gave the paper an 'F' and said, \\"Whoever wrote this paper doesn't have the slightest clue about Kurt Vonnegaut\\". Ha! Ha! he's just one of those authors we'll probably never really ever get."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is a wacky, swift, many charactered Vonn book, wrapped around his frequent theme of human ridiculousness.Jonah is the narrator, a man fascinated by the day the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, who sets off to investigate one Feliz Hoenikker, noted scientist and possible \\"father\\" of the bomb. What ensues is a funky, quirky, Vonnegutian swirl of synchronicity, and faux Taosit/Existential philosophy, born as Bokononism.Cat's Cradle is a quick read, featuring 127 chapters, some a page long, few beyond three pages long. Including Jonah there is Newt, a midget, Mona, the most beautiful woman in the world, the mysterious Bokonon, gruff, crude American's, scientifically bizarre ice-water, a statue lover, a Ukrainian spy, an ex-pat ex-convict major domo, a frozen dog, and the possible end of the world, among others.Truly a trip through Vonnegut. Through it all though, the essential foolishness and gullability of man is turned up to light.\\"Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are 'It Might Have Been.'\\""},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"As a graduate of Catholic high school and UCLA, I read Cat's Cradle on my own in 10th Grade, and it changed/saved my life. Vonnegut's perspective is one of truth, and this fantastic fictional tale is a wonderful vehicle to enhance positive objectivity in the world. It resonates with the wholeness of the world, the role of a society and it's members, and the quirkyness of genius."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"There is a great deal of very witty satire in this short novel that resonates with anyone who lived through the sixties. Vonnegut is dead-on in lampooning the child-like idiocy of twentieth century science in playing with forces that it neither understands nor can hope to control. Also effective is Vonnegut's critique of religion. He imagines a deal struck between the founder of \\"Bakononism\\" and the head of state to keep his religion illegal. Somehow the unholy alliance between the state and religion has a way of corrupting the latter. This is quite well done and amusing.As for the principles of Bokononism itself, on one level Vonnegut seems to be preaching a \\"free love\\" philosophy and hostility toward organized religion that were so much in fashion 50 years ago. But on a deeper level, Bokonon seems to be making the age-old challenge to how God can tolerate so much stupidity and evil in His universe.On the down-side, I thought much of the book could be pared down -- including an interminable plane ride to the fictional island of San Lorenzo and endless discussions/letters between Newt and the narrator that do little to advance the plot or ideas of the book. Also, the book lacks the true depth of feeling that later made Slaughterhouse Five a masterpiece.So, I'd recommend Slaughterhouse Five to anyone who wants to read Vonnegut now. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is good, but not great.In the audiobook version of this novel there is a ridiculous interview of Vonnegut where Vonnegut posits that his German heritage somehow kept him from being accepted by the literary establishment. I suppose Vonnegut did not get the literary acclaim he desired. This was probably more the result of snobbery toward best selling authors than any hostility to German Americans. Or it could be that Vonnegut had a habit of saying a lot of silly, eccentric things. But his writing is generally good and his books, particularly Slaughterhouse Five, are worth reading 50 years after the fact."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is Kurt Vonnegut's fourth novel and was perhaps his most autobiographical one when it was released. Published in 1963 it features the Hoenikker family, and specifically the three kids, an elder son, a tall middle daughter, and a younger son are similar to Vonnegut's family. This novel also helped turn Vonnegut into a popular author, when Graham Green said it was \\"one of the three best novels of the year.\\" As with his other novels, Cat's Cradle is a satire, and while there is a science fiction element to it, that is not the strength of the work.The narrator is a writer who is working on a book called \\"The Day the World Ended\\", which initially is about the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima, and in particular the father of the atomic bomb, the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker, and in particular his three unusual kids and what they remember about the day the bomb was dropped. However, like the title suggests, things are not always what they appear to be (\\"See the Cat? See the Cradle?\\").Vonnegut changes the focus of perception throughout the book. The end of the world originally focused on the atomic bomb, changes to a new and different threat also created by Dr. Felix Hoenikker. Bokonoism goes from a spoof of a religion to a religion of its own. Perceptions also change with regards to San Lorenzo, the relationship between the government and religion, and the attitude of the narrator to writing. Even the perception of the titles of the chapters changes as the reader progresses through the story.The science element of this story is actually rather weak, although there is an intriguing concept; there is also a key point which Vonnegut doesn't address at all. Nevertheless, the strength of the novel is in the insights, as well as the counter-culture elements, and the unusual style makes this an interesting read, to say the least. When Vonnegut is discussed, often this novel is left out when it comes to what was his best. However, his dark humor and social satire are well in evidence here, and this is not one to be missed."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had to read this book for my ethics class, and it was chalked full of metaphors and symbolism in regards to society and what people tend to believe is important. The story is a fast-paced page turner, and even though it has been decades since its publication, the issues it brings up are still very relevant today."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Who else could combine a newspaper journalist, the apocolypse, a midget, an invented religion complete with its own tennents, terms, and texts, and the father of the atom bomb into a fun and thoughtful novel. NO ONE! A fun a thrilling novel that you will need to read twice!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The novel Cat's Cradle by the author Kurt Vonnegut shows how a society can maintain itself around the contradiction of science and religion. The novel reflects around such examples as the infamous ice- nine and the profound religion of Bokonism developed by a most impressive man, Bokonon himself. The novel mainly revolves around the concept of the crystals known as ice- nine. This is said to be a compound of water whose molecular structure has been altered into another form which makes it solid at room temperature and have a melting point of one- hundred and fourteen degrees Fahrenheit. It also is known to instantaneously freeze anything that it comes in contact with, which eventually destroys the world. Ironically this substance happened to be created by the maker of the atomic bomb. An interesting book indeed. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the concept of science versus religion and also to anyone who is intrigued by science itself. I found the book to be quite an enjoying and extremely fascinating book to pick up, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying out one of Vonnegut's \\"different\\" books."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is a well-known excellent writer. He wrote several great books that incorporate human life and emotions. One of his best works was A Cat's Cradle. This book talked about the contradiction between illusion and reality and how people valued it in their societies. It also showed the topic of science vs. religion in modern society. Vonnegut's creative style of writing made this book an interesting read. All of these reasons make A Cat's Cradle an excellent book to read and a beginning for the understanding of the world portrayed in Vonnegut's many writings. The plot of A Cat's Cradle involves humanity and the contradictions that exist in modern society. Vonnegut focuses on the theme of illusion and reality in this book which were also explored in his previous novels, Mother Night. He came to the conclusion that illusion becomes reality in people's lives. A gloomy world is depicted in this novel to show the reality of life. This book is basically about one man who wants to write a book about World War two. It leads to his investigation between the topics of science and religion. The science part of this novel discusses an atomic bomb and a fanciful \\"ice nine\\" poison. The religion part of this novel discusses the widely followed religion of Bokonism that said that God is \\"utterly indifferent.\\" The topics this novel discussed were written very humorously. Every chapter had a joke at the end. It was an easy and very interesting read. The characters were exciting and easy to follow. A Cat's Cradle questioned topics of humanity and life in a very interesting and joyful way. Kurt Vonnegut's book A Cat's Cradle was an excellent read. Its theme was creative and questioned certain topics that really never discussed. Like all of Kurt Vonnegut's books the chapters are short and discuss short segments of the main character's life. After the reading the book, it makes the reader question their own life and humanity in general. The way the book is written keeps the reader consistently involved in the book. I truly enjoyed this book especially since I have read other books by Kurt Vonnegut. I hope you decide to read it and then read other selections by Kurt Vonnegut, an acclaimed and highly recommended author."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is clearly one of KV's best books. He has a way of writing a science fiction book without it seeming like science fiction. The focus seems to be more on the characters than the plot idea. The description on the book jacket emphasizes all the wrong parts, so don't let that turn you off."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"What is society? Why does society leave behind those who influence it most? Why are some of the firmest establishments religion? Kurt Vonnegut dared to answer these ever-pondered questions in Cat's Cradle, a novel daring to talk about things that most men do not. Vonnegut satirically and facetiously explains and defines society, through a story about a bomb, a midget, a clarinet player, a mad scientist, and a man who just wanted some answers.How could Vonnegut have used these tools to explain such a large and vital factor? That is the magic of the novel as well as his unique and intense art. Vonnegut picked apart society's aspects and analyzed them, and then he proceeded to put them all back together, allowing one to look at the whole in a new light. The narrator does this through meeting people and describing their place in society effectively. However, when those characters were introduced, the author did not simply just bring them in and begin his descriptions, both physical and intellectual. All the descriptions of the vital characters were researched and unveiled to the reader beforehand, and of course Vonnegut always had a way of slipping them into the scene. By the time they were in the picture, the reader already knew them or knew of them. This factor made the novel enjoyable to exponential amounts. Vonnegut also challenged Christianity, and wondered why it was the firmest leaning post people have, especially American people. Why wouldn't a religion like Bokonon, the religion of the narrator, with its bittersweet lies aimed only at pleasing society, surpass this main stream religion, with its harsh truthfulness. The author's approach to this fact made the story fascinating because of the brightness and boldness of the idea.The structure of the novel, with small, neat 1 or 2 page chapters, depicts how thought is broken up into thought, just like the recollection that regular thinkers go through every day. The chapters do refer to each other interchangeably to make the story comprehensible. The titles of each of the chapters pertain to small details included in the text that stuck out in the narrator's mind. Any person can relate to this type of thought, since it is involved in any recalling of any story. The reader then flies through the novel and digests the story as any other would their own. This novel was incredible in the fact that Vonnegut dared to challenge so that in the end, the reader could do nothing but relate to his conjectures."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"What is the purpose of mankind?As usual, Vonnegut has done the unthinkable. He's turned an absurd, worse case scenario into a very possible future. In the future mankinds fight against his own nature has escalated to a point that they no longer have a point. Machines and a few elite run absolutely everything. The I.Q. rules supreme and loyalty is unquestionable. The U.S.A. has fallen away from there onetime belief in the people. Usefullness and happiness has been replaced by convenience. The management of the country can not understand how someone without an electronic dust reducer in their home could possibly be happy. One time daily survival chores have been reduced via machines into a ten minute daily routine. What do you do now. How about head to work for the Recks and Reeks to pointlessly beautify a city that has already been made perfect so you can bring home your thirty dollar a week check. Or maybe you belong to the army and will therefore spend twenty five years cleaning your barracks and marching in parades with your wooden toy gun. The machines do everything so proficiently that the every day man is turned into little more than a show room slave. Modeling to other countries how good we have it over here. Government gives everyone a meaningless job and a prefab house. There is no hunger, no homelessness, no problems to overcome. Besides, maybe, what to do with your spare time besides sit in a bar and talk about your lack of realistic plans for the future."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I picked up CC after a friend recommended SH5, which I read and enjoyed. Vonnegut's sly, subtle wit will probably strike many at first as just cynicism, but the character's all have heart. Ironically in all of the absurdity of Vonnegut's characters and stories, he manages to capture more of humanity than any author I've read in quite some time."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had heard of Kurt Vonnegut for some time, and decided to subjectively decide upon his brilliance. I chose Cat's Cradle as my introduction to the crazy world of Vonnegut, and I must say that I was impressed. His writing is witty, funny, and unique. His cast of characters were unbelievable and hilarious. His comments on religion, politics, science, etc. were profound and thought provoking. Vonnegut's genius only takes precedence in your mind days after you have finsihed this work, as you constantly anaylze his statements and beliefs. It has been a long time since I have had to anaylze a novel, but Cat's Cradle serves as an interesting piece to dwell upon."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Ice-nine is a substance that will freeze anything it touches. Invented by Felix Hoenikker, one of the scientists who created the atomic bomb, it has the potential to bring the world to an end by turning the planet into a freezing ball.&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a novel full of sharp satire and irony. The narrator, who is writing a book about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, meets in the course of his research a variety of weird and wonderful characters who recount their experiences of the late Dr. Hoenikker. This leads him on a quest to find Hoeniker's three children, who each possess &quot;chips&quot; of Ice-nine...A novel that has been compared a number of times to &quot;Dr Strangelove&quot;, &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a witty, dry-humored approach to the apocalypse. Although Hoenikker's three children are weird, I could relate to these characters more than any of the others in the book.The way in which the world comes to an end is so ironic and offbeat. I can imagine Terry Gilliam making a movie of this novel. With his quirky approach to film-making, I'm sure it would work well."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"this book is more than a gretawork of literature. this book has a heart and soul. beyond description."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read Cat's Cradle when I was about 15, and I just reread it recently as a 39 year old. While the book remains an important work, I think a bit of the urgency and vitality wore off. I remembered that it had some cool ice-stuff and a frozen dog from being a teen. Upon this reading, I was amazed how spiritual the essence of the story seemed under the layers of obvious satire. Jonah, the reporter, is attracted to the exotic Mona, not because of her beauty (but being the typical male, that's what he thinks) but because, ultimately through the simple act of touching his feet to hers, he finds God. Vonnegut seems a very anti-religious man.....hating the organized religions of the world, but still facing up to the fact that God can be found anywhere and everywhere, even if one dosen't know what one seeks. The book, due to it's anti nuclear theme, was perhaps more urgent in the 1970's, but it is still a laugh-out-loud enjoyable read. I also admire the layers of storytelling. It is one of my favorite Vonnegut offerings."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I first read the book in question when I was compelled to do so in the eighth grade. Now I'm a semi-literate college student; I've revisited this masterpiece at least once every two years since my initial encounter with it. Each time, I've found it nearly impossible to rip myself away. To an even greater degree than in other Vonnegut books, the prose is masterful. The plot is magnificently crafted and ingeniously engineered (though perhaps inadvertently) to provoke contemplation of elemental aspects of one's humanity."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my first Vonnegut book, and I absolutely loved it. I began reading it 3 days ago and I finished it last night. i wasn't able to put it down for more than a few minutes at a time. The way he speaks of religion and science and the way he puts them together was both funny and sadly true. I would recomend this book to anyone, and I am sure that i will go searching for the rest of his books to read and enjoy in the very near future."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. It brilliantly contradicts the 98% of all literature that claims truth is the most valuable commodity in the world; it is short, sweet, and devastating. And so I add my 5* to the masses."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read this book many years ago and it has remained my all time favorite book. Kurt Vonnegut is a brilliant writer.

Cats Cradle, what is a cats cradle, a string jumbled together to make something interesting. Well that is just the same as we humans and our lives. We are all weaving in and out of each others lives!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a very enjoyable book to read. I say this not only because some of the characters and situations are bizarre but, they are also easy to relate to. This book has a lot to say about people and religion (to name only a few) and it does it in an &quot;I can't put it down!&quot; way. Treat yourself to this one, you'll laugh, you'll cry (maybe). Vonnegut won't let you down."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut has been my favorite author since high school, when I first picked up one of his books. I have been an avid reader of his since then. Vonnegut uses many metaphors for the concept of organized religion, and at some points actually comes out and states his point. Many interesting concepts and points about religion and out ideas of a God are expressed in this book. I hesitate to say too much about it, this book really speaks for itself, and is best saved as a &quot;treasure&quot; to discover for yourself. I HIGHLY reccomend it to anyone- from high school age on up, it makes a great read. By far one of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I haven't read any of Vonnegut's other books (yet), but I certainly will! Thanks to this book, I have been opened up to a new author. I can't say that I'd recommend this one over any of his others, since I haven't read them yet, but I definitely recommend it, period!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This review will likely spoil parts of the plot. I'll try and keep those to a minimum, but you've been warned.My English teacher once called this book a \\"science-fiction\\" novel, and that was the first red flag I should have noticed. Science-fiction, in a literature class? What English teacher would allow such a thing? I thought they despised books that focused on ideas instead of character!I soon learned that I had misread them entirely. It's not the focus on ideas that turns English majors off--it's optimism, and a sense that science and technology empower humanity and allow a brighter future. That's why \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a book that they endorse. It goes beyond mere pessimism and dives into the abyss of nihilism.From Kurt Vonnegut, we learn that science and technology will be the death of us all, that the military-industrial complex is a force that will develop any weapon for its own sake without regard for the consequences, and that the purpose of religion is to provide comforting lies.These ideas are delivered through two plot devices--a substance called Ice-9, which converts water into solid form at room temperature, and an ideology called Bokononism. The former eventually--spoiler--kills almost all the world's population, and is supposed to be a parody of the atomic bomb. The latter is a religion whose adherants tell each other comforting lies. Leaving aside that doublethink is necessary for a lie to be comforting if the recipient of the lie is aware of its lack of truth, Bokononism fails as a parody of Christianity--Vonnegut's target--because the whole point of Christianity is that the adherants believe their ideology to be the truth! If an ideology is accepted to be a lie, why would anyone follow it? It is also an inherantly ugly ideology in that it provides no reason for one to exist. Even Marxism has some sort of bright ideal at the end of it to motivate its followers--Bokononism has nothing going for it.As for Ice-9, its inherant flaw as a satirical concept is that it is a parody of a phenomenon that doesn't exist. The military-industrial complex would not develop an obviously self-destructive device--the fact that there are no Cobalt Bombs should be evidence enough of that. Before anyone counters this point with the Atomic and Hydrogen bombs, an atomic war is not inherantly a civilization-ending event. They're just big explosives in a small package--humanity no more can wipe itself and the earth's biosphere out with them than it can alter the earth's orbital path. Ice-9 is a wholly different concept, a device that can freeze all liquid water on earth, and, if one thinks on timescales of trillions of years, perhaps the entire galaxy. Its use in battle would inherantly destroy the one who wields it. There is no reason that any power would develop it.Another flaw in this book is its lack of memorable characters. A character can be judged on his or her strength by how well one can remember them. Some authors write truly memorable characters--Allen Steele's William Tucker in \\"A King of Infinite Space,\\" Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's Allen Carpentier in \\"Inferno,\\" Henryk Sienkiewicz's entire cast of main characters in his Trilogy, to name but a few. In \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" the only characters I can remember are that one midget (because I thought maybe the word \\"midget\\" was the source of that legendary Vonnegut humor) and the woman from Indiana who wants people to whom she is not related to call her \\"mom\\" (I remember her only because I tried to figure out what her mental disorder was for a while).Bottom Line: The book's messages are that Science is Bad and Religion is Lies. If you believe that either of these statements are false, you'd be better off with just about any other writer (Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Jules Verne, if you're into Science Fiction. Otherwise, I can recommend Henryk Sienkiewicz). If you are an English major, this might be the book for you. It's depressing, cynical, and all the other things that make for those excessively-long papers that English professors love."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"You either like Vonnegut or not. This is my second novel of his that I've read, and again, he comes across as misanthropic, plotless, and pseudo-philosophical. His characters are wooden and unlikeable. His chapters are usually one page long. His prose and dialogue are generally quite bad. He is not a comedian. If this is the published novel, one wonders what the first draft or brainstorm was like.What drug was Vonnegut doing, when the Cold War made him think up \\"ice-nine?\\"If Vonnegut wrote to get some message across, why didn't he write an essay or a short story? If he wrote a novel so that he could flesh out characters or tell some compelling story, then this is a utter failure.If you want funny, read P.G. Wodehouse. If you want an anti-nuclear message, there are at least a dozen better short stories or novels by other authors. Some of them are near-masterpieces like Bradbury's \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\", Clarke's \\"The Curse\\", and Miller's \\"A Canticle for Liebowitz.\\" If atheism is what floats your boat, read some atheistic philosopher because Vonnegut can't even go toe to toe with Elijah and the bears."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My father is a Vonnegut fanatic so this book came highly recommended to me. Having finished it a few days ago I feel that I can make a fair assessment of the book.I have read one of Vonnegut's other works before Breakfast of Champions having read that and now this I notice a trend of Vonnegut's style of writing. You almost get a feeling that he is stalling, not inserting any action. In Cats Cradle nothing exciting happened until there were 30 pages left in a 200 page book. It wasn't even as if he had built up the anticipation for something to happen either. Vonnegut just keeps reintroducing more and more information for you to swallow. He even goes so far as to make up words for his Bokonism religion. The words were often times hard to remember which was which, presenting discontent. However the book was not all bad. The book provides a very radical insight of the world and makes one truly question their beliefs. However it's a very pessimistic view, as is common in most of Vonnegut's work. After finishing the book I felt very depressed and didn't enjoy my reaction to the conclusion to the book. Vonnegut depicts how the human race will inevitably destroy itself. All and all this book is okay if you're on vacation and get to read it everyday. Otherwise you forget some details on the religious words and what have you. That is why I give this book 3 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is my first Vonnegut read. Considering his Nobel prize for literature, I was disappointed. Cat's Cradle creates a handful of new words; bokonon, boko-maru, wampeter, and etc. The apparent purpose of this tome is to poke fun at religion in general, in a very gentle and inconsequential way.Generally, I was bored through the bulk of the story, with only the slightest uptick in the way Vonnegut tied up loose ends together at the conclusion.My next Vonnegut read will be \\"Slaughter House Five\\". If what little I've read about that story prove to be even half accurate, it should prove to be a better reading investment.Paul"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Ive read through Cat's Cradle twice and I'm convinced that Mr Vonnegut was either insane or is good at convincing the reader that he is. The characters in the story are certifiable. And the leadup to the climax is a trip through the rediculous and surreal. That may very well was his intention, however the result is a book this is every much jarring to try and get through."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I wanted to read some more of Kurt Vonnegut.

So my memory is a little rusty, but at the same time, the really good parts and the really not so good parts stick out.While I was reading this book, it kind of bored me. It takes a great amount of action to really keep me interested in stuff, though. I think I may have a light case of ADD. Anyway, the religious words that Vonnegut made up kind of jumbled together in my mind, and I just pretty much confused one for another. I don't know. I just felt kind of bored throughout the book.It was good, though. I'm glad I read it. It's kind of like 1984, it kind of sucks as you're reading it because it's so damn boring, but when you get through it, you think to yourself, &quot;Damn it, that was a good book! I'm really glad I read it! Everything was just great!&quot; Cat's Cradle is kind of like this. 1984 was better, though.

But, after the first 100 pages, it started to grab my attention.Cat' Cradle is a story of a man that wishes to write a book about the father of the Atom bomb(it's a fictonal person) and ends up finding out about some of his 'other' inventions(not some mutant freak). Like I said origonaly, the first half or so of the book loses me. I only got interested in it when the protagonist got on the plane midway through the book.In some ways, people could find this novel contrivesal, because the main religon(Bokonon) mimics the eairly Christians death by the cross, and that man is going to far with science that is harful to us, but only if your trying to see that like I was. It's a fine book all in all, but it's somewhat boring at first, and his humor isent really that great, in fact, I only saw it once or twice.

I've always been a fan of Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Obvious satire on all the ridiculous happy endings sewn onto stories but why else throw in the towel on mankind? One wonders if the story might be a justification for suicide. One supposes that Vonnegut, like his character, little Newt, was disappointed that in making a Cat's Cradle that there really is no cat and no cradle-that there is really nothing supporting the religious tripe that seem to keep people rolling down the track. He certainly put the \\"dys\\" in utopia here. I doubt if a more poignant tale of futility and hopelessness could be penned.Although his memorable characters are nicely drawn-they are all too easily erased by the final page. Why struggle through so many pages of words only to reach the same blank page one started with? Looking for virtue in the tale one can say that it was short and abrupt. The suffering doesn't last that long. Everyone would prefer an instant and painless end to their life."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Don't waste your time on this book. After reading in Palm Sunday that Vonnegut considered Cat's Cradle his finest work, I turned to it with anticipation. I had enjoyed Vonnegut's style in Palm Sunday, his irony, and was expecting something equally stimulating. What a disappointment. The \\"plot\\" is pointless, and leads nowhere other than to an abrupt and sudden ending. His coining of new words and concepts along the way attempts to mask the absence of any serious message. I lived through World War II and the Cold War and kept looking for something I could relate to either of those 20th-century challenges to Western civilization, but I found nothing here--only flights of Vonnegut's fancy that I couldn't relate to any real world I know. His characters are shallow and undeveloped and his dialogue much the same. If you like pure fantasy that isn't related in any way to the challenges of our lives in the real world then maybe you'll find something here. For me, the lesson I take away from this is to approach any other Vonnegut novel with extreme caution and scepticism. Time is too valuable to use on shallow ramblings like this one."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle started off well enough and flowed easily, then it took a turn for the silly and outlandish. I must admit that K.V.Jr is a very intelligent man, and behind his somewhat unremarkable dialogue there is a very large message here. This book has the typical anti-establishment theme Vonnegut is known for. I'm sad to say I wasn't a good audience for his words. The concept of the \\"ice-nine theory was great, but I didn't care for the story three forths of the way through. It ended silly and not what I expected. I didn't cheer for any of the characters, in fact I had no respect for any of them. I will not say it is a bad novel, but it is a bad novel for me at this point in my life. It is a hard novel to grasp, but easy to read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Didn't know what to expect. Thought it might be difficult reading for some reason. Turns out it was pretty easy.

I think it could have been a 4.5-5 star book if the story would have been expanded upon to at least 500pp, or at least long enough to develop the characters."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"To be honest, I was left with a strong feeling of distaste after having finished Cat's Cradle. First, there's the book's rather blunt ridicule of science. In Cat's Cradle, science is represented by two characters - Dr. Hoenikker, inventor of the atomic bomb and all-around genius, and a fellow scientist whom the protagonist goes to interview some years after Hoenikker's death. The latter is basically an overbearing pompous ass and veritably invites the reader's contempt, especially given his praise of the former. The former is portrayed as a completely delusional psychopath to whom nothing exists besides research; his complete lack of contact with reality or with anything outside of his laboratory leads to the death of his wife and the severe maladjustment of his children, and aside from the other scientist, the whole town still hates him even years after his death.Hey, Vonnegut, you don't think you're being a bit too hard on scientists there, man? I mean, certainly, given the premise of science being irresponsible, deluded and in many ways blind and repugnant, like Hoenikker, then Vonnegut's \\"parable\\" about \\"over-reliance on science\\" makes perfect sense. But the entire premise is completely intellectually dishonest. There have been, believe it or not, works that have examined the same problem, in the same way of looking at the life of one scientist who is too wrapped up in his work to notice other aspects of life. The film Nine Days Of One Year immediately occurs to me as an example. But that film, though it reached a conclusion similar to Vonnegut's - that, the search for truth aside, one must not forget certain other important things in life - was far more honest about its subjects, acknowledging that they were more than just garish caricatures, and was all the more thought-provoking and powerful as a result. In comparison, Vonnegut's portrayal of science (which, in the book, is always greatly and deliberately praised by the most vacuous and unlikeable characters) is just ham-fisted and crude. Essentially, it proves a point about something that has no basis in reality in the first place.But that flaw, I suppose, would be forgivable. It's not uncommon for artists to oversimplify this issue, and it doesn't mean that the end result can't be good. The real problem I had with Cat's Cradle was the grotesque and very forced \\"comedy.\\" Actually, to be more accurate, it was the way Vonnegut turned _everything_ into grotesque and very forced \\"comedy,\\" and expected me to laugh at it. The prime example of this is that bit where Newt, Hoenikker's midget son, falls in love with a beautiful young circus freak who turns out to be a Russian spy and, moreover, twice as old as Newt. How does that sound to you? To me, it sounds like some gag made on some bad \\"cult comedy entertainment show,\\" and it was genuinely painful to read. Yes, yes, yes, plenty of great literature contains scenes in which characters suffer painful humiliation - but _this_ scene made me feel, very uncomfortably, that Vonnegut _himself_ was actively getting off on inflicting this sort of mean-spirited, artless tripe on his characters. And then there was that bit with Frank Hoenikker, the missing son who suddenly became second-in-command in a small island dictatorship, when he suddenly tells the protagonist where and why he had been secretively running about throughout his youth. Which would've been possible to ignore, if not for the exposition, in which we view him as a talented, creative human being and are told what he _really_ spent his time doing. Why did the author ever bother characterizing him if he was just going to turn it into another hideous caricature with no depth later on? Why am I supposed to laugh at people being abased for no reason? Oh, wait, I get it. It's supposed to prove some kind of facile \\"point\\" about how \\"life is really one big joke!\\" Insightful.I could say more. I could talk about the utterly awful \\"Calypsos,\\" about the way Vonnegut bludgeons the reader with his overwrought message, about that silly religious terminology, and about other things. But that's all secondary. The science fiction element is original, and Vonnegut's an inventive and imaginative author, but this book simply left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Where is the contemplation in this \\"classic\\"?This book, though an interesting insight into one man's thinking and life journey, certainly did not seem to merit the hype it has received.It seemed very whiney and a little condescending, talking down to the reader. If the world annoys you, Vonnegut, work to improve it, or better, your view of it, rather than complaining to the world! Cat's Cradle seemed like an explanation of one man's depression and corruption so we could understand, even agree with him. I am certainly not saying the world is perfect, but if you are looking for a pensive and melancholy-toned book about its problems, I suggest \\"Demian\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and others of Bradbury's classics. In comparison, Cat's Cradle is merely a collection of a cynic's complaints creatively assembled."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 90% of this book.

More importantly, I realized that I didn't have to understand a book to enjoy it.I recently reread Cat's Cradle for the fourth time, and 20 years later, I'm no closer to understanding it. Yet, I still caught myself laughing out loud and profoundly sad upon reading the final paragraph.Cat's Cradle is not the best book I've ever read, but reading it opened my mind and allowed me to pick up and read some of the best books I've ever read"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If the worst thing you can say about a book is that you wish it was longer, then, hey, that's not too bad, right?I mean, I can recognize wonderful writing more than I can produce it so I won't write much here.

You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you do not feel like reading what I think about the book, and just want a recommendation \`yes, go for it / no, you would be wasting your time', go to the end of my review. If, on the other side, you want to know what I do think about \`Cat's cradle', keep reading.Politics, religion and God, love and friendship, life and death. All is nonsense for Vonnegut. All is scorned, ridiculed. Or maybe he just tries to throw to the trashcan the absolute character we, human beings, tend to give to all those supposed absolutes. It could sound hard, but probably he is right in some way. Think about love, think how sometimes we just idolize the object of our longings: oh, I would do whatever you want me to do (and whatever means whatever--that crazy we can be). Then, for some reason, you realize the worshipped idol is not such, but just a human being, like me or you. All those great thoughts, ideals, aspirations (\`I'll take the moon for you') just blow out. The result: a huge disappointment, a crisis. Any solutions? Yes, realize that love, or friendship, politics, morals, and everything else, are relative. And I am not saying that their value change with circumstances, but that any single of these elements should not be the sole foundation of our life and way of acting. Maybe I should think more about this, but it makes sense to me. My personal experiences tell me so.Anyway, the book is good, funny most of the times, and it makes you think. Worth the time and the money."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Put this review down at once, it is nothing but foma!

It's a short, easy read. It's totally absorbing and entertaining. I think I discovered that I'm a Bokononist. Too bad."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I had heard so much about Vonnegut since my freshman year in High school. I know now that I will become a hard core fan of all his books. I'm an avid reader of all science fiction novels and this one is definitely one of my favorites. This book is by far a thrill ride of an apocolyptic adventure. There are also alot of great charcter introduced in the book and alot of funny scenes. This was my first experience with Vonnegut and I enjoyed every moment of it. When I first saw the cover of the book I thought that it would be interesting and it was. It was not so hard and it was not very easy either. I love the way he satires religon and science. Blending his patented wry humor with acute social insight presented in an absurd fantasy world, Vonnegut has written an exceptional novel of love lies and the self destruction of mankind. The story centers around the narrator, Jonah, who is called by name only once in the entire book. We are told in the begining of the book that he is writing a book on the events of the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.His research leads him to a correspondence with Newt Hoenikker, the midget son of doctor Felix Hoenikker, father of the atomic bomb. After meeting with Newt, destiny leads our protagonist to the impoverished island republic of San Lorenzo, where among other adventures he finds religon, falls in love and becomes a president. All of this by itself would make for a very entertaining book, but it is not in the story line that Vonnegut's genius lies. Cat's Cradle is rife with painfully accurate insights into the institutions that our society holds so dear, such as, religion, politics, and science. Vonnegut invents for the inhabitants of San Lorenzo a brand new religion based completely and admittedly on &quot;foma&quot;, or lies. This wouldn&quot;t be so shocking, except for the fact that this &quot;bokonism&quot; seems to make perfect sense. Other Vonnegut ironies pervade the book and are too elaborate to go into. Cat's Cradle is one of the most absurd,and frightening novels. This book truly causes one to stop and think about the things that one holds as unquestionably true. All of these incredible people, places, things and ideas in Cat's cradle are intricately woven into a perfect tapestry that sums up and spells out many of mankind's self-created problems in 191 pages. I haven't read any of Kurt Vonnegut's other books but I know that I most certainly will. After checking this book out from the library I went and bought my own copy. I strongly recommed this book to anyone over the age of four-teen. There is no reason not to buy this masterpiece of modern literature. SO IF YOU READ IT WAS AND DIDM'T LIKE IT THAN READ IT AGAIN. IF YOU READ IT ONCE AND ENJOYED BUY IT AND READ IT AGAIN."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The writing is very good and elegant and it worths reading the book only because of that, but the story is something else. The first half of the book is brilliant. That's the part which takes place in US, while the narrator is interviewing people related to Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. The book is full of interesting phrases and has a sharp insite into social life and relationships. But when the plot moves to the ficional island of San Lorenzo, the interesting stuff became rarer and rarer and what was intelligent and funny became dull and boring. Sometimes I had the feeling I started reading a certain book and finished reading a completely different one."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Maybe I did not read the fine print, but I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It looks like a very high quality fake. My primary gripe is with the cover. I have owned this book in softcover and the hardcover looks like someone scanned the softcover and printed it in their back room. The text looks fine and if you are just looking to read the book, nothing more, I am sure it is fine. If that was what I wanted though I would have paid 5 bucks for a softcover. I was looking for something a bit more collectible. Something that would look nice on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt's analysis of human society is one of the most accurate posssible.

Admitedly, these could be ravings explained by the vertigo I'm suffering having over-dosed on morbid satire. I reread Cat's Cradle for the nth time this week. This is my current comment: Much like being punched in the gut by a heavyweight, you're left breathless and staggering even if you'd seen it coming."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I am glad this wasn't the first Vonnegut book I read. Had it been I probably wouldn't be enthusiastic about reading another. Fortunately, my first was Slaughterhouse-Five.There are plenty of reviewers here who gave great, detailed synopses of the book, so I will skip that.What I found good about the book was it's commentary on religion and, more specifically, the relationship between religion and political power (Papa and Bokononists/Bokonon). I also enjoyed the reactions John had to some of the absurd things people would say, especially on the plane. And the elevator scene was a riot, funny and thought provoking. Vonnegut is a master at providing us with funny and ridiculous characters, and there are some in this book (although not enough to make it a great book, but still enough to make it worth a read).But...the book got slow in many places, and after a while it seemed almost like a chore to read. I enjoyed the message, but not the way it was told. If this is your first Vonnegut book please don't use it against him if you find it boring, many of his other books (like Slaughterhouse-Five) are awesome."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Writer researches family of father of the atom bomb, Hoenikker, who split his new invention, ice 9, among his three children.

At many point I told myself that I was going to stop reading but then an interesting part came and I could not put it down. The book does jump around a lot which at times make things difficult to follow. Although it does not jump around as much as Slaughterhouse Five there is a strange fluidity that is created that puts a damper on the usual Vonnegut books. It is almost to fluid to make the book interesting."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It is an interesting book with a masterful writing style. My appreciation of this book was largely literary.

The narrative is quick-paced, never stopping to allow you to catch your breath from alternately laughing and crying at the folly of humanity.Of course, it's as all of the reviewer's here note; the novel is short, though takes a wide scope. It contemplates such difficult subjects as the nature of science and science's refusal to consider religion or the moral implications of its work. The novel is also extremely interesting for its commentary on religion, particularly considering that Vonnegut was an atheist. Each minute chapter is thought-provoking in its way, and underneath its primary themes, there is an exorbitant range of objects to satirize. And yes, the much of the stupidity is captured in the pages of this little read.Cat's Cradle is one of the greatest novels of this century. Everything which Vonnegut comments on is just too much to go into here; this review would end up being longer than Cat's Cradle itself. It certainly makes a great read, and the things Vonnegut writes will keep you thinking whether you agree with him or not (I particularly recommend this for college science majors)."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut discusses the importance of science and religion in his science fiction novel \\"Cat's Cradle\\". On the first the protagonist seems to be an average person: He does not have a focus in his life, is unstable and feels unloved. That is very interesting about the book because this ordinary person from the beginning becomes someone special in the end.The protagonist, Jonah, is a journalist who wants to write a novel about the \\"father of the atomic bomb\\" whose family he meets doing research. Jonah finds out about Ice-nine, a substance that converts water into ice even at high temperatures, it is unclear if this substance is existent or not. This stays mysterious until the ending of the book, which is an apocalypse, all life on earth dies of Ice-nine. The author has a very descriptive style. The story takes place in unpleasant settings. The characters in \\"Cat's Cradle\\" are weird, persons who are very rare in real life because they are so extreme. The plot itself is unrealistic. Vonnegut has a black and white view of life: something is good and bad. There is nothing that is just good or bad. The result of the book is that also science is bad sometimes because it can be destructive and even religion is not only good because it is based on lies.The book is entertaining and it has an unique humor which is not to be understood for everybody. Who does not like black humor would probably not think the book is funny. But the novel is still a good book to read because it makes people, who are interested in its theme, think about it and get interesting points of view. For people who just want a book for pure entertainment it is not the right book to read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Cats Cradle&quot; produces an excellent outlook on society in general. The main character, Jonah, named after the biblical Jonah and the Whale story for his unfortunate circumstances, is writing a book called &quot;The Day The World Ended&quot;. Throughout his research, he meets many brilliant minds and by pure coincidence (or as Bokonon would say, as it was supposed to happen) he comes across an object which can actually end the world. A interesting analysis of scientists, truth, religion and human nature. Near the beginning it tells you that if you cannot understand how a religion can be based on lies yet still be practised then you will not understand the book (that Jonah is writing: &quot;The Day The World Ended&quot;). You will understand this later in the book. An excellent read for an open mind on many topics such as religion, truth and science."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is the second Vonnegut novel I read, the first being Slaughterhouse-Five. I was highly impressed by both of them. He has become one of my favorite authors. Once again, I am amazed at Vonnegut's ability to treat deathly serious subjects so lightheartedly without trivializing them. I laughed out loud several times during the course of this book, and yet, it is no less profound than the overtly serious 1984. How can this be, you ask? The answer is that Vonnegut has discovered what Orwell, Huxley, and countless other brilliant &quot;fair warning&quot; writers failed to realize: humor is the one universal element. Many people disdain such so-called universal elements as love, religion, politics, and the like. However, NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE, is safe from the far-reaching potential of humor. Vonnegut uses it skillfully here. I won't go into plot details here, read the book for that. What I will say is that on the surface is an entertaining and fast-paced piece of black-humored satire, and between the lines is a highly relevant novel that has, and hopefully will continue to, displace the arrogance and folly of modern Man."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"my first vonnegut book and, so far, my favorite. i did not have a sense of who vonnegut was or how he wrote when i picked up this book on a recomendation of a friend. 50 pages into it i really did not know if i was actually reading a novel or just some mad old fart rambling about chemistry and conflict. it jumps around in the usual post-modern fasion, leaving the reader to wonder where the author could possibly go with all of the seemingly usless information being hurled at us at every turn of the page. but soon i got a sense. then a grasp. then an almost privledged feeling as i saw the parts of the puzzle take their place. this seemingly incoherant babbeling was slowly starting to take shape and what's more, make sense. i could not put the book down. it hooked me with confusion and reeled me with its wit. i recomend this book as a pill for the mundane. a psychotic break from textbooks. and as a prime example for understanding the post-modern world in which we now live."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my favorite Vonnegut book, and one of my most favorite books of all time.

That is what I have thought all along, I just didn't know how to express it!&quot; Vonneguts main characters are his ideas, and such is the case in this book. You don't necessarily identify so much with the characters, but with the ideas their story illustrates. This is a great book and I would, and do, recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut displays, once again, his amazing abiltity to interweave various elements into a captivating read for people of all ages! I'm 16 and have read only a small number of Vonnegut novels, and I appreciate his work as much as people three times my age (sorry guys!!) That's the sign of truly great literature. I'm using Cat's Cradle as the basis for a paper that is supposed to pull together all my scholastic subjects under one unifying theme, as introduced in a book of my choice. Vonnegut makes this task easy, with his tying of a fictional religion, Bokononism, with the terrible catastrophe caused by science going too far with the creation of ice-nine, which eventually brings about the end of the world. Vonnegut delievers a serious message about the willingness of mankind to give up everything for lies. Through this fun to read book, he displays genius and complex philosophy. The levels of thought in Cat's Cradle are multi-layered -- you appreciate a comment on its satirical face value, then realiz"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! Foma of course, are lies\\" (177). This is the title page of \\"The Books of Bokonon\\" (177), the fictional and Nihilistic religion in Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. Vonnegut uses Bokononism as a device to communicate his social commentary on science, religion, and human stupidity. Although Cat's Cradle is a witty, black comedy based around the end of the world, it makes you think while you are laughing. This book is a beautifully written classic and is an essential read for any fan of Vonnegut's work.This novel starts out with the narrator, John, doing research for his book about \\"what important Americans had done on the day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima\\" (11). This leads John to the \\"father of the first atomic bomb\\" (14), Felix Hoenikker, and his very unusual family. He has a midget son named Newt and his other son, Franklin, is the assistant to the dictator of the island of San Lorenzo. San Lorenzo is the main setting of the story and is home to religious leader, Bokonon. While on the island, the old dictator dies and John becomes president. Before Felix died, he made a substance called ice-nine, which makes water freeze at room temperature, simply because he thought it was interesting. Ironically, combined with human stupidity this crystal of ice leads to the destruction of all life on the planet.Cat's Cradle is a cynical and pessimistic portrayal of humanity. Vonnegut owes this outlook to his harsh life. His mother committed suicide on mother's day in 1944; he was a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden; he watched his sister die of cancer; and he himself tried to commit suicide in 1984. His experiences in the war and his life have led him to become a pacifist and this moral vision shows through in Cat's Cradle.Underneath the humor in this novel, Vonnegut gives cutting social commentary. His thoughts about religion are demonstrated through Bokononism. Bokonon says, \\"she was a fool, and so am I, and so is anyone who thinks he sees what God is Doing\\" (13), showing Vonnegut's disapproval of organized religion and its interpretation of god. He also writes that when man asked God about the meaning of life, God replied, \\"'everything must have a purpose? Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this', and He went away\\" (177). Bokononism holds that the only meaning in life is to search for a purpose. Although this Bokononism is meant to parody religion, it brings up interesting existential questions about the meaninglessness of life.When this book was written, Vonnegut was commenting on the Cold War and the foolishness of man in building weapons that could destroy the world. In today's age of the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" and impending doom from terrorists, these themes and ideas are still applicable. He ironically has the \\"father of the atomic bomb\\" (14) creating a simple crystal of ice that eventually destroys the world. This warns against carelessness regarding life and the foolishness of building weapons capable of destroying humanity. Vonnegut makes a convincing argument for pacifism by making fun of the consequences of war and destruction.In Cat's Cradle, Kurt Vonnegut perfectly balances humor with thoughtfulness. This unique style and tone in his writing separates him from any other author and he gets his point across without preaching to the reader. This book is a masterpiece of literature and is Vonnegut's greatest work of art."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"[...]Vonnegut skewers science, religion, families, human foibles, ... and does it with such a pleasently twisted story. The concept of Ice 9 is itself such an amazing absurdity. I read this book in college in 1968. I've read it six more times since then. My teenage son and daughter have also read it. It is now a family tradition. I rate this book as my favorite piece of literature. Don't pass this book by."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut was trying to make a point with these words at the beginning of \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" but they're wrong. The events and characters may be foma, but the things that drive this book are all too real.\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is the story of John or Jonah and his attempt to write a book about the events of August 6th, 1945, the day of the first dropping of the atomic bomb. His efforts begin weaving his karass with those of the Hoenikker family, children of one of the prime scientists who worked on the bomb.Foma? Karass? These are Bokononist words. While this book is written by Vonnegut, the tale tells that it's been written by John, after the events of the book. He started his book as a Christian, but has since converted to Bokononism, developed by a man named Bokonon, a Buddha in his own right. Bokonon's religion is simple: Make lies, be happy. It is at the beginning of his book that it claims the entire text is foma, or lies.Vonnegut has created an excellent conflict within the politics of San Lorenzo, the island where Bokonon lives, and how it draws John in as a catalyst for events to come. While the end result is not his fault, it's interesting to see how he learns of things that will happen, and since the book is being written by him, he comments on his own thoughts and those of others in the past. This isn't very new, but often first-person narrative books make the character not know what's happened, even if they tell everything in the past tense, even so much as to know how long ago the events took place.Within \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and stretching into a few of his other works, Vonnegut has created an entirely new and original religion, one that professes openly that nothing about it is true except it's theme, which is exactly what is true about the novel.Little Newt Hoenikker represents the second best theme, the first having been the religious implications present. His traumatic obsession with the cat's cradle and the fact that he wonders why he can't see the cat, not as a six-year old, and not as an adult, shows that sometimes people are expected to see what they cannot see, and that it's ludicrous sometimes to expect anyone to see it.The most intriuging questions of all lie in what the character Mona says late in the book, after the climax; questions that are sure to have you yourself wondering about things in our world, in the real life posed by this book.Above all, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is an interesting book that will keep you reading. I originally heard of it through the movie \\"The Recruit,\\" where Ice-nine was used as a code for a computer virus. Ice-nine is something very different here, and its effects are monumental, even when simply discussed hypothetically earlier in the book.While many Vonnegut books are primarily for those who enjoy Vonnegut's dark humor and style, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a novel that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone old enough to read it. It is anything but foma."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle may be Kurt Vonnegut's best book, and John -- the main character who is not mentioned by name beyond the first page of the book -- may be a bit like Vonnegut himself, a man swept up by events, an involuntary protagonist.Vonnegut's characters, as always, are eclectic, unusual and extremely funny. The general subject matter is at once irreverent and relevant to the world we are in today, and the insight into human nature is timeless.Without giving away the story, the end of the book is biblical, one way or another. I see it as apocalyptic, which is an easy interpretation, but a friend sees similarities with the Great Flood, a cleansing event. Now I wonder if the first and last books of the Bible have more in common than I first thought. Thanks, Kurt, John, Ice-9.For those who don't know much about Vonnegut himself, the man never meant to become one of the leading writers of his generation. He was a short story writer in the 1940s and 1950s, when that was still a viable profession, and he turned to novels reluctantly. According to his biographies and interviews he's given, he saw himself as a simple story teller, a catalyst for readers to live in a different reality for a few pages, to chuckle a little on the bus home. But his longevity, the importance of the then-contemporary issues he has written about and the impact he had on generations of young people (who later became middle aged and then old people while remaining influenced by the writer from Indianapolis) have solidified Vonnegut's place in the American literary canon, and Cat's Cradle is the best example of his work.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Don't read this review; it is foma. Absorbing. Do read the book. This review was a lie."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Using his trademark gruff, farcical voice, Vonnegut has written another brilliant novel proclaiming disdain for war, nations, horror, science, religion and all the other absurdities of mankind. Cat's Cradle is a clever, humorous Cold War satire involving an obscure Caribbean island, a religious philosopher named Bokonon, and an apocalyptic substance called \\"ice nine.\\"I especially enjoyed tidbits of Bokonist philosophy sprinkled throughout the book. For example, the Bokonist term, karass, refers to the teams that all of humanity is unknowingly organized into to do God's will. People in the same karass participate to help each other achieve cosmic goals-all perfectly unwittingly. And there's granfalloons, which are false karasses created by people themselves, and which are meaningless. Examples of granfalloons are, according to Vonnegut, \\"the Communist Party, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company, the International Order of Oddfellows-and any nation, anytime, anywhere.\\"While the narrative is broken up into staccato chapters containing references to future events, the book mainly follows a standard timeline-basically, from beginning to end-unlike his most sophisticated and emotionally charged book, Slaughterhouse Five. Nevertheless, while not on a par with Slaughterhouse Five, Cat's Cradle is an enjoyable romp into Vonnegut's colorful imagination and worth a read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Now I will destroy the whole world.\\"- What Bokonists say when they commit suicide, Cat's Cradle, Chapter 106You'd think a story about the end of the world - not just the world of one person, or human civilization, but all life on the planet - would be a grim affair, but Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is replete with wit, wry humour, and a touching compassion for human frailty.Vonnegut's book is no bright dystopia, like the one portrayed in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, nor is it as unrelentingly dark as George Orwell's 1984. It's our world that Vonnegut so amusingly satirizes, a world in which human beings are awfully good at creating doomsday devices (atomic bombs, religions), and lying to themselves.Many have said this is a story about the insanity of the Cold War, but I think it's a short history of human stupidity. And it is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in 1963. The plot follows a narrator who is writing a book about one of the creators of the atomic bomb and in the process discovers the scientist has also made Ice-9, a substance with the potential to turn all water into solid ice. Why invent such a dangerous thing? Come on, science can't be held back by such existential worries - it's progress, baby.Our world is beset with climate change caused by our technologies. As a species, we're on the cusp of massive changes that could exceed the pace of evolution - whether from genetic engineering or through fusing our biology with information technology - and this is precisely the kind of book that everyone needs to read.We need to think about what we are doing with our scientific power, not just proceed blindly.Cat's Cradle is the book that helped me find a way I could be a writer: it's literary, but it plays with science fictional tropes; it's funny, but there's a point to it all. In it he invents a religion, Bokonism, that is both humane and ironic, and that puts the lie to all other human religions. He spoofs geopolitics as easily as he skewers human egocentrism. And he does it all with humour and prose that's accessible and well crafted. It's deceptively simple, in fact. You can't help but be moved, and then you think, \\"How did he do that?\\"The short chapters are perfect for today's attention-deficit-disordered readers (at least, until we have our concentration chips implanted), so it works as a book that everyone at university could read.Not to mention all the great ideas (foma: a harmless untruth) and kickass existential \\"Calypso\\" lyrics from the Book of Bokonon:Tiger got to hunt,Bird got to fly;Man got to wonder, \\"Why, why, why?\\"Tiger got to sleep,Bird got to land;Man got to tell himself, he understand."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"When I got my Kindle I quickly decided that a Vonnegut novel would be the first thing I read, like christening a new ship. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a superb book, and it remains one of my favorites even 30 years after I first read it. This digital edition, however, needs some heavy proofing by a copy editor. In most-- if not all!-- instances, trailing double quote marks do not immediately follow the final letter or punctuation mark. Instead, they are shifted one space to the right and appear before the first letter of the next word. This frequently gives the appearance of a new character speech, when the author intends only narrative. This is compounded by the author's own use of the word 'Papa' in double quotes. The problem is not a deal killer, but it causes the reader to back up and re-read many sentences to get them back into the proper context, thus yanking the reader frequently out of the story being spun.5-star book brought back one star due to a bad digital conversion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"cat's cradle, like all of vonnegut's books is a rather odd little piece of work. it's bitingly cynical, deeply depressing, and yet seems to convey a fragile sort of hope all at once.this book was written as a critique of what mr. vonnegut referred to as unethical scientists, people so concerned with what they might possibly be able to do that they don't stop and think what the consequences of their actions might be. it's rather effective at this in my opinion, creating a scenario that is silly and terrifying all at once.it's a harsh book, and some people will find that the almost fluffy humor grates with the dark premise and sometimes nasty characters. some people will love it deeply as it showcases vonnegut's ability to hate what humanity is and yet care what becomes of it at the same time.even if it turns out to not be your thing it's probably worth the read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is basically a unique and creative look at the end of the world. To me, Vonnegut is arguing that the dizzying progress of science and technology in the last century has made the total destruction of life on earth a frightening possibility, and it's not just the \\"bad guys\\" who threaten humanity with annihilation: an equal threat comes from the well-intentioned but short-sighted, from the lonely or downtrodden, from the greatest superpower to the tiniest and poorest island nation.In other words, truly destructive technologies, once they exist, become a danger to the entire world regardless of the \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" reasons for which they were created, and regardless of whether they fall into the hands of the \\"good guys\\" or the \\"bad guys.\\" Vonnegut seems to be saying that scientific advancements cannot exist in a moral vacuum, that scientists should take responsibility for what they're creating. The need for extreme care in creating such destructive technologies is made all the more pressing because, according to Vonnegut, we as human beings are addicted to classifying ourselves into nations and religions and political parties, and then killing and dying for these classifications.Perhaps this is the importance of Vonnegut's invention of Bokononism, the religion of the island nation of San Lorenzo: if Bokonoism offers one real truth to its followers, it's that the entire religion is made up, a \\"shameless lie.\\" The result is that, instead of striving to live Bokononism as the only possible truth, Bokononists are easy going; they realize from the start that Bokononism itself is just another example of the uniquely Bokononist notion of \\"foma,\\" i.e., \\"harmless untruths that make you brave and happy and kind.\\" If that's the case, there's no reason to kill others who disagree with you; instead you can focus on what really matters, which for Vonnegut seems to mean creating satisfying connections with other people.Cat's Cradle, then, is not only Vonnegut's plea for responsibility in the development of technology, but, perhaps even more fundamentally, it's the story of how we ought to simply learn to get along with each other. Luckily, it also happens to be a wildly funny, perfectly crafted piece of fiction. Great book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This early classic was one of the books that made Vonnegut famous, and probably the first book where he really found successfully his particular style of black comedy. (He aimed for something similar in Sirens of Titan, but that book, with some fine moments, is uneven and significantly less successful.)The first persom narrator is known only as Jonah, although his first sentence is the allusive, \\"Call me Ishmael.\\" He is writing a book about the atomic bomb that leads him to research on the late Dr Felix Hoenneker, a brilliant scientist who viewed science with pure curiosity. Never caring about the practical implications of his work, Hoenneker made no distinction between working on the atom bomb and investigating how turtles retract their heads.Seeking to learn more about Hoenneker from his surviving children, Jonah follows them to the impoverished island nation of San Lorenzo, loosely based on Haiti. There he is introduced to Bokononism, the dominant religion of the island which, among its many unusual features, openly proclaims that it is a fraud. A good part of this rather short novel is a detailed discussion of Bokononism, which is one of Vonnegut's most memorable creations.While on the island, Jonah also learns more about ice 9, the final project that Hoenneker worked on. Ice 9 is ice with an entirely different crystalline structure from regular ice, which has the trait of freezing at normal temperatures. Thus, if you mixed ice 9 with any body of water, it would promptly freeze. Jonah soon finds reasons to doubt his assumption that ice 9 could not really exist.Jonah's adventures come to a grim if strangely appropriate finale - I don't think Vonnegut has ever written a novel with a happy ending. The moral of the story is, it seems, that life is entirely without meaning or purpose. And yet, the humor and vitality of the novel give it an energy and even joy strangely at contrast with its depressing message."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"was saddened to hear last year of the death of Kurt Vonnegut.

He managed to cover some of the most important philosophical, religious, psychosocial and ethical questions of the times.Can science and religion coexist peacefully? Can most people accept reality or do they prefer to live with their delusions? Is there any point in reading history, let alone writing it, if humanity's track record is such that we appear to be doomed to infinitely repeat our own mistakes?Vonnegut covers these tough issues and more in an entertaining and ironically humorous fashion. Although the book was published in 1963, his preoccupation with substances that could obliterate the species is every bit as relevant today as it was then, if not more so, and his characters are quirky yet believable.He spins a tale about a writer named Jonah (John to be exact)who becomes fascinated with the Hoenikker family: the children of a late scientist who co-discovered the first atomic bomb and an even more lethal substance called ice-nine, which could freeze all of the rivers and streams.Fortunately for us, Vonnegut's doomsday scenario has yet to play out. Perhaps it's just a matter of time but hopefully, people and nations are smarter than Vonnegut gave them credit for.Sigrid MacdonaldAuthor of D'Amour Road"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cats Cradle\\" tells of the story of a man simply setting out to write a book about the atomic bomb. From this simple objective, our hero finds himself thrown into a world of dwarfs, banana republics, Hoosiers, scientists, and one secret formula called Ice-9. The plot is a wild one, but the theme remains constant as Vonnegut pits science against religion in a no holds cage match. In the end, our hero barely survives both as Vonnegut seemingly thumbs his nose at the rest of the world.\\"Cats Cradle\\" reminds me of Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", both books speak in powerful ways to youthful angst and both tend to grow and develop with their audience. There's no protagonist like Holden Caulfield here (a youthful soul most readers related to strongly) but there are a number of characters that represent the worst society has to offer, characters we see each night on the news. The book starts with \\"Cradle's\\" protagonist, Jonah, coming up against a guarded and cynical scientist who in turn leads him to the three children of Doctor Felix Hoenikker, inventor of the nuclear bomb. Each of Hoenikker's kids, now grown, have some of their father's last experiment Ice-9, a chemical, which freezes all fluids on contact. A small amount could freeze the planet we learn, this while the Hoenikker siblings are running around the globe, each with their tiny thermos of Ice-9, the very future of the world in their incapable hands. The trail of the sibling's flows to San Lorenzo, a small island, that is responsible for the creation of Bokonism...a religion based on lies. It is here where Ice-9 and Bokonism go head to head and the results are devastating.Of course Vonnegut's true villain in all this is man and his incredible talent of making wondrous things, be it through God or test tubes, that are very good at destroying us."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut is one of those author's with such a ridiculous cult following that he never interested me.

What a great book!Cat's Cradle revolves around the concept of lies. One of the main features of the book is the tenets of Bokononism, a made-up religion that is admittedly based on lies. The name sake of the book, the Cat's Cradle, is a reflection of lies in society-- There's &quot;no damn cat, no damn cradle.&quot; Lies in conversation, lies in life: it's an ongoing commentary on it all.So it's about lies.

In that sense, I was disappointed with the book, since it turned out to have a mostly serious tone to it.Cat's Cradle, in my experience, is Vonnegut's most lauded novel, but I did not enjoy it as much as the other two I've read. It seemed like the story never moved--like every major plot point was just the precursor to something that never happened. It felt like just the opening chapters to a much longer novel.However, with all that said, it is very readable. Any fan of Vonnegut will love this book.

The story provides the platform for social commentaries by the various characters about religion, the futility of mankind, and war. There are plenty of colorful moments and humor, and the overall effect for me was one of strangeness. It provided some entertainment, but I could hardly take it very seriously. I read one other Vonnegut book, Mother Night, which was deep and riveting. This one could scarcely have been more different. Both books are easily identifiable as Vonnegut's.

He is extremely misleading in his simplistic, choppy, writing style that gives the opportunity for anybody and anybody who has a small amount of reading skill to pick this volume up and consume it. Though its simplicity is comforting the words spelled out in the metaphorical between-space of each line tells an entirely different tale.Vonnegut picks apart aspects of family and love, religion and war, science and government so well that this book is absolutely worthy of reading several times over. The most important aspect that he delves into is the concept of science. Is anyone else out there frightened of science and its ability to make new and 'better' technologies at such a phenomenal rate that eventually, inevitably, somebody is going to mess it up? Ice-nine, the scientific creation that seems like it would be a work of genius is, in fact, a work of stupidity that eventually leads to destruction and chaos. Science dooms as well as heals.

It's about the end of the world, and starts on the anniversary of the end of the world for the Japanese, the day the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.Our protagonist, Jonah, is writing a book about the end of the world. He ends up interviewing the offspring of the father of the atom bomb, Dr. Felix Hoenikker, an eccentric, seemingly uncaring father who, unbeknownst to most, also makes \\"Ice Nine\\" before he dies. Ice Nine causes everything to freeze. It precipates the end of the world.Before Ice Nine takes over, and freezes the world, Vonnegut takes us on a whirlwind tour of the hearts and minds of a slew of zany characters, from Newt the midget, son of The Father of The Atom Bomb, to a secretary who disdains anyone who \\"thinks too much,\\" to a philanthropist who turns out to be the complete opposite, to a zillion others (almost too many) in between. We are taken to the island of San Lorenzo, a Carribean banana republic run by a paranoind, eccentric dictator that is totally at the beck and call of the USA, and that is where things really get weird.This book is divided into 127 very short chapters, which makes it not only easier to read and remember, but also made it easier, I'm sure, for Mr. Vonnegut to write.One of the main points of this story, if I understand correctly, is that religion, in this case \\"Bokonism,\\" is pretty much a hodge-podge/hocus-pocus bed of spectacular lies. In the end, the founder of Bokonism, Bokonen, admits himself that it was all a complete joke, not to be taken sersiously (how can anyone take seriously a religion where people make love by rubbing their feet together?), but I won't spoil it by telling you what happens in between.Mad scientists and their nervous secretaries, midget kung-fu, foot sex, countless hungry, skinny, stupid natives, one beautiful, \\"healthy\\" native, fat businessmen here to save the world, steep jungles, waterfalls, underground bomb shelters, earthquakes, tornadoes, fire and brimstone (don't tell Vonnegut I said that), horse faced flute playing enfent terribles, and much, much more.

He meets the children of the maker of the atomic bomb, all of which possess a substance that could potentially destroy the world.This is my first time reading Kurt Vonnegut and it's an experience that I should havehad sooner. The book has a very satirical tone to it and is reminiscent to the works ofChuck Palahniuk and Christopher Moore. Vonnegut offers us a tongue in cheek view of religion, politics and the human condition in general. His style of writing is confusing at first but the reader can tell that it's intentional. There is mystery and an element of surprise. In the beginning I wondered what exactly the book was going to be about.The characters are round and well developed, all have their own unique quirks,and lack predictability. Even Mona with her nonchalant personality ends up surprising you. The main character (John or \\"Jonah\\") is delightfully inconsistent when it comes to his structures of belief and always keeps the reader guessing. Newt (who is a little person and the son of Felix Hoenikker, the creator of the atomic bomb) seems irritated and resentful at first but emerges later on in the novel as a dignified man with an amiable disposition. Julian Castle (a well-to-do member of the island of San Lorenzo) provides comic relief one moment and enrages you the next.The overall feeling that I got from this book is that it is a futile business to try to understand the meaning of life, why people behave the way they do, and why \\"evil\\" in the world continues to prevail."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is one of Kurt Vonnegut's less subtle satires, as he lays his views out there in a very obvious manner for all to see. One of the dominate themes of this text is that when science is weaponized it is always wrong, period. He also goes after his usual suspects: religion, God, and man's inhumanity to man.Stylistically \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is told in a much more linear format than most Vonnegut texts. In fact, it is told completely in chronological order which is a very unusual device for Vonnegut novels. It is also very funny, but in a very dry, dark humor sort of way. Many parts of the book also feel like a precursor to his \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\", which was published six years after this novel. There are some shared characters, and a shared setting, the city of Ilium, NY.\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is at its most biting when Vonnegut depicts the arrogance and selfishness of humanity. The callousness with which the characters (practically all of them) treat the world ending due to man's carelessness is truly frightening. How aloof man can be about his destructive powers. The massive irony of this text is that the world ends by accident! We don't set out to destroy it, we are just careless with our ability to do so, and when one is arrogant and careless...well you know what that can yield. There are no real villains in this piece, just sloppy and short sighted people. Vonnegut seems to be reserving his harshest judgment for the character of Frank Hoenikker. Frank resents that people were not nice to him when he was younger. Yet his treatment as a teenager does not engender sympathy in him, but rather bitterness, and does not lead him to be kind to others. To be that blind and unobservant about your own life is something that Vonnegut seems quite disgusted with in this text.Religion also gets its share of jabs in this book, but unlike many readers I don't see Vonnegut as knocking religious faith, as much as I see him saying that he understands why people need it, he just does not put much stock in it. Like most of Vonnegut's oeuvre, God plays a huge thematic role, and on page 225 of this text Vonnegut gives an interesting and keen observation of the role that God holds for many people. The question is also asked in the text, what is God up too? The answer given is apparently nothing, although Vonnegut does not go so far as to state this. He leaves the role of faith wide open for his readers.Vonnegut also plays with a theme that dominates many of his books, which is the idea of predestination. His invention of the religion of Bokononism is a lovely idea for a religion, although it does not hold up to intense scrutiny, unless you make a lot of allowances for it. And that is the point. Isn't all religion like that to a certain extent?The ending of this novel is nihilistic and hopeful all at once. I am not sure what I think of it, I am almost positive I don't agree philosophically with it, and I am absolutely sure it is the perfect ending for \\"Cat's Cradle\\". At its heart this is a book about how much stuff (most stuff) we don't really understand. A character occasionally asks \\"See the cat? See the cradle?\\" when there is nothing to see. There is nothing there, and thus the text's satirical question/ comment on religion and science, which both are in the explanation business. Page 183 in the book aptly brings this home for the reader. Making sense of the world is what science attempts, and in the arena where it matters most it has failed. What next? \\"Cat's Cradle\\" dares to ask this question."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is the type of book that I personally love.

It's founder is one of the main characters within Cat's Cradle and never makes a real appearance until the last page and only then to deliver a message to &quot;Jonah&quot;.Vonnegut risked getting out of control in this novel, but somehow he's able to balance everthing, keep the reader involved and make a statement. Unlike other &quot;hip&quot; novels of the '60s, Cat's Cradle holds up well in our decade."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a FANTASTIC read!... A heartbreakingly dramatic yet hilariously funny satire on the simple ... ideas of scientists. It's just as good as Slaughterhouse-five, if not better! Jonah, the protagonist, and every other character in the book is not only memorable but realistic. And you actually feel for them. Bokonon is a brilliant religion! It seriously makes you stop and think about the world around you. Believe me, at the end of Cat's Cradle you'll be begging for more!!! It's probably my favourite book. And I guarantee you'll love it!!!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I thought Vonnegut was good when I read Slaughterhouse Five, but then I picked up Cat's Cradle. I won't ruin any of the story for you by telling you what happens, but it is, like Vonnegut's other books I have read, funny, but at the same time makes you think. Keep an open mind when you read it, that would be my only advice other than read it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Perhaps Vonnegut's masterwork...although many would argue for Slaughterhouse. This appears to be the start of Kurt's insane phase which seems to span from Cat's Cradle all the way until Galapagos, give or take. Where this books tops many of his 'insane era' novels is it is more a mesh of his early, 'money-making' novels where he tried to follow more traditional writing guidelines (i.e. Mother Night, Player Piano). Again, many will disagree, but due to Cat's Cradle combining Vonnegut's insanity and early Orwellian/Huxlian style this book is ultimate read to truly taste Kurt's entire pallate (of course, ignoring the later 'Bitter, Old Man' phase [Bluebeard, Timequake]).For those looking to sample the taste of a brilliant, raving lunatic, which is Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is the true paterfamilias, not Slaughterhouse."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"As a high school reader I missed the Vonnegut craze. But, on one Saturday with nothing to do my father suggested that I read this. I can say that a few hours later it is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. It my not be the best structured book, but I really enjoyed it thoroughly. It is written so the main character, Jonah, has already gone through this. This makes it helpful to the reader to explain some of the plot before you get there. Anyway, Jonah is writing a book about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on a Japan. As we go though his research he see Vonnegut insights into the institutions like science, religion, and many others. This is a book that really is going to make you think about ideals that you hold deal. I can't wait to read other books by Vonngut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Dude, this novel rocks! Awesome in its complexity and scope! The world will end, not with a bang, but a whimper of despair so silent it deafens the soul."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"My favorite quote from Cat's Cradle by Jonah, our somewhat humble Hoosier narrator. It is just one among many quotes that you will be itching to write down while reading Vonnegut's blackly fatalistic, yet humorous take on the madness of humanity. After having read other dystopian, apocalyptic masterpieces such as Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984, Cat's Cradle was a break from the monotony that not only makes you laugh, but also makes you think."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Initially I was somewhat put-off by the first few pages of the book. I didn't feel like familiarizing myself with this invented religion (Bokononism) and it's respective jargon, so I put down the book and didn't pick it up for several months. But I decided to give the book a chance again and I came up w/ the following:This work goes at a good pace, in the few places where the novel may start to dull, Vonnegut picks things up again. You can say that it's a roller-coaster of a book, you have no idea where the book can go. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" involves Jonah, who decides to write a biography about Dr. Felix Hoenikker, who invented the atomic bomb. Yet, his search really starts to takes off when he acquires information and contacts w/ the former scientist's children. From there, the storyline is like letting to of an inflated balloon --> from the lab to Newt on the plane to San Lorenzo to lust to presidency to ice-nine @ work, and more! I'd find myself returning from a 10-hour workshift and I could still read this book for hours. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a good one, it'll make your head spin, you'll find yourself begging for more."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"excellent characters and plot line. good discussion on problems in world, but in humorous way. vonnegut is a genius and a funny one at that."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've read many of Kurt Vonneguts books. I consider him to be my favorite writer and it is through this work that I was first introduced to American Pop writing. To me, then it was a very special little book. That's why it makes me a little sad when I reflect over it now a few years later and realise that its not really as fantastic as I once thought. Vonnegut betrays his science fiction background in a book that sprawls out of control. In places Cat's cradle reverts to a 'then this happened, then this as well' style that is immature and unappealing to the reader. This book does have its moments. An excellent introductary correspondence with the son of Dr Hoenikker, the invention of Bokononism; a religion based purely on untruths, which serve to show the creativity which Vonnegut is capable of anyone considering reading this might do better to read 'Slapstick(or lonesome no more)' which to my mind is a far superior book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is the first Vonnegut I have ever read and it is defintely one of the best books I have ever read as well. I picked this up not ten minutes after reading Old man and the Sea by Hemingway and finished it in five hours. Literally could not put it down and would reccomend it to anyone who can read and comprehend. It is wonderfully thought provoking and lighthearted, but at the same time apocalyptically dark. Wonderful for no matter what kind of books you like to read."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cats Cradle has become one of my all-time favorites. I recommend it to everyone becuase I rarely like sci-fi-ish or war/ military related books but this was able to keep me interested. Vonnegut has a thought provoking writing style."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. Kurt Vonnegut is a master of literature...his books are so well put together, that it's hard for me to imagine how someone could actually write like him. Cat's cradle is an amazing adventure through lust, love, adventure and peace. It will change your life...It changed mine for sure!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This novel was truly enjoyable to me. It was fast paced, and it kept me reading. I just couldn't put it down! Vonnegut comically satirizes religion and politics in this novel, with an interesting story and a twisted but truthful ending."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It's not Breakfast of Champions. It's not Slaughterhouse-Five. It doesn't have to be."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Among Vonneguts best, Cat's Cradle is a skewed (and skewered) look at religion, faith, government, and mankinds need to *believe*. Both playfull and cynical, the book is never beating you over the head with it's message (i.e., Ayn Rand), but instead presents it to you in an obvious yet subtle fashion. (Onvious yet subtle? You figure that out)One of Vonneguts most loved, and for good reason. Recomended for both Vonnegut fans, and those looking to find out what the stink is all about."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've never read a Vonnegut book until Cat's Cradle. I had only seen the horrible film version of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. I knew that the book couldn't have been as bad as the movie. I went to the bookstore to find it, but they didn't have it. I then saw CAT'S CRADLE, and thought it would be a sufficent substitute. I'm glad i picked it up. It's a funny satire regarding the end of the world and the family of the man who invented the nuclear bomb. Vonnegut does a very good job at creating and maintaining brilliant characters and situations. I hope to soon pick up another Vonnegut book, and I have no doubt that I will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was the first KV book that I read. I stumbled across it in 1968 and it cued a ravenous appetite for anything Vonnegut. I instantly identified with the book's quirky outlook on the nature of life and love on another eschelon. My absolute favorite book. In the early 70's my CB handle was &quot;Ice 9&quot;, and today it is my Internet identification! So read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is the first Vonnegut I have read in six years and I was totally captivated through the whole book. This book is great for the person who colors outside the lines. Not for your average normal person."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vintage Vonnegut in that this is his most cynical book.The book is organized into about 120 chapters, each not much more than a page or two long, so the effect is like being shot by a fully automatic machine gun. With all the crazy ideas packed into such little space, this also surely makes it Vonnegut's densest book.How often can an author invent a religion, a country, and a doomsday weapon all in one book? And he also manages to criticize the use of science without considering the consequences, the lies that parents tell their children, and the futility of most religions. Then he wraps it all up quite conveniently by ending the world.In my opinion, this is his second best book, a more bizarre and warped version of an anti-war story than Slaughterhouse-Five was, with a twinge of his earlier science-fiction wrapped in.I wouldn't call it depressing...at least as end-of-the-world novels go. This isn't a warning about how dangerous our pursuit of war is, but rather how absurd it is. Vonnegut doesn't end the world and expect his readers to shed a tear. He'd rather you shake your head in bewilderment, shrug your shoulders, and give a little laugh. After all, like the cat and the cradle...its all an illusion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I was listening to a friend of mine talk with our Language teacher one day about Kurt Vonnegut. From all I heard before, he was a sick, psychopath who couldn't write. On advice from my friend and teacher, I went out and bought Cat's Cradle. This book was terrific! It's Absolut Vonnegut! 120-Proof, people! My only criticism is it was too short! When reading it the first time, I kept imagining that it would be terrible, but by the end I thought it was just what I needed to get over a terrible book I had just read for school, The Egypt Game. There is NO reason NOT to buy this masterpice of modern literature! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"'Cat's Cradle' may be the most Vonnegut book he has ever written. A typical page-turner that moves you along with the mix of science, religion and revolution delivered in his sly fashion. I hit my Vonnegut jag as a high school senior, devouring one after the other in a 2-month period. I went through that with Jerzy Kosinski, too, an author I would recommend to any Vonnegut fan. As with all of the Vonnegut books I rate a '9,' the weak link was the ending. Not as good as the rest of the book. The Vonnegut books that rate a '10' are 'Sirens of Titan' and 'God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater.' Those are books that after I finished, I went back and read the last chapters again -- that good. 'Cat's Cradle' is great, but not penultimate Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut uses his novels to explore human nature: in this wonderful book he examines religion, human nature, and the morality of science. Read it as you will, but please look into the web that holds this work together. Reading the surface is a good tale, but pointless. Reading into the novel the true exploration of religion comes out. He calls it a joke, yet points it out as being good. Read between the lines and the true magic of this typical Vonnegut piece comes out."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"One of his best. Cat's Cradle seems rather simple to the eyes, but is a visionary masterpiece to the mind. In the beginning Vonegut informs the reader that what he is about to tell you is a bunch of lies, and what ingenious lies they are. A true eye opener."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut understands the link between science and religion as being the search for truth. In our desire as humans to superimpose order on our lives, we work to uncover the secrets of the universe. The real secret, however, is that the pursuit of truth it futile. In addition to being unknowable, the truth is, ultimately, irrelevant. Let's not destroy the world trying to find it. Vonnegut understands just enough chemistry to be dangerous. Even though the book's ending is a little weak, the journey is immensely enjoyable. For those who truly understand the message, this is Vonnegut's most coherent and most clever work."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is a great introduction to the world and style of Kurt Vonnegut. It was the first book of his I read and certaintly not the last. His witty style and comic ideas make this a must-read for anyone who likes humor and science-fiction. While it may not be his best work, it definitely deserves attention and merit for being so humorous and yet having such a deep, underlying purpose. It is essential, pure, unadultered Vonnegut!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"i just finished cat's cradle last night. although i amonly 16 yrs old i believe that i could capture all the brilliance of this work as any other adult. i believe that cat's cradle is exponentially better that some ofhis other works like s-house 5 or deadeye dick. vonnegut may leave some of his humor aside, but replacesit with a handful of more irony and morality. i thinkthat the book was written primarily by vonnegut to question the morality of science and religion. he makesa mockery of both with bokonism and ice-9. i'm writingmy junior research paper on it tonight, and am extremelyhappy this was my choice because vonnegut's writing isextremely didactic as it preaches us the harms of ourown sacred social institutions."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut leaves the United States to see what the world really looks like. And San Lorenzo is our own world-in-a-bottle. Leaders prosecuting religion, but are themselves believers, a prophet whose name and message are misunderstood, a scientist working without regard to the outcome of his work. The people are ignorantly content with their lot, nobody wants to rule, and it is not technology that makes people happy, but basic physical contact. Vonnegut leads us into this miniverse of men, and through his eyes we appreciate the folly of being, the indifference of science, religion and man himself to the fate of the world. We become uncaring Bokononists, happy with the optimistic lies we daily tell ourselves. The destruction of this world is, of course, in a whisper, not in a bang. And even then nothing really changes, does it? Anyone for Foma?"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I really liked the beginning of this book and the setup. I thought Vonnegut did a great job of enticing the reader and in creating an atmosphere of mystique around what the main character was doing and researching to hook the reader. I thought it devolved in to an over the top story at the end, but I did enjoy it. I don't know if that's typical for Vonnegut or not to compare to other novels of his."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A classic example of Vonnegut's views of human morality and nature in the face of determinism, Cat's Cradle entices you with a beautiful combination of science fiction and philosophical exploration."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle was one of the first novels I read of Kurt Vonnegut, back in an era where his books were sold as paperbacks with distinctly bright colored covers and a signature logo of title and author, when the author still tacked on \`Jr.' to his name. Vonnegut was adopted by a generation of people his children's age and always seemed hipper and cooler than most others of his generation. He was one of the generation that lived through the Great Depression to fight in World War II and lived to tell the tale, only his tale was not full of gratitude and patriotism. He was one of the \`greatest generation' to actually have the audacity to question whether they really were the greatest generation.That skeptic questioning of authority made him ripe fodder for admiration from the counterculture of the sixties and seventies. Even at the age of nineteen I felt ambivalent about jumping on the bandwagon to read and \`follow' him. Nevertheless, after seeing the bizarre and impressive movie of Slaughterhouse-Five I read that and, at the urging of my best friend, followed it up with Cat's Cradle. In short, it was unlike anything I'd ever read and I wasn't sure how to react to it.After two subsequent readings and at least one reading of all of his other novels and almost forty more years of living under my belt I can more fully appreciate the artistry of this wild novel. In a sense, it is the book that established the template upon which the typical \`Kurt Vonnegut' novel was based. It contains almost all of the standard elements of his fiction. From the opening line \`Call me Jonah' to the final cosmic nose-thumbing it is what they called in the sixties a \`put on.' It takes disaster for its subject matter, in this case the dropping of the atom bomb and the echoes of all potential future doomsday scenarios and laughs at it with a wry, fatalistic serenity. The narrator could have just as easily have concluded with the repeated refrain from Slaughterhouse-Five, \`and so it goes.'Not only does the novel offer a convoluted convergence of fates and paths leading to a doomsday scenario, he filters it through a fictional religious philosophy, Bokononism. The novel introduces us to an entire collection of terms and concepts such as foma, wampeters, granfalloons, karasses and many others. A karass, for example, is a group of people who, often unknowingly, are working together to do God's will. A wampeter is the central theme or purpose of a karass.The novel also includes the fascinating concept of ice-nine. Vonnegut heard about it while working at General Electric. Irving Langmuir, at one time a public relations officer for GE, entertaining visiting author H.G. Wells, told him about the idea. Wells was not impressed enough to include it in a story or a novel so what Wells neglected to use, Vonnegut considered fair game and it becomes the wampeter of Jonah's karass and, by extension, the enforcer of the zah-mah-ki-bo, or inevitable destiny, of mankind, an element that trumps the atom bomb for destruction.A summary of the plot of the novel would be pointless and almost nonsensical without explanations of at least some of these concepts. Suffice it to say, it is a doomsday tale in which a group of individuals, some involved in the same karass and some adhering to one of many granfalloons, are intertwined by various wampeters into a common zah-mah-ki-bo. If that last sentence struck you as gibberish Bokonon would agree and concede that it was one of many foma, harmless untruths.The geographical destination is the island of San Lorenzo, a small island nation located in the Caribbean, on which a structure of \`dynamic tension' was imposed between a fictional religion and a fictional dictatorship by two survivors of a sunken ship, a Marine deserter and an African rover. Lionel Johnson, the African, becomes Bokonon and founds a religion outlawed by the dictatorship by his fellow survivor, Earl McCabe, by mutual agreement. Religions and nations are granfalloons that are dispensers of foma.This novel even includes a practice similar to Heinlein's grokking from Stranger in a Strange Land, published a couple of years earlier--boko-maru, the Bokononist ritual for a merging of souls, enacted by two participants pressing the soles of their feet together and kneading them. Practices such as this may strike modern readers as elements from a quaint artifact of an earlier, more nave time. One must remember, however, that this was an era in which science fiction writers really did create their own religions i.e. L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology. Novelists such as Heinlein and Vonnegut were quoted as modern prophets by people young enough to be their children. Vonnegut possesses the talent of the entertaining satirist and dilutes his sobering revelations with large doses of sardonic humor. Cat's Cradle, like many of his best novels, is not only deceptively easy to read but possesses prescience that casts a shadow on a contemporary society that many in the sixties would have viewed with skepticism and horror. For that, along with many other reasons, it transcends its status as \`relic of the sixties.'"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is obvious since any religion that calls all religions lies, including itself, is probably the correct on to belong to.I'm surprised it took me this long to finally read it.

If you have ever questioned how society is impacted by science and religion, you must read this book. I have loaned my copy of the book to numerous friends, and every person has gotten something different out of the book. Every time I read it, a different aspect of Vonnegut's social commentary becomes apparent to me. Unlike many other books by Vonnegut, you do not have to read any of his other books to understand the plot"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This book makes the reader ponder just what technology is doing to the human condition. Vonnegut makes us think about the &quot;clear and present&quot; dangers of nuclear weapons but also about the fictious danger of &quot;Ice-9.&quot;Ice-9 is a substance which can make water freeze at room temperature. It is thus the most fretful creation ever. It seems funny that Vonnegut has both the nuclear bomb and the Ice-9 created by the same scientist. It'seven funnier that this scientist doesn't appear to have realized what he was doing. (If this interests you, you might want to read the real life testements of Richard Feynman in &quot;Surely you must be joking, Mr. Feynman.&quot;)One of the most amazing parts of &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is the philosphy which is intermingled with the technology. Vonnegut creates a character named Bokonon who has an illegal religion which everyone practices. The main characterof the book slowly converts to this hopeless religion which somehow accurately portrays how life occurs for our present society. Like I said in my one line summary, every high school student should read this book. It mighthelp future generations to see the interconnection of people and the consequences of excessive technology."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is a wake-up call for those who think technologywill solve the world's problems.

The adventure Jonah, the main character, goes through in the story is hilarious and entertaining. Jonah wants to find information for a book he intends to write about the day the Americans dropped the atomic bomb on Japan when he comes across a doomsday device called ice-nine. This sends him on a rather unique journey to rather unique places. Jonah discovers a new religion, Bokononism, that is supposed to be outrageous but seems to make perfect sense. As it happened, or as Bokonon would say it, \\"As it was supposed to happen\\", Jonah journeyed to an island called San Lorenzo, of which he becomes president. I cannot explain the entire plot of the book, but you wouldn't want me to anyway, would you?Among the many characters in Cat's Cradle are the Hoenikkers. First there's Felix Hoenikker, the father of the A-bomb. Jonah wants to research him for his book when he met his children. Newton Hoenikker is the midget-son of Felix who Jonah befriends. Frank Hoenikker is mysterious; he has not been seen for awhile. Angela Hoenikker, the only woman in the family, was like a mother to the boys. She did not have much of a life of her own. The three Hoenikkers have the world's supply of the doomsday device, ice-nine. All Jonah wants is to get his hands on it. What role will ice-nine play in the book? That one you will have to find out for yourself. If you read this book, you will enjoy it for sure.Other books I reccommend are Slaughterhouse-Five by Vonnegut and 1984 by George Orwell.

I'm scrounging around at Amazon now looking for other books from the man.Cat's Cradle is not funny, not to me. It's scary and repulsive, it's deep and it's incredibly poetic. Good poetry is only as long as it needs to be; it crams as much sense and meaning into as few words as possible; it's ambiguous/open to interpretation, and it's timeless. This book does all that stuff. I hope all of K.V.'s books are as good.The plot is actually quite simple, and also irrelevant. I think V. could have said what he wanted to say 100 different ways and all of them would have had the same effect.In the hands of a lesser writer, it could have become a top mystery/thriller, perfect, really perfect, material for a bestseller, to be made into a Summer Action Blockbuster. But the man chose substance over sales, social commentary over salary, which I supose is his MO, and we all profit therefrom.With the U.S. in dire need of a smack in the public face from a big mirror, Cat's Cradle is as relevant today as it was yesterday."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is one of my five favorite books ever. I keep trying to find something else from Vonnegut that exudes the same energy and necessity of that book. Cat's Cradle didn't do it for me. At the end of the day, the novel felt naked and didactic, like an excuse to shout a world-view. It felt self-indulgent to me.There are a few areas in which a novel can excel in order to spark interest: plot, character, setting, and language/style. The Greatest Novel of All Time probably excels at all of those -- but I don't think that novel's been written yet. If a writer can nail two or three, it's probably worth reading. Heck, if you completely kill on one of those four, the novel will probably do well. For me, Cat's Cradle doesn't excel at any of the above.The plot is thin -- and given that it's intended as comedy, that's to be expected. Still, there's no point at which the main character faces a Problem, battles with Complications, and then either succeeds or fails. Instead, the book's tension is based on withholding a mystery from the reader -- what's the deal with the ice and why does the author keep hinting at how important it is? It's not a very gripping source of tension and, from the standpoint of plot alone, there's no reason not to turn to the last ten pages of the book and see how it turns out. I don't feel like I would've missed out on key plot points by doing so.Characters in this novel are thin and two-dimensional (if that). Again, this is meant to be a comedy, or a parable maybe, so stock characters may be called for. But by not having any actual depth or texture in the characters, character does not provide a reason to care about the novel. The characters come off as so subservient to the Message and are so devoid of reality, that their idiosyncrasies feel arbitrary and manipulative rather than interesting.I'm guessing Cat's Cradle defenders would argue this point with me, but I found that the novel's setting was practically non-existent. At least, I didn't come away from the book feeling like I Was There. The eventual San Lorenzo is sparsely described and, as with the characters, seems entirely subservient to the Message. I don't feel like I get the sense of another actual place -- it felt like it was all happening on a sound stage. To a certain extent, the same could probably be said for Slaughterhouse Five -- except that with Slaughterhouse Five, well, first off there was, in fact, more attention to setting details, but also SH5 builds a landscape out of the minds of its author and protagonist. In Cat's Cradle, we get so little from the narrator in terms of his way of thinking, this doesn't happen. Maybe it should have.Finally the writing and style of the novel -- well, it's the trademark Kurt Vonnegut style, except that he did it better elsewhere. There are no coy self-references like occurred in SH5, no cunning self-deprecation, no fierceness of joy in the absurdity of language and the novel format. It's just sort of jaunty and tossed-off and having read SH5 previously, the writing in CC felt like a weak and unremarkable shadow of what Vonnegut eventually accomplished.As a result, I come away from Cat's Cradle feeling like I'd just read a thinly masked agenda story. And unless you already cling (heh) *religiously* to its message, there's not much fun to be had. In terms of communicative efficiency, it would've been more profound for Vonnegut to have simply written the sentence \\"People believe in and do stupid things, which is especially problematic when they have access to nuclear arsenals.\\" I didn't find anything in the novel that conveyed any other idea of any significance. And frankly, that message itself seems pretty dull in the modern world, especially without a fresher lens through which to view it.All that said, while I didn't enjoy the book overall, I appreciated its brevity (that's not meant entirely back-handedly -- short novels rarely overstay their welcomes). Also, it's a very easy read, and there's a lot to be said for a writing style that allows for that. Unfortunately, I didn't find enough else in this one to make me care.(PS, I've read some of the negative reviews of the book that knock it for being cynical and pessimistic. Er -- it's *Kurt Vonnegut*, it's *supposed* to be cynical and pessimistic. Cynicism in a novel can be done very well and its presence doesn't degrade the work any more than optimism necessarily would.)"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is by far one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Vonnegut brings this fictional story to life with great detail at every turn. From the creation of ice nine to Bokonism, Vonnegut weaves a complex but entirely believable story. The novel begins with the main character John who is writing a book on the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima called The Day the World Ended. His writing this book leads him to his destiny as he travels to the laboratory where the bomb was created and then to San Lorenzo where he becomes president. San Lorenzo's founder, Bokonon, created a religion for the people. This is an average idea except for the fact that Bokonism seems uncannily real, with it's own terms and practices all created by Vonnegut. This novel is a masterpiece.Cat's Cradle is fast passed, deeply detailed, and very interesting. The novel is very ironic and a must read for everyone. Kurt Vonnegut weaves a great story that never lets you down. Through its outlandish turns and twists Vonnegut makes it seem so very real. This novel is definitely a 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is one of the funniest, thought-provoking books I have ever read--funny from the first line, thought-provoking weeks after reading it. Vonnegut is very deceptive in his writing. Just when you think you know what's going on, he turns the story in a completely new direction. I was kept off-balance throughout the entire book.The book puts you in a strange quandry: you want others to read the book, but as you read it you want to share outloud almost every scene. It would be easy for me to post here my many favorite lines, memorable moments, and insights drawn from this work. It would also ruin it for every one of you who have not yet read the book. I would not do that you should experience this story first hand.There is a stanza from a poem by Lucille Clifton that is strangely appropriate to &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; even though it deals with an entirely different subject matter. In this altered paraphrase of Clifton's words, Cat's Cradle &quot;is a political story is a war story is a universal story but it is not about these things this story is about one human heart this story is the story at the end of the world.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Lately I've been very much into postmodern novels, so I knew I would eventually come across Kurt Vonnegut's work. This is the first book I've read by him and I'm sure it won't be the last -- yet while I enjoyed CAT'S CRADLE and the laughter it brought me, I think it is far from perfect.The writing itself is simple and direct, yet sophisticated and well crafted. It reads very comfortably and is quite cheeky at times. The prose suits the nature of its narrator (first person) very well, a man who is sparse with his words and quick with his wit (which often goes unnoticed by the other oblivious characters).Speaking of characters: the ones in this book all have their own idiosyncratic quirkiness. They're as eccentric as they come, and some are just outright bizarre and absurd in a laugh-out-loud (but also head-scratching) way. None of them are particularly deep or interesting, but they're fun to watch.Now, the main thing that gets me about this book is the plot. It starts out modestly enough: our narrator explains that he once set out to write a book titled \\"The Day the World Ended,\\" but then he became a Bokononist (I'll leave the pleasure of finding out what that is to you). I'm not going give a synopsis of the whole plot, but suffice it to say that the protagonist stumbles through a series of unlikely events and lands himself on an island full of crazy people. As interesting as that sounds, I never really got the sense that anything was really happening. What events do happen never seem to have any real consequence. I never felt any suspense or shock -- only curiosity, confusion and suspicious awe. And then the story just ends. It cuts off without any real resolution, and I'm left thinking, \\"Huh. That's it?\\"I think that CAT'S CRADLE is carried mostly by its characters, its comedy and the interrelation between the two. I wouldn't call it a profound or impressive novel, but I don't think that's what it is trying to be. I think it's a quirky and fun novel that's a riot to read, but I can't help but feel let down by its conclusion (or lack thereof). Maybe there is a larger point that I'm missing; this book certainly has the potential to exist on many levels. However, as it stands, I can only give it three stars. Maybe I will reconsider when I inevitably reread this in a few months or years (I always end up rereading books I enjoy).Until then, CAT'S CRADLE is just okay in my opinion."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"At the opening of the book, the narrator describes a time when he was planning to write a book about what important Americans did on the day Hiroshima was bombed. While researching this topic, the narrator becomes involved with the children of Felix Hoenikker, a fictional Nobel laureate physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb.Vonnegut uses his wit and humor to demonstrate the absurdities of religion and makes many other useful social commentaries on the human race. The narrator describes his search for a mysterious substance called ice-9 that has mystical properties, and may have incredible benefit(or harm) to civilization, depending on how it used. It is hard to fully describe this book, as one isn't sure what it really is until the last page, but it is a book worth reading for fans of Vonnegut in any event.Relic113"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I'm an avid Vonnegut reader. Though I have not read all of his novels, I've read many- I would say roughly half, give or take one or two.As you may already know, the premise for the book is that the author is writing a book on the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. Felix Hoeniker. He ends up learning about a more devastating weapon (if you will call it), Ice-9. Ice-9 is by far more devastating because it freezes all water immediately upon touch, with the ability to freeze the world if ever exposed to great bodies of water.The book's main focus is on the ugly side of science- Developing new things that create more harm than good, without realizing the consequences. Another focus of the book is on religion's role in society and in persons' lives and how it affects both.Anyways, I do not wish to give too much away. To do so would 1) Spoil your read, and 2) Take up too much time.The book is a good read, though not among my favorite Vonnegut books. However, I attribute this to personal preference, rather than Cat's Cradle being an inferior book. Indeed, any Vonnegut book is heads and shoulders above much of the rest. Many people may disagree, but I did not find the many characters to be fleshed out very well in comparison to some of his other works (Bluebeard comes to mind). Also, comparatively speaking and consistent with my previous statement, I felt that the main characters didn't grow as much as I would've liked (but this is not to say that they didn't grow). Again, these are my opinions and I'm sure that some, if not many, would disagree.In conclusion, Cat's Cradle is a solid read with clever insight into religion and technology's affect on society, for both good and bad. If you're new to Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle isn't a bad start, though I would suggest Breakfast of Champions (arguably Vonnegut's most accessible book), Slaughter House Five (his most renowned), Welcome to the Monkey's House (not extra spectacular, but short stories are a good way to see if you like his style), or Sirens of Titan (his most underrated book and tied with another one of his as my favorite). If you're familiar with Vonnegut, then Cat's Cradle is a very reasonable book to pick up. Either way, there's a good chance there's something you'll keep with you when you finish Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"surprises galore. many strange characters fit together in unexpected ways. important concept as to how easily we can end the world."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Brilliant.

It is an utter shame that he died recently, but so it goes. In my opinion, this is his finest work. He satorically questions religion, war and the nature of man all in one hillarious masterpeice. He is the Mark Twain of the 1900's. I recomend EVERYONE read this novel."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut wrote a number of extremely good novels. Two of them are truly great. Cat's Cradle is one. (Slaughterhouse Five is the other)Cat's Cradle treads on some of the same ground as Orwell's 1984, but where Orwell delivers his message with a heavy hand, Vonnegut delivers his message with sardonic wit and sharp insight. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut directs his considerable wit and insight at the institutions of religion, politics, and science.Cat's Cradle is arguably Vonnegut's funniest and most imaginative novel, and also one of his most profound. It manages to be both absurd and frightening. If you haven't read anything by Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is a great place to start. This is an important book; one of the best novels ever written."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Okay, I would like to give it 5-stars! What was I thinking, I can't change it now?!?! A truly entertaining, and somewhat frightening book. I don't like to write long reviews, so I'll get right to it. If you enjoyed Slaughterhouse-Five, you'll most certainly enjoy this novel. Cat's Cradle is more accessible, and not as outrageous as Slaughterhouse (which I enjoyed a little more). What can be said about Vonnegut that hasn't already been said. He was ahead of his time in thumbing his nose at the \\"powers-that-be\\".

It contains a gripping tale about a protagonist that is stuck in a world that is almost certainly doomed to fail. Along the way there are many interesting thoughts expressed and funny moments."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The book, which is one of my all time favorites is not quite as amazing as some of the reviews. Some are looking for SiFi and find this \\"simple\\". Others are looking for a feel-good, uplifing story, and many seek something to conform to their pre-conceieved beliefs and biases. They come away depressed! This is a brilliant satire of so much of the human condition. The charactors are great, and the story line, although fantastic suits as a perfect vehicle for the myriad of points made in a book of less than 200 pages. It is a story to be read every 10 years of so and to compare to the current state of the world. In a way, only the names change and the irrationality continues."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Do you believe in anything? Do you think there is any importance to life (at all)? Well, the whole point of this book is that life means zilch. Religion is a crutch, politics is a crutch. Everything means nothing. I wonder why some people like to be this pessimisstic. Why people want to believe that life means nothing. If life means nothing, then why don't we go on murder rampages? Why don't we steal, rape, and loot? What's the point of trying to teach a lesson if life means nothing? There is no point. One of the previous reviews mentioned Catcher in the Rye. Awesome Book. Actually has a postive message. This book just encourages you to leave all your beliefs behind you and think that the whole world is an accident. I dread reading this next semester in my lit. class. I already did in my sophmore year, and it just about killed me."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The book started out with the main character John telling us that he wants to write a book about the creation of the atom bomb. But, the book is nothing about the atom bomb, in fact the atom bomb is rarely mentioned. The book then went on to tell us about how he went to the lab where the bomb was created, and talked to the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker's family and friends. Then John started telling us about this weird made up religion called Bokonon. This is where the book starts to become horrible... Crazy things start happening and none of them make any sense at all. The reason I chose to read this book was that I had read Slaughter House 5, and loved it. But this book wasn't written anything like SL5. I absolutely hated this book because of the fact there was abosolutely no point to it. Every book I've read has had a theme to it, but not this one. No important stories were told, no messages were expressed, and no action occurred. The book was extremely dark and hadn't even the slightest bit of happiness in it.

I have far better things to do with my time than to wait for this old man to get a sense of humor that he can put down on paper. If you would like to laugh, read &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot;...

I can't stand to have this book in my house. I buried it along with my dead cat (meow) (that's an inside joke for you three CC fans out there)."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Based on the tons of positive reviews for this movie, I can see that everyone enjoyed it. I just finished reading it in school and am now very frustrated.Cat's Cradle is pointless and so ridiculous that by the first page, I lost interest.First off, there are WAY too many chapters and for me and my studies, I had to write a chapter summary for each one. Very annoying.Kurt Vonnegut is trying to be funny during the whole book and because of that, his book is about nothing. He just randomly throws whatever is on his mind on paper and gets it published and famous. He tries to be funny. I say again TRIES. He is not though, his attempts are horrible and all of his ironic passages were idiotic.On top of it for a student, he made my life a living hell. We would spent the whole class analysing the first line.\\"Call Me Jonah.\\" Why?!Or: \\"So we had a night to kill in Ilium.\\"None of this is ironic or funny, it's absolutely ridiculous. This isn't a book, it has no plot, nothing. Its characters aren't developed and well...it's so ridiculous it's stupid.The title of the book has to do with a very minor incident and it should have been called ice-nine.The ending is absurd, the whole religion invented is absurd...EVERYTHING IS ABSURD. It's not funny and is painful to endure Vonnegut's billions of attempts at trying to be funny. And then on top it, to have to analyze it and do a final on it...well right now..I'm not liking Vonnegut and I might as well burn the copy of Slaughterhouse Five that I have sitting on my already big book collection.So, unless you are forced to read this trash in school, I would stay far away from it as it's boring, lame, ridiculous, not funny and very painful to endure.Vonnegut doesn't develop any of his characters so by the end, I really didn't give a rat's a#$ what happened to any of them. And the ending...just dreadful. This book manages to bash religion, not develop its characters, not have any plot, be too long, and not funny. Now that's not a very good book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is a decent sci-fi escape, but nowhere near as good an escape as Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, or Star Wars: A New Hope. This isn't very challenging, and you may feel compelled to read it because of the almost too simple story, and easy going language. This is basically a book about a mad scientist who tries to take over the world by freezing it over with a substance called Ice-Nine, and at the end he succeeds because of his children's greed to control it. Again, not very complex or deep, a basic fable, but still entertaining. But as entertaining as Star Wars? NO. I recommend renting the star war movies or getting the star war books, especially the ones with Jabba the Hut. Cat's Cradle has no point or meaning to it, unlike Lucas's prophetic, amazing vision. Vonnegut is funny, but not very intelligent."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've never read a Vonnegut book before, and now I know why. He died and so I saw him on the news and figured I should give him a shot. Cat's Cradle kind of sounded dumb and it turns out it doesn't mean anything, but I don't judge books by their covers because that can't tell you anything, so I decided to read it anyway.After the first sentence I knew the book was stupid. \\"Call me Jonah?\\" I mean, why call him anything? What kind of crappy book starts like that? Is that some kind of in joke or something where all the Vonnegutians are laughing SO HARD because he is SO FUNNY again. It only took three words for me to know the book was dumb, but I kept reading it because I didn't want to give up and figured it may grow on me, but it didn't, unless you mean grow on you like athlete's foot does, by which I mean in a bad way, not like it grows on you a whole lot, because it doesn't except in a bad way."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my favorite book that I have ever read.

However, this does not make the book in any way laborious to get through. You will chuckle to yourself many times, and probably even laugh out loud a couple of times. Vonnegut's talent for writing comical satire is certainly up there with Joseph Heller and the other greats; and Cat's Cradle lives up to what you'd expect from a master in his field. This book is a quick read (I read it all during a cross-country plane trip) and will both amuse you and also plant some wacky, but nonetheless ingenius, ideas into your head. Another good one by Vonnegut, it's worth it if you're a fan of his style or are just interested in getting acquainted with his work."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I was told to read this over summer for an Advanced Placement high school course, and got a great surprise. I could talk about social satire and other philosophical, metaphoric ideas, but nobody cares.

Don't be frightened off by Vonnegut's reputation, give Cat's Cradle a shot. The book is just plain excellent."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is no Slaughter-House Five. But what novel can possibly compare to that one? Though not as staggering as that book, Cat's Cradle is still can unbelievably well done novel that manages to be both hysterical and profound in a way that only Vonnegut can seem to pull off. It is a short book, but this slim volume contains a mountain of insight on religion, war, human nature, sex, well-being, and the limited nature of human comprehension. It broaches all these subjects with humbleness; it brings no pretensions to the table and is throughly honest--it never feels like it is being preachy. Bokonon is one of the best characters I have encountered in all of literature, and the philosphy he promulgatges is so obvious that it is hard to believe that it sounds so fresh. I guess that sometimes obvious things are hard to see. This book states the obvious that maybe we would never notice on our own. Cat's Cradle is vintage Vonnegut. Bokonon says: \\"History, read it and weep.\\" I say, read Cat's Cradle and have your mind blown."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I've read all Vonnegut's books. This was the first one I read, and it's still my fav. Breakfast of Champions comes close, but this book is still his masterpiece in my mind.Anyone who sees this world from the half glass empty principle will love this book. I laughed out loud repeatedly - Kurt just cuts through the crap and writes the most basic concepts of life at point blank range - he really knows how to make us see things for what they truly are.I'm not going to bore you with what I got from the book or what you're supposed to think. I think that what makes this book great is that you'll get something out of it no matter what your belief structures are or what your background is.

In this story, the main character (who is also the narrator), Jonah, meets many interesting people on his journey to successfully write a book. He encounters many new things, such as a new religion, and a new way of living. Jonah's book, along with an article he needs to write for the magazine he works for, leads him to San Lorenzo. There, his life takes a very interesting turn, and because of this, his life will never be the same again. Kurt Vonnegut has many highlighted points in his writing. In the novel, he writes as thought he was thinking. He doesn't always write in perfect English. This makes reading, for the most part, easy. However, at times, it can be difficult to understand. Vonnegut also uses an extensive vocabulary. There are words that he uses that I could not define without a dictionary. He also makes his chapters very short, which I find makes for much easier reading. I believe this novel was very good and I enjoyed it very much. As I read Cat's Cradle. some very vivid pictures were painted in my head which, added to the overall effect of the book.

I think this novel could be enjoyed by just about anyone, even if you think it's not to your &quot;taste&quot;. Give it a try, I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Having read many of Kurt Vonnegut's novels, both the sublime (MOTHER NIGHT) and the ridiculous (TIMEQUAKE), I felt I was prepared for CAT'S CRADLE. And, as usual for Vonnegut, all his usual elements are here: the purposefully simple prose, the distrust of established dogma, sex, religion, science, et al. But upon finishing CRADLE, I was awestruck at my unpreparedness for the true mobilizing force behind the plot. Rage.CAT'S CRADLE is an angry book, full of loathing and despair for the construct we call humanity. Vonnegut has always been one of the world's best moralists, but CRADLE finds him almost unhinged to the point of mania. And yet, it is quite likely Vonnegut's greatest and most entertaining achievement.The narrator, Jonah (or so he informs us), is an author bent on penning a novel which will encompass the day the hydrogen bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. His research leads him to the family of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, a scientist involved in the invention of the bomb. As he talks to the family, and other scientists, he becomes faintly aware of a fictional substance called \`ice-nine', which had befuddled Dr. Hoenikker for some time. In true Vonnegut fashion, this subplot is dropped until needed, as several years later Jonah meets up with the Hoenikker family in San Lorenzo, a tiny third world country with a bizarre origin and an unusual religion.I don't want to give too much of the plot away. Unlike several of Vonnegut's more recent works, the plot does play a large part of the novel's progression. Suffice to say, the fictitious religion of Bokononism plays a large part in the story, as do insanity, death, power, Armageddon, clarinets, stone angels, and love. And it all proceeds logically, especially in the context of the teachings of Bokonon.Like the best of Vonnegut, the deeper themes only come to the reader after they are replayed in the mind. Vonnegut's distrust of religion is evident as always, as Bokononism is based on the premise that all religions are lies, including Bokononism. But Vonnegut doesn't simply slam religion; Science, as the alternative, is equally a cause for distress, as power-mad generals demand new methods of destruction from their scientists, and the scientists don't consider the possibility that perhaps some problems should never be solved. Vonnegut finds no happiness in ignorance, but he finds none in knowledge, either.Why, then, is CAT'S CRADLE such a funny book? Any other author might have well been crushed under the weight of manic depression. But not Vonnegut. He revels in man's insanity, in man's arrogance. Vonnegut cannot provide an answer; neither should he be expected to provide one. He realizes that by delivering a soliloquy on a method to save us, he would become that which he despises the most: a preacher. Vonnegut knows there are no easy answers. All he can do is provide examples of where our current behaviour will take us.CAT'S CRADLE is simultaneously hysterical and horrifying, a morality tale that remains as relevant in the 21st century as the day Vonnegut published it. Anyone who believes they have the answer to mankind's problems should read it at once."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cats Cradle by Kurt Vonnegot is a wonderful but deceiving. It is a well-written story about the narrator Jonah (a journalist) and it opens with him writing a story call The Day The World Ended and he based it reactions of Felix Hoenikker (the father of the atomic bomb) on the day the bomb was dropped. Jonah meets Felix's three bizarre children and he becomes mixed up with the inhabitant from the island of San Lorenzo. He learns about ice-nine, a small chemical that could bring around the end of the world. Once created for the soldiers to solidify mud so it is easier to travel on. However he really made a weapon more dangerous the atomic bomb. There are many high points skillfully twisted into the story. Vonnegot is a very skillful writer and I want to read more of his novels. The high point that sticks out the most is when Jonah and the others bring about the end of the world by using ice-nine. This however was a mistake they had to pay for. I think the book has no low points because it was written so well nothing makes you lose you attention. Yes, I would recommend this book to anyone of any age. It is good at any age because you can see things at a different view. The one reason one shouldn't read this book is if they are easily distracted because if you miss one thing you are in trouble.

Full of intriguing ideas and well-drawn characters, the book starts out strong enough. Once the action reaches San Lorenzo and begins to build toward its apocalyptic climax, however, it gradually becomes less and less coherent. While the story ends with the ultimate bang, it sort of whimpers its way there -- Maybe it's some sort of literary device that I just didn't get -- And is it just me, or does Vonnegut's slightly self-righteous cynicism, doubtless refreshing in the early 1960's when the book was published, now seem just a little tired? The Vonnegut true believers would probably call this so much \\"foma,\\" but, in my opinion, if you're looking for one of the Great Man's books to read, stick withSlaughterhouse-Five"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"The best book on anthropology ever.

The characters are also less interesting than those that apppear in his other novels and plays, though there are some that reappear such as the God-guru Bokonon. I just found this novel kind of wierd, and then the apocalypse was sudden, etc. There are many of Vonnegut's typical themes: socially inept people (&quot;losers&quot; in the glitzy American sense) who gain positions of influence/power in obscure places and try to do good, banal science that started out inadvertantly and became very deadly, and speculations about how people should treat eachother. It is an odd conglomeration.Tepidly recommended."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I remember reading this book 20 years ago and it sorta stuck in the back of my mind. Then about 3 months ago I was reading about the prion theory of the transmission of mad cow disease in a popular science magazine, and it struck me as sounding very familiar....then I remembered Vonnegut's Ice9.The prion theory goes like this. There is a protein in your brain which normally folds itself into a particular shape in order to perform it's function. Along comes a prion, which is the same protein, except that it has folded itself into a new shape. This single mishapen protein molecule teaches the normal protein molecules in your brain how to fold into this dangerous, new, non-functional form. Soon afterwards, your brain begins to crystallize into something resembling swiss cheese.Twenty years ago, it bothered me that the central scientific premise of an otherwise fine novel was so implausible....obviously, I no longer feel that way."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Why do people write reviews that are 5 paragraphs long? I dont get it....Anyway, this is a wonderful book. A quick read and suspensful all the way up to the last sentence. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I don't normally read contemporary fiction, except for Don Delillo, but I figured I would read Vonnegut because I think I confused him with Updike and because there was a Graham Greene blurb on the back. In any case, Vonnegut's black humour is mixed with a little too much knowing misanthropy for my taste. There are no sympathetic figures in the novel, which is roughly based on Shakespeare's Tempest, or at least set on the same island, San Lorenzo, but I could be mistaken. Official ceremonies, scientists, Indiana, and ambassadors all get the superior treatment from our narrator, Noah. The only sympathetic figure may be the scientist who built the bomb, but of course his childlike scientific play will ultimately destroy the world one way or another. Cat's Cradle would be a much better movie than novel, but only if it starred OJ Simpson and was turned into a slapstick comedy, because otherwise the black humour is just humourless misanthropy and the fantasy a tired device."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I love Vonnegut's books. Few, if any, American writers display such imagination and wit. Or depth of conviction. However, in most of the five books by him that I have read, the endings are disappointingly weak. This is definitely the case in &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot;. The book progresses with near Huxlian vision (and much more humor) until Vonnegut appears to run out of resources. His ending, the apocalyptic suffocation of the world with the cancerous &quot;ice-nine&quot;, is far too abrupt and cartoonish. It hits the reader like, well, a dose of &quot;ice nine&quot;. This is a major shame, as his magnificently creative tale deserves a better thought out -- perhaps more subtle -- ending, something that lingers on the brain for a long, long time. The problem with most of his books is their unfortunate diffusion from one's conciousness, more than likely due to their relatively poor endings. I suggest that any readers buying this book bail out about 20 or 30 pages before the end. In fact, I would advise this to readers of most Vonnegut books. Perhaps then, the words of the Master of Black Humor would enjoy a longer half-life, and deserve a much better rating."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Perhaps it's my age. I'm 22. I've heard that this book is supposed to be a \\"must read.\\" So I decided to sit down and actually read this thing.I don't get the hype. Seriously. It's too scattered and too random. It may have started off interesting, when the main character first began his interviews...but it all did not mesh well for me and it was VERY boring.It seems like a very poor attempt to try to appear intellectual. I did not find this book intellectually stimulating at all or find it \\"mind boggling\\" or full of \\"wisdom.\\"I didn't get the satire or find the satire at all amusing.It was a waste of time for me to read this book.I would have liked to see more ice-9, and to go more in depth with ice-9. And perhaps even more post ice-9 chapters for the ending.I wasn't very satisfied with the ending either--I wasn't satisfied with the book at all actually.At least I can say that I've read Cat's Cradle? Umm...yeah.Note for kindle edition:1) Little to no errors in kindle edition (I did not find any).2) Chapters are all complete (I compared to a paperback of Cat's Cradle).3) No page numbers are listed, only location.4) Format is just fine--it's perfect.5) Table of Contents is included."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"the book arrived in great shape, as listed. it took a little while to get here, but that might have been the post office's fault. It did arrive within the listed time-frame."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Not as good as Sirens of Titan, but easily as good as Slaughterhouse. Definitely worth the short time it takes to get through one of these."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"It has been a while since I read this book, but its one of those that stick with you, making you think about it for years after. Vonnegut crafts his novel about a new compound discoered that could destroy the world. The cast of characters are regular folks entrusted with this dangerous substance. How everything goes down will leave you reading this whole book in one sitting."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Worth the read, particularly if you want to \\"try\\" Vonnegut. I did this for a book club and it worked quite well since there are infinite interpretations to pretty much every word of Vonnegut. It's hard to say what it's about other than it's a great outlook on apocalypse."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was my first Vonnegut book, and I had really high expectations for this book. I was not disappointed, not in the least. The irony, the strangeness (especially in the dialogue), the characters, the suspense, the ending, and most importantly, the humor, were superb. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. Vonnegut's irreverent take on religion, government, sex, war, and every other topic he takes on in the novel is refreshing, and the history and principles of Bokonon (the fictitious religion featured in the book) he derives through the course of the story added a lot of comic relief as well as interesting perspective on common religious thinking. Tis a shame I never enjoyed the man's work while he was still with us. I certainly intend to read more of his work in the future."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"Call me Jonah,\\" CAT'S CRADLE begins, referencing the unfortunate soul who got stuck in a whale. This Jonah is a journalist who has decided to write a book about the architect of the bomb that \\"resolved\\" World War II. It is not a spoiler to say that he learns after tracking the deceased scientist's post-war life and work that on the day the bomb was dropped, Dr. Newton Hoenikker was playing with a piece of string and as one of his now adult children observes of the children's game of the book's title, there was no cat, there was no cradle. Much of the book becomes a chase down to a Caribbean island republic with a colorful bunch of characters, some accidentally and others not quite so accidentally caught up with the scientist's next big thing after the bomb.Vonnegut uses this absurd comic tale to comment seriously about the problem of unchecked power, whether it is scientific or political. He gets in some views on religion, too, and invents an entire new one out of whole cloth, \\"Bokononism,\\" which is rife with its founder's sayings. Rereading this 1963 book again in 2007 after thirty odd years, I am astounded at the number of prophetic passages that suggest things that later became a part of our cultural language, including napalm, nuclear winter, Jonestown, Katrina, and politicians who don't \\"get it\\" about how America is regarded by the outside world.There is a warm, sad smile in Vonnegut's voice that makes his stuff compelling. His is an inventive vision that melds the comic and fantastic with a shrewd, philosophical look below the surface of human dealings. I especially like the passage in which he puts in his two cents on the value of writers, that they compare to firefighters and emergency personnel, and even college professors, because they all perform essential services to humanity."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is the purest voice of creativity of the modern era, perhaps all time. I have read and reread everything that he's written that is available in print. Each rereading brings into focus some nuance or framing heretofore overlooked or unappreciated. He never insults his readers, even shares the often painful creative process with them. \\"Player Piano\\" is my personal favorite, although \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is popularly considered his masterpiece. When asked to name the guests for my perfect imaginary dinner party, my list always begins with the iron pairing of Jesus Christ and Kurt Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"If you are a Vonnegut fan, you'll love the book. The author employs his typical, hyper-aware social commentary while using sometimes silly, often times sardonic, cynical humor. If you are the type of reader who is able to easily extract the deeper meaning of what Vonnegut is saying from his light and fanciful narrative, you will enjoy the book. Otherwise, you will find it simply a whimsical story. If your brain has a hard time wrapping around the absurd, you will not enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This is truly an amazing book, if your interested in reading anything by Kurt Vonnegut I would recomend this being your first, I swear it, if you read Cats Cradle you will be hooked on Vonegut!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Of all Vonnegut books, I'd have to say Cat's Cradle is his greatest achievement (despite a few short pieces of his that are brilliant). So, if there are any Vonnegut \\"newbies\\" out there looking for the right Vonnegut book to start with, order away! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"With the exception perhaps of Douglas Adams, who else can make the end of the world so entertaining. This is an exceptional book from Vonnegut and I strongly recommed it. It left me numb... and reminded me of Fire and Ice (below). Enjoy this outstanding read!Fire And Ice by Robert FrostSome say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice.From what I've tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire.But if it had to perish twice,I think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"This was the first Vonnegut book I read, and I couldn't put it down. I literally got it in the mail, started reading it and didn't stop until I was done.I now plan on reading anything else that Vonnegut has written."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle is fantastic Vonnegut and easily one of my favorite works by him. It's a great blend of sci-fi and philosophy that really makes you stop and think. As most of Vonnegut's work, it's delightfully witty. There are some books that I regret buying because I will only ever read them once -- this is not one of those books."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I'm a big Vonnegut fan, but Cat's Cradle is definitely my favorite of his works. It is smart, provocative, and the ending left me breathless. This book is a must-read for all speculative sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"I read this book in paper years and years ago.. it was the start to a love affair with Vonnegut. Did you know that Vonnegut's brother was the atmospheric scientist who invented cloud-seeding (with silver nitrate). Just the sort of colleague who might have been able to come up with a real-life ice-nine. This is fiction, but how much of it couldn't happen. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Loved it, amazing story. I powered through it in a day and a half (take's a lot for me to read that much!). I prefer it to Slaughterhouse Five, although they're both amazing."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"A friend had suggested I read this; I had only read one other novel by Vonnegut (Galapagos). The story and characters were engaging, and the writing style was fluid. Overall, this was a good read and is a book I am proud to add to my permanent library."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Vonnegut's style speaks to me. Cat's Cradle I've read several times over the past 10 years- and each time I enjoy it more."},{"Title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"\\"So much, for now, for the wampeter of my karass.\\"Vonnegut goes as far as making up his own vernacular and religion in this story that begins innocuous enough. The writer wishes to document the day the atom bombs fell on Japan, and finds his way into the lives of the bomb's late inventor and his family. What follows is a tale of twisted beliefs, self-destructive tendencies, and of seemingly mundane events that will one day transform the world.Multiple people with related histories collide (through more than luck if you believe in the book's religion of Bokononism) in a darkly comedic way on the mythical island of San Lorenzo, and the fate of all mankind is in the balance.It is no wonder that Vonnegut has been a staple on the bookshelves of student everywhere, as he is a masterful writer that engages, entertains, and challenges notions of normality. Cat's Cradle is a book that everyone should read at some point, as a great example of an author that defined a genre."}]`),K={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],B={key:0},x={key:1};function L(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=w("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(m,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(e(),f(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,P)):b("",!0)])}const D=d(K,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-fbf9b6eb"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/18.md","filePath":"quotesmag/18.md"}'),j={name:"quotesmag/18.md"},q=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(D)]))}});export{E as __pageData,q as default};
