Hailey doesn't get his exposition and application of the Minor Prophets off of the front page of today's newspaper. And he also doesn't think that \\"the remnant\\" has anything special in its future except its role in the Church. He takes the prophecies concerning \\"the remnant\\" and clearly shows how they point to the day when Israel would be brought into the Kingdom of the Messiah, also know as \\"The Church\\". His expositon is very thorough. This is not a fun read, but I don't think that it should be. I use McComiskey's set, NICOT, New American Commentary and Tyndale. But since the interpretation and meaning of the prophecies of hope concerning \\"the remnant\\" is so important, Hailey's book is the most important book on the Minor Prophets that I own. If you come from a pre-millennial viewpoint, Hailey's book will challenge your thinking; but he will do it in a kind way. I think this book is the top of the heap on the Minor Prophets. Enjoy and God bless.

In Bolt's words, &quot;No material detail of the Bible narrative has been omitted, and it has been my intention throughout to add nothing which is at any point contrary to it.&quot;Originally published in 1960, the author relies heavily upon Reinhold Neibuhr's &quot;The Nature &amp; Destiny of Man&quot; and Charles Ellicott's &quot;An Old Testament Commentary for English Readers.&quot;The descriptions of God, Adam, Eve, the serpent, and the Garden are clearly rooted in Old and New Testament imagery and conceptualizations. There is very little interaction with the insights of &quot;modern&quot; anthropology, archaeology, biology, psychology, etc."},{"Title":"A Walk Up Fifth Avenue","review":"Bernard Levin begins A Walk Up Fifth Avenue with three quotations from descriptions of New York City. These date from 1916, 1929 and 1949 and were written by Jane Kilmer, Theodore Dreiser and E. B. White respectively. Bernard Levin uses these vignettes to establish the reality, or perhaps unreality of a changing city, a superficially permanent edifice which really is in constant flux and is never more than a transient manifestation made concrete of the people, interests and activities it houses. Bernard Levin's 1989 book now becomes, itself, another such historical exhibit, since the twenty years that have elapsed since the publication of A Walk Up Fifth Avenue has seen major changes to New York's skyline, economy and population. In 1989 Bernard Levin made scant reference to Arabs or Afghans, and hardly mentions Islam when referring to the city's religious identity. In 1989, Russians, generally, were still in Russia, not the United States. The twin towers of the World Trade Centre appear in three of the book's colour plates without remark, and nowhere in the book's three hundred pages it took to walk the length of Fifth Avenue is there a single mention of the word \\"terrorism\\".For the targeted British audience of this book, the author, perhaps, symbolised something quintessentially English. An established columnist on The Times, well-known television commentator and latterly presenter of off-beat travel programmes, Bernard Levin was close to being a household name at the time, an instantly recognisable voice amongst the middle classes. But he was, himself, of immigrant stock, a Jew, and, at least originally, very much on the edge of the British establishment, no doubt knocking regularly on the its partially closed doors. Maybe this is why, in A Walk Up Fifth Avenue, he deals so informatively with the concepts of \\"new\\" and \\"old\\" money in New York. He describes beautifully how shady might be the origins of any kind of money, but the obvious class differences that the distinction engenders is keenly felt and wonderfully depicted in the book.Bernard Levin however, reveals that he is no fan of luxury for luxury's sake, and clearly has little sympathy for any kind of conspicuous consumption. He rubs shoulders with the better heeled at a New York party, but gently satirises the ostentation and the bad taste, perhaps being guilty of applying a new-world versus old-world, peculiarly British pomposity to place himself above an old money versus new money snobbery. It makes a fascinating juxtaposition of the author's opinion and subjects' assumptions. What makes the passages even more poignant for British readers, of course, is the Bernard Levin's long association with satire, especially that aimed at the rich and powerful.Levin is also clearly not a fan of commercialism. The appearance of Ronald McDonald in a Fifth Avenue parade promoted Levin to describe the character, somewhat sardonically, as \\"a true hero of our time\\". It prompts the reader to reflect that Father Christmas, as we know him today, is largely the product of an erstwhile promotional campaign for Coca Cola and his default red and white is not much more than a corporate trademark. And perhaps even the practice of giving presents on a day other than the Three Kings was an American invention, driven more by marketing than generosity. One wonders whether a century from now children will sit on a burger clown's knee to receive their annual schooling in consumerism.A Walk Up Fifth Avenue is much more than a travel book. It's considerably less than a history, and never attempts analysis. It is an informative, slightly random mixture of whatever caught the fancy of an observant, vaguely jaundiced British journalist as he tried to probe the heart of one of the world's greatest cities. It's an uneven read, but doubly rewarding, since the book not only takes the reader there, it also now offers evidence of its own justification, because it catalogues change and invites us to reflect on our current, equally tenuous, impermanent status."},{"Title":"A Walk Up Fifth Avenue","review":"The descripton of the book and the condition it which it was received matched, and the service time for delivery exceeded my expectations.

Thus, up until now, my favorite volume in the series was the 1996 edition edited by Adrienne Rich -- not because I think all of the poems she chose were brilliant (many weren't), but rather because the choices were unpredictable and, though diverse, held together by a clear philosophical intent on the editor's part. (It was exactly this philosophical intent which made the book the most controversial one in the series, with Harold Bloom deliberately excluding any of Rich's choices from the ten-year retrospective volume.)Robert Creeley's volume seems even better to me than Rich's (partly because I like Creeley's view of poetry more than Rich's). I expect, though, that the book will either be loved or hated by readers, for though there are some old favorites such as Donald Hall and Sharon Olds included, the majority of the poems are innovative and &quot;difficult&quot;.Approached with an open mind, a high tolerance for ambiguity and confusion, and a certain sense of humor, though, and this book reveals itself to be full of wonders. I couldn't tell you what the exact meaning of Forrest Gander's magnificent &quot;Carried Across&quot; is, but I can say that reading it was one of the most powerful and rewarding experiences I've had while reading contemporary poetry. None of the other poems had quite the same effect on me, but why should they? Jenny Boully's footnotes-to-blank-space &quot;The Body&quot; had me laughing and thinking and wondering and rethinking as I wandered through it, a bit lost but also amused, and many other poems had similar effects.Frank O'Hara maintained that poetry should at least be as interesting as movies, and, with the proper willingness on the reader's part to stay open to oddity, just about all of these poems meet that test."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"I've read this series regularly, and I've also often chosen to use it in my college courses, though in the last five years or so, I've found it less useful as a teaching tool and more useful as a compendium of trendiness in American Poetry. The last really comprehensive &quot;Best&quot; in this series was Richard Howard's year, but then, Howard is really an editor, a writer and reader with broad tastes, and secure enough in his own achievements that he doesn't submit to the kind of cronyism that afflicts this year's anthology. Creeley's choices are so very dull that I fear these must be buddies. I'm going to have to find another anthology for my students. This one has been disappointing too many years in a row."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"This has been a wonderful series of books, a great way to keep abreast of where current American poetry is going - and I'm sure it will be again. Unfortunatley this edition doesn't measure up. The reason for this failure falls at the feet of the editor, Robert Creely. I understand an editor's desire to place his own stamp on such a work. Furthermore, if that weren't the idea behind the series, it wouldn't have a new editor ever year. That said, I have to say that Creely put far too much of his own mark on this year's edition. Unless you happen to really enjoy Creely's own poetry, you probably will not enjoy this book. It reads like a collection of his own work. About every tenth poem I feel like I have a clue what the author is trying to say. All the rest amount to little more than gratuitous verbal fireworks, pointless word plays, excessive alliteration, and general self-absorbed drivel. In the future I hope series editors will try to bring us once again a broad collection of what is great in current American poetry, not simply one marginal poet's collection of the poems he happened to like that year."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"I disliked the 2001 collection and made certain to check this out in the bookstore before buying. I'm glad I did. Much of the poetry in this collection suffers from the same self-conscious elitism of the prior collection. Great, and good, poems can require more than one reading for true comprehension. But impenetrable? Inaccessible? I hate to sound like a crab but ...when are we going to stop judging art as good solely because it break the rules, and start requiring it to be shored up by meaning, and represented by talent? Language poetry can be done well - but it's not done well just because its language poetry. Transgression for transgression's sake is B-O-R-I-N-G. A few bright lights, but all in all, a murky, sad collection. Recommended instead: A Book of Luminous Things: An International Anthology of Poetry edited by Czeslaw Milosz. A transcendent collection."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"I've read this series since 1989 or so and have thought it consistently excellent. This volume, however, is almost entirely made of exceptionally eccentric poetry that will alienate almost all readers. As I read it, I kept thinking about this: Somewhere a thoughtful, educated and well-read person decides he or she will finally take time to explore what is going on in today's poetry. Our hypothetical friend goes to his or her local bookseller and finds &quot;The Best American Poetry 2002&quot; and understandably concludes this is an ideal book with which to start. It would likely be his or her last purchase of contemporary poetry. It's very much unbalanced and is simply not at all representative of poetry in 2002. The editor indulges his own taste for the inaccessible and quirky with no consideration for the task of presenting, well, &quot;The Best American Poetry.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"Maybe too many aspiring poets hold inclusion in &quot;The Best American Poetry&quot; as being the pinnacle of having &quot;arrived.&quot; This reasoning makes for a lot of frustrated poets, who feel as if their work is more deserving, which in turn makes for negative reviews. There are a lot of talented writers in this volume, writers whose work might have been overlooked or lost on readers, because so many poets don't turn to literary journals--they turn to this anthology to see who's who. I'm sure that younger poets (and very talented poets) such as Sarah Manguso and Jenny Boully benefited from this anthology because their work suddenly found hundreds of new readers. Of course, there is also bad, very bad poetry in this collection. However, I'm willing to take the good with the bad if it means having a yearly summary of the current poetry scene."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"Besides the very fine introduction by David Lehman, this has to be the most abstruse collection of poetry I have ever read. I am a college teacher and have traditionally used the Best American series in my classes. Year after year, it has been my favorite poetry anthology. I had my students purchase this edition before I had a chance to look through it this year and I am worried that a collection like this will just fortify all their worse preconceptions about poetry: elitist, inside, arch, academic, and bloodless. It seems to be an elaborate joke played by Creeley on the whole idea of a &quot;Best American Poetry&quot;. Could his taste possibly be so narrow? Perhaps this issue should be called &quot;The Best American Language Poetry&quot; or &quot;The Best American Poetry out of The University of Buffalo.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"Gad, what a dreadful bore! The problem is not that the poetry in this volume is experimental--it's that it's incredibly dull, hiding its lack of content, or even anti-content--its lack of new ideas--in its inscrutability. Experimental poetry is not necessarily a dead end, but from this pleasureless, drearily mannered volume you'd think it was. There's hardly a narrative poem by anyone under 50--and there's plenty of excellent young narrative poetry being written. Creeley's got his head in the sand. This is a monument to what's already over and done with. Please, David Lehman, pick somebody a little younger, a little hipper, to edit this next year."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"For a great many years now, I have been buying and reading cover to cover the annual issues of \\"Great American Poetry.\\" This is by far the best example the anthology has had to offer. Every poem is unique, powerful with a vast command of language and nuance, and they each invite rereading after rereading. These gems are diverse and yet extraordinary in their methods. The poets are seen at their finest. 2001-2002 must have been a highly creative year."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"For many years, I have been taking the Best American Poetry books down from the shelf at the local bookstore for a peek, but I never felt compelled to buy one until I read the 2002 version selected by Robert Creeley. I've always had more respect than affection for Creeley, finding it hard to get into his stuff, but I loved the synergy (Marketing stole this word from the Greeks--I'm stealing it back) produced by the juxtaposition of devil-may-care experimentation with the best of more traditional, \\"mainstream\\" offerings in this volume. My favorite examples of these divergent impulses here are Jenny Boully's \\"The Body,\\" a poem in the form of footnotes to blank pages (this poem has been ridiculed in other reviews found here, but I find it daring and exhilirating--in fact, I wish I had thought of it first) and Donald Hall's \\"Affirmation,\\" an astonishingly straightforward and devastating poem that is one of my favorites from his body of work and one that should warm (freeze?) the heart of the most esthetically conservative reader.Even though I received a B.A. in English with a focus on creative writing ten years ago, I have only recently begun to understand the struggle between those who would keep poetry at a place it never was (the \\"School of Quietude\\" in Ron Silliman's terms--you MUST read his blog, it's good whether you agree or not, just as long as you care about poetry) and those who want poetry to continue to evolve (not \\"improve\\"), no matter what unexpected and scary turns it may take (what Mr Silliman calls, in our time, the \\"post-avant\\"). This book seems to have frightened most of the reviewers who felt compelled to contribute their opinions here, which frightened state they express as distaste. Just know that the most innovative and forward poetry that has lasted was seen in its time as \\"eccentric\\" or \\"inaccessible\\" or \\"repugnant\\" or \\"unreadable\\" or \\"incomprehensible,\\" ad nauseam, from Euripides to T.S. Eliot, who, despite of his conversion to stultifying artistic conservatism and his weird adoption by \\"the Establishment\\" (and weirder disinheritance by \\"the anti-Establishment\\"), told us, if I remember correctly, that meaning should not be sought when first reading poetry that is new to us, but rather an understanding of the qualities of language the poet is presenting to us.[This may be a complete misrepresentation of Eliot; I'm sorry I don't remember where I read his statement about reading for meaning. Anyway, people who hate this book will respond that there is no quality to the language here, the good old days were the best, blah blah blah etc etc, but this is as good a place as any to end this review.]"},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"I have never been a fan of Creeley's work (&quot;For Love&quot; is honestly one of the worst poetry books I ever wasted a yard sale dollar on), but I still expected better from his BAP selections, which are totally lacking in flavor. Creeley tries to convert readers to his surrealist style, rife with inaccessible, abstract dream-language, most of which here is narcissistic, utterly incoherent, and reads like the journal ramblings of a Goth teenager. Someone who does not like poetry would not change his/her mind after reading BAP 2002, and that is exactly why I find this collection repugnant. As a poet myself, I have an open mind, experiment with nontraditional modes of writing, and enjoy the surrealist and renegade edge of many contemporary writers. But this edition was useless, both as enjoyable reading and as writing inspiration. 90% of the poems are meaningless, flat, and unfulfilling. Additionally, they were culled almost exclusively from the internet and unheard-of publications. I strongly support small presses and am always eager to sample new publications, but to ignore more established journals which consistently produce quality work feels disrespectful somehow. To be fair, there are a few bright spots in this edition--the poems by Broughton, Burkard, Chapman, Cooley, di Prima, Equi, Friedlander, Gizzi, Goldbarth, Hall, Kumin, Merwin, Myles, Metres, Olds, Sadoff, Warsh, Wier and Wright are worth a second read. But an anthology such as this shouldn't be assessed on the quality of each individual poem, rather on the tone and texture of the whole. The &quot;picture&quot; that BAP 2002 paints is a painful, wasteful, headache-inducing one. Creeley himself says in the introduction, &quot;These poems are better than the best, each and every one of them. If you don't agree, then go find your own.&quot; Please, please take his advice."},{"Title":"The Best American Poetry 2002","review":"I don't think anybody but Robert Creeley &amp; David Lehman would have compiled this selection of poems, &amp; it's an essential volume, full of all kinds of crazy experiments in modern poetry &amp; a few incredibly beautiful brilliant more formalist poems.

One descends from the postromantic lyric, the other from Black Mountain (by way of the Pisan Cantos) where only language (not content, not anecdote) counts. This collection contains mostly poems by poets who have an extraordinary gift for free-association. Very few of these poems make any contextual sense and fewer still make any _grammatical_ sense. Are these the \\"best\\" poems of 2002? Not by a country mile. In fact, try imagining readers in 2050 reading this book. How many of these poems will endure? How many will resonate in the minds of the average college student fifty years hence? To be sure, choosing the \\"best\\" of anything is always a reflection of the editor, but Mr. Creeley has lost all sense of judiciousness and cultural perspective here.

We live in New Jersey, so we were of course interested in Amiri Baraka's contribution (he's NJ's poet laureate). It's hard to say which of Baraka's qualities makes the deepest impression: the illiteracy, the meaninglessness, the scatology, or the utter rhythmlessness. She then turned to \\"The Body\\", which elicited giggles. And now I discover that it is dangerous to put a book like this in front of a 13-year-old. She's decided that being a poet is a great career path: you don't have to know anything -- you don't even have to be able to write! -- and there's no heavy lifting.

Unfortunately, it seems that David Lehman's flip style of nonsense poetry of unimportance and clever witty self-involved and boring poetry has permeated the collections for 2001 and 2002. Both last year's, supposedly edited by Robert Hass, hard to believe, and this 2002 volume, supposedly edited by Robert Creeley, also hard to believe, are full of David Lehman's silliness, his air-headed cleverness. Lehman is no judge of great poetry, and very much wedded to the light-weight qualities of the New York School of poetry, i.e. those who think, for one example, that Anne Waldman can write when words are definitely not her medium! There is not enough good, solid poetry in either of these volumes, and too many supposedely experimental, witticism that float off to nowhere. Time will show that David Lehman's taste had a terrible influence, along with Bush's light-weight Billy Collin's, on the current years of American Poetry--not at all in the tradition of our greats, i.e. Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Galway Kinnell, Allen Ginsberg, June Jordan, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Denise Levertov, etc., but in the tradition of his clique and &quot;in&quot; crowd who will be on the outs of the final reckoning.

Due to a shortage of nurses, she's working overtime at the hospital, cooking and cleaning at home, and trying to figure out which of her new relatives might be her enemies.Not quite as delightful as the Little sisters' THE GREAT BLANK KANBA. Indeed, there are some dark, creepy goings-on in that mansion. Still, there's much to like here. The main trio of characters are wonderful. Miriel is a clever, independent, hard-working nurse, whose supply of sarcastic remarks is apparently inexhaustible. Ian gains sympathy as the put-upon husband, despite his murky motivations. Ian and Kelly of course take an instant dislike to each-other and it's a tribute to the authors' writing that their animosity never feels forced, and their verbal jousting is fresh and funny. Hilarious dialogue and great characters make this book an entertaining read. Sometimes, Kelly and Miriel behave foolishly, in seemingly self-destructive ways. I wasn't too annoyed by that because the book had so many good qualities."},{"Title":"The Black Honeymoon","review":"The Little sisters wrote couple of dozen books in similar vein. Plucky, young heroine, her paramour, wacky relatives and sparkling wit, dearly remembered from the old movies. Mirna Loy, Cary Grant, perfect actors for this kind of flicks.The plots are not very original, but nevertheless reading this little jewels that The Rue Morgue Press faithfully reprints is a pleasure. Luckily I own at least another dozen of their books to relish and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Black Honeymoon","review":"All the Little mysteries are written on multiple levels and can be read and enjoyed as mystery, comedy, or romance. And, due to the passage of time, it is now a period novel, a window into wartime homefront America.It largely succeeds. The mystery is complex, logical, and mostly satisfying and convincing. The reader might have a slight case of \\"There sure was a lot going on in that house in those two days!\\" but nothing major. The comedy is spot on and is funny without being grotesque given the tragedies unfolding. The romance is probably the weakest leg of this literary stool. The leading man, Ian, doesn't come across as a guy who could sweep Muriel off her feat in a few days. All in all, Muriel's father and his friend Kelly seem much more interesting.I've read three Little mysteries and have thoroughly enjoyed them all. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Angel Unaware: A Touching Story of Love and Loss","review":"Wonderful book! I read this book years ago, and just happen to see it one day on Amazon.

Even though this child lived more than a decade before I was born, her story has touched me.

When she later asked where to obtain a copy for anther mother who had lost a child, I ordered a supply for her from Amazon. THANK YOU for helping us touch lives through the written word!"},{"Title":"Angel Unaware: A Touching Story of Love and Loss","review":"It was August 26, 1950 when little Robin Elizabeth came into the world. Her Mommy and Daddy were so happy to meet her, but a doctor was concerned and began to take a closer look at her. One of the nurses accidentally let it slip out that \\"the doctor had said something about [her] being a \`borderline' baby.\\" Babies like Robin never went home, but were sent to institutions, never to be seen again, but Dale Evans Rogers and her husband would have none of it. Roy firmly stated, \\"We are taking our baby home. God has a purpose for allowing this, and if we put her away, we will never know it.\\" They would be a guiding light and inspiration to families with Down's syndrome babies ... the doors began to open and the babies began to go home.This tale, told in Robin's little voice begins when she comes home to meet her siblings, Dusty, Cheryl, and Linda. There was always a nurse to tend to her needs, but Cau-Cau was the one that stayed the longest. \\"Cau-Cau knew her business with babies. She told Mommy I wasn't really her child I was God's child.\\" Of course she was Daddy's beautiful \\"Little Angel,\\" and any opportunity he got that camera came out to take pictures of her. Things were not easy for Robin who had a bad heart, poor coordination, and as she claimed, \\"Any noise bothered me.\\" But there was a lot of love in the Rogers' household and everyone was learning from the love she gave in return.This is a heartwarming, timeless story of a Robin Elizabeth, a Down's syndrome baby. This story, told from Robin's perspective in heaven, was penned by her mother as she grieved her death starting two days after the funeral. I could almost hear her little voice as she talked about things that happened Down There and the freedom she felt Up Here. The biography is sweet and loving and gives a sense of how well she fit into the family. For example, when she \\"talks\\" about her brother Dusty she says, \\"There was a kind of a spark between us, Father, if you know what I mean.\\" When the Rogers' family took her home in the 1950s, it was simply unheard of. Their love and acceptance of her was no different than that of their other children. This very short biography is a classic tale about how a mother dealt with her grief, but mostly is a tale about a family's love for their \\"Little Angel.\\""},{"Title":"Angel Unaware: A Touching Story of Love and Loss","review":"I first read this as a child and it touched my heart as I was raised with the Roy Rogers TV program.

One of my classmates had the book ANGEL UNAWARE, and while I didn't read it then, I read it later.It's an unbelievable story. Roy and Dale had children by previous marriages, but little Robin was the only child they had together, and she had Down's Syndrome. The whole family adored the little girl. The story is written first person as though the little girl was telling it, and as if she were actually an angel sent down to be with the Rogers family and to teach them more about love and bring them closer to God. It revealed the extraordinary writing talent that Dale Evans--already an extremely multi-talented person. In the story, Robin herself is talking to the Lord about all the wonderful things that they did for the Rogers family. I get misty-eyed just remembering this story its beautiful message. In fact, I've gotten choked up a couple of times while writing this review.Robin didn't live long. But the good that came through her brief life still ministers to others.Roy Rogers always had a burden and love for children with disabilities. Perhaps he always did (he was a good man) but I'm sure that the experience with Robin deepened it. Roy and Dale would later adopt a disabled little boy named Sandy -- which is a story in itself.If you can possibly get a chance to read this, please do so!

Kuyper is simply brilliant and his writing is amazing - tackling difficult issues and concepts, yet making it accessible to an interested and engaged reader. Kuyper believed that God was (and is) interested in all facets of human life and that the belief-system of Christianity addressed all the various facets of human endeavor. Lectures on Calvinism begins with an overview of Calvinism as a Life-system and then is broken down into chapters that relate how Calvinism addresses religion, politics, science, art and the future.Kuyper addresses three primary spheres of human involvement - (1) our relation to God, (2) our relation to man, and (3) our relation to the world. Kuyper believed that a proper understanding and perspective of these three spheres would give man a proper biblically-based relationship to God and others - and that proper perspective was one of engagement for the cause of Christ, not \\"monastic flight\\" from the issues of the day.Avoidance of the world, according to Kuyper, is not biblical. But understanding how to engage and placing a proper emphasis on the importance of worldly things is also a must. For those who believe they have an understanding of Calvinism from the simplistic \\"five points of Calvinism,\\" this book would blow them away! The book is not for everyone - I would suggest only a serious reader would enjoy this book - but if well-read, this book is definitely worth the time and effort!"},{"Title":"Who Do You Love?","review":"We love Martin Waddell's books, particularly the ones that have touched our hearts and tickled our funny bones (Once There Were Giants, The Big, Big Sea, The Pig in the Pond).

The author and publishers (what are editors for?) have missed an opportunity to fix the correct form in the minds of children and parents everywhere, and to have it associated with a smiling, shared secret pleasure. No rhyme or rhythm would have been destroyed by saying &quot;Whom do you love?&quot; instead of &quot;Who do you love?&quot; Quite the contrary, in fact: the m of whom lends a certain delicious quality to the question.

Yoshikawa's novel is based on the Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), which is a classic of Japanese literature and one of the best historical sources of the late Heian Period in Japan. &quot;Heike Story&quot; remains true to the history but fleshes it out in a way that brings the historical characters to life. The translation seemed fine to me, and I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in Japanese history and culture, and especially the late Heian and early Kamakura Periods."},{"Title":"The Heike Story","review":"I am a Japanophile and history buff, so I loved this author's \\"Musashi\\" and \\"Taiko\\" novels. I finally got around to this and am quite disappointed. I agree with those who have found this translation weak---the dialogue sections are stilted and the feelings of the characters seem awkwardly expressed in English. The worst damage to the novel is the abridgement of entire sections, deletion of characters and incidents and the condensation of some chapters. As noted at the end of the \\"Historical background\\" section, this is an \\"English version\\" of the novel!Eiji Yoshikawa is definitely ill served by this version and the publisher should seriously consider having a new translation made. As it stands, this version does not even cover the fall of the Heike---which is the main point of the whole chronicle.Still, Yoshikawa weaves a good tale---he gives a human face to historical events. What delights have English readers been deprived of by this badly mangled version?"},{"Title":"The Heike Story","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago and have read it several times again. It is a beautiful story and the translation gives it all the justice it deserves. I don't understand the problem the previous reader had with it. It is highly accessible (unlike the translation of Tale of Genji that I read years ago) and requires no special knowledge of Japanese geography, history, etc. I recommend it highly. (FYI, I too have lived in Japan and traveled extensively throughout the country. My Japanese isn't good enough to read it in the original.)"},{"Title":"The Heike Story","review":"Despite what some of the previous reviewers have said, this translation is not that bad.For the record, a rice-ball is just that -- a ball of rice. In Japanese, it's an \\"onigiri.\\" Basically historical Japanese fast food. Sushi did not exist in the 12th century. Why *not* call sake wine? Would these reviewers be upset that \\"lager\\" is usually called just \\"beer\\"?And \\"general of the guards\\" has nothing to do with the shogunate. Since when is the shogun a palace GUARD?As for Minister of the Left: The Great Council of State -- which governed Japan -- was headed by three ministers: Minister of the Left, M. of the Right, and M. of the Center. The Left was senior to the other two.Could this have been a better translation? Definitely. And for many reasons. But not for any of the ones whinged about in previous reviews."},{"Title":"The Heike Story","review":"This is not a translation of the mediaeval classic of the same name, but a modern novel based on its core events, namely the rise to power and fall of Taira Kiyomori and his clan, also known as the Heike."},{"Title":"The Heike Story","review":"This is another great book by Yoshikawa and would recommend to any readers interested in Japanese history and warfare.Some readers may not like the translation. Many words have been translated into their actual meanings, e.g. \\"sushi\\" to \\"rice ball\\"; \\"sake\\" to \\"wine\\"; \\"geisha\\" to \\"dancing girls\\" etc., instead of throwing in well known Japanese terms. But I don't find this a problem, the translator was being consistent all the way.The translation is, however, weak in the explanation of titles and posts, e.g. \\"General of the Imperial Guards\\" = \\"Shogun?\\"; \\"Minister of the Left\\"; \\"Councilor\\". If the tranlation had included an appendix for the titles and posts, it will surely make the book a more enjoyable read.Notwithstanding, I don't think readers will require much knowledge regarding Japanese culture and history to enjoy this book.Hope to see more books by Yoshikawa translated into English. Will be nice to have \\"Yoritomo of the Genji\\" translated into English too, it being a companion book for \\"The Heike Story\\" and continues the story to the creation of the Kamakura Shogunate."},{"Title":"The Heike Story","review":"First, I'll say that this book is fantastic. The plot and storyline fascinating. Yoshikawa is a great storyteller. However, I deplore the translation. In the copy of the book that I found, entire chapters were taken out of the book to supposedly accomodate someone unfamiliar with japanese language, culture, history, and geography. I was disgusted by the fact that this classic novel was butchered so bad. As a previous review explains, sushi is renamed &quot;rice balls&quot; and sake is renamed &quot;wine&quot;. I've never been to japan, but i can speak it a bit, and through reading alot of japanese novels I have come to have a very good understanding of its geography and history. Had they left everything in, an ignorant reader could have just not paid attention to geography, historical significance, etc. But instead, someone who loves and admires japan and wishes to receive the fullest experience like me feels robbed."},{"Title":"The Heike Story","review":"Like others reviewing this novel, I've significant experience in Japan. And, like other Yoshikawa novels it is a wonderful mechanism for looking back on the Japan of legend. As with any good historical fiction, the historic details and culture are correct and well presented.My argument is with the translation. If we are referring to the same translation (published by Kodansha many years ago, I believe) it is a problem of the translator glossing over matters which he feels may be beyond the comprehension or the interest of the reader.

Det. McCleary has had it rough, apparently in the first two novels the reader learns this.

Having been imprisoned in Andersonville during the Civil War, he is still haunted by his experiences, and his thoughts inform his actions as he tries to solve a murder that powerful people want covered up. His investigation leads him to the dysfunctional family of a major power broker. McCleary is unimpressed, but he runs into a lot of obstacles as he pursues justice.Graham's writing is superb, the narrative voice is compelling, and the historical information is seamlessly woven into the story. Having the Centennial Exhibit as the setting is brilliant! The mystery takes a lot of twists and turns, and it is gory and shocking, not for the faint of heart.Terrific third outing for Det.

I enjoy his stories. His research is actually quite remarkable, and it gives the reader an insight into the past that they may not have had. This book does that very well with the Centennial World Fair in Philidelphia. It does make you sad that all that grandeur is gone, especially after what was spent. It also gave me an insight into what World Fairs were like in their heydey. Graham's writing though is rather simplistic. This makes for quick reading of the book, and somehow the dialect and way of speaking didn't ring true with me for the era. Also, where did the title come from? The title really had no reference to the story at all. The mystery was pretty good, although I had figured out the guilty one by about 1/3 of the way through the book. But I still enjoyed the story and the sense of history that Mr. Graham instills. That's why I gave this book a higher rating than the grammar and writing skills warranted. I disagree with one of the previous reviewers viewpoints that if you really want &quot;the smell and stink of the open sewers, read Anne Perry&quot;. I have read all Ms. Perry's books and I enjoy them immensely, but Mr. Graham's novels do really give that sense of time and place just like Ms. Perry's. His extensive research helps him achieve this. But if you really want the smell and stink, as well as the sense of place, correct grammar and syntax, I highly recommend Peter Lovesey's Cribb and Thackery novels. They're the best I've read on this era."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"All I can say is wow! This is one series that continues to get better and better. The book deals with the 1876 Centennial in Philadelphia, and its proximity to the Shantytown in the same city where opium seems to be the drug of choice. It's fascinating to see the ideas of a city looking to the future while the current plight of its poorer people goes unheeded. It's not a light read by any means -- the murders are rather gruesome, and many of the characters are gray in terms of morals. But I couldn't put the book down. Definitely another winner in this series."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"I enjoyed the story up until the very end - the description of the Centennial was very well done; you felt that you were there. However, I like a twisted ending as well as anyone, but this was a mess! One too many U-turns, in my opinion. Otherwise, a clear, descriptive story with good character development."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"This isn't a bad attempt at historical mystery fiction, so much as the wrong history in the hands of an amateur. Don't be surprised if you get the sense you've seen this movie before. You have -- it's Robert Towne's 1974 screenplay &quot;Chinatown,&quot; but Graham is no Towne. I have trouble placing the smarmy, wiseacre dialogue used in &quot;Black Maria&quot; . . . with a nation of citizens who still have to empty their slop buckets daily and read by gaslight. Humphrey Bogart? Perhaps. John Wilkes Booth? Fugeddaboudit.Look, people were still riding horses in these days, okay? &quot;Black Maria&quot; doesn't smell like 1877; it doesn't move like 1877; it doesn't sound like 1877; and it doesn't taste like 1877. We're really in the 1930's -- the only thing our detective is missing is spats (and perhaps a bazooka).Historical mysteries present unique challenges. The strategic placement of brand names and places here and there is no substitute for the heavy lifting necessary to evoke 1877. Nothing short of every sense, at all times, must not only be recalled it must be ubiquitous -- or we might as well give them all cell phones. Only the most gifted talent should attempt capturing the atmosphere of (any) century prior to the 20th and this one just doesn't have what it takes.Want AUTHENTIC 1870's police fiction? Read Anne Perry: You won't make it through 2 pages before either smelling the open sewers, almost stepping in steaming horse dung, wiping the industrialized coal soot from your eyes, or covering your mouth from the latest health epidemic. Even a mug of ale in an 1870's pub -- placed in Anne Perry's evocative prose -- somehow tastes richer; the bread, more chewy; the meat pies, buttery and steaming. Children smell like soap, fresh from a bath with no proper ability to rinse off. Food competes for precious real estate where the daily ice block is stored (itself, a precious commodity).This is sufficient for a library book, and only when the one you really wanted has been checked out: Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.Skye"},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"DULL AND BORING.VERY LITTLE ACTION UNTIL THE LAST 10/15 PAGES."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"THE BLACK MARIA, is a must-read for fans of the previous McCleary mysteries (THE KILLING BREED and THE RESURRECTIONIST), and quite possibly the best introduction to Mr. Graham's work for those who have not yet entered the gaslight noir world of late 19th Century Philadelphia that McCleary inhabits.THE BLACK MARIA follows McCleary as he exposes the seedy underbelly of the Centennial Expostion in a gripping search to find a savage murderer. As every twist and curve in the investigation leads deeper into the dark past of a rich industrialist family from Mauch Chunk, PA, McCleary learns that the cost of sanity and redemption rise as the value of life falls.As in Mr. Graham's previous work, page-turning suspense drives THE BLACK MARIA, while carefully-researched details of late 19th Century Philadelphia life and times draw readers into McCleary's world. However, Mr. Graham's attention to period detail has never been better, nor more fully-realized, than it is in THE BLACK MARIA. Readers will find themselves so caught-up in the sights, sounds, smells and excitement of the Centennial Exposition, they'll have a hard time believing they didn't just travel back in time when they finally turn the last page of THE BLACK MARIA.-- S.D.

The first two books are good; this one is outstanding.Like the first two novels, THE BLACK MARIA is populated by fascinating, complex characters and a fast-paced (though occasionally convoluted) mystery. But it is the setting--the World Fair of 1876--that makes this novel so compelling. Mark Graham has recreated this vital slice of American history so extraordinarily well, it's almost like being there in person.Mark Graham is a talented author whose writing skills improve with each book. I look forward to the next addition to this series."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"For once, here's a book that lived up to its good reviews. Graham's meticulous research, his use of the language (and spelling) of the times, places the reader firmly on site as we travel with detective Willton McCleary through the Centennial Exposition. The rendering of the site's splendors and its neighboring sleaze is so historically accurate and visual that we can almost smell the foods on offer and hear the swish of women's gowns; we watch the pickpockets, see the displays and gaze in wonder at the miracles of the era: the new type-writing machine, the telephone, and every conceivable type of contraption. Woven into the tour of this remarkable venue is a mystery so complex and twisted that the reader is lured into suspecting any number of people of being the savage killer McCleary is attempting to find. McCleary himself is a finely drawn character with secret sorrows and scars on his psyche; he has honor and integrity and is a most sympathetic character. The pacing picks up, gets to a gallop, then races toward an unexpected and oddly satisfying conclusion.The author's note at the end of the book about Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition leaves one feeling (as I believe he hoped) with a sadness for how much of historical value has been lost through neglect or greed, and how important it is to preserve the remaining cultural remnants for future generations.Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"Mark Graham is creating a new genre, and the Black Maria is an outstanding example. His complex hero, Wilton McCleary, solves a murder and confronts the darkness of his own soul at the Centennial Exhibition of 1876. As in Graham's previous books, The Killing Breed and the Edgar nominated Resurrectionist, the historical detail is impeccable. It's not a shoot-em-up.It requires an attention span, but it's a great read for the intelligent reader, and the story builds toward an absolutely gripping conclusion"},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"As a history major in the early 70s, the time in America between the end of the Civil War and the turn of the century always struck me as incredibly boring.Yet in the fullness of time, this period of peace and prosperity set the course for the American Century that lay ahead. The &quot;New World&quot; surpassed the old in military and industrial might. The instability of the pre-War years was replaced by a sense of an indivisible Americanism, a nationhood heretofore unknown.Nowhere was the rise of industrial America more evident than at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. The grandiose world's fair staked America's claim on her true manifest destiny, the leader of the industrial democracies. It was here that the telephone and typewriter were introduced to skeptical and astonished consumers. And here that the plot of the Back Maria unfolds.Wilton McCleary, city detective, is assigned to the Exhibition in seeming disgrace within the Philadelphia police force. He is assigned to escort the journalist son of one of the financial backers around the fair and the surrounding Shantytown, a virtual den of sin. Here he finds a dead girl and a lot of unanswered questions. Despite orders to stay out, he investigates, uncovering a seedy world within &quot;polite society&quot; every bit as vicious and corrupt as anything in Shantytown.This is a breathless hair-raising ride through a brave new world, as seen through the eyes of a man older than his years, and trapped by a conscience that still believes in justice."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"In THE BLACK MARIA, the Reader is transported to Philadelphia's celebration of the Centennial. Beneath the bright facade of the gala, a seedy, and to some appealing, underground culture festers in the neighboring Shantyville.Detective Wilton McCleary works at the Centennial: busting buzzers (pickpockets) during the day and giving swells (the well-to-do) guided tours to Shantyville at night. Soon enough, the two worlds brutally collide.Detective McCleary is an Everyman in search of salvation from his past. He endured the horrors of Andersonville and murders on gaslit streets of Philadelphia. He finds temporary solace on a train ride from Philadelphia to Mauch Chunk. This flair of Romantcism was welcomed and is something not recalled from Mark Graham's previous works.THE BLACK MARIA yields the aura of charm and digust simultaneously. A naive idealization of the past is abandoned and replaced with a dignity found only in objectivity. Graham's strength is his apparent knowledge of and fascination with Philadelphia's past.In the end, the Reader is as manipulated as McCleary. Both of whom are under the control of Graham. Graham gives us McCleary, who leads us through the labyrinthine world of old Philadelphia, and by doing so, he conditions us to his will. Mark Graham, at least in this novel, is the wizard behind the Centennial, pulling the chains that make this historical mystery function as a complete, nearly perfect, whole.(Even after three novels, there are still enough questions about McCleary to warrant a fourth. I suspect that hardcover fiction lies in the future.)"},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"the kind of book that excels in both description of a bygone era and is also tightly plotted and character driven.

A Must read."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"Shortly before reading The Black Maria, I read the highly touted Conspiracy of Paper. That book had great historical detail, but a weak mystery. What makes Mark Graham's book such a pleasure to read is the combination of fascinating history with a well plotted mystery. In this case, a mystery with an ending that took me completely by surprise. I was convinced I had it figured out, only to find I had been expertly fooled. Please Avon, publish Mark Graham's next book in hardcover and put some marketing behind it. He has earned the right to a Caleb Carr sized audience."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"This is a great book, and the author should be much better known by now.

I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Black Maria (Mystery of Old Philadelphia)","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this novel, the images of the Centennial fair in 1876 Philadelphia are very vivid, you can almost see all of the described sights. I was very disappointed in the mystery however. It all seemed too convoluted and confusing. The protagonist McCleary didn't impress me all that much. Everyone and their brother seems to be able to fool him. Not a great trait in a detective. However, the author is excellent in bringing back the atmosphere of the 1870's."},{"Title":"Caravaggio Books","review":"The author has done an excellent job of starting what I hope is a series. He still needs to smooth out his character dialogue style (no one uses the other person's name in every sentence of a conversation!), but the plot is well conceived, and the main character, Phil Costanza, is a likable--and believable--person. There is one pasasge in the book in which an old professor lays dying in the hospital. Costanza's interaction with the man (and with the attending physician before and after the death) and the description of the man's dying thoughts is truly a beautiful piece of writing. In fact, it's almost as if it were by a different, better writer. Hopefully, Mr. Peterson will extend this excellence throught his entire next book."},{"Title":"Caravaggio Books","review":"I picked this up at my library because I like these mysteries that have a bit of an intellectual conceit, such as the art-historical mysteries of Iain Pears, and it looked like a reasonable way to pass 2-3 hours. And it was. The plot didn't have many twists, and the resolution was not terribly surprising, but the characters and pacing more than made up for any weaknesses as a genre piece.So I looked to see what other books Peterson had, and found just one thing, from 1980, that might or might not have even been the same Peterson. This one was first published in 1992, but not published in paperback until Worldwide (the mystery division of Harlequin) picked it up in 1997, and apparently not re-published since then.Plenty of authors write a book or two but fall into, or remain in, obscurity, but there's something more poignant about it when the writer is clearly smart and talented. The book could have had a wide appeal: there are planty of other academic-themed mystery series, the characters display nuanced twists on the stock figures of the genre, the book has no present-tense violence (just discovered victims) and little profanity -- making it more appealing to tamer mystery fans -- yet is free from cats, aged amateur sleuths, and other elements that turn off fans of more serious mysteries.Maybe there's no mystery or tragedy. Maybe he had an idea for a book and got it out of his system. Maybe, as my ex-wife pointed out, he might have been single when he wrote the book and then got married and wanted to spend time with his family, or maybe he got a more demanding or satisfying job. Pretty good book, though."},{"Title":"Caravaggio Books","review":"Mr. Peterson does write very well. The plot and characters are well developed.To begin with, the story line revolves around two killings in a college library. Who killed a well liked retired professor and also a less well liked but very human graduate student. The protagonist, Detective Phillip Constanza is likeable and clever. Perhaps, too clever, for the reader who follows the thinking of Detective Constanza is cheated out of a proper denounement. The author never lets us in on his thinking, not even at the end. I couldn't decide if I was too slow on the uptake or the author was playing a bit of a game; perhaps, a mystery within a mystery. Peterson is good and by the way this is the first title in series, but I hope he gets better."},{"Title":"Here's Looking at You (Politics, Media, and Popular Culture, Vol. 3) (v. 3)","review":"Here's Looking at You takes a detailed look at the ever-changing relationship between Hollywood and the political arena. It not only focuses on how Washington affects the films that are made in Hollywood (from the age of the silent films through the end of the 20th century) but also how Hollywood has a certain level of effect on politics and how politics and politicians are viewed by the general public. Giglio uses numerous good examples from popular (and the not-so-popular) films to prove his numerous points. Here's Looking at You is well organized, with sections focusing on the cultural and economic backgrounds for the films made. One of the better and more abundant topics is his look at war, and how Hollywood will either support or deny support in favor of the war effort. Giglio also attemps to explain what it is that makes a film political. Although there is no obvious answer, he does use numerous examples from the media to serve as a basis for comparison. Overall, this book is a teaching tool for the younger generations. Giglio's obvious biased against certain genres or topics in film does make reading a little difficult, but the biased is accepted, if not ignored, for the quality information provided. Here's Looking at You is a fine example of the influence Hollywood has on the world, especially in the political spotlight."},{"Title":"Here's Looking at You (Politics, Media, and Popular Culture, Vol. 3) (v. 3)","review":"This is a good book. Giglio does a good job of surveying films with political content that were produced or distributed by Hollywood studios since the turn of the century. He has an interesting chapter on the treatment of lawyers in film with some interesting observations about female lawyers. He does a good job of introducing readers to film theories without going into depth. I used it in my undergraduate course on Politics and Film last semester. The students seemed to like it."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"J.G. Ballard's 1975 novel \\"High Rise\\" contains all of the qualities we have come to expect from this author: alarming psychological insights, a study of the profoundly disturbing connections between technology and the human condition, and an intriguing plot masterfully executed. Ballard, who wrote the tremendously troubling \\"Crash,\\" really knows how to dig deep into our troubling times in order to expose our tentative grasp of modernity. Some compare this book to William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and there are definite characteristics the two novels share. I would argue, however, that \\"High Rise\\" is more eloquent and more relevant than Golding's book. Unfortunately, this Ballard novel is out of print. Try and locate a copy at your local library because the payoff is well worth the effort.\\"High Rise\\" centers around four major characters: Dr. Robert Laing, an instructor at a local medical school, Richard Wilder, a television documentary producer, Anthony Royal, an architect, and the high rise building all three live in with 2,000 other people. Throughout the story, Ballard switches back and forth between these three people, recording their thoughts and actions as they live their lives in the new high-rise apartment building. Ballard made sure to pick three separate people living on different floors of the forty floor building: Laing lives on the twenty fifth floor, Wilder lives on the second floor, and Royal lives in a penthouse on the fortieth floor (befitting his status as the designer of the building). Where you live in this structure will soon take on an importance beyond life itself.At the beginning of the story, most of the people living in the building get along quite well. There are the usual nitpicky problems one would expect when 2,000 people are jammed together, but overall people move freely from the top to the bottom floors. A person living on the bottom floors can easily go to the observation deck on the top of the building to enjoy the view, or shop at the two banks of stores on the tenth and thirty-fifth floors. Children swim and play in the pools and playgrounds throughout the high rise without any interference. Despite the fact that well to do people live in the building, with celebrities and executives on the top floors, middle-class people on the middle floors, and airline pilots and the like on the bottom ten floors, everyone gets along reasonably well-at first.Then things change. The gossip level increases among the residents, and parties held on different floors start to exclude people from other areas. In quick succession, objects start to land on balconies, dropped by residents on higher levels. Equipment failures, such as electrical outages, lead to mild assaults between residents. Cars parked close to the building are vandalized, and a jeweler living on the fortieth floor does a swan dive out of the window. Every incident leads to further acts of violence and increasing chaos in the lives of those in the building. People begin to take a greater interest in what's going on where they live than in outside activities and jobs. As the violence escalates, elevators and lobbies on each floor turn into armed camps as the residents attempt to block any encroachments on their territory. What starts out as a book about living in a technological marvel quickly morphs into a study of how technology can cause human beings to regress back into primitivism. Moreover, Ballard tries to draw a correlation between the technology of the building and this descent into a Stone Age mentality. He shows in detail how the residents of the apartments sink back into the morass, passing through a classical Marxist structure of bourgeoisie-proletariat, moving on to a clan/tribal system, to a system of stark individuality. In short, Ballard tries to equate our striving towards individuality through technology with how we started out in our evolution as hunter-gatherers, as individuals seeking individual gains. The promise that technology will liberate the individual is not the highest form of evolution, argues Ballard, but is actually a return to the lowest forms of human expression.Within a few pages of the story, I thought this might turn out to be very similar to a Bentley Little book. Little, nominally a horror writer but often a social satirist, often takes a situation like this and shows how people collapse under the pressures of modern life. My belief was not born out, however, not because Ballard doesn't take certain situations over the top but because he imbues his work with a significant philosophical subtext that Little would never write about. Bentley Little is all about focusing on the over the top, outrageous incidents of humanity's decline, whereas Ballard is more interested in serving as a preacher on anti-humanistic technology, thundering out a jeremiad concerning where we might go if we do not take the time to think very carefully about the society we wish to create.\\"High Rise\\" is a dark, forbidding tale of woe that is sure to get a reaction from anyone who reads it. There seem to be few out there who can deliver such devastating blows to our love of technology as Ballard does in his works. This author is often referred to as a science fiction writer, but \\"High Rise\\" works just as well on a horror level. So does \\"Crash,\\" when I think about it, although the cold, detached prose of that book is not present in \\"High Rise.\\" Whatever genre Ballard falls into, this book delivers on every level."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"High-Rise is a compelling, modern take on De Sade, taking a look at the darker sides of a humanity with too little room and too much time. The prose reminded me of some great Sci-Fi Golden Age writing, descriptive without being flowery, chilling without gratuitous language. The author pulls off quite a feat in never once stooping to the level of his characters, and in doing so leaves one able to sympathize with even the most barbaric of them.Though I enjoyed the novel, I feel it goes on a bit farther than it should. Essentially, it is a take on the old 'worldship' stories, modified for an era that does not dream of the stars, all of which that I've read have been in a novella length, and well-served for it. While Ballard tries to fill every page with worthwhile words, one can almost see him straining to keep the work at novel length, rather than taking the pay cut that comes with short fiction. And, truly, a few repetitive scenes do little to distract from the overall story, and readers will get their money's worth with High-Rise.WARNING: dog lovers, this novel contains several scenes, including one quite pivotal one, of violence towards dogs. As previously noted, the prose never becomes grotesque, but still be warned."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"I would advise the young to follow up their college-class readings of LORD OF THE FLIES with this book, about the war of residents in a high-rise, in which the outside world seems to dissapear and all that matters is the world inside, and the struggle (quite literally!) to the top. This is the postmodern, techno-age version of LORD OF THE FLIES, and implies that instead of an island, we have created our own fortresses and islands, in our age of apartment buildings, condos, and antiseptic, sealed-off living spaces. But we can not escape from ourselves, after all."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"J. G. Ballard's High-Rise (1975) is a fascinating yet relentlessly mono-thematic novel inspired by the effects of overpopulation on society explored in earlier sci-fi masterpieces such as John Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar (1969) and Silverberg's The World Inside (1971) (both of which I prefer to High-Rise).The appeal lies more in Ballard's literary qualities and stylistic choices rather than the novel's ideas which are dominated (albeit, I'm being overly simplistic) by a virulent strain of \\"Lord of the Flies syndrome\\" afflicting adults, instead of children, crammed into an \\"island-like\\" building. Wine war paint instead of pig blood... Chowing on Alsatian dog instead of feral pig... etc.Plot Summary (limited spoilers)\\"Later, as he sat on his balcony eating the dog, Dr Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within his huge apartment building during the previous three months.\\"And so begins our protagonist's (antagonist?) relentlessly dark (and relentlessly predictable) apartment wanderings -- a crumbling society plagued (in increasing degrees) by flickering electricity, disturbed naked drunken rampages along dog pee filled elevators, rape, suicide, the self-destruction of the upper class.Laing is one of two thousand occupants of an ultra-modern apartment building for the wealthy which contains entertainment facilities, grocery stores, an endless supply of alcohol (a liquor store), swimming pools, and schools. A few minor inconveniences (a weak electricity supply, malfunctioning elevators) leads to the escalation of tension between the occupants.Although all the occupants are wealthy, those that live higher up band together against the lower floors and a \\"class struggle\\" breaks out. The ultra-wealthy dart down the stairs and allow their dogs to pee in the hallways and swimming pools of those lower in the building. The less wealthy dart upstairs on daring raids stealing items. The highest floors take on a perceived \\"Eden-like\\" quality and our main characters aspire to venture to the higher floors.Soon society devolves into an orgy of rape, extraordinary violence, primal urges, as all the elevators stop working, people stop attending work, and the food runs out. The occupants lose all their social restraint -- they lust after siblings, their friends' wives, etc. No one alerts the police... No one questions what is happening... The architect watching all from his high floor penthouse with his white alsatian...Final ThoughtsHigh-Rise is a beautifully written book. The collapse of society unfolds in a disturbed and occasionally, an achingly beautiful manner. Our characters are objects -- archetypal parts of Ballard's crumbling society -- we feel nothing for them. A haunting spectacle -- the spectacular suicide (and rebirth?) of a modern society held together by a tenuous facade that snaps under the vaguest tension...This is the first book by Ballard I've read and I'll definitely seek out more. Highly recommended for those not faint of heart!"},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"As unheimlich as it gets, High Rise is a story about people who lose their civilized selves in a violent, primitive orgy to ascend to the top of a culture entirely enclosed in a skyscraper. For some reason, it reminded me of the final scenes of The Wickerman movie, where no one remained to speak out against the uncontrolled barbarism of the community, there in a small village, here in a very elite group of condo dwellers. Of course, it's made clear that people are really violent, selfish brutes inside anyway; and any tear in the fabric of polite society will open us all to our evil selves.

Instead, it produces a ruthless hierarchy that only increases man's oppression and exploitation of his fellow human being. Basically, this s class warfare run amok, to the point where it becomes nothing but ultra-violent tribalism."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"I'd only add that, like all of Ballard's work, it's also very funny.Those of you who think this novel is unbelievable or preposterous have never lived in a large apartment complex."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"There's nothing Ballard loves more than microcosms (&quot;Rushing To Paradise&quot;, &quot;Concrete Island&quot;, &quot;Day of Creation&quot;) and in this one, he isolates the factors of human society and puts it up against our animal natures. The result is as fascinating as it is ultimately horrible. Very well-written, and strong both as a novel that raises a philosophical question and as a straight-ahead horror novel.On a side note, I found this book in print, new editions, in a couple of major Canadian bookstore chain in Montreal. Yet it doesn't seem to be in print in the U.S. What's up?"},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"\\"Hell is other people\\": this estimation by Jean Paul Sartre might be used to summarise this book, which could alternatively be described as a modern-day \\"Lord of the Flies\\". Yet I felt constantly alienated by the lack of psychological insights into any of the characters: I ended up not particularly empathising with any of them, or even clearly differentiating them. Perhaps the author intended precisely this reaction in the reader. The descriptions of the details of characters' behaviours read almost in an academic style, albeit without any typical failings of academic writing: this book is easy to read, and conveys a brilliant claustrophobia through the words. I did like the sexual analyses, though I personally believe that human beings have the definite capabilities to create societies less like that of chimpanzees and more like bonobos'. However, the portrayals of objective observations are accompanied by a frustrating sketchiness of the human characters. The reader is constantly told precisely what characters are doing, but with no deeper reflections as to why. Indeed, this may reflect the focus of the plot, whereby the building itself is more vivid, pervasive and 'alive' than any of the people physically and psychologically trapped inside. However in the end I found reading this book strangely dissatisfying, because I felt that the writing failed to capture or portray any particularly in-depth illuminations of any of the characters."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"It didn't give me nightmares, but... Ok! High-Rise is one of Ballard's best, but it's extremely disturbing. It's much more readable than his dark, freakish &quot;Crash,&quot; but just as powerful.One of SF's finest craftsman, Ballard is an expert at revealing insights towards human nature. Thus, after decades, his works are not dated, as much of the genre's works are. Like any decent SF, this was written not about where we are headed, but about where we already are. And this book is about the violent tendencies to human nature, and as long as we stay this way, this book will be important.Violent, weird, violent again, but powerful."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"I've read this book twice now, and I wouldn't say it's my favourite Ballard book so far, which isn't to say it doesn't have its good points. Freakish, creepy and obsessive, the story tracks the disintegration of a newly-built highrise from the pinnacle of modern convenience to a twisted and perverse enclosed world of primitive survival.I found a lot of repetition in the narrative, which got a little annoying at times. Typical themes found so frequently through Ballard's work are here - internal psychology in relation to external environment, voyeurism and perversion of the affluent, and so on. Some parts even made me feel quite squeamish, and I wouldn't say this would be one for the fainthearted.Certainly worth the read for Ballard fans and fans of literature in a similar vein, I don't think this would be my first choice to new readers."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"I spent years waiting for this novel. And then I finally got it from my wife for my birthday. I have to say that I was quite disappointed.First, the conflict in the story is presented in such a fashion that it is hard to be anything but detached from it. While I am aware that I am from Generation Why and am divorced from the concept of caring about fictional or real characters and their trials and tribulations, the fact of the matter is that it was remarkably difficult to really care about ANYTHING that happened in this book, including the gang rape of the inhabitants of the tower.What should have been an interesting study in the strife and malfunction of human relationships, the stranding of a thousand people on a desert island in the middle of a society that they are functionally free to escape to at any time, was underdeveloped and overprocessed. The result was that a wonderful story premise was destroyed. We know why three or four of the characters stayed in the tower. What about the rest? We only know anything about three of the characters in the entire story, and their motivations seem...lacking for the determination to survive and thrive in this environment that they are presented in.If you want a dystopian epic about what can go wrong in a building like this, go pick up Neal Stephenson's The Big U. It is far more credible and far more entertaining. Much better overall.The two good things about this: The first paragraph and the last page. The nihilism and the destruction wrought by the people in the first tower makes reading the book tolerable. And the first paragraph is the single most interesting beginning of a story that I have ever read. These two things are why it is getting a star above minimum.Go read something better. This is overrated.Harkius"},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"Anyone that would sell a horse with a bad limp for the same price as a horse without a limp deserves at least a review written on it.

Ballard's premise, the isolation of the building and its shift into unexpected but psychologically natural warfare, had me expecting _Watership Down_, and the passage with the gulls suggests that Ballard might have been expecting the same, but that isn't exactly what we got.This is a fever dream of a rootless humanity with no loyalties, no strong emotions, and no understanding of or desire for either; it rings false. The author does not know what people really act like under these kinds of pressures (though a study of the literature of the two World Wars, fiction as well as memoirs and history, would certainly have told him); but he does know, and laboriously depicts, the set of behaviors that modern literary critics would tell him would occur. It is true enough, as the narrator openly states, that the model for these characters' behaviors is postmodern man, not primitive man; but the defining trait of the postmodern is insulation from difficult physical realities -- hunger, death, pain, war, disease -- and postmodernity tends not to last when this insulation has disappeared.The author's eye is inaccurate in general; one small but telling detail is the mention of a shotgun halfway through the book, and the comment that the inhabitants of the high-rise had a tacit agreement that they would settle their conflicts \\"by physical means alone.\\" This sort of understanding (an implausibility which this book shares with _The Napoleon of Notting Hill_, in both cases probably due to their authors' aesthetic preference for melee weapons) would last only until someone decided that victory was more important than tacit agreements -- in other words, until someone had been truly and deeply insulted, or found that someone or something that he really valued had been put in danger. Bursts of this sort of real violence happen even in our own more stable society; in a context like this, busily unravelling into a Nietzchean fairyland, they would be all but constant. (Nor does this mention the utter failure of everyone present to involve the police, and indeed the failure of the police, the military, the building inspectors, the insurance companies, and so on to take any interest whatsoever in the high-rise, if nothing else for their own financial self-interest. I'm familiar with what Barzun calls \\"the loss of nerve characteristic of periods of decadence,\\" but this takes the cake; if Wilder had actually burned down the building as Laing had imagined, think of the life-insurance payouts alone...)This sort of spurious depiction is probably most painful because much better works have covered this subject, or elements of it. Perhaps the closest analogy to High-Rise is G.K. Chesterton's _The Napoleon of Notting Hill_ (now out of copyright, and readily available on-line). Bill Mauldin's _Up Front_ is one of many memoirs of the World Wars -- and the trench warfare of the Italian campaign of 1943-5 saw physical conditions similar to this book's, but with quite different consequences. Post-apocalyptic fiction is a thriving, if often irresponsible, genre; for psychological truths relevant to this book's subject matter, I would recommend Aldous Huxley's _Ape and Essence_ and Walter Miller's _A Canticle for Leibowitz_. And, of course, for a work dealing with the same themes, but with conclusions as different as its physical trappings, I'd recommend Richard Adams' _Watership Down_."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"One element of this wonderful, chilling novel the reviewers here miss is just how funny it is."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"And it's more affordable than the used editions sold here!....."},{"Title":"High-Rise","review":"I found this story to be totally unbelieveable and depressing. I realize that a distopic satire is not generally uplifting, but I have read many others that were more effective, and placed me in a vividly described future in which I could imagine myself being compelled to behave the same horrific way as the characters they describe. An example is George Orwell's 1984. Unlike the Orwellian future, the high rise didn't seem like a real place in which the characters would truly have behaved the way they did. I never felt an empathy for any of the characters in High Rise that would have made this example of the genre effective. If you are an eternal pessimist who has no real hope for humanity, maybe you will enjoy this book. I don't believe that simply living in a high rise building with 2000 occupants would cause wealthy people to stuff excrement into the poorer peoples' air conditioning vents. I don't believe that if people were forcing the elevators to remain on a single floor, violently preventing occupants from using certain floors, throwing furniture off balconies and damaging expensive cars, that nobody would call the police.

The most important concept I came away with is the advice to speak to your cat intelligently, & to treat him as a sentient being who bears personhood & with respect. I agree with the author that this is crucial. Even if your cat does not fully pick up on all of your complex human vocabulary, as Ms. Moyes elaborately fantasizes that hers do - your cat *will* pick up on your intent, the tone of your feelings towards him, & the spirit in which you speak to him. Her method of developing a call signal to find a lost cat is also of practical value. If you come away with these points, you've got the basics.That said...This author's narcissistic \\"snitty british\\" arrogant writing tone propelled by almost purely emotional reasoning drove me up a wall........ The author struck me as overly self-involved & almost completely lost in her own personal fantasies about what is going on with her cats to the point of living in a dream world, made for one. After page 20 this slowly became nauseating, & a stifling urge to scream settled in & stayed.In this book, the author haughtily purports herself to be everyone's Conscience concerning their pet. She makes striking statements that anyone who would ever opt to declaw a cat - or to solely house them indoors - is better off not having one at all. Apparently, this individual would rather see stray animals piled up dead on the floors of kill shelters, than to be adopted to live by apartment pet regulations concerning declawing, or kept safely indoors. My thought was, \\"How dare you...\\" The author needs to reach beyond a myopic, single-minded love of Siamese cats & an upper class lifestyle to develop some concept of how many hundreds of thousands of cats are left unclaimed & unadopted to die in shelters every single day, claws intact. This is reality.But then...she imagines that in spite of the plethora of feline breeds & mixes available, every person would *only* want to keep a Siamese cat, if they only knew their nature, as a matter of course. After reading her descriptions of her cats' behavior, I've never been more glad to have a DSH in my care. However, if you do keep a Siamese - get the book. It may help you realize you're not alone in your Siamese's unique antics. Most of the information here pertains only to them & does not generalize out well at all to other breeds. I could not relate at least 60% of the content to my own cat's personality, habits, feelings, & behavior. Or any other cat I've known, for that matter. Or, if you are interested in a purely anecdotal personal \\"case study\\" account of one person's experience of Siamese behavior - you may find this book's giddy ramblings entertaining. Be prepared to wade through mounds of ego & narrow subjectivity to get to the informational content you seek.However - if you are looking for a truly resourceful book on how to communicate with your cat...look elsewhere. Don't let one woman's endless egocentric carrying on bend your mind concerning your cat. Some far better suggestions for books on this topic would be:* \\"The Language of Animals: 7 Steps To Communicating With Animals\\" by Carol Gurney* \\"CatSpeak\\" by Bash Dibra, reknowned animal trainer* \\"The Cat Whisperer\\" by Claire Bessant* \\"Animal Talk\\" by Penelope Smith* \\"277 Secrets Your Cat Wants You To Know: A Catalog of Unusual & Interesting Information\\" by Paulette Cooper & Paul Noble* \\"Cat Owner's Manual\\" by Dr. Bruce Fogle - written by a Veterinarian, this is the single most helpful cat book I've found yet.There are SO MANY better titles out there on the topic of human/feline communication with helpful, useful information surpassing this stifling narration.To be perfectly honest... And I can't believe I'm saying this... I finished the book thinking, \\"I am so grateful I am not Ms. Moyes' cat.....\\" And screamed into a pillow."},{"Title":"How to talk to your cat (A Signet book)","review":"This book is a jewel.

The beginning contained some &quot;historical&quot; information, which I found sketchy considering the author had no credentials or references. The argument that this woman gave for how cats became domesticated wasn't convincing. Regardless, there was a decent section in the middle about picking a cat (if you got past her feelings about purebreds), communicating with your cat, and what the different &quot;miaows&quot; and body language mean that I found interesting and useful. Otherwise, the book is filled with stories of her Siamese cats and their world travels, unlikely circumstances involving the one cat being lost for 2 weeks, and many, many opinions.

Most importantly, it tests the chivalry hypothesis: the idea that judges would like to protect women from the criminal justice system rather than put them in it.Though this book is small in terms of pages, it is filled with rigorous, hardcore statistics. It takes a while to read, therefore. Authors note information from California, North Carolina, and Minnesota: it is geographically diverse. The books best chapter is the one on African-American women in the criminal justice system.Some may view this book as dated. However, the dynamics to which they point are still pressing issues. The book says most women are convicted fro drug offenses, not violent crimes. That is still true and \\"get tough on crime\\" laws of the late 1980s and 1990s have exacerbated that situation. Like when the book was released, Black women made up only 12% of the female American population, but the majority of female inmates. Sadly, so many tragic trends continue approximately 25 years later.This book would be good for numbers crunchers and for criminal justice majors looking to snag a statistic or two for papers, especially ones for feminist professors."},{"Title":"Daughters of the House","review":"The English writer Mich&egrave;le Roberts wrote Daughters of the House.

Most southerners that I know do not know why or even care that their kitchens are so small. I happen to live in a house with a large kitchen, a huge front porch, and a small back porch. I don't know the how or why the original builder of the house decided to include a very large kitchen, but I, being a Yankee, love having a large kitchen.Kitchens in the south were the domain of domestic help, and the cultural norm was not to provide a great deal of space for the help. That tells us something about cultural attitudes even though most of us no longer can afford to employ domestic help. I would conclude the obvious then, that buildings do not learn on their own: They need to be nudged to catch up with current realities--just like school kids who want to skip school.At present, I am trying to figure out what to do with my front porch that just collects garden furniture laden with dust. I don't need an extra room and have no desire at this time to screen the porch in. Screening is too obvious. What to do?The small back porch has already been enclosed and has \\"learned\\" to be a mud room for our two pet canines when it's too hot or cold for them to stay outside or when it's raining.Perhaps by the time I have finished reading this wonderful book, I'll know what to do about the idiot front porch.I love this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"A great review, from the experience, of the dynamics of buildings.

By well put together I mean that it is not only wellwritten, but well illustrated. The photographs are excellent and help explainthe topic under discussion.The book is about how buildings change over time. Brand shows numerousexamples of how different buildings have changed with use. More important heexplains what makes a building that can improve and adapt to new uses as itages. This is important for architecture since builds often last longer than thepeople who design and build them. At some point they may be put to uses thatwere never anticipated when they were built.The author, who is an architect, is highly critical of how his collegesdesign buildings. Most buildings are designed without any thought for theoccupants. Nor is any thought given to the uses the building will be put to inthe future. Few buildings are designed so they can adapt to unanticipated uses.In brands opinion the more impressive the design of the building the less usefulit will be to it's occupants.Brand offers advise and examples on how to make a building that will lastand be used and loved by its occupants for a long time. These rules are fairlysimple. Several good examples are included. This is the most important part ofthe book.I read this book about architecture even though I am not an architect andhave no particular interest in the subject.

I would have liked however more contemporary examples of buildings with specific illustrations to make the subject matter more current to our existing design practices.

This brilliant, readable, and richly ilustrated book makes the same point again and again, in every architectural idiom that's lasted and especially in the ones that haven't. Longevity implies adaptation to changing uses. That includes configurable and customizable interior spaces, as well as walls that can be knocked down easily for expansion and new construction. Between renovations, the building must also be kept alive; the things that make its systems easy to modify also make the building easy to care for and repair. In other words, success means all the things that modern \\"architected\\" buildings aren't. Once you've really understood this wise book, just about every construction that fails in its purpose without actually falling down can be understood, and those failures predicted. MIT's misconceived Stata Center fits the failure pattern perfectly, being unmaintainable, unmodifiable, and unwilling or unable to address a future different from its present. Ironically, the very failure of that MIT building cuild have been averted using the lessons Brand learned during his residence at MIT's Media Lab.If you love buildings, you'll see what makes them lovable. If you've lived through at least one renovation, you'll see spelled out much of what you learned the hard way. And if you have a building that just isn't working, no matter how, you must read this book to understand why. This is a fitting companions to Christopher Alexander's book on design for living and for purpose. It covers the other decades or centuries of a building's life after initial design: the living redesign as it's repurposed, or its spiritual if not physical death, when purpose changes but the building can't.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"This book is incredibly interesting, and very enticing on a Sunday afternoon. The photos that accompany the text are always appropriate. And the text is theoretically oriented without being too dense. Well done."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"It is no surprise that the creator of the Whole Earth Catalogue decided to take a close look at buildings; because how we live shapes -- and is shaped by -- the what and where of our living spaces. Brand's driving idea here is that buildings are never static. Far from being the unchanging \\"given\\" we often suppose it to embody, architecture flows. The goal is to figure out which buildings are most adaptive over the longest spans and use that new knowledge to build for change. One of the most important pointers is to spend more on basic Structure, and less on finishing. Finish changes with taste and necessity -- last century's factory remade as a postwar office building to become a 70s artists' co-op and now a mini-mall with boutiques and a Starbucks. Substantial structures can and will learn new functions. Most radical of all is the suggestion to eschew a mortgage. Sixty percent of the final cost of a building is interest paid to a bank. Why not build a small, finished core building or a large but rudimentary building, using what would usually be considered down-payment money? Absent mortgage payments there will then be cash available to continue building -- and a chance to see what might develop. Every new owner sees projects-in-waiting immediately after moving in -- why not plan for that? (This is my own advice to would-be \\"alternative\\" householders, but there is no reason it shouldn't apply to commercial builders as well as homesteaders.) The overall lesson one draws from the photos, plans and text in this comprehensive work is this: buildings exist in and morph through time. The ones that last -- that we love to inhabit, to look at, to feel -- have learned and been encouraged to learn. Teach your buildings well. Brand's sendoff is appropriate for this review: \\"What about the building you see when you look up from this book? Go do something timely to it.\\""},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"What non-architect can dislike a book that so wittily exposes the follies of Frank Lloyd Wright, I. M. Pei, and Buckminster Fuller? Furthermore, as the owner of an unusually shaped structure myself, I can give personal testimony to the validity of Brand's thesis that the best buildings are those incorporating simple designs that can be easily maintained and easily modified. (Ironically, Brand spends some pages describing his own conversion of a tugboat into a houseboat--the result charming but screaming cramped living and eternal maintenance.) The illustrations and their captions are themselves worth the price of the book; I several times returned fascinated to the many fine photos of buildings as they had been modified through the years. No wonder the BBC was able to make a six-part series from this book."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"Stewart Brand has a well-deserved reputation as a visionary iconoclast. The founder of the Whole Earth Catalog has been challenging our preconceptions for many, many years. With \\"How Buildings Learn\\" he turns his finely-honed analytical and futurist abilities on architecture and construction.This book is primarily synthetic in its focus. There aren't any brand-new ideas here, but there are many powerful methods and ways of thinking from other disciplines that Brand has brought to bear on the problem of making buildings that stand the test of time. Those whose backgrounds are not as diverse as Brand's (and whose is, really?), will be exposed to many unconventional ways of thinking about buildings. The reader will come away with a powerful sense of possibility and a deeper understanding of the built environment.Whether you're an expert or simply have an interest in the structures we build around ourselves, you'll find much to admire in this thought-provoking exploration of buildings through time. It's every bit as relevant and ground-breaking today as it was when it was published."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"This is a book someone foisted upon me unawares and I devoured. I write software for a living and I found this book has a lot to say about software that Brand probably doesn't realize he's saying. His constant return to Christopher Alexander is a dead giveaway: The pattern-language movement Alexander started took the software world by storm in the mid 90's. It is now generally assumed that the pattern-language movement in software is still unfolding. The authors of the first major pattern-language texts are heavily involved in the kind of \\"Agile\\" design processes that one associates with what Brand advocates in this book: the idea that the end is the beginning and understanding your work must be an evolutionary process where if it's done right, a building and a system is never finished and never perfect but always improving."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"I am an acoustical and systems design consultant who specializes in worship and performing arts facilities, and use this book regularly in my practice. I have found no better resource for introducing the facility planning \\"layperson\\" to the enormous blind-spot that many in the architectural design and construction profession have regarding the relevance of buildings to the functional needs that should define their design, as well as the ongoing process of maintaining this relevance over time.While highly specialized rooms such as auditoria do not usually lend themselves to significant modification over time, or to strategies such as \\"loose fit,\\" Brand's advice about the risk of architectural experimentation in the fundamental form of most buildings is spot on. This book is an extremely engaging read, and also serves as an excellent introduction to other key literature on architectural programming, scenario planning, the evolution of the architectural profession, and so forth.As other reviewers have suggested, anyone who lives or works in a building can profit from reading this book. I would add that anyone who works in the construction or facility management industries, or who expects to be involved in planning a building project from the perspective of the owner or user, has a duty to seek out the sort of education that this book provides."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"Anyone interested in architecture or historical preservation would probably enjoy the observations and case studies in this book. Brand has a new, fascinating idea to examine what makes building livable, and to look at what happens to structures in the decades after they are built. Good thinking, and maybe this could be the beginning of a new area of architectural scholarship. Recommended!"},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"This book is one of my required texts for my master's degree in historic preservation. Preservationists are often overly concerned with restoring buildings to a specific period and this book should change their minds! The concept of a building as a living breathing CHANGING entity is something that anyone involved with buildings should take to heart. Brand's book is well written and easy to read, and anyone who has ever been in love with a building should read it"},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"As a lover of old buildings, I have often wondered why it is some buildings are almost universally loved and others not, why some building manage to stay around for centuries while others fall victim to a wrecking ball before they are even half a century old. Brand has a lot to say about these topics and about the how and why of building survival and adaption. His book, unlike this review, was fascinating and I devoured in book in one day. I'm sure I annoyed my husband with my nearly constant interruptions of \\"Listen to this!\\" which were followed by my reading aloud some particularly striking point. Brand's prose style is a delight; his points are well made and easily understood by a layman. Buy this book and read it, you won't regret it (unless you are an architect or architectural student). If you are an architect, you should still read it, but you will probably regret it as it should cause you some painful re-thinking of your entire approach to building.BEST NONFICTION BOOK I'VE READ in a year or two."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"Until reading this book (which I have only half devoured so far), my idea of preservation was returning a structure to its appearance as originally built. Brand makes a thoroughly persuasive argument for allowing buildings to retain those alterations they colllect over the years. The text is straight forward, engaging, the time progression pictures are fascinating. Overall, among my few favorite books about architecture, preservation, or human adaptability. Excellent."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"The best part of this book is its historical photos, a history of our society told by its buildings. Worst part is its premise: that once we understand the importance of adaptability in buildings, we will build differently.The fact remains building owners will never pay more than is necessary to meet their forseeable needs. (And if it weren't for building codes, even health and safety would be compromised.)Another point: Although he values ordinary buildings, and wants an architecture free of pretense, pretense of some sort is the essence of architecture, which, as Frank Lloyd Wright said, begins where function ends. Do we really want a world of plain utilitarian structures?So the book ends up being more of a criticism of our short-sighted culture, using buildings as examples. The arguments may not hold water, but the vast amount of research that obviously went into this book to document how buildings change over the decades still makes it interesting."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"the point made by the author is a very good one: we all have to look at the way buildings were once built and integrate the intrinsic knowledge into what we architects are doing today. The pictures in the book are very interesting and illustrate this beautifully. Regrettably the author continues his point in a way that is less convincing, by critisizing every main building breakthrough of the last century and concluding that the traditional methods were better. Alas, the world did change, and we will have to find new solutions to our worlds' problems by looking ahead aswell as to the past."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"I've learned a lot from Brand's commonsensical, and in some ways, humanist approach. The delight he takes in the messy business of human life is exemplary. However, he sets up a false opposition - there's no real conflict between buildings which adapt and flow with change, and the grandeur of enlightenment monumentalism. The latter will undoubtedly benefit from paying more attention to flexibility, but needn't completely pack its bags in the process. I'm just back from the Sky Garden in Osaka - really, there's nothing Brand's wider philosophy could approve of in such a modernist temple, but it embodies aspects of humanity that an avowedly low-key architecture never could. For all that, HBL should be compulsory reading for all kinds of designers and engineers.

It is a very good book and like everyone says it is common sence. Or is it, It does not seem to be commen sence to most architects.I thought architecture was as taught in this book, but my elusions where shattered, it seems architects just want to fit in, or thay want there building to look good to a viewer sitting in another building staring at the photograph on the front cover of a magazine.I have also wondered about software architecture, and am just starting to see the connections.

There is much to be criticized about architectural process & the industry. But what a chiding, morally superior, sneering repetitive text.

What a drag to read. And any insight is now buried under the boilerplate assumptions of the next architectural phases this kind of writing ushered in. Not timeless."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"I've hesitated to review this book because I'm personally suspicious of glowing praise. However, this book deserves it. Brand's starting point is the observation that most architects spend most of their time re-working or extending existing buildings, rather than creating new ones from scratch, but the subject of how buildings change (or, to adopt Brand's metaphor, how buildings learn from their use and environment) is ignored by most architectural schools and theorists. By looking at examples (big and small, ancient and modern), Brand teases out patterns of re-use and change, and argues (very convincingly) that since buildings are going to be modified many times, they should be designed with unanticipated future changes in mind. Of course, the same is true of programs, and I found again and again that I could substitute the word &quot;program&quot; for &quot;building&quot;, and &quot;programmer&quot; for &quot;architect&quot;, everything Brand said was true of computing as well (but much better written than any software engineering polemic I've ever read)."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"Stewart Brand's How Buildings Learn: What happens after they're built is as much a reflection of his life as it is about architecture. This potent clearly written essay provides valuable insights for a wider ranging audience while poking fun at established norms in the information age. Depreciatory of modernism casting doubt on the success of popular monuments paying homage to their creators, Brand does not limit his criticism of Wright for Falling Water in southwestern Pennsylvania or I.M. Pei's Media Lab Building at MIT. The strength of the book is the candid and thoughtful approach, interrelating complex issues with simple strands. Weaving a tale of old stuff in a new world, Brand proposes that buildings are most useful to their occupants and neighbors when they adapt. He assures that change will happen and that the only enduring monuments are those that can transform with time. Brand relies on a variety of primary and secondary sources and reinforces his examples with candid photographs, often visually comparing and contrasting to make his points. For each of these archetypes he tests the building against its function to perform basic living needs. He candidly makes observations without concern for political correctness within the broader architectural community.Proposing six shear levels within a building based on their ability to temporally adapt, How Buildings Learn uses Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space, and Stuff as a highly successful outline in delivering its message (p. 13). One source attributes this paradigm to that developed by British architect and historian F. Duffy's \\"Four S's\\" of capital investment in buildings. The site is eternal, yet often ignored by architects. The structure is most permanent defining the form and lasting 30 to 300 years. The skin is the part the architects get to play with. The services change every 10 to 15 years and, for ease of adaptation, should be kept separate to allow slippage from structure. The space (interior partition and pedestrian flow) and people's stuff change continually at the will of the occupants. After defining these layers, Brand then maps how buildings acclimatize over time based on their architecture.The architecture is divided into three paths: low road, high road, and monumental. As a counter-culturalist, Brand observations should surprise no one that those dysfunctional places revered by society adapt the worse while despised \\"low visibility, low-rent, no-style\\" structures are functional, cost effective, and adapt easily to change. Contrasting the \\"temporary\\" World War II government warehouse Building 20 at MIT to I.M. Pei's Media Lab on the same campus, Brand illustrates his points with human testimonies and photographs. Though scheduled for demolition a number of times over the decades, Building 20's adaptable character has resisted. On the contrary, it appears the only forces retaining the overly designed and dysfunctional Media Lab are economic and social: the millions of dollars expended for its construction and the people that approved the funding for a monument to its designer. High Road buildings are high maintenance, described by Brand as a \\"labor of love measured in lifetimes.\\" Citing original work by the Duchess of Devonshire, he attributes the character of these buildings to \\"high intent, duration of purpose, and a steady supply of confident dictators\\" (p. 35).Unlike Low Road buildings that demonstrate value through utility, or High Road buildings that endure for their beauty and majesty, the worst buildings for adaptation are Famous buildings. For this arena, Brand has a target-rich environment. One book reviewer describes these buildings as \\"ignoring time, while time does not reciprocate.\\" Because of its leaky roofs, Falling Water becomes, \\"Rising Mildew\\" and a \\"seven-bucket building\\" (p 58.) Famous buildings cannot adapt. They either exist as monuments to their creators, requiring significant investment to preserve, or as relics on the landscape succumbing to the forces of nature disintegrating into the landscape upon which they sit. Brand applied a similar logical approach to contrast exposed building elements. The Eiffel Tower, though despised by the locals at its inception, now stands as a monumental icon to the technical advances of the early twentieth century. The structure is beautiful in the nude. On the contrary, the exposed systems on the twenty-first century Pompidou Centre - originally celebrated for innovation and creativity - are now rusted and cracked. Without intervention, Famous buildings are destined to return to the landscape from which they were created.How Buildings Learn mirrors Brand's interest in preservation and high technology. While one might interpret preservation and modern construction materials as diametrically opposed disciplines, Brand alleys these concerns. The chapters on Preservation and Maintenance allude to the desirable attributes of quiet, populist, victorious, and romantic. The space materials create environmental stewardship through their speed, efficiency, strength and effortless implementation. Traditional or \\"vernacular\\" materials will be touchable and aesthetic but come at a higher price. Smart materials, created from advanced processes, are cheaper and may provide the economic incentive to preserve an old building that might otherwise succumb to the financial pressures created by vernacular restoration. Brand suggests that future buildings will learn more quickly. He uses computer advances in sensory and motor response as metaphors; however, does not suggest to what part of his six \\"S's\\" illustration this prediction relates.As a matter of fact, Stewart Brand has a history of predicting technical change and has built a contrarian consulting organization around this ability. Unlike most management consultants, yet consistent with How Building Learn, Brand helps companies adapt - designing for impending change instead of planning for a strategic future outcome. As Fortune magazine paraphrased him, \\"If mind-boggling change is the only constant, focusing on the avoidance of major blunders yields better results than the single-minded pursuit of the big win.\\""},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"In a review in _The Last Whole Earth Catalog_ (1971), author Stewart Brand wrote: &quot;We're not into utopian thinking around here, preferring a more fiasco-by-fiasco approach to perfection.&quot;This perfectly captures the central thesis of _How Buildings Learn_: Once built, buildings do and must _change_ to fit the changing needs of their inhabitants. The interiors may be remodeled, roofs raised, additions made, plumbing and wiring added, rerouted or remodeled, &amp; etc. Single-family brownstones become apartment buildings, homely warehouses may become lofts for artists and high-tech startups, and mansions may be turned into museums.Good buildings can be changed gracefully; bad ones resist change. Brand shows us many examples of each. In many cases, &quot;vernacular&quot; architecture -- rather plain structures that wouldn't earn a place in an architect's resume -- prove the most suited to change. Brand reserves considerable fury for prestiege projects that seem more to serve the architect's ego than the inhabitants' practical use.I'm not an architect, student of architecture, or what-have-you, so I don't know how this book ranks with other critiques of architecture. I can say that I found it immenseley informative, persuasive, and readable."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"\`Buildings That Learn' covers the adaptation over time of buildings to tenant needs, often hindered by all of: the \`fixed solution in year xyza' aesthetic architects; the vagaries of the real-estate market; and the short-lifetime of modern buildings (quality not increased at same or better rate of increase in human life over centuries). Interestingly, software \`guru' Ed Yourdon flagged up similar problems hindering software productivity and quality in his \`Rise &amp; Fall of the American Programmer' (e.g. non-customer focus, markets prices &amp; labor costs, poor quality development etc..).Addressing the building layers (site, structure, skin, services, space plan and \\"stuff\\") through a logical sequence of chapters, to get the most out of this book deserves a thorough read rather than a surface glance. The deeply referenced &amp; illustrated, entertaining chapters span:Flow- introduction and the time dimension; Shearing Layers- of the different rates of change in buildings; \\"Nobody Cares What You Do In There\\": The Low Road- easy adaptation in cheap buildings; Houseproud: The High Road- refined adaptation in long-lasting sustained-purpose buildings; Magazine Architecture: No Road- where tenants needs ignored for photo-aesthetics; Unreal estate- and markets sever continuity in buildings; Preservation: A Quiet, Popularist, Conservative, Victorious Revolution- to address incontinuity and frustrate innovators; The Romance of Maintenance- and preservation; Vernacular: How Buildings Learn from Each Other- and respect for design wisdom of older buildings; Function Melts Form: Satisficing Home and Office; The Scenario-buffered Building; and Built for Change- imagining buildings inviting adaption.Strengths include: the great depth of reference material, illustrations and evidence; easy-readability; an insiders' window on the international world of architects and civil engineers; and suitability for wide audience including lay-people interested in the built-environment and society, as well as complex systems architects (hard engineering or software development).Rarely the text becomes a bit rambling (more sidebars or bulleted lists?) and repetitive with unsupported assertions- but that is the only negative. Improvements could include an additional chapter cross-referencing (learning from?) \`adaptive systems', \`scenario planning' etc.. from the other professions that explicitly use these approaches to develop longer-term customer-centric complex adaptive systems.Overall a great read, that encourages re-evaluation of living and working space (don't accept those dis-functional anonymous boxes behind the trendy outer skin!). \`How Buildings Learn' is best read with both something like \`E-topia' by Mitchell (Architect and Computer Scientist at MIT) for a visionary (and sometimes contradictory) view of the future of the built environment; and Schumacher's \`Small is Beautiful' for a sustainable economic-development viewpoint."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"I liked this book so much I bought one for my sister who lives in a bungalow (explained in the book), one for my father, one for me (and then a replacement when that got lost). The book is fascinating for people interested in buildings but also a good lesson in planning, executing and followup on anything. The chapters talk about how you can design to be just-right (which never is) or for flexibility and the one on maintenance (with a wild story about the replacement beam for New College that was planted hundreds of years earlier). Software particularly, which is my field. It's now assigned reading for the technical writers who work for me. Buy it."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"This book, while it has nothing to do with software, has everything to do with the nature of complex systems - which means, of course, that it has everything to do with software. Every software engineer and systems architect I've shared this book with has immediately recognized the content for the allegory that it is. Were Brand to simply replace 'Building' with 'System' throughout the book, he'd make a mint in the software industry. I introduce software people to this book by handing them a well-worn copy and asking them to comment and argue in the margins. It has spawned an epiphany of content. It, &quot;The Design of Everyday Things,&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; will be manditory reading in my shop. Oh, the book might have something to say about buildings, too."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"When I started reading the book I felt myself in agreement with much of what Brand has to say. Eventually I began to have nagging doubts which eventually crystallized. The title is a poor match for the content and part of the problem is one of the things Brand talks about: no one really knows how buildings learn or what happens after they've been built because the architecture profession hasn't been interested in those things. Brand makes a lot of suggestions but by the end of the book you realize he hasn't synthesized a whole from the many conflicting parts.Is exposing services good or bad? When he talks about MIT's Building 20 he likes exposed services. When he talks about the Pompidou Centre in Paris he doesn't. We should build of masonry because it lasts forever. No, masonry is hard to change and we should use wood. Wood requires too much upkeep so we should use metal roofs. But metal buildings are ugly. But anything more than 100 years old is beautiful. We should build for the ages but it should be affordable so we don't have to take out a mortgage to do so. Flat roofs are bad (even though they promote vertical growth) but rectagular walls are best (because they make additions easy). Overly specified buildings are bad but then he goes on for pages about how he turned a barge into a house. It should be somewhat specific because open architecture overwhelms us with the possibilities, but it shouldn't be TOO specific.It isn't until the final two chapters that he actually has some concrete suggestions and then you realize most of the book he has been arguing against a strawman.The best part of the book are the photos, often showing the same building or neighboor over the spans of a few decades, really driving home how buildings can and do change."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"The book is about buildings -- but read this as a metaphor and you'll see that he is also talking about how we change as a society. I read this book and thought about the computer industry -- how computer systems change as the learn about users. This is a clever book and informative. Read it with an open mind and you may find more than what is in the pages."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"An inspiring meander that outlines a gaping hole in architectural thought and practice, and well-written enough that one of the personal anecdotes almost made this grown engineer cry. What Brand suggests about four-dimensional architecture contributes (along with other such thoughts by Alexander and related thoughts from disparate sources such as d'Estree Sterk and Rybczynski) to a still-developing architectural outlook that incorporates human-building interactions and the consideration of time - an outlook that holds much promise and should be further investigated by building professionals and architectural theorists alike."},{"Title":"How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built","review":"I'm always fascinated with how seemingly impersonal forces effect changes over time. This book is about exactly that: Although people are responsible for changes to a building, over a long period of time and many owners the reasons for the changes become obscure and the effects of many different changes turn the structure into something unique.Brand includes hundreds of examples of &quot;rephotography&quot;: Photos of a location taken at many times from roughly the same angle to illustrate the changes. (Among the best are 140 years of photos of San Francisco's Cliff House, which burned down at least twice.) He examines both structural and cosmetic changes to a building, as well as the ephemeral changes to the people and things inside a building which change much more rapidly. He also considers a few buildings which were designed from whole cloth, and as a result are both resistant to change, and decidedly more cold and unlivable regardless of their artistic merits.Brand's friendly, yet often opinionated, writing style is tremendously engaging, and unlike many non-fiction books there's rarely a sense that he's repeating the same ideas over and over: There's always something new here, more lovely photos to look at. And it imparts Brand's love of the organic, living man-made environment where the practical and the aesthetic merge into something entirely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Demon Box","review":"Ken Kesey has produced a very special collection of stories, a number of which are written in the 3rd party, using the character &quot;Deboree&quot; as Kesey's alias.

It kept my attention, but what really got me hooked was the eloquent writing. Kesey has a great talent for detail, but he does not ramble on for pages about trivialities.

His humor, characterization and descriptions of geographical space (my native Oregon)all remain intact and on a level with his finest work.Some vinettes are obviously more memorable than others and often the writing seems unfocused and in need of editing.This is really a small matter considering that this is the closest to a autobiography the world will ever get. DEMON BOX certainly makes for a strong and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Demon Box","review":"The passing of Kesey last month led me to the Demon Box. I immediately fell under his spell...again.

Kesey pulls no punches in outlining how the golden dream of the '60s turned to ashes over time, with many of its symbolic leaders falling away. He spares no one, least of all himself, in these pages.And yet, this is not a grim or depressing read. Detailing with tremendous humor and gusto his journeys to China and Egypt, as well as offering poignant observations on the passing of personal heroes like John Lennon and Neal Casssdy, Kesey emerges as a fully realized person whose flaws only make him more fascinating.While Demon Box can hardly compare to a towering masterwork like Sometime a Great Notion, it is a deeply rewarding book.

But when Kelkar arrives, he and Ghote get involved in a sudden and violent event which will have tragic consequences.I don't want to give away too much. The event takes place in the first 1/3 of the book and rest of the book is dealing with the aftermath. But if you do want to read it, I don't want to spoil anything.I really loved this one. Keating wrote so many mysteries, and some were much better than others, IMHO. The Inspector Ghote ones are some of the best, with the ability to transport the reader completely into another world and time. This one deals with the Indian monsoon, and I almost wanted to turn on my windshield wipers and look for an umbrella as I listened. This one is more of a character study than some of the other ones in this series, but it was still one that I couldn't wait to see what happened. Highly recommended, but probably hard to find."},{"Title":"Under a Monsoon Cloud","review":"First: If you can get it, perhaps at the library, seek the audiotape version read by Sam Dastor to bring full life to this wonderful book. A story whose heart is Inspector Ghote's admiration of a man, that man's use of anger in the performance of his duties, and Ghote's realization that anger is perhaps not the best policy. Not for the speed-reader, Keating's descriptions of those monsoon days in India will bring out the sweat in you!"},{"Title":"Matt's Fantastic Electronic Compusonic","review":"Children's books that teach children lessons are a perfect venue for opening up discussions about many things. One book, titled \\"Matt's Fantastic Electronic Compusonic,\\" deals with bad habits, and addictive behaviors in children.The story begins with a boy named Matt, who receives a computer game as a birthday gift. Matt enjoys playing this game so much, that he begins taking it everywhere with him. In fact, he chooses to play it instead of spending time with his friends and participating in other events. In the end, Matt kicks his bad habit and learns what matters most in his life.MyParenTime.com recommends this book -- the illustrations are large and colorful, and do a good job of complementing this rhyming story. The book has a religious theme that conveys the message that bad habits (addictive behaviors) should not take the place of God in a child's life."},{"Title":"Matt's Fantastic Electronic Compusonic","review":"Today's kids are bombarded on a daily basis with \\"entertainment\\" options, most of which involve some type of screen. In the new book Matt's Fantastic Electronic Compusonic, the main character Matt faces a big decision about how he wants to spend his time. This 32 page hardcover book, released in April 2004 by Kregel publications, features eye catching illustrations by Jeannie St. John Taylor which really help convey the pace of the story.Matt receives his awesome new \\"Compusonic\\" hand held game as a birthday gift, and it swiftly takes over his life. As Matt struggles with the choice of game vs. friends, he comes to the conclusion that nothing should come before God. The action that leads up to this ultimate choice leaves young readers caught up in the story line and concurring with the end result.Matt's Fantastic Electronic Compusonic is aimed at readers ages four through eight years of age, but my twelve year old son read the book to his nine year old brother and both were thoroughly engaged in the story. If you have a house filled with screens and monitors, this book is a must read for your family!"},{"Title":"A Little Touch of Drama","review":"Ukrainian Classics in Translation was launched in 1972 by Ukrainian Academic Press (UAP) with Professor S. N. Luckyj as editor of the series. The intent was to make available in English outstanding literary works by Ukrainian writers from the past two centuries. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, starting with the fourth title, will sponsor the series; and, it will continue to be published by Ukrainian Academic Press.Note: Originally, Fata Morgana, a novel by Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, was to be the fourth in the series. And, when you open A Little Touch of Drama and read through the list of four titles in the series, you'll see Fata Morgana listed as the fourth title. However, that plan had to be abandoned, and Fata Morgana was superceded by Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky's modern Ukrainian masterpiece, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.A Little Touch of Drama is the first in the series of Ukrainian Classics in Translation. Written by Ukrainian author Valerian Pidmohylny, it was translated from Ukrainian by Professor George S. N. and Moira Luckyj, with an introduction by Professor George Shevelov of Columbia University.Forty years after its first publication in Kyiv in 1930, the English translation of Valerian Pidmohylny's novel Nevelychka Drama (translated here as A Little Touch of Drama) appeared; it was originally serialized in a Soviet Ukrainian magazine. It wasn't until 1957 in Paris that the novel was first published in book form. The West ignored it mainly because only Russian literature of that period interested the Western reader. U.S.S.R. minority languages were thought of as worthy of linguistic studies, but not as having universal appeal. Therefore, even though it wasn't political in its aims, much of the 1920's Ukrainian literature was ignored, except by students of politics.Ukrainian author, Valerian Pidmohylny was born in 1901 near Katerynoslav. Although he attended Kiev University (now officially the National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv), he never completed his studies there because of the revolution and civil war ravaging the country at the time. When he became a teacher in the 1920's, he dedicated most of his time to writing.Short stories were what he was known for--especially his novel Misto (The City), which was published in 1928. Pidmohylny translated French literature (France, Maupassant, Stendhal) into Ukrainian. As one of the leaders of the apolitical group of writers \`Lanka' (The Link), he was arrested in 1934, and deported to a concentration camp--where he most probably died.Pidmohylny's works remained banned and were not available even at the time of writing of this book (1972), although after Stalin's death some writers were posthumously rehabilitated. The translators of this book have tried to recapture the sardonic quality of his novel while closely adhering to the original text. Chapter titles range from Shevchenko quotations to allusions to cheap operettas and romances.Following the Translators' Preface is a slightly abridged translation of the article, \`A Disturbance in the Protein,' which was written by Yury Sherech (pseudonym of Professor George Shevelov, of Columbia University). As the second and last novel written by Pidmohylny, A Little Touch of Drama differs, in part, from the first in that the action centers on one spot--a room. Thus, this novel may be called a \`chamber novel.'This novel is about the varieties of love. Five men love Marta; she's indifferent to four. The four men remain static and take no part in the love plot. This is a novel about two people, which takes place between four walls.Professor Shevelov tells us that Pidmohylny's work doesn't deal with politics, but, instead, deals very much with Ukrainian literature. \\"Its place is among the intellectual, ironic novels of the late 1920's...Pidmohylny's work is a small, unnoticed, and yet quite distinct link in the development of modern literature.\\"This novel, the first in a series of four, is the appetizer, which whets your appetite for more of Ukrainian Classics in Translation. The translation is superb, imagery is intoxicating, and love is exposed as maybe even you've experienced it.

On my opinion, the book describes the &quot;revers&quot; side of the Olympic Movement and what is very important for readers and especially for researches. Now it is possible to compare the traditional concept of the Olympic Movement (D.Miller, R.MacAloon, N.M&uuml;ller, J.Lucas, O.Shantz, K.Lennartz and others) with the new facts and data, sometimes very controversal. I can't agree with authors in several items, but the whole book gives us a result of hard work.

It is jumbled and some of the stories aren't even sci-fi are seem out of place. The collection has many great stories, but I don't recommend it to people new to Bradbury; if you haven't read \\"The Illustrated Man\\", I suggest it over this collection."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"I highly recommend this book to any fan of Ray Bradbury's work, or to anyone who wishes to introduce his classic works into their library. He is a passionate visionary that writes not only about sci-fi, but his colorful writing style encapsulates the sometimes ineffable feelings that each and every one of us have had about every possible situation in life, and dare I say, in death. I always feel like a kid again when I read his books, I am taken away to warm, sunny Saturdays when I was still in awe of the newness of life. I can hardly force myself to read the works of others as I am convinced that no one can do with words the magic that Ray Bradbury has done."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"I would like to note, as have some other reviewers, that I am working from the 18 story collection. It saddens me to say this, but these stories are a far cry from some of Bradbury's other material, and hardly worth the time for modern readers. Bradbury has an unnerving tendancy in his short stories to be one-dimensional, hokey, and heavy-handed; all these characteristics are on display in this collection. Also, I am willing to forigive his portraits of women in some of his earlier work, but these stories date as late as the 1960s, and Bradbury has to learn to write women in ways that are not hysterical or conniving.While there are moments when Bradbury is able to recapture some of the awe and beauty of his earlier work, much of this is, sadly, sentimental hackery. Stories like \\"Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's is a Friend of Mine\\" and \\"The Man in the Rorscharch Shirt\\" are so obvious and dull as to be difficult to finish reading. \\"Tomorrow's Child\\" is so absolutely ridiculous and wrong-headed that is almost makes a person angry. I've read quite a bit of Bradbury, and this was the first book of his where I have had trouble reaching the end. \\"The Inspired Chicken Motel\\" is the one bright spot, I felt, where Bradbury manages to stumble into a father and son's shared sense of wonder, and their desire to believe in some kind cosmic meaning, revealed in an omen. Other than that, the stories are rote and uninspiring.There is plenty of great Bradbury out there; I love Dandelion Wine, Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, and Something Wicked This Way Comes. All those books are worth owning. But not everything Bradbury ever wrote is genius, and certainly not _I Sing the Body Electric!_"},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"este escritor es muy bueno, escribe de manera corta e interesante y a los norteamericanos parece encantarles, sus historias son extranas tal vez localistas, tal vez solo extranas, pero son excelentes, aunque es muy americano y no creo que llegue nunca a ser muy leido en america latina, aunque en realidad no se como esta su p&oacute;pularidad por aqui. este libro es muy bueno para las personas que estudian o planean estudiar cultura americana, les puede servir de complemento, tiene un buen rango de historias que van desde pueblos, hasta espaciales...

Bradbury's certainly a fine writer, but like that other renown master of the short form, Borges, he totally fails to engage me. I guess it's all a matter of taste, but the stories in this collection felt rather dated, and that's probably why I didn't enjoy them that much. Many of the stories raise questions about what it is to be human, and the intersection of humanity and the technology humans create to mimic humanity. And while they're moderately effective (especially the one about the robot grandmother), once you've read Dick's &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,&quot; everything else tends to pale in comparison. So, not my cup of tea, but that's just me."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"In the fifth edition of \\"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", the article on Rachmaninov affirms that the popularity of his works is proof they aren't very good. By that reasoning, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms must be even worse composers.But there is _some_ truth to the idea that popularity and \\"quality\\" are inversely related. Ray Bradbury, arguably the most popular 20th century writer of fantasy and science fiction, is a perfect example. Bradbury is a writer for people who have no imaginations of their own.I read a lot of science fiction when I was young. (Fantasy had not become as popular as it is today.) By a wide margin, no writer struck me as consistently awful as Bradbury.Why? None was quite so _obvious_ -- Bradbury telegraphed his punches in the titles of his stories! His treatment of any idea was often heavy-handed and sentimental. And he claimed priority for any work with even the least resemblance to one of his (qv, \\"The Foghorn\\" and \\"Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\"). I don't know whether \\"Boys, Grow Giant Mushrooms in Your Basement!\\" predates Philip K. Dick's \\"The Father-Thing\\", but if it had, Bradbury surely would have sued.It's about time (while Mr. Bradbury is still alive) to proclaim him the semi-competent mediocrity he is. There, I said it. He also needs a kick to the knees for his inane use of Whitman's \\"I sing the body electric\\", a reference to human sensuality and sexuality, to title a story about an asexual, unsensual android.I sing the body electric;The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them;They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul.Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves;And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?And if the body does not do as much as the Soul?And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?I find it amazing Ray Harryhausen has put up with him for 70 years."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"A lovely short story + 1 poem collection, with some Martian and Royal Hibernian cheek by jowl. My review is in alphabetical order rather than presentation order, for ease of reference.\\"Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's is a Friend of Mine\\" - One fine summer's day, a man arrived at the train station in Green Town, Illinois - giving the name Charles Dickens.\\"Christus Apollo\\" - A poem, speculating on how many worlds in the wide universe have seen the birth of a Christ child.\\"The Cold Wind and the Warm\\" - The Royal Hibernian Hotel in Dublin is having a dull winter, when six male ballet dancers descend out of the blue for a 24 hour stay, looking for an unlikely new place.\\"Downwind from Gettysburg\\" - Phipps says that's where we must stand, the only hearing place. (He's always dreamed of making a movie with a farmer and his son standing at the edge of the crowd listening to Lincoln's address.). Instead, he built a tourist attraction in Illinois with a robot Lincoln - and someone has now 'assassinated' the robot.\\"The Haunting of the New\\" - Another story near Dublin's Royal Hibernian Hotel, but not with the same characters. Nora's family has lived at Grynwood for the last 200 years, each generation wilder than the last. (On Charlie's first visit, two rival ballet mobs, separated by a language barrier (Manhattan vs. Hamburg) were visiting, along with a Duchess. Nora greeted Charlie stark-naked at the front door, only to have the Duchess strip down in response as she came in.) Sometimes Marion brings his Pekingnese dog troupe, which always gets drunker and sicker than he. Now (years later) Nora offers to sell Grynwood to Charlie - and for the first time, the house has no weekend guests. What happened?\\"Heavy-Set\\" - That's one of his nicknames, as well as Sammy (for Samson). He spends all his free time bodybuilding, but there's something not quite right about him.\\"Henry the Ninth\\" - He's the last man in Britain, this December, because everyone else has finally given up, left the island, and relocated south. (Obviously written, I must say, by somebody who never lived through a Florida summer, but I love it anyway.)\\"The Inspired Chicken Motel\\" - The family stayed there while looking for work in the Depression. The motel chicken laid eggs \\"right out of Revelation\\".\\"I Sing the Body Electric!\\" - This was turned into an episode on the original Twilight Zone, which was OK, but the source is better. It begins the week the world ended - the day Tim, Tom, Agatha, and Father returned from Mother's funeral. So Father picked up a Fantoccini brochure on buying an Electrical Grandmother...\\"The Kilimanjaro Device\\" - The narrator is one of the loyal readers of an old man who died in the wrong place at the wrong time; they've all chipped in to try to change that. The writer isn't named. If you don't recognize him from the context, look up Ernest Hemingway and start reading.\\"The Lost City of Mars\\" - This really ought to have been in The Martian Chronicles; it explains how the dry canals were reborn. A very rich man, looking for the fabled lost city of Dia-Sao, had the canals refilled so that he could search for it by water (air and land expeditions having failed). Wilder and Parkhill (from the 4th Expedition) are invited to join the canal yacht party. Nobody quite knows why the city was abandoned.\\"The Man in the Rorschach Shirt\\" - The doctor's shirts were an easy talking point with total strangers - designed by Jackson Pollack.\\"Night Call, Collect\\" - When Mars was evacuated at the beginning of the war, Emil Barton was left behind in one of the Martian cities, alone. He recorded messages and set up the computers to call him at random, so he could hear a human voice. But at eighty, messages left by twenty-year-olds can be hard to take.\\"The Terrible Conflagration Up at the Place\\" - A gang of Dublin men show up at Lord Kilgotten's place to burn it down (some of them also appear in 'The Cold Wind and the Warm'). But the old lord himself answers the door, invites them in, and offers them a drink (asking them to wipe their feet, which they do). And nothing is ever as easy at you think it will be.\\"The Tombling Day\\" - As the bodies of the old cemetery are moved to the new, Grandma has come to see William Simmons one last time. And the real tragedies of the deaths of the young are explored.\\"Tomorrow's Child\\" - The baby was born healthy, but in the wrong dimension - he looked like a blue pyramid. A terrible problem for his parents, who can't communicate with him, and for him - he doesn't know what the 'normal' world looks like, never having seen it that way.\\"The Women\\" - One of the 'women' is the ocean, luring the husband of the other woman to his doom.\\"Yes, We'll Gather at the River\\" - A line from a hymn, which springs to mind since \\"the Lord giveth, and the Highway Commissioner taketh away.\\" The new highway is being built 300 yards from the tiny hamlet of Oak Lane. (If you like this, read the opening chapters of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, particularly the definition of a bypass)."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"I've been a big fan of Ray Bradbury for ten years now, since my high school American Lit teacher gave me &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; to take home over Christmas break. It wasn't assigned reading, but he knew I liked to read, as he did, and he thought I might like it. He was right. Actually, I loved it. In the years since I've read almost all of Bradbury's writing and I've been consistently impressed. Bradbury is a short-story-writing poet whose subject is the intangible wonder we all experience in our finest moments of living and dreaming. Those moments are often far-too-fleeting, but Ray Bradbury knows how to chase them down with his typewriter. I've never read a Ray Bradbury book that didn't make me feel wonderfully alive.When I began reading &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; I was a little worried that it wasn't up to the par of his other short story collections. Bradbury sometimes writes in broad strokes that result in unfulfilling caricature. I felt this was true of the first couple stories. But after that, the book really took off, and I felt he was firing on all cylinders again and again. &quot;Yes, We'll Gather at the River&quot; has to be one of my favorite Bradbury stories. &quot;Night Call, Collect,&quot; the title story, &quot;Any Friend of Nicholas Nickleby's Is a Friend of Mine,&quot; and &quot;The Man in the Rorschach Shirt&quot; are other high points in the collection. He also takes some stylistic excursions in this book. &quot;Heavy-Set&quot; is an excellent prose portrait, but is not really like anything else he's written. There is also a poem included as the last entry in the book. If you've never read anything by Ray Bradbury, I highly recommend you pick up one of his many fine books. &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; is right up with the best of them."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"I remember reading this collection for the first time about 25 years ago. I was in maybe 7th or 8th grade and was going through a Bradbury period, reading everything of his I could get my hands on. To this day, Mr. Bradbury's writing touches me as few other writers ever have or will. Right now, as I write this small review, I can remember vividly, as if I were there right at this moment, lying in my bed and reading the title story. I remember the grace and humanity at its core and I remember reading the final sentence and weeping.This is a magnificent book. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves stories and life."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"Now that my children are quickly approaching their teen years - I find myself going back and looking to share with them the books that I loved as a teen; books and stories that not only introduced me into the sci-fi genre of writing, but made me pause and think of the possibilities that our world COULD hold. I Sing the Body Electric is one of those books. Ray Bradbury is at his most masterful with his stories here - some offering hope and comfort, others sharing glimpses into lives that reach far beyond our day to day realities. So, as my children reach their age of questioning and searching for knowledge, I want to share with them what I consider one of the greatest collection of stories of all time, not just of science fiction. My hope is that they too will read and marvel and wonder and question about the possibilities of what COULD be that Ray Bradbury presents in I Sing the Body Electric."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"This is the kind of reading that should be taught in high schools.

And now, fifteen years later, I decided to go back and try to read a few of the books I remembered. I especially remember enjoying books by Asimov, Bradbury, Dick, Wells and a few others. This was the first one I happened to read, and I was amazed. The first few stories were kind of 'iffy', but I was quickly pulled into each and every story. Ray Bradbury has a writing talent that few today can replicate. His mastery of words and his imagination are amazing.I've read a few 'modern' sci-fi, and they've all failed to impress me. The true wonder of sci-fi is in books like this. Sure some of the ideas are out-dated, but who cares? It is science-fiction. Stephen King and the others I read didn't seem to capture the wonder that is in books like this.I know that some prefer modern sci-fi, but for me, the 'oldies' are where the great science-fiction lies."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"(Please note that the edition I am reviewing is the older publication that contains only the original 18 works that make up I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC!.)I usually adore Ray Bradbury short story collections, but I think it would be more honest of me to say that I \\"merely\\" very much enjoyed I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC!. While I wouldn't rank this as his best work, it contains a number of seductively powerful moments. It's a wonderful set of quite varied fiction, however not all of the stories gave me the same emotional charge that I get out of other selections of Bradbury's writing. It's still a compilation worth reading, of course, since even Bradbury on a mediocre day is still better than the vast majority of short story writers.As with other Bradbury collections, it is difficult to characterize the feel of this. The stories cover a smorgasbord of topics; included are stories about Mars colonies, Irish peasants, supernatural chickens, electric grandmothers, and a host of other mind-bending fictions. You have to admire his creativity if nothing else. And he has a fantastic way of making even the most bizarre of artifacts seem as familiar as apple pie and the smell of freshly cut grass. His characters are painted with broad strokes, but they're so carefully crafted that you'll feel as though you've known them all your life.Some of my favorite Bradbury stories are his most basic and uncomplicated ones, I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC! being no exception. THE KILIMANJARO DEVICE is a simple tribute to Ernest Hemmingway written with a deceptive elegance. The science fiction overtones of DOWNWIND FROM GETTYSBURG, THE LOST CITY OF MARS and the titular story mask some very real human emotions. In some stories, youth and old age are brought together, with childlike enthusiasm touching characters at all points during their lives. In other stories, depression and gloom are all-encompassing and inescapable.On the other hand, there are a few stories that I just didn't care for. And I must admit that the poem at the end (CHRISTUS APOLLO) did very little for me. Still, it's testament to Bradbury's ability as a writer that the poorest stories can only fill me with mild indifference. Very little here blew me away in the manner of his DANDELION WINE book, but there is nothing that I would refuse to read again.I enjoyed I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC! during my initial read. But I found myself appreciating the stories even more the second time around. Bradbury excels at painting the whole spectrum of humanity, from the most noble to its most pathetic. And he turns both extremes into very compelling stories. This is probably not his greatest collection, but it is definitely not one to be skipped."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"I'm apparently in the minority on this one, but I didn't think this was one of Bradbury's better short story collections. The title story is the most significant one here, and while it's interesting that Bradbury, contrary to what might seem to be implied in some of his other stories, here praises technology (hence the title), he does so in a rather muddled fashion. It's about a family that gets a robot \\"mother\\" to replace their recently-deceased real mother---but it goes farther than merely saying that machines are good in their place and strongly suggests that an artificial replacement could actually be far superior to a real mother. This is so bizarre that you have to suspect that Bradbury is being satirical, but to the contrary there is every indication that he's playing it straight.\\"How many times have you heard how inhuman machines are, in your life? How many bright fine people have you heard spouting the same tired truths which are in reality lies; all machines destroy, all machines are cold, thoughtless, awful. There's a seed of truth there. But only a seed...most machines are amoral, neither bad nor good. But by the way you built and shaped them you in turn shaped men, women, and children to be bad or good.\\" This is all fine and good as far as it goes, but Bradbury goes on to have the children declare in the end, \\"You've always been alive to us!\\"---which, in the context of the story about their real mother being dead, is somewhat disturbing.There aren't any other stories here that really stood out for me, and most of them were just not up to Bradbury's usual standards and I thought were far from his best. But they weren't his worst either, and almost anything he writes is worth reading. These probably are too, but perhaps only if you're a real Bradbury fan; otherwise, you might want to read some of his more classic books instead, such as Fahrenheit 451, Dandelion Wine, The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, or even We'll Always Have Paris. I would put this one fairly low on the list. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"I Sing The Body Electric","review":"I read the book many moons ago.

This book covers the love story between MS Percival and her first husband, poet Herman Gund. I find Percival's history to be fascinating and am ever amazed with her ability to rise above all the travails life puts before her. This is a type of Romeo and Juliet love story carried out through a series of letters the lovers sent to each other during times of extended separation. Most compelling of all to me are the poems written by Gund which serve as section breakes between parts of the book. The ending is a surprise and a heartache which will linger long after the pages of the book are closed."},{"Title":"Silver Pages on the Lawn","review":"This is the sequal to \\"Weather of the Heart\\" a book I think is fantastic. Since I so loved the first book, I was disappointed in this one. \\"Silver Pages....\\" is well written and flawless in construction but the story moves slowly.It is interesting to read about student life in the 1930s and how students have, in some ways, not changed much. It is sad to read the long evolution of Herman's depression while the ever optomistic Nora carries him emotionally through his short life - not unlike how she carried her mother emotionally in the first book.I found the font selected for the printing of Herman's letters tedious to read. The letters are depressingly redundant and the difficult font only served to encourage me to skim through them.I have met Nora Percival and my copy of her book is signed for me. I am so happy that her congenital optomism was not dampened by her closeness to war, poverty, illness and depression. A lesser person would not have been able to pick up the pieces of shattered childhood and troubled, albeit loving, young adulthood to live a long and happy life as she has done."},{"Title":"Oh the Things You Can Do That Are Good for You!: All About Staying Healthy (Cat in the Hat's Learning Library)","review":"This is one of the better books in The Cat in the Hat Learning Library series.

The rhymes in this book are either strainedIt can travel five feetand blasts out with great powerat speeds over one hundredmiles an hour!or facile (the Garoo in Fadoo tell me true, they do - just like you!) to a degree that bugs me as a Seuss fan.To be fair, this problem turns up throughout the Learning Library series, not just in the volumes written by Tish Rabe. When you have to cover every health issue under the sun short of cancer and addiction (or every dinosaur or aspect of plant reproduction), it's probably pretty rough to hold a rhyme scheme and use words that kids can understand.

I truly am pleased that Dr. Stoff can deliver such a straightforward idea of the private suffering and ridicule that those of us who are diagnosed go through, while explaining the unknown changes that take place in our bodies that seem to defy medical explaination by &quot;experts&quot;.

Initially, it can be difficult to get through the first two chapters, but a real gem of a book with anyone dealing with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Epstein Barr Virus, Cytomeglovirus, HHV-6, Fibromyalgia and Environmental Toxins. We have been using the advice from Dr. Jesse Stoff for years at the Institute of Anti-Aging and Longevity in Carson City, Nevada because we believe that Dr. Stoff is correct in the belief that the body can heal itself through it's own immune system when dealing with the five issues that weaken the immune system called the P.I.T.T.S. which stands for Poor Nutrition, Infection, Toxins, Trauma and Stress. We have been applying the protocals from Dr. Stoff with excellent results. This book is a godsend from Dr. Stoff. It really goes into detail of the hows and whys of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and how to put it into remission with your own immune system. Dr. Stoff give excellent protocals to help the patient and the book gives 80 per cent of his treatments, but if you combine this book with his lastest one called The Prostate Miracle on cancer you have an excellent outline of what to do to improve you health, your immune system and putting the disease into remission. We have been using his research for years and find that the key to helping the patient the most is dealing with the stress and the new nutrient AiE10 in the Body Wise AG Immune to &quot;trigger&quot; the communication pathways of the immune system; especially as a modulator since so many patients (especially women) are dealing with auto-immune difficulties such as Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Candida, Fibromyalgia and other combinations of viruses and bacteria. If anyone would like receive the advanced protocals of Dr. Jesse Stoff's lastest research in this area we would be more than glad to offer help at 1-800-878-6659 at the Institute of Anti-Aging and Longevity. What has been very helpful from Dr. Stoff is the T and B subset panel of white blood cells that allows the wellness professional to interpret the data on the immune function of the patient which leads to the proper protocals to take on immune reconstitution in dealing with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome."},{"Title":"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","review":"This book is a very good book on Chronic Fatigue.

It is a religion that is diametrically opposed to the teachings of Scripture but his understanding of that becomes faulty when he tries to predict the outcome of things that God has expressly hidden. Prophecy fever always diverts attention from the needs of the world. I have not found a book that moves the church to reach out. The solution offered by the author of these sorts of works typically urge you to go literally or figuratively out to a mountaintop to await Christ and in effect to ignore the world. Follow this sort of advice and you will be \\"of the world\\" but not in it... you will out of fear flee the world as the world would flee any other danger.

His stories about living in France were very interesting, and content that I've never read anywhere else before. For that, the author gets 5 stars. However, at intervals too often for my taste, the author gives a hefty dose of pro-Christian God finger pointing that I find very off-putting. For that he gets 1 star. Take the average and he gets 3 stars. Let me explain...The cultural discussions in the book are factual, different and interesting. However, by including how (the Christian) God views this, or how Muslims will pay for that, is pure speculation based on whether (the Christian) God in fact, exists, and that (the Christian) God is, in fact, the correct perspective to have. This implies a value judgment against any non-Christians. I was raised in a Christian family, but do not subscribe to the tenets of any religion today. I find the exclusive pro-Christian spoon feeding offensive because at the end of the day, we are all humans. The author's perspective about Muslims and their general goals is interesting and compelling.

It is thorough, well-researched from sociological, political and Biblical perspectives and is sufficiently current and compelling to arouse the interest of most readers.In view of the violent headlines of the last week or so - the riots spreading from the Muslim-inhabited environs of Paris to the rest of France - Chapter One alone, incuding \\"Islam and the West: The French Experiment\\" is bone-chillingly real and relevant.At no point did I get the impression that the author was putting forward his personal \\"pet\\" eschatological timeline a' la several \\"end-times\\" writers. In fact, he resists quite admirably the temptation to forward his own agenda, repeatedly warning his readers when what he presents is simply a possibility and not a prophecy. He is not fanciful or impulsive. And to my mind, he does not trivialize or set back the cause of world missions, as someone has suggested. On the contrary, he and his family have put their money where their mouths are...and it is precisely the fact that they have gone and lived among Nanterre's Muslim community to love and serve which girds Stice's words with such passion and understated authority. His obvious caring and respect for those to whom he has ministered permeate the book, yet he does not mince words when discussing particular aspects and factions of Islam itself.At the very least, this book will provide an interesting slant on what is taking place on the world stage at this very moment...and it well may be prophetic in several respects. All in all, this is a work that is entirely worth one's money and time."},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","review":"I didn't finish it, I got to upset just reading not quiet half.

Too bad."},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","review":"Having read many of the current titles out there, including the fantasy of \\"Left Behind,\\" I was initially intrigued with Ralph Stice's title of the book. When I picked it up, however, I literally couldn't put it down.He has hit the nail squarely on the head, as the saying goes.What makes this book so different than the others out there, is that it is written by a missionary who lived among the Muslims and who understands their frustrations, anger, and current events as they deal with the geo-political-religious world. From the opening chapter of painting an imaginary scenario where the world is ruled by an Islamic Al-Mahdi, he continues in his book by supporting his thesis, and not once does he say he is absolutely correct. He leaves that up to God. But what he does is weave Scripture, compassion for the Muslim people, and current events to pose a plausible scenario.There is much to mull over and consider in this book, as well as questions that remain long after the book has been put down. Issues such as what should the Christian church's response be to the Muslim people, and the answer is \\"Love.\\" There are also warning signs along the way, such as the Achilles heel which will ultimately sink the United States, and that is the addiction to Oil and the greed of the country and how it plays into the terrorist agenda.Ralph Stice uses Scripture very liberally, and half way through the book he gives a \\"timeline\\" which he suggests could be plausible, and he strongly believes that it's possible for the Saudi government to fall into the hands of Muslim extremists within the next few years. And given that scenario, he asks the questions about how will the Christian respond to a more simpler lifestyle.There's a lot to consider, and I'd highly recommend this book, as it is a WAKE-UP call to the church of Jesus Christ. We need to pay more attention to the current events around us, as it is possible, based on the many Scriptures he presents, that the Anti-Christ is just waiting to rise into prominence. My question is like his own - why hasn't the country and the Church, in particular, even considered this?A phenomenal read, and highly recommended. I wish I could give it a #10."},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","review":"Ralph Stice is a modern day prophet, plain and simple. This book is anything but a dry study or your typical end-time evangelical alarmism. It is a well-written, well-thought-through, well-researched and very personal examination of what the present trends in the Islamic world, the doctrines and vision of Islam and Biblical prophecy have to say about the future of this World. Stice's experience as a missionary and friend to hundreds upon hundreds of Muslims is clearly evident from page one. Stice has also suceeded in building a rare bridge of understanding between Americans/Westerners and the Muslims that he lived amongst for so long. As the nations are presently in the early stages of a major polar-political shift that has not been seen in possibley several hundred years, Rev. Ralph Stice's poignant and prophetic work is an absolute and urgent must read for priests, pastors, imams as well as common Muslims and Christians everywhere. This is one of those rare books that someone tells you about and it gets passed around several times. I have already purchased a few extras to give away. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","review":"Positive reviews from trusted friends and the provocative title were what initially piqued my interest to read this book, and I'm very glad that I did!It's very informative and well researched. I appreciate the journalist writing perspective and style. I also greatly appreciate the research and citations in the book that make it simple to cross-reference and further dig into the topics that the author explores and lays out.This has become and been a much needed resource of information on Islam from an end-times perspective that has educated me on what was previously an unknown body of knowledge for me. It also has provided background and conversation for many a dinner table discussion with friends. And perhaps it is for this that I am most grateful to Stice and this book--he has taken an area of knowledge that would seem impolite or politically incorrect and made it compassionate and intelligent. He provides well-sourced education in an area of which most Americans are very ignorant.Buy it for yourself and give a couple to friends and I guarantee you'll have the makings of some excellent and thought-provoking and intentional dinner conversations--with perhaps eternal ramifications!"},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","review":"Whether or not you are a believer of End Times prophecy, \\"From 9/11 To 666\\" is a relevant book of facts surrounding the Islam religion of today, yesterday and realistic for tomorrow. Written by a world-traveled former journalist, turned world resident missionary, Ralph W. Stice - who is not a scholar or an unapologetic hyper-patriot blindly defending America - has spent more than a decade living among Muslims as his neighbors and friends, including the time spent in France where the two cultures regularly collide. Stice, who has a clear-eyed and unique knowledge of Islam, speaks the language, knows Muslim history, has listened at mosques and serves as a sympathetic bridge between two worlds with an unbiased view, combining first-hand knowledge with a deep love and respect for the people as well as empathy for the bondage they are in.Osama bin Laden says, \\"We love death. The U.S. loves life. That is the big difference between us.\\" Of course he knows the many other differences that our country seems to ignore, including the fact that our leaders don't yet understand how the rest of the world thinks. In a western country that practices \\"separation of church and state,\\" we see Islam through our own cultural lens. Islam has no such separation. To fight its people, we fight Allah. A war fought is all about religion - a war against infidels, a war not about power but religion in power, a war not against terrorists but against the ideology. (My own long-held thoughts are that one cannot just go into his neighbor's yard and cut down what is believed to be an unsightly weed to remedy the eyesore for oneself unless doing something about the root. And what if the neighbor believes this root holds a rose instead? What is \\"surrender\\" in a war when one side fights for one thing and the other side, another?)Many Muslims, long time American admirers and moderates, now feel betrayed due to the forces in Iraq. They see it as a rebirth of colonialism and a rebirth of the Christian Crusader movement. They ask themselves why a president who claims to follow Jesus would bomb innocent people when they know Jesus as a peaceful prophet. Unfair foreign policy is a major contention. They no longer understand us and no longer want to.The U.S. exports capitalistic, secular democracy to certain nations while turning a blind eye to atrocities and horrendous human rights violations committed by other dictators. There are many who equal Saddam Hussein's cruelty yet continue to remain in power. The pick-and-choose interventions have become shocking to the Muslim people. They see American forces and power and wonder why we don't help them, believing we easily could. Righteous anger over the world's injustices, dictators and political rulers becoming rich and hoarding those riches from their people, poverty and hopelessness of a better future light the path of the radical jihadist.The Muslims draw on a greater wealth of information of world history and persecutions as well as the current, inflaming policies of the U.S. which draws more and more into the fundamentalist camps, both offensively and defensively. We know far too little about global issues and seem to be incapable of understanding cultures besides our own to be able to lead the world. Unlike our own separation of church and state policy, international news is regularly addressed in mosques. While the western world became more secularized in pursuit of intellectual evolution, such \\"progress\\" was not embraced by the Muslim world.American culture is one of the main reasons we are known as \\"The Great Satan.\\" Muslims try to raise godly children but our popular entertainment culture infiltrates to their youth, giving the impression that all Americans are as immoral and smutty as the shocking output representing our society. They have long believed we are all a society of perverted (and truly greedy) people as shown by the media.Economic growth has not kept pace with the Muslim population growth. With no jobs and too much time on their hands, any solution, including joining militias becomes feasible.Hatred of the Jewish people, which began from the age-old battle between Ishmael and Isaac and further developed as a result of the Jewish people rejecting the claims of Muhammad as a prophet of God, continues in full fury today, being preached incessantly and is much worse than Nazi Germany at its peak.The numerous parallels between the Islamic Koran and the Christian biblical prophecy are astounding including the seven year tribulation time period before Christ's return. Muslims await signs of the End Times and \\"The Awaited Savior,\\" Al-Mahdi who is to prevail over all religions. Promised is the eradication of \\"those pigs and dogs,\\" referring to Jews and Christians. Believing that Jesus had a substitute on the cross and ascended to Heaven to await His final time on earth to help Mahdi and Allah, Isa (the Islamic name for Jesus) is to appear without fanfare near Damascus, Syria, claiming he was not the son of God and will rebuke all Christians for believing as such.The two are to lead the world toward Islam's aspirations: Redress for all the wrongs done against them by outsiders (using the oil card, this could be reality), the right to revive Islamic civilization without interference from the west, the unification of all Muslim territories into one federally organized Islamic caliphate (their maps were redrawn in 1916 by French and British diplomats), and the replacement of anti-religious ruling elites with sincere Muslims who will rule according to the shariah.The noted timeline for disastrous world events most likely to unfold, begin with the overthrow of the Saudi government, thus virtually shutting down the oil supply to the heavily dependent west are also feasible predictions by experts. With viruii and chemical weapons missing from guarded sites and nuclear weapon arsenals in the making, already in the news, it doesn't take much imagination to see the potential for the End Times scenarios to play out their parts.Although the common thread running through all forms of Islam is that Islam stands supreme among world religions and it is best for every nation to adopt it as their own as any obstruction of that divine plan is considered to be a war on Islam and Allah which justifies jihad, from the first page of \\"From 9/11 To 666\\" to the last, the author calls for compassion for the Muslim people, born and enslaved into the religion and also to separate the faith and its leaders from the followers. This is a down-to-earth book that doesn't contain a lot of religious rhetoric for either side. I would recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","review":"Ralph has some real meat here for those who dare.

This book \\"From 9-11 to 666\\", Livingstons 'The Final Clash', 'Anti-Christ Islams Awaited Messiah' by Richardson and 'Why I Left Jihad' by Walid Shoebat are fresh manna for the one who has an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches."},{"Title":"From 9/11 To 666: THE CONVERGENCE OF CURRENT EVENTS, BIBLICAL PROPHECY AND THE VISION OF ISLAM","review":"The author puts forth this scenario where the antichrist is a Muslim, and the whole world bends to the will of Allah and becomes Islamic. While I've believed all along that the antichrist will rise from an Arab land, I don't accept the author's conclusions.

Personally, I was offended at his anti-Western bias in blaming all the evil of radical Islam on the West and Israel. He disregards the genocide that Muslims have inflicted on millions of Christians and Jews for the last several hundred years in obedience to the Koran's commands. However, while reading the book, my own deep seated prejudice against Muslims was brought to light, and for that .. I'm glad I read this book. As a Christian ..

Made you think that they were waiting for something to happen, and when it did, it brought many of them out. A year later they took over the city, in a coup d'etat, and I was there too, having to be evacuated, but thanks to some Muslim neighbors my family was kept safe.I have talked to many Muslims also, and believe that Ralph's scenario of end times is quite feasible.

This is by far the best city map I have ever used. First, it is durable enough that I anticipate it will survive the entire stay.

There are probably hundreds of books on Nixon and Vietnam, China, and Watergate. But very few exist on his other policies, including his economic policies. This is especially strange considering that his Administration presided over the final destruction of the gold standard, first sustained budget deficits, and the beginning of the Great Recession of 1970s.Thus, this book is extremely useful. Almost month-by-month it describes the swinging pendulum of booms and busts that resulted from Nixon's economic mismanagement and the world economy's response to it. This is a very thorough work, meticulously documented. The author carefully documents endless cases of sacrifice of economic policies to blatantly short-term political goals.It's also a good narrative, it weaves all the facts and explanation together, and it's organized very well. I found it very easy to read and understand it. It sheds much light on the economic causes of all those strange events of the 1970s. It's also a great companion to a more general history of USA during those years."},{"Title":"Nixon's Economy: Booms, Busts, Dollars, and Votes","review":"Nixon's Economy is a fast paced, action packed account of Nixon's economic policy decisions and the politics that drove them.

It's a lot of material to fit into such a thin book making it a quick and exciting read."},{"Title":"Reconstructing Keynesian Economics With Imperfect Competition: A Desk-Top Simulation","review":"Marris has written a book about the Keynes's General Theory(1936)that is based on a claim, made by Richard Kahn,Joan Robinson,and Austin Robinson,that Keynes provided little or no microeconomic foundations ,in price theoretic terms,in the GT.Furthermore,because Keynes had been a poor mathematician since 1927,whatever mathematical analysis is in the GT is full of errors.Marris,like Don Patinkin and a host of other economists, simply assumes that Kahn and the Robinson duo are correct.Marris then proceeds to rewrite the General Theory ,based on a microeconomic foundation of imperfect competition ,because it is not possible to demonstrate the existence of involuntary unemployment in a purely competitive theory of microeconomics.Of course,this was another of the claims made by both Kahn and Joan and Austin Robinson.Any one who is mathematically literate(differential and integral calculus)will find Keynes's worked out mathematical and microeconomic analysis in chapters 19(and the appendix to chapter 19),20,and 21 of the GT in the form of elasticities.Keynes's basic result is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p is the real wage,mpl is tha marginal product of labor derived from a neoclassical aggregate production function,mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,and mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods.Only in the special case of mpc+mpi=1(which is a point on the boundary of both the dynamic and static production possibilities curves)will the standard classical and neoclassical result occur that w/p=mpl.If mpc+mpi&lt;1, a set of stable,multiple equilibriums will result.It will be impossible for labor to cut its money wage in order to reduce unemployment.Thus,their unemployment is involuntary as Keynes proved mathematically in 1936.Marris needs to reconsider his beliefs in the numerous canards told by Kahn and the Robinsons."},{"Title":"Modern Southwest Cooking","review":"I've known John Sedlar since the mid 70's and eaten in several of the restaurants he's worked in and owned.

It has, of course, all the flaws and period language style one would expect in a period memoir. The real value of this edition is that for researchers or students of history, the real editions from 1906 are very hard to find and quite expensive and sometimes you can't find them in English.There really isn't a better reference on Rose Bertin than this book. The author, Langlade, has a thing about a competing memoir by Leonard Antier, Marie Antoinette's hairdresser, which he cites as unreliable and untrue.It is suprising that this woman survived the Revolution and the Terror that followed and was able to pass naturally. One would think that because of her close association with the royal family and the court that she would be among the first to be put to death. But careful planning and an incredible sense of survival served her well.She is clearly the best documented marchand du mode of this period and her story leads right into Charles Worth, the next notable couturier and from there to Lucile and all of the modern designers.It was highly enjoyable and I am about to order this company's OCR \\"Souvenirs\\" of Leonard - just to see the difference and to add to my library of French history."},{"Title":"El Ingles En Accion","review":"I am a literacy tutor for Spanish-speakers that want to learn English.

He was misunderstood and criticized by many of his own people, yet he began a movement which brought many Jews home to Israel and helped unite them with a common language. I think one of the most amazing things about this true story is that, in reviving the Hebrew language, Eliezer actually had to create many words himself. Because the language had been &quot;dead&quot; for so long, there were no words for things such as airplanes, automobiles or concerts. He had to hunt through the existing language to find words that he could combine or slightly modify to make new words.

The surfaces of the front and back plates are silky smooth, taut and very pretty. The spine, being sewn with strings, is tight, yet allows the book to lay completely flat when open. The pages inside are very smooth, practically non-porous grain, and of a medium weight, thick enough for fine-tip pen-and-ink, but too thin for any other medium of drawing or writing element.

It was an enjoyable introduction to this Christian hero who played a major role in the development of our largest state.From his youth in Spain, through his education and his pedilogical service at a Spanish seminary, Junipero was preparing himself for the great work of his life. Responding to a call to be a missionary to New Spain, Junipero took the long ocean voyage to Mexico. Anxious to preach to the Indians, Junipero was once again assigned to an academic life at St. Ferdinand College in Mexico City. Eventually, at age 56, his pleas to be sent to California were granted. Walking much of the way, this gray clad Franciscan friar established the chain of missions which would form the foundation of Californian society. Spending most of his time at Carmel, Junipero became the Father of spiritual and secular California.\\"Wait For Me\\" is a charming story written in language which a child can understand and an adult can enjoy. With much dialogue, it reads like a novel.

Stubbs labor of love which documents not only the 11th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, but also the individuals who comprised it, is everything a regimental history should be. Unjustly overlooked by historians due in large part to the fact the regiment served as a part of two different brigades (the first a very unusal mixed-state command), the 11th Mississippi's combat record in Lee's Army of Northern Virginia is second to none. By the time it was assigned to Brigadier Joseph R. Davis's brigade in early 1863, combat reputations at the brigade level had unfortunately already been established and &quot;carved in stone.&quot; As a part of Bee's/Whiting's/Law's hard-hitting &quot;mixed&quot; brigade, the 11th Mississippi, 2nd Mississippi, 4th Alabama and 6th North Carolina comprised one of Lee's premier combat units and played a major role at 1st Manassas, Gaines Mill, 2nd Manassas, South Mountain and Antietam. However, the brigade was broken up in late 1862 and the units reassigned to more traditional &quot;state&quot; commands. The two Mississippi units went on to form the core of Davis's new brigade which came to grief during the Gettysburg Campaign. Although the 11th Mississippi missed the debacle at the Railroad Cut on July 1, it was present for &quot;Pickett's Charge&quot; forming the highly exposed left flank of the Confederate line once Brockenbrough's small Virginia brigade broke to the rear. The remnants of the 11th Mississippi, along with the other units of Davis's Brigade, also suffered in rear-guard actions at Williamsport and Falling Waters. Thus, the outstanding performance subsequently demonstrated by Davis's brigade following the Gettysburg debacle, during the Overland Campaign and the fighting south of Petersburg in the closing months of the war, was largely relegated to brief passages or footnotes in the works of most Civil War historians. Steven Stubbs history of the 11th Mississippi helps correct this serious error of omission. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Duty-Honor-Valor: The Story of the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment","review":"Mr. Stubbs has written an excellent history of the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment. The Eleventh fought from First Manassas to Appamattox and had as colorful and as glorious a record as any regiment in R. E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. That record, until now, has largely gone unnoticed. Finally it has been told in great detail. As an Ole Miss alumni I especially enjoyed reading about the University Greys who were University of Mississippi students who made up Company A of the Eleventh. I also liked the roster included in the book. It gives the service record of every man in the regiment, some 1500 of them total. I would recomend this book to Ole Miss students, Ole Miss alumni, Mississippians in general, descendants of these men and anyone interested in the Army of Northern Virginia."},{"Title":"Duty-Honor-Valor: The Story of the Eleventh Mississippi Infantry Regiment","review":"Steven Stubbs has truly immortalized the men of the 11th Mississippi Infantry Regiment in his heavily researched history of this famous Confederate unit.

From organization, through the first battles, into Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, and on to the heartbreak of Appomattox, the author describes the activities, movements, and everyday lives of these men of the South. Especially interesting to the genealogy buff is the detailed roster of all men known to have been a part of the 11th Mississippi. Overall, this is by far the best regimental history that I have ever seen.

The down-to-earth language and charming illustrations perfectly bring together education and entertainment.There are fourteen descriptive pairs of animals in this book, all with full-page illustrations, and a handy pronunciation key for sounding out some of the trickier names. Just because it's informational, don't think you can't sit down and read this to your little one at a whim.

The small book began by slogging through Russian history of 500 years ago, mentioning names and places that were unfamiliar, heavy with footnotes.Then a pattern began emerging-the squandering of the nation's resources on foreign ventures \\"veering off into the interests of others\\" with no benefit the Russian people.I was unable to put it down. I read the whole thing in an evening. This could be titled The American Question-there's much we in the USA could learn from the experience of Russia.Much of what Solzhenitsyin says is not politically correct.He sees \\"how harmful it is for the dominant nation in a state to create a multiethnic empire. Whoa, boy! They'll take your Nobel prize back!Solzhenytsin predicts that,\\"Circumstances will arise therein [in the 21 st century] when all of Europe and the United States will be in dire need of Russia as an ally.\\"\\"Today, looking at the growing stream of refugees bursting through all European borders, is difficult for the West not to see itself as something of a fortress-a secure one for the time being, but clearly one besieged. And in the future, the growing ecological crisis may alter the climatic zones-leading to shortages of fresh water and arable land in places where they were once plentiful. This, in turn, may give rise to new and menacing conflicts on the planet, wars for survival.\\"Solzhenitsyn has incisive (negative) comments on attorneys, Western courts, the liberal press, Gorbachev, and the US State Department.I learned something about serfdom, something of Russian Bolshevism, and a lot about idiotic foreign policy and bad government."},{"Title":"The Russian Question at the End of the Twentieth Century: Toward the End of the Twentieth Century","review":"Winner of the Nobel Prize for literature Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born in Russia in 1918. He has experienced World War II, labor camp, internal exile, and expulsion from the Soviet Union. He spent 18 years in seclusion in rural Vermont. In this book he explores Russian history in search for answers for Russia's decline. This book was born and distilled through Solzhenitsyn's many years of experience of struggle with the Communist state and exile... In the same time he is not someone who just have an ax to grind, but rather a thinker who attained understanding to the question \\"Why?\\" or at least someone who knows where to look for answers...Solzhenitsyn doesn't spare criticism to rulers of Russia starting with the biggest figure - Peter \\"the Great\\". He calls him \\"a man of mediocre if not savage mind\\" with appetite to the European grandeur, squandering national resources and wasting lives of Russian people. From Peter up until now it was \\"...three hundred year period ...of missed opportunities for internal development, and ruthless squander of national strength on the pursuit of external aims of no benefit to Russia: we troubled more about European \\"interests\\" than about our own people.\\"\\"The Russian Question\\" is an honest and thought-provoking book, written by someone who criticizes, but really loves Russia and her people. It would be a great book to read as a counterbalance to academic books on the subject. This is a real gem that shouldn't be overlooked by anyone interested in Russian history, philosophy and politics."},{"Title":"The Russian Question at the End of the Twentieth Century: Toward the End of the Twentieth Century","review":"Solzhenitsyn's writing is interesting and cohesive, but his conclusion is unclear. He leaves no doubt that neither bourgeois-democracy nor dictatorial communism are remotely acceptable to him, but does little to make concrete the third way he envisions. His ideal state seems to be built upon Slavophilism, a vague spirituality, and certain aspects of democracy, and I would like to learn more about that than his rants against the modern and historical US and Russian forms of government."},{"Title":"The Russian Question at the End of the Twentieth Century: Toward the End of the Twentieth Century","review":"The great Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has just passed from the scene. And his death was mourned by Orthodox Christians as well as other lovers of the truth throughout the world. Of late, many have styled Solzhenitsyn as perhaps the greatest intellect of our time. And having read this wonderful and terribly important book, I am much inclinded to agree with them.As a previous reviewer mentioned, Solzhenitsyn suffered much in his life. Most modern readers will already understand that he was for a long time interred within the Soviet Gulag. And he was even exiled from the Russia he loved so much. But, in thinking of Solzhenitsyn and his magnificent work, I can't help but think of Bishop Fulton Sheen's commentary on Russia and the Russian spirit. Bishop Sheen averred that the Russian experience and Russian greatness had much to do with the concept of the suffering servant. And this spirit rings true throughout Solzhenistyn's amazing and insightful book.Solzhenitsyn's rendering of the very important, and sadly little known, history of Russia is the most balanced, sensible, and even somehow poetic I have ever read. Any person who would understand Russia and the Russians would serve themselves very well by reading this book. But, more importantly, the book stands as a very important statement relative to the overall human condition at the outset of the 21st century. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. Read it. And be well informed and richly blessed in the process. God bless."},{"Title":"The Russian Question at the End of the Twentieth Century: Toward the End of the Twentieth Century","review":"The title sounds like a socio-political analysis. Actually, it is a short history book. But upon closer inspection, it is more than that. Solzhenitsyn uses the medium of history to re-tell Russia's story in a way to call the Russian people back to their spiritual heritage and also to warn Americans of the dangers that their own democratic liberalism offers. Written primarily for Russians, this book is a call for all. The specific question is simple: \\"Shall our people [Russians] be or not be\\" (106)? Solzhenitsyn raises points out the obvious double standard: patriotism and nationalism are good only when it is not Russian. (He didn't live to see how blatant this Western hypocrisy would become in the Ossetian War).The main body of the book is a survey of the last five centuries of Russian history. Solzhenitsyn's basic premise is that whenever Russia became imperialistic and sought other territories, the Russian people suffered and the country would lose prestige. Solzhenitsyn's basic premise is correct, but it is not that simple. He is quick to point out the dangers of pan-Slavism, and perhaps he has a point, but I don't think he fully understood the threat of Islam. The Ottoman Empire, while at times the \\"Sick Man of Europe,\\" being faithful to Surah 9.4-5, had to subjugate Russia's Christian brethren. While not all Russian military responses to the Ottoman Empire were warranted, the actions themselves were understandable.Lessons Learned from the BookLesson 1: The West, primarily Austria and England, is treacherous and should never be trusted (though of course, some alliances may be necessary). The most sickening moment of the West was the Crimean War, where \\"Christian\\" France and England allied themselves with Turkey, keeping their Christian brothers in the Balkans enslaved simply so Russia would be weakened. There is a wealth of material on this point that Solzhenitsyn could have used but didn't. He should have documented the diabolical schemes of Schiff, Rothschild, and Rockefeller in the 20th century to prove that Russia stood as the bulwark of the Anglo-American New World Order. I am certain he was aware of these moves. Their absence is curious.Lesson 2: Multi-ethnic societies under one empire simply do not work. Serbia learned this the hard way and Solzhenitsyn, while at times sounding pedantic, is on the right track in warning of the coming dangers. Decentralization and devolution is key.Lesson 3: Capitalism and communism are not opposed to each other at the root level. Again, see Schiff and the Wall Street Capitalists bankrolling the Communist Revolution. The goal of both oligarchic capitalism and Marxist communism is the concentration of wealth and power into the hands of the banking elite."},{"Title":"The Russian Question at the End of the Twentieth Century: Toward the End of the Twentieth Century","review":"I thought that this was a provocative book dealing with all the issues and dealing with all the possible view points.

Each description includes at least one or two carefully chosen examples. The length of entries varies: INTERESTED IN is handled neatly in one paragraph, while MAY extends to four pages. Throughout the book, the reader is given helpful hints on the pitfalls of translating from English to German. (&quot;If you wish to say [English] x, then it must be translated with German y, and not z.&quot;) Its design is simple: German synonyms are listed under English headwords. If you wish to find the difference between &quot;Tatsache&quot; and &quot;Angabe&quot;, for example, you would look under the headword FACT, where the former is in paragraph number two, and the latter in number three. (My one [small] complaint is that the indexes of words treated is at the back of the book, when it might make it a bit easier for the reader to have them at the front.) Each synonym is usually given its own paragraph, though sometimes synonyms that are very close in meaning will be treated together. English headwords are printed in bold and in capital letters, while German equivalents are in bold with normal capitalization; terms are thus very easy to find and distinguish from one another. Though intended for serious endeavors by the advanced or semi-advanced student of German, Farrell's is one of those rare dictionaries that is fun to flip through even at one's leisure."},{"Title":"Dictionary of German Synonyms","review":"Recently in my German conversation class I remarked something to the effect that every time I make a presentation to a large group I am thankful that \\"am mindestens ist es auf Englisch\\" that is, \\"at least it's in English,\\" my native tongue. My instructor, a native speaker of German, instinctively corrected my use of the term \\"am mindestens,\\" saying that I should have said \\"am wenigstens ist es auf Englisch,\\" but when asked, she realized that although she was sure \\"am wenigstens\\" would be correct, she couldn't really explain why.I naturally turned my old reliable \\"Dictonary of German Synonyms\\", one of my favorite language books, for clarification. The distinction is apparently that \\"am mindestens\\" should be used primarily with precise numerical amounts, such as for example \\"I drank at least 2 liters of Gluhwein last night.\\" I say \\"apparently\\" because the explanation in Farrell's book is actually a bit cryptic.Much more clear is the more recent and larger (and more expensive) \\"A Practical Dictionary of German Usage\\" by K.B. Beaton. The two books are extremely similar. Farrell was a Professor of German at the University of Sydney and his book was published by Cambridge University Press. Beaton was a Senior Lecturer in German Studies at the University of Sydney and his book is published by Oxford University Press. Why the University of Sydney would be the center of English language research in German synonyms is a curiosity, but if not Sydney, Australia, where should they be studied?Beaton acknowledges Farrell's pioneering work in the field but clearly believes it was already out of date by the 1960s. If you can only afford one book, I suppose I would recommend the more expensive Beaton, but despite the similarities I still find Farrell's older work more readable. If nothing else, Farrell's book is less unwieldy and easier to read for pleasure."},{"Title":"Idle days in Patagonia","review":"This is a tranquil, contemplative work of reflection on the varieties of nature. Like the amazing bird that changes its song regularly when one of its species, for reasons unkown, 'decides' to create a new melody which the others then follow. Another thing to look out for is the sensation that Hudson's glasses has on the local indigenous population - mocking laughter turns to incredulous amazement. This book brought peace to my life, and hopefully increased my sensitivity to natural wonders all around me - everyday ones as well as the extraordinary."},{"Title":"Idle days in Patagonia","review":"Of the three non-fiction books I've read by W.H.Hudson(the other two being The Naturalist in La Plata and A Shepherd's Life)this is far the weakest. Where the personality of the writer was unobtrusive in the other works, it becomes intrusive to the point of being offensive in Idle Days in Patagonia. There are some interesting anecdotes about local characters and happenings, as well as details about animal behavior. But the biggest drawback is the overlong philosophical rambling, of which the topics sometimes seem downright trivial. However, don't be put off by one lesser work. The Naturalist in La Plata is an excellent book of natural history of the pampas, and A Shepherds's Life is quite good as well."},{"Title":"Idle days in Patagonia","review":"What I love about the writings of W. H. Hudson is his wonderful descriptions of the flora, fauna, and folklore of South America. But I suppose it is true what they say about idle minds.

The romance with rugged naturalism is a bit much."},{"Title":"The survival of Charles Darwin: A biography of a man and an idea (Library of great lives)","review":"Those who have read Clark's biography of Einstein, will find his study of Darwin and of his theory of wonderful interest. Clark was truly a master of the biographer's art. A thoroughly researched book that gives insight into Darwin as a kindly country gentleman who spent his life in earnest study of nature - indeed of the processes of survival. The book does not end at Darwin's death but continues on to examine the impact of his work and the development of knowledge about heredity well into the late twentieth century. The only regret the reader may have from this book is knowing that Clark is dead and we will have no more wonderful studies. He did not write many books, but instead gave remarkable attention to the figures he studied. Reading all of his biographies would be a worthwhile journey into the art of research and of writing that gives historical figures of gargantuan proportion a humanity that brings them to life. The Biography of Darwin also gives light to the ridiculousness of creationists who still struggle against the inevitable truth of his clarity of thought, as well as to how scientists could impale themselves against the guarded idols of the fixed paradigms of their own egoes. Would that some playwright would bring Darwin to life in a work of intellectual stature. There are surely enough characters of his time to make it most interesting."},{"Title":"The survival of Charles Darwin: A biography of a man and an idea (Library of great lives)","review":"This book is not so much a biography of the man (Darwin) but rather the history of his theory and the impact it has had on thinking up to the present day where it is alive and well.

This book is divided into five portions. The first portion takes Gary's past from his first drawings to syndication of \\"The Far Side.\\" Along the path was a pre-Far Side comic called \\"Nature's Way.\\"In the second part of the book Gary offers his original sketches and captions in comparison to how the comics actually came out. In most cases the final version was better, but not always. At the end of this portion of the book is a short section titled \\"stories\\" that is what it says, comics with a lengthy caption that is at the very least a short story. In some cases the caption could be a novel, if you think about the concept for very long, which I do not recommend. You might suffer further brain damage.The third part is really interesting. It shows how Gary or newspapers made mistakes. The mistakes were often subtle, sometimes blatant. Some of the more interesting mistakes happened when the caption of adjacent comic was switched with that of \\"The Far Side.\\"The fourth portion of the book is humorous independent of the comics. Gary offers comments from various people offended by his art. Considering the art and the comments offered, I suggest that in many cases people saw something that was not there, which makes me wonder where THEIR mind was at. In other cases, people need to remember that Gary is offering a perspective on the world, in comparison to how people see things. It does not mean that Gary is interested in actually seeing the things in his comics happening; usually.The fifth and last portion of the book offers Gary's favorites. I concur that most of them brought a smile to my face, and in a few cases an out right laugh.Gary Larson succeeds in thinking outside the box, something that he does with great regularity. I suspect that he would be great at inventing. Of course, he is a self-described nerd, and I believe it. He also seems quite pleased that his comics find substantial popularity amongst scientists. Probably engineers too. If you think \\"The Far Side\\" is one of the greatest comics ever created, you will love this collection for its explanations. I recommend this collection highly for Far Side fans."},{"Title":"Angel Country: Angelic Encounters: True Stories from Maine","review":"If you don't believe in angels, you just might reconsider the possibility after reading \\"Angel Country.\\" Author Ria Biley is not suggesting that angels are limited to the state of Maine, rather, this is where she became consciously aware of angels in her life.\\"Angel Country,\\" a neat little biography of what angels are and how they manifest to anyone open to their presence, is a compilation of true stories about \\"ordinary people whose lives have been touched in extraordinary ways. They tell of rescues, healings, voices and visions-miracles large and small, touching all levels of the human condition.\\"Biley, who believes the writing of this book chose her, points out that she believed in the activity of angels in her life years before beginning this book, and that the timing of angels as an \\"in thing\\" was synchronistic to when her book was published. This, to her, speaks of the relevance and power of angels in our lives.Following a section on topics like how angels manifest, degree of encounters, and why angels are interested in us, Biley moves into the stories of angels by degree of encounter in the lives of people who live in Maine, although the angelic encounters may not have taken place here.Some of these interventions were quite dramatic, such as one Biley experienced firsthand, when she was miraculously saved from certain death in a sudden, impending car wreck-ultimately, the vehicles never so much as touched.Biley tells us that nearly every angelic encounter in her book had an eyewitness account to the intervention.I suspect the most common form of an angelic encounter is when an individual stops what s/he is about to do at the sound of a voice warning of either impending danger, or to do something other than what they were about to do.Two stories shared by different people (different times/places) who, while driving, heard a commanding \\"voice\\" instruct them to \\"pull over\\" or \\"slow down\\"-both individuals were spared what surely would have been serious, if not deadly car accidents by heeding the instructions given by these voices.As further explanation on what angels are, Biley tells us that there is evidence to \\"support the conviction that Angelic civilization existed long before Man.\\" And, although \\"we don't become Angels after death, we do join them, and get to live on the same spiritual plane with them. Angels come to escort us from this life to the next-they accompany our souls home to the dwelling place of the Creator.\\""},{"Title":"Angel Country: Angelic Encounters: True Stories from Maine","review":"For anyone who adamantly believes in the power of God and His helpers, or at least continues to have faith that acts of kindness are possible in a world overrun by violence and turmoil, Angel Country offers an outlet of that faith and offers the theory that perhaps there is indeed a benefit to prayer.

I prefer the novels of the 1950s and early 60s. I believe this book was written in the mid-70s. It features a ridiculous plot concerning derring-do in mining camps, a helicopter, some Wedgetailed Eagles, a girl's underwear (or lack thereof; very daring for L.W.) and a hero called \\"Jard\\".In other words, a typical Lucy Walker novel and plenty of fun for the afficionado."},{"Title":"Girl Alone","review":"I adore Lucy Walker. I love her romances as much as I love brownies or chocolate chip cookies. I have a bunch of them in my TBR pile, and I ration them out, cuz I know when I finish the last one I'll be very sad.Girl Alone, however, did not quite live up to what I've become accustomed to. It was a little - dare I say it? - boring. Mardie is a great heroine, like all of Walker's heroines. I can' really say much about Jard, the hero, as I really did not get to know him, at all.Mardie is quite taken with Jard from the moment she sees him, even though she only gets a fleeting glimpse of him. Unlike all the other customers in the area, he doesn't eagerly come in to meet the new owner of the store but just goes about his business. His hat shades his face so she doesn't even really know what he looks like.For most of the book, Mardie and Jard are in different locations and rarely interact with each other. At one point, when they run into each other while taking animals to see the vet, they do finally have a conversation, and Jard invites her for a ride in his plane. But then they crash, and Jard is unconscious until help arrives and he's taken off with the medics while she goes home.The immediate aftermath of the crash is the best scene in the book. Their night together in the cold outback later causes a mild scandal, and I was a bit surprised by Mardie's daring action, simply because Walker's books are always so tame and quaint. As with all her books, there is no sex, nothing more than some chaste kisses. But one character does say \\"bitch\\" one time, which was another shocker for a Walker book.I just wish the beginning and ending of the book had been as good as that plane crash chapter."},{"Title":"The Natural Nursery: The Parent's Guide to Ecologically Sound, Nontoxic, Safe, and Healthy Baby Care","review":"Maybe in 1980 this book would have been of use, but in today's \\"Green/Organic\\" world, this book is useless.

The lie constantly to themselves and those around them. Their behavior is duplicitous and blind, within insight. They use each other and in turn are used. They make a big deal of going to church but have the spiritual sensitivity of hyenas. They do volunteer work for charity but rob each other and society every chance they get. They have the sexual behavior of gutter trash. They do drugs, drink themselves into stupors, and kill one another. And I wonder, am I like that too, except that the circumstances of my life are different? Had I been in their circumstances would I have resembled them?And the answer is, who knows?The scene is the Park Circle section of Dallas where everybody has lots of money. The principals are Harvard design school graduates, but any difference between them and your standard USC grad is not noticeable. The husband either poisons the wife or she poisons herself. The court found him guilty. She's something of a nut case, wallowing in the narco-guilt of a sister-brother incestuous relationship when she was eleven and Bill Jr. was thirteen. Her husband, Richard, a sexual addict (according to her) has a steamy affair with a shallow blonde. Her father has mass bucks and is called \\"Big Daddy\\" although he's a bantam of only five-seven. He uses his money to control his family, but of course it all backfires. Bill Jr. takes the cocaine/alcohol cure at the Sierra Tuscon drying out farm and then Richard attends briefly for both sexual addiction and alcoholism, both sent with Big Daddy's money. Nancy, the wife, is semi-frigid, but does get it on at strategic times, enough to be pregnant five times (two miscarriages and an abortion, two kids). Reading between the lines, one might guess that she is a semi-conscious furtive tease. They all abuse one another in various ways. Would I have done the same thing?You know, I think (a) I wouldn't have had the energy and (b) I would rather stay home and read a book, any book. The above was written after reading about half the book. It is amazing how good this book was near the end! Which only goes to show, it's the material that counts. I think Gray was padding it out a little. The truly amazing thing is how inadequate at getting the truth is our legal system. It's a statement about human kind: truth really is just a word: what counts is social, political and economic power. Or should I say forensic truth is a secondary consideration.Poisoned Dreams is written in a quick and slightly dirty style that suggests that Gray believes the dictum from literary agent Evan Fogelman, quoted on page 270, that good writing doesn't count for as much today as it once did. Yet, I wouldn't call this bad, or anything of the sort. What really works for Gray is the story, and he does deliver that. Furthermore, he presents both sides, which is something he believes in, and he keeps us guessing until past the end. So nice job, but perhaps a little seasoning, a little polishing, and a little editing would have made this an outstanding piece of work."},{"Title":"Poisoned Dreams: A True Story of Murder, Money, and Family Secrets","review":"I desperately wanted to read this story after watching the made for TV movie. I searched all over for a book about it. I finally found this one, and even though it wasn't written by an author I knew of, my desire to read the story won out in the end. What a mistake. This is the worst book I have ever read. It is not true crime, in any sense of the word. It rambles on incessantly about things that have absolutely nothing to do with the book as well as legal nonsense that I know about. I mean, how to pick a jury? Come on, the author wasted at least 5 pages talking about that. Then there are these weird interludes throughout the book where some \\"interviewer\\" is talking to a random player about their thoughts on the case. Really? It was so pathetic, I only got through it because I wanted to know what happened to the husband. In the end it didn't matter because the author seemed not to really know either. Ugh. What a waste of money. Save yours and watch the movie. It's better."},{"Title":"Poisoned Dreams: A True Story of Murder, Money, and Family Secrets","review":"The book is extremely dated. It opens discussing the murder of JR Ewing of Dallas, as if anybody cares. It goes on and on about the rich neighborhood that the characters lived in, going off on unrelated tangents - a crazy woman lived in the neighborhood, and also interjects the story of Sandra Bridewell (\\"and there she lives to this day\\" - well, not to this day, she's in prison now, probably out soon though). We also have to read too much of his personal opinion and problems - he's an alcoholic (when he talks to someone he refers to himself as \\"the interviewer\\" - so we won't guess who he is?) and how much he'd like a drink, also how Chinese food is NOT his favorite. I DO NOT CARE I want to read to the STORY of the victim and the murderer, not about YOU, AW Gray. Geez, what an ego this guy has. Of course he was raised there too, he tells us. Zzzzzzzz.Anyway, we're told that Richard, the husband convicted of killing his wife, had a perfectly normal childhood, and was not beaten by a crazy uncle and nothing terrible ever happened to him at all, nothing in his childhood made him this way...to grow up to be a compulsive liar and murderer. And how does AW Gray know this? Well, maybe the mother and father told him, maybe not, he doesn't say, but there was no need for him to do any research at all into Richard's childhood. So Richard's childhood is wrapped up into one small paragraph. Meanwhile, complete chapters are devoted to the history of Dallas (zzzzz...okay, Dallas exists, we know, please get on with the story), the prosecutor and HER childhood, and anything else Mr. Gray would like to expound upon.When we finally get to court, Mr. Gray refers to the persons coming to the trial as \\"the slobbering public.\\" He seems to be slobbering himself over the beauteous (according to him anyway, no pictures of this woman) \\"legal assistant\\" of the defense attorney, and the perfect earlobes of Richard's mistress's sister. Zzzzzzz again.Then at the end, he tells us he's changed everyone's name, and if we are so inclined that way, it's a matter of public record and if we want to know so badly, we can just go look it up for ourselves. \\"Whatever turns you on.\\"What an arrogant, self-absorbed person.

Volume One- It has the dual fortune of being both a quick read and a decent intro to Sartre's life and thought. It also calls him on his *ish*, which is rare for biographers. (Gerassi's parents were Spanish -ok his mom wasn't but married into it- friends of Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir, in fact both his mother and father as well as Jean hismelf became the basis for characters in sartre's 'Roads to Freedom' Series of novels).While not as massive a compendium as the Annnie Cohen-Solal bio, this has much to reccommend it. In fact, preciseley that it is not the massive compendium reccommends it in my eyes. Who has time for that but the intellectual janitors in their ivory towers? Gerassi knows Sarte's works quite well, but primarily- he knew the man himself and he gives interesting insights into many anecdotes and ideas.My feelings towards Sartre tend to be passionately ambivalent. I don't care for his philosophy, which will always be 'cool' to the pseudo-sophisticates who don't even possess a thorough grasp of it... I was enchanted with him in my teens mainly because of his persuasive skill with words (the man was an extraordinary wordsmith), and I will always be deeply enamored of his novels. 'nausea,' alone I feel should secure his place in the history of literature.There are tons of works on Sartre purporting to unveil his thought and life. Most of the ones I've read are inadequate- they come off as hack-kneyed and reactionary, and try to compensate for their faults with an over-abundance of fruitless linguistic play that goes nowhere- does nothing, or they take him to task overly for a variety of his personal failings (and there are plenty from which to choose). Few thinkers and biographers attempt to tackle the man as a writer and an activist... Few try to work with Sartre's all-too-human imperfections and put them into context....And few see any kind of logic in Sarte's later years but Gerassi, because of his close involvement with both Sartre and De Beauvior, is able to show the heart and soul of the man at work, especially in his darker years (involvement with revolutionary Maoists and loss of his sight and mental faculties, most likely due to his extensive use of drugs, ampetamines, alchohol etc in his 30s and 40s)...Stil, Sartre is a writeer and thinker worth exploring, and he was one of the more interesting men of his time. If you are at all interested in learning more about this maddening intellectual of the 20th C- this is a fine place to start. Gerassi was chosen by sartre mainly because he was not an acolyte- he had his own opinions and had frequent arguments (some quite vitriolic) with J.P. A couple of which gerassi recounts.The book has a lot of meat. Most don't. Let me reiterate that is written cearly and concisely- a quality MUCH LACKING in most books of this kind, and a quality that I value highly, outside of experimental fiction... I have read this a couple times, always enjoy it, find it interesting and illuminating.just one man's five cents, as always."},{"Title":"Jean-Paul Sartre; Hated Conscience of His Century; Volume 1","review":"I don't know what's wrong with the next reviewer (I suspect it's Anne Coulter with a fake moustache- Hi Anne!).

Sartre had more gumption than most when it came to calling out his age on its evils. Are we to blame him because, post-WWII he turned away from a non-poitical stance and embraced a left-wing ideology?This is a short, consise bio, and I think the best on the market of its kind.

Who'd have thought you could find yourself feeling that you overpaid for a book that cost $2? This is such a book. Sartre is a phase that most kids go thru, like pimples, before they grow up and understand the world. Yes, we are here a short time and then we die. Get over it.For Gerassi, a noted leftist, this book is more of an admission that he, like his friend Sartre, never grew up. While it is hard to read this book and not feel sorry for someone who will die an adolescent, I feel even worse knowing that the kind of nonsense Gerassi expounds about his fellow traveler in this book is probably standard fare dished out to the unsuspecting innocents in his political science classes at CUNY. What can you say about a book which fawns over a person like Sartre, whose entire life consisted of his fawning over mass murderers and criminals of the left? This book is a classic example of leftist snobbery, where Stalin's extermination of millions of Georgians, Ukrainians and others by starvation is ignored and the extermination of millions of Jews by an equally evil totalitarian criminal like Hitler is condemned. Sartre's equal admiration of mass murderers like Mao and Castro is made to look \\"enlightened\\" when it is simply outrageous. The only redeeming part of the book is that you can understand Sartre's narcissism and self-loathing to be possibly attributable to his warped childhood and excessive use of drugs and alcohol. I'd be nauseated and depressed too if I were as screwed up as he was.What an unfortunate end of being and nothingness for a poor, naked, innocent little tree to give up its life to provide the paper this book was printed on.

The stories, especially that of the wonderful Julia, would be very engaging IF THEY WERE TRUE. The Julia story is a hoax and a fraud. It is based on the real life-story of Muriel Gardiner (1901-1985), a talented psychoanalyst, intimate friend of the Freud family and generous anti-fascist crusader. IT IS NOT BASED ON ANYTHING THAT LILLIAN HELLMAN EVER DID. This fact has been told by many others besides me. How long will it take to get the message straight?"},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Lillian Hellman's PENTIMENTO, A loose collection of autobiographical essays and stories, has been both controversial and famous, and very specifically so for \\"Julia.\\" In this particular tale, Hellman describes her attempt to aid a friend by smuggling money to support anti-Nazi efforts in 1930s Germany--and subsequently finding herself unable to protect Julia from the ferocity of the Nazi machine. Powerfully written, it is the centerpiece of the book, and in 1977 was adapted into a very popular and much-praised film starring Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave.It was at this point, however, that controversy arose. The film caught the attention of Muriel Gardner, who promptly asserted that she was 'Julia' and the story itself was significantly based on her own life and work in pre-World War II Germany. She also stated that she had never met Lillian Hellman--but it transpired that she and Hellman had at one time shared the same attorney, who was well aware of her past and who could have described it to Hellman.Hellman flatly stated that Gardner was not 'Julia' and insisted that the story, while altered re details and circumstances to protect the identities of those involved, was indeed factual. As more details of Gardner's life came to light, however, it seemed increasingly likely that Hellman had indeed made use of it in creating the story, and the dispute continues to provoke strong feelings even some thirty years after the deaths of both Hellman and Gardner.It was not the first time Hellman had been accused of literary fraud and it would not be last. During her long love affair with novelist Dashiell Hammett, Hellman was frequently accused of draining his ideas to further her own work. In 1979 writer and critic Mary McCarthy prompted a suit for slander when she described Hellman's work by saying \\"every word she writes is a lie, and that includes 'and' and 'the!'\\" But regardless of how Hellman came by her ideas, there is no getting around the fact that she had the gift: at her best, she was the equal of the best of the best, turning out several masterpiece dramas and three autobiographical works that jolted best seller lists from end of the country to the other.PENTIMENTO is the second of these autobiographies, published in 1973 between the equally famous UNFINISHED WOMAN (1969) and SCOUNDREL TIME (1976.) And although \\"Julia\\" remains the most famous--or perhaps most infamous--work in the collection, Hellman is actually at her finest in the other stories she tells, most particularly those that center on her childhood home of New Orleans.In both these writings and others, Hellman shows a remarkable gift for capturing place, time, and character, zeroing in on her New Orleans family, her lover Hammett, and the legendary Tallulah Bankhead to name but a few. From the lunacy of personalizing condoms in Hollywood to the drunken jitters of opening night on Broadway, Hellman makes you see it, feel it, touch it, taste it. It is a brilliant accomplishment--and if you suspect that the stories on which she hangs these talents are at best misrecalled, at worst deliberate falsifications--is this not, after all, what we demand that writers do? Recast reality in order to spin a good story? Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Pentimento is a brilliant--and entertaining--portrait of a woman's life seen through the doubleness of \\"then and now.\\" Hellman sketches the people within her life, now housed in her memory. Although dubbed a memoir, it transcends a mere record of Lillian Hellman's life and portrays instead the way in which a woman's history merges with the memory of it. Each chapter is a portrait of someone or something symbolically important, and each is written in a different style reflecting its content and theme. Not history, not autobiography, not fiction, Hellman tried instead to get the feeling of her life right, to find something individual and universal. Drama, humor, tragedy--it's here, and it's important."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Lillian Hellman, one of the greatest playwrights of the Twentieth Century, bares her soul in this electrifying collection of vignettes about her life in the theatre; her friends and family; her complex relationship with the great Dashiell Hammett; and much more.Reading this book is like listening to Hellman talk intimately about her life. It is a true memoir; she does not remember details; the conversations tend to be fragmented, and she freely admits that her memories may have been blurred by the passage of time (and in some instances, Hellman's enthusiastic consumption of liquor).Hellman was an extraordinary writer and an extraordinary woman. In PENTIMENTO she reveals herself as few writers have ever done. She makes no attempt to portray herself as a hero or a villain, but as a real, living, breathing woman with changing views and difficult but fascinating relationships.One of the vignettes tells of her friendship with \\"Julia,\\" a woman whom she had known from girlhood who became an anti-Nazi resistance fighter and eventually was murdered by the Gestapo. There have been several cries of \\"FAKE!\\" and \\"LIAR!\\" concerning the Julia chapter, particularly from a woman named Muriel Gardiner, who claimed to be the model for the Julia character in both Hellmann's book and the subsequent film adaptation (a brilliant one directed by Fred Zinnemann). To be sure, Hellmann was known by her friends and family to be a woman who exaggerated things; it's what made her such a great playwright. But the only thing I can say in Hellmann's defense regarding the \\"Julia\\" chapter is that Muriel Gardiner, what ever she herself did or did not do during WWII, it is indisputable that she emerged from it with life and limb intact. Assuming that she was in fact a real person, \\"Julia,\\" whoever she was, did not.In fact the very weaknesses that have been cited for this book over the years are, to me, its greatest strengths. The memory lapses, the sometimes fragmented nature of what she recalls and what she does not (And when she did not recall, she simply said so. Certainly she did not make up cover stories; if she did, one suspects that she would have played the role of the heroine in the Julia tale when in point of fact she was such a klutz when it came to subterfuge that she nearly got caught several times.Hellman does not claim to be an historian; she is merely a human being talking about the things, places, and people of her life. And like most reminiscences, there are always things forgotten, things only half remembered, things you THINK you remember only to discover later that you were quite mistaken, and so on. Had she been making it up, one suspects the dominant figure of the story would have been not Julia, but Hellmann Which is precisely what happened in the film because they decided to go with a frame storyline in which Hellmann is the narrator, making Jane Fonda the titular female lead and relegating Vanessa Redgrave (who won an Oscar) to the background. Yet despite Vanessa's win as SUPPORTING actress, and despite the fact that Hellmann is sort of the \\"front woman\\" of this tale, the Julia character, despite limited screen time, permeates the whole film. As she does in the book: it is Hellmann's voice, but often it is Julia's words we hear.It is precisely because the book is so fragmented and uneven that it rings so true.All in all, a MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"I do not have the knowledge or tools to judge whether Hellman has written the truth here. However, what I do know is that it is splendidly written in a quirky style, which I studied when younger, and the stories are full of psychological depth and personal reflection. While I find her plays and scripts somewhat shallow with easy-to-label characters, I admit that I liked this book as a fully realized work of art.While I do think it matters if she consciously fictionalized her life, whatever the facts this is a good read. I will leave it to scholars and critics to hash out the debate.There are many memorable scenes that live in my mind: her floating in a storm and remembering an incident of killing a snapping turtle, with reminiscences of Hammett as her great love. The scene wanders into a rumination of death and loss, which I thought was real literature. Of course, there is the story of Julia, but there are many other notable scenes, like Hemingway competing with Hammett over his sppon-bending abilities. It is also a window into the past that is vividly rendered.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Pentimento is a fine example, not only of Hellman's writing, but of her imaginative style. The story 'Julia' stands out in this collection because of its basis in reality.The character of Julia is based, at least partly, on the adventures of the New York psychiatrist, Muriel Gardiner. Like the fictitious Julia, Gardiner studied in pre-war Vienna where she became involved with an anti-Nazi group. Hellman, who also lived for a time in New York, heard bits and pieces of Gardiner's story. Though Gardiner did not lose a leg and obviously survived, her story piqued Hellman's imagination. Hellman's portrait of Julia does not exactly parallel the life of Muriel Gardiner but it was sufficiently close, especially the Vienna section, for some critics to accuse Hellman of purloining Dr Gardiner's story.Dr Gardiner produced her own memoir in 1983, a book titled 'Code Name \\"Mary\\" '. Though she had an exciting time in Vienna, her story is not nearly as fascinating as Hellman's 'Julia'. The ending is especially poignant and avoids the happy ending that brought Dr. Gardiner's book to a close."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"Pentimento: A Book of Portraits is electrfying in its earnestness and candor, incisive in its tone, acerbic in its wit and picturesque in its mental imagery - a memoir (unlike An Unfinished Woman) that is a bit more honed and focused and less formless in how the recollections and diary entries jump from one to the next. Be that as it may, let it not mitigate the merit of An Unfinished Woman, for in its own right, it is a very worthy read and most deserving of its National Book Award. Each chapter in Pentimento is framed, each segment representing a person, place or experience that had a certain signifigance to Lillian Hellman's life and development not only as a playwrite but as a person. The book chapters are listed as thus: Bethe, Willy, Julia, Theatre, Arthur W.A. Cowan, Turtle, and Pentimento. The writing fluidity is fragmented, almost jarring, but the fierce, explicit prose enhances the flavor of the volatile, broken mishmash of truth and hyperbole, a choice style that is not a detriment to what Hellman has to say. With magnetic intimacy, the portraits all have something meaningful to declare; they range from the profound to the wittily bizarre. The latter is best represented in the portraits entitled &quot;Arthur W.A. Cowan&quot; and &quot;Turtle.&quot; It is in these two portraits where Hellman's mordant humor especially shines.From Arthur W.A. Cowan:I said, &quot;Oh, shut up, Arthur.&quot;And he did, but that night as he paid the dinner check, he wrote out another check and handed it to me. It was for a thousand dollars.I said, &quot;What's this for?&quot; &quot;Anybody you want.&quot;I handed it back.He said, &quot;Oh, for Christ sake take it and tell yourself it's for putting up with me.&quot;&quot;Then it's not enough money.&quot; (P.235)AndFrom Turtle:Toward afternoon I telephoned the New York Zoological Society of which I was a member. I had a hard time being transferred to somebody who knew about turtles. When I finished, the young voice said, &quot;Yes, the Chelydra serpentina. A ferocious foe. Where did you meet it?&quot;&quot;Meet it?&quot;&quot;Encounter it?&quot;&quot;At a literary cocktail party by a lake.&quot; (P.278)Considering the period, the one-liners are quite sharp; the portrait that obviously stands out the most is &quot;Julia,&quot; the 'supposed' friendship that developed between Hellman and a Freud disciple who happened to be an anti-facist supporter - a 'friendship' that later formed the basis for the Academy Award-winning film of the same title. Whether the story is fact or fiction, that is up for the reader to decide. Whether &quot;Julia&quot; represented a single woman or a group of dedicated individuals fighting to stop/lessen the evils of war whom Hellman truly admired and who thus wanted her name associated with, may also never be known. But what can be said of the Julia portrait is that it is a written down homage to a person or persons who tried to make a positive difference in that dark epoch of our global history."},{"Title":"Pentimento","review":"If you have never read \\"Pentimento,\\" you should find a way to rectify that fact.

He acknowledges the influence of Shakespeare's A Midsummer's Nights Dream, which furthered beliefs and fueled interest. He writes of what an irony this was, saying that although Shakespeare recognized the traditional fairies of his time and represented them well, these depictions were &quot;...superceded by the fanciful beings that he invented for an appearance in one play.&quot;Because of this, he concludes, real fairies were &quot;tamed, shrunken, childized and ridiculed into oblivion.&quot;I recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of belief in fairies."},{"Title":"Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis: Form and Content in Tonal Music","review":"Forte's &quot;Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis&quot; is most effective when used by a good teacher.

In both cases, the reviewer critcizes not an iota of the book's content he is reviewing! Forte/Gilbert is a standard text in Schenkerian Analysis. It is by no means, however, a great text. It is indeed dense and its organization is quite often flawed. However, this is a presentational issue mainly. It is neither what &quot;clumsy&quot; has implied (that it lack content), nor what &quot;A nightmare!&quot; has stated out right (that it is a theoretical imposition of a composer-wannabe's ideas onto compositions). Neither the original theory nor this book explains all of tonal music (or claims to!) and to make the calims such as those made above is absurd. If you need to buy this book, you will. Otherwise, it is not exactly enjoyable reading. The Cadwallader/Gagne text is a more practical introduction to Schenkerian Analysis, for those that are freelancing in music theory. I give this book no more than 3 stars as well but I do it on the basis of having read, grappled, and understood the book and its flaws. No book, no matter how flawed, deserves the treatment of an ignorant gloss in an honest review."},{"Title":"Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis: Form and Content in Tonal Music","review":"This gets three stars because it is the only readable (just) exposition of Schenker's theory in one volume available--to my knowledge. Otherwise it should get one star. The author's prose is clumsy, often ungrammatical, and his argument is unsound, often logically fallacious. Eventually something better will come along. (Readers interested in music theory will probably want to look at PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns too.)"},{"Title":"Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis: Form and Content in Tonal Music","review":"Never fear. No one is likely ever to mistake the author of &quot;Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis&quot; for Ernest Hemingway. In fact there exist many eloquent and elegantly written music theory textbooks, Walter Piston's &quot;Counterpoint&quot; and Cecil Forsyth's &quot;Orchestration&quot; among them. But I don't expect eloquence. I expect that a writer who can't distinguish adjectives and nouns, who doesn't understand that pronouns require antecedents, and who mangles his diction should not be published--or at least that his manuscript should be carefully edited. By this criterion alone I might reasonably withhold from &quot;Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis&quot; as many stars as I am allowed. (Alas, I am not so reasonable.) I don't have room now to discuss its treatment of Schenker's theories. I should like to point out, however, (to belabor the obvious) that 1) no book can be excused its faults on the ground that it is intended as a classroom supplement and that 2) it is illogical and...rude to gratuitously assume criticism the concomitant of ignorance or opacity."},{"Title":"Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis: Form and Content in Tonal Music","review":"got it in time, and was exactly what i was looking for. cheapest price i could find and 5 star service. :)"},{"Title":"Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis: Form and Content in Tonal Music","review":"I am a student of music and read musical analyses avariciously; I had no problem understanding 'The Art of fugue' or Piston's 'Harmony'. This book, on the other hand, is an abstruse Nightmare! It's odd because Mr. Forte at least pretends to want to explain his subject clearly, and the book has just hundreds of examples; but I'm afraid I hardly understood a single one of them. From the very earlist examples on, Mr. Forte paints full Schenkerian grafts, before you even know what half of those silly lines and phrasing markes mean, and example after example I found my poor self asking: why this way, and not that way? And so I read the entire book, front to cover, various times, trying to see if this or that question would eventually be addressed, but in vain.Since then I have come to understand Schenkerian thought, partly, through other sources. I have concluded that the reason his theories are so very hard to understand and to put into practice is because a great deal of it is just nonsense for people who wish they were composers but aren't, and so they spend their time painting little complicated grafts (which are often even misleading about the way we hear music). That said, I nevertheless hope that one day a better, clearer book on this historically important subject will soon be writ."},{"Title":"Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis: Form and Content in Tonal Music","review":"This book is poorly organized and pompously written. I hear Schenkerian analysis can be helpful and interesting but you wouldn't know it from this book. Not that I even made it very far. I wish I hadn't spent the money."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"Through print and screen we have learnt how Oskar Schindler, that Sudenten charmer, saved the lives of his Jewish workers in occupied Poland and Czechoslovakia during World War II. What was less recognised is the role in Oskar's activities of his wife, Emilie. She appears of course in Kenneally and Spielberg, but she is a small bit actor, confined to the margins. Now, finally, we hear from Emilie.In a series of reminiscences, she tells us of her Catholic upbringing in Bohemia and her first meeting with Oskar. Entranced by his \\"mysterious, undefinable nature\\", marriage followed soon after. The coupling was not always a happy one though and Emilie says she was aware of her husband's extra-marital wanderings from the early days. Still, she stayed with him. Like other women, she couldn't pull herself away from what she described as Oscar's natural seductiveness.Emilie's views on Oscar are insightful but the real story is her part in Oskar's acts of deliverance. Most noteworthy was her leadership and devotion to the surviving Jews of Goleschau, who arrived unannounced, emaciated, near death in frozen cattle cars in the middle of the night. In what was already a hellish situation, her quick thinking saved many at a time when Oskar was away on some business trip.Some will be disappointed by this book's brevity and the narrative is a little disjointed in parts. But we now know more about Oskar's long-suffering wife and her part in the drama. It's well known that in 1967 Yad Vashem recognised Oskar as one of the Righteous Among the Nations. It is less publicised that in 1993 it correctly extended this recognition to Emilie. In the concluding lines to her story she invites us to toast her, as well as her husband. It's now time we did."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"The account of the Schindlers is very well known. For this reason, my review intentionally focuses on some little-known information relative to this interesting memoir provided by Oskar Schindler's widow.Emilie Schindler recounts the challenges her husband faced in keeping his Jewish workers. Yet, all over the Reich, Jews were being spared from death and diverted into forced labor. A few hundred thousand known Jews survived the Nazi period in this manner. This fact contradicts Holocaust-uniqueness proponents, who had argued that ALL Jews were targeted for extermination, and, moreover, that practical matters were invariably shunted aside in the effort to locate and kill every possible Jew. The Schindlers' experience exemplifies the fact that the Germans were willing to spare some Jews provided that they would be useful to the Reich. And, with few exceptions, these Jewish forced laborers were not killed in the final hours of the war. Finally, the Schindlers' experience shows that the Germans WERE willing to let practical matters (namely the need for forced laborers) to get in the way of killing as many Jews as possible.Emilie Schindler believes that Erwin Rommel, the Desert Fox, did not commit suicide. She believes that he was kidnapped from his home and forced to swallow poison (p. 95).It is interesting to note that Oskar Schindler spoke Polish quite well (p. 49). Moreover, he had been involved in anti-Polish intelligence before the war. It also turns out that he was involved in the action of procuring Polish army uniforms for German intelligence (p. 32). These were later used in the German propaganda stunt in which \\"Polish\\" soldiers attacked the Germans, giving the latter a pretext for launching their war of aggression against Poland.Emilie Schindler (p. 43) informs the reader that Polish forces were able to resist the German invaders for only 8 days. This is manifestly incorrect. Regular Polish forces fought both the invading Germans and Russians for 35 days. Then Polish guerilla warfare began and never stopped during the entire German occupation of Poland.Very few non-Poles realize the fact that, as a final act of cultural genocide, the Germans planned to blow up the cultural cities of Krakow (Cracow) and Czestochowa (Tschenstochau). Emilie Schindler mentions the former (p. 50). Only the speedy arrival of the Red Army (and, not mentioned, Polish guerilla resistance) prevented this from happening. (I myself visited Krakow and saw the holes that the Germans had cut into the foundations of the historical buildings. These holes were to be filled with explosive charges. After the war, the holes were left unfilled as a testimony to German barbarism).The Schindlers apparently had some sympathy for Poles. Emilie Schindler recounts an experience (pp. 58-59) during which she expressed anger and defiance to an SS man, whose dog had just bitten a Polish woman. In the plant at Brunnlitz, Oskar Schindler had not only Jewish forced laborers, but also Czech and Polish forced laborers. Owing to the shortage of food rations, Oskar Schindler always saw to it that the Jewish forced laborers were given more food, as they were forced to do heavier work (p. 85)."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"Ever since I saw Schindlers List I wanted to know more. This story draws you in and makes the reader think he/she is experiancing what the people in the story are. Truly a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"This is a terrifoc book. It really gives insight into what happened with Oskar Schindler, and his wife. Great addition if you are a fan of Schindler's List, which seems not to credit Emilie fairly fpr all she did as well as Oskar. Awesome. Very informatibe - I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"I am working on a book on Oskar Schindler, so I certainly appreciated the perspective of his wife. If you're considering this book to augment your understanding of Oskar Schindler, then this is an excellent book. If you're reading it purely as a memoir, it has some serious flaws. It is short on detail and struggles with a cogent chronology for the reader to follow. Remember, Emilie Schindler was not a writer, and she had help to even write this book.However, this is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the enigmatic Oskar. I read it in a few hours. I think that amount of time is worth the valuable insight I gained into Oskar's character and motivational profile."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"Emilie was the real strength of conviction behind the otherwise boorish, womanizing Oskar. This memoir / biography provides an amazing view of Oskar and his many corpulent weaknesses. One wonders if all those people would have been saved if their fates had been left to Oskar alone. The book itself is well-written and perhaps subject to some literary critique since Emilie never proclaimed to be a writer. It is true that Emilie seems to have had a \\"persecution complex\\" believing that she had to do all the grunt work while Oskar was out doing his thing. If one believes her remembrances, as documented, then that would be pretty accurate. I think that her co-author and certainly the editor could have made this book better by helping to downplay some of the \\"poor Emilie\\" aspects and adding more meat to her role along side Oskar. That said, I found little to be critical of in her style and delivery. Highly recommend this insightful, historical book."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"With all due respect to Mrs. Schindler, who certainly has had her share of hardships in her life, this book is really pathetic. It seems to be a poorly written essay on &quot;Why I should be called a saint&quot;. (Despite her disclaimer that she does not consider her husband or herself heroes.) The tone is flat, petty, childish, curiously voiceless. Other than a string of infantile reminiscences of how she supposedly verbally stood up to the Nazis, her only other point is to try to impress the reader with what a dissolute rakehell her husband was. The movie &quot;Schindler's List&quot; did NOT portray her husband as a god; quite the contrary in my opinion. It showed him to be the complex character that he was. Perhaps her pique stems from the fact that Emilie Schindler's character was almost absent from that movie. All right, Mrs. Schindler, by list survivor accounts, did indeed help her husband take care of &quot;his Jews&quot;. But don't waste your time or money on this book. There are scores of other memoirs and even fiction that are much more enlightening. Read &quot;The Cap&quot; by Roman Frister, or &quot;The Reader&quot; by Bernhard Schlink. Or read &quot;Schindler's Legacy&quot;, a compilation of first-person &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; testimonies."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"As a fan and avid reader of anything relating to WWII and the Holocaust, I was looking forward to reading this book. The only thing I knew about the Schindlers was from seeing the Speilberg movie, so I thought reading about their experience firsthand would be insightful and rewarding. In her introduction, Emilie states that her husband was not a hero and neither was she. This isn't a statement trying to discredit their actions, but rather an attitude that is commonplace among WWII survivors. Any soldier who receives a medal will tell you that he isn't a hero. The heroes are always described as those who gave their lives.Emilie Schindler begins her very brief memoir with scattered stories, remembrances and incidences from her childhood that are meant to show us at once how inquisitive and stubborn she was, qualities that later served her during WWII. Her memories seem scattered here and there, with no focus, until she meets Oskar Schindler and marries him shortly thereafter. As she talks about their experience working as spies, she also highlights and rehashes Oskar's numerous affairs, some with acquaintances and the approval of mutual acquaintances. From the movie, we know that Oskar was not a faithful husband, but the trouble with Emilie's tirade is that she claims not to be angry at her husband. If she isn't angry, why is nearly a quarter of the memories about her husband's infidelities? And if she was so hurt by his actions, why did she stay with him? She talks about his mysterious and seductive nature that made women pursue him instead of vice versa, but there's no concrete reason to support both her anger at him and her staying with him. Even the words she claims to have uttered at his graveside for filming the Speilberg movie, seem hollow and untrue when viewed with what she has written previously. If she has forgiven him for his infidelities and leaving her, it certainly doesn't show in her scrambled prose. And the final lesson of the prologue that we are to \\"love one another\\" is almost laughable after her tirade against her husband.I'm not trying to say that Emilie Schindler didn't love her husband, or that she doesn't deserve credit for her role in the so-called \\"Schindler's List\\", because the truth of the matter is that her and her husband saved over a thousand Jews. And without her help, Oskar Schindler most likely would not have succeeded. However, as inspiring as their story is, and could have been portrayed, this memoir is a bitter rant in disguise."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"With my interest in World War II and the Holocaust, I eagerly anticipated reading this book as a supplementary material to \\"Schindler's List\\" the movie and my other books on the subject. While the book has its moments, it is very uneven. It almost seems that Emilie Schindler wrote this book to spite her husband and take some credit for his work. While I am sure she deserves more credit than she receives, the tone of the book almost seems bitter.The book is short in length, almost too short for a memoir. Emilie Schindler gives a summary of her life at each stage. I felt that she had so much more to say at times, but held back. Particularly, the events involving protecting Jews during the Holocaust is far too brief. Mrs. Schindler spends more time talking about irresponsible behavior and infidelity in her marriage than I cared to read. Since the book was released shortly after the movie was released, it seems she is trying to discredit her husband.Emilie Schindler does give some valuable insights into her life and her late husband's life that may not have been written before. For example, little has been written of their plight after the war. Before this book, little has been said about how Oskar left his wife after the living with her in Argentina for several years. Also, Mrs. Schindler points out some of the flaws in the movie \\"Schindler's List\\" while still acknowledging it was a good film.What ruined this book for me was the bitter tone Emilie Schindler sets. I would rather focus on Oskar Schindler's great work than his flaws."},{"Title":"Where Light and Shadow Meet: A Memoir","review":"I have been billed for this book, but still have never received it.

But my advise- spend a couple of evenings searching out reputable names in natural hoof care on the web, what they have to say, and various forums on this topic. You'll learn at least as much as you would in this book. You'll also find oodles and oodles of photos of \\"bad\\" feet and perfect barefoot natural feet, learn terminology and see diagrams.

Never re-read Jackson, but Ramey's is dog-eared from studying again and again.

It reads like a pause, an interlude between Unsworth's densely crafted and thoroughly enjoyable historical novels, (Land of Marvels; Sacred hunger, et al).What a wonderfully gifted writer!Constance Richardson, Author, \\"Swimming Upstream: A Memoir.\\""},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"The first Barry Unsworth book I have read, and very enjoyable. If you are thinking of relocating, or buying property in a region with unknown cultures this book is a must. It relates the struggles and pressures of dealing with alien protocols and the general mis-haps that can ensue. It also shows Barry's love and his enrapture for this beautiful region of Italy.Try it, you'll enjoy it"},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"Unsworth is always a gifted writer, even with a story that seems to alternately tighten and lose its focus, as here, rather than sharpening steadily toward a climax that ties everything together, as his best novels do. Its flaws notwithstanding, this Umbrian set-piece is an entertaining read, with some well-developed characters, especially the lawyer, Mancini; the unscrupulous British contractor, Blemish; and the Chapmans, whose marital compromises are exposed during the course of the dispute with their unpleasant peasant neighbors. The other characters - the anguished German, the morose cuckolded professor, the nave and art-mad American retirees, the gay Italian betrayed by his lover - function more as local color. As realistically detailed as their personalities are, they are not particularly relevant to the plot, such as it is. Not that they need to be, in a book like this, which is as much a collection of character sketches as an account of a specific human conflict. If you accept the novel on those terms, it's easier to enjoy. Reading it, I wondered if Unsworth hadn't collated and embroidered mental notes about some of his real Umbrian neighbors into these pages. The greedy peasant family, the Checcheti, who instigate the dispute over the road they all share, are for me the one real disappointment. Seen from a distance, they never come into focus enough to be interesting. They are never in the same room with us, as it were. That may well be true to the Chapman's perspective on them, however, as the Chechetti are presented almost exclusively in relation to their British neighbors. At the end, I felt that I did understand many of the other characters. Mancini, the Perugian lawyer more interested in the art of litigation than in justice, nicely represents the \\"furbo\\" (cunning) aspect of the Italian personality. Blemish, the book's buffoon, is believable as a committed cheat who is morally offended when others try to cheat him. (His loving and lusty relationship with his generously fleshed wife provides the book's only comic element.) The fatuous, self-satisfied Harold Chapman is neatly described as someone who \\"was given to the counting of blessings, which in practice meant the listing of assets.\\" I cheered the far more sensitive Cecilia Chapman's radical life-choice at the end of the novel. This would be a good book to read on holiday at the beach or in the mountains. But don't take it to Italy when you go. Bring your Blue Guide and your phrase book instead, and get to know the country and its inhabitants a little. I promise you'll meet far friendlier people than inhabit this fictionalized Umbria."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"I picked up this book because the author had won a Booker Prize, and, unlike The National Book Award, winners of the Booker are generally reliable. In this case, while his prize-winning, or near prize-winning, books may have been good, this one was not. Neither was it bad. The writing was smooth enough to keep me reading, but the book simply did not gel.After Hannibal falls into the Year in Provence category of books -- Brits (or Americans, pick your empire) buy property in Italy/France and have problems with the natives. The problems are supposed to be entertaining, and in some way, show us the endearing nature of the natives, who are charming but frustrating in their simple, unfathomable ways. This book followed that well-worn pattern, but without the endearing and charming parts. The various imports--a British couple, an American couple, a guilt-haunted German, a gay urban Italian couple--all have run-ins with the Checchetti family, a bunch of devious, and thoroughly disagreeable peasants. The run-ins were supposed to be amusing.Regrettably, we were not amused, not because the writing was bad (it wasn't, in fact it was quite good), or because the plot wasn't engaging (it was, in its own convoluted way), but because the author did not appear to have put very much effort into this novel. In fact, I could not quite shake the feeling that he had written it while on vacation (in Italy) out of a sense of habit. (\\"I really should be writing something.\\") I am willing to read some of Unsworth's other books, because it is obvious he knows his way around a pen, but in the future I will stick to the ones that live up to his reputation."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"I'd been looking forward to this book since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and was enormously disappointed. No cannibalism. No Clarice Starling. Plenty of the Italy that we had all been expecting since hearing that the author was attending the trial of some Italian serial killer, though. So where was Hannibal Lector? Well, in a very intrigueing and disturbing fashion the author has hidden him in the text. At first I was disappointed and then I realised that this was literary detective story as much as it is a horror story. Which one of these characters is Hannibal Lector, disguised and under a new identity? And what is he going to do? Understanding that - and no, I'm not going to give it away - turned it into a very interesting book indeed. Was it worth waiting over ten years for? I don't know. BUt as always this talented author has given us a lot to think about."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"Can the history of a region shape the lives of those who settle there? Barry Unsworth, winner of the Booker Prize for his novel SACRED HUNGER, suggests that may be so in his hypnotic and gorgeously written new novel about fantasy, deceit and betrayal.Set in &quot;Golden&quot; Umbria, a region made famous by painters like Raphael and Peruggino, AFTER HANNIBAL explores a brief spell of time for English, Italian, German, and American neighbors living along a dusty rural road. They all have their dreams, some elevated, some vicious, and reality crushes each of them in one way or another--or sets them free in unexpected ways.But that's not surprising, because they live in a dramatic, blood-soaked landscape, however dreamy and idyllic it may appear, and however filled it may be with cities that are &quot;treasure-houses of art and history.&quot; Hannibal destroyed a Roman army there, and in the Renaissance, noble families jockeyed for power, defying each other and the Papacy in blood. The region's history is &quot;a record of crime.&quot;All this background is ironically supplied by an Italian history professor who himself longs &quot;to be detached from history, rescued&quot;--but of course, that's not possible for him or his neighbors who are bound together in surprising ways.Though the author's couple from Michigan sounds more British than American, it's an easily forgiven lapse. AFTER HANNIBAL is wise and witty, infused with the warmth of a dazzling landscape, and tempered by a sad, deep knowledge of the human penchant for self-deception and self- destruction. It's a deeply moving book much like one of the tiny, ancient Umbrian towns the author describes: &quot;undemonstrative, unclamorous--it makes no very loud or evident claim on your attention. It exists in its own right, in its venerable and richly layered past and harmonious present.&quot;"},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"Barry Unsworth is one of my favorite authors, and I have read all his books. This was my least favorite. What \\"unites\\" the disparate characters are simply a road which passes by their houses and (ubiquitously) a lawyer whom they each consult. Although Unsworth's use of historical context and detail is usually one of the most enjoyable and well developed aspects of his novels, here we are dealing, peripherally, with battles involving both Hannibal (who craftily fought off the Romans) and the Fascists (who left this part of Italy devastated).Having spent time in the Italian countryside, I could relate somewhat to the details that Unsworth relates about the land and the feel of the environment however; the book itself just doesn't have a central core. Having said all that, however, I'd still rather read a lesser Unsworth book than most books on the bestseller list"},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"Though entertaining - and deadly realistic in its portrayal of human weakness at its most mean - this is not the best of Mr.Unsworth's fiction. Its portrayal of the lives and struggles of isolated expatriates in Tuscany, and of their exploitation by an avaricious attorney, has much of the comic about it, and the observations are never less than sharply ironic and amusing, but the underlying theme is of tragedy, of small lives blighted by failures of spirit and generosity. There is no redeeming feature in this story of gloom and petty misery and the larger themes that dominate much of Mr.Unsworth's other fiction are missing here. It is a capable and readable work - but by the time one is half-way through one longs for something more. This said however, Mr.Unsworth in even his lesser work - the category this undoubtedly falls into - is still a better writer than many who are higher acclaimed and the aficionado of his work should not give this a miss."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"and 'Ugly Englishman' as opposed to Americans who are unusually kind and trusting in this book about several couples trying to work through the good offices of an Italian lawyer trying to help them with problems caused by greedy contractors, crazy neighbors etc.. I found all the little stories interesting except for the one about the professor Monti where Unsworth included maybe a little too much about local history for my patience. All in all an interesting book that also provides a cautionary tale for rich foreigners who are keen on Italian real estate."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"For a modest book, \\"After Hannibal\\" has a surprising number of themes: human greed and ruthlessness; the beauty of Umbria and its art and hill towns; the deficiencies of the Italian legal system; marriage. Unsworth made his home in Umbria at the time this book was written, and it shows. It takes a writer of considerable talent to make the reader so deeply experience the beauty of a region.The book is nicely plotted, and its historical material is interesting in itself as well as contributing to the themes and plot There is an ensemble cast of characters. They interact convincingly, but clearly Unsworth takes more interest in some than others. The most memorable characters are the project manager and the lawyer. A few minor points bothered me. Cecelia intends to stop at a bar as part of her flight, which would mean, as it happens, that she would stumble on her husband, yet it seems unlikely to me that Unsworth would want to suggest this, it just does not fit. Fabio notices that the lawyer had not \\"included himself in the ranks of mortality\\". There is something larger than life about the lawyer, but what purpose does his utterance about \\"you mortals\\" serve? Finally, Cecillia is disheartened at how quickly the peasants cave in when it is clear the legal system will work against them: to me this does not reflect any lack of dignity, but the shrewdness of the poker player who knows when to fold. In this case, perhaps we just need to differentiate between Cecilia's views and the author's."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"As always, Unsworth's skill as a story teller and creator of compelling characters pulled me through the story. But by the end I realized that I didn't care about the characters, and their stories seemed more sketched than real. I think he tried unsuccesfully to tie too many story lines together.Read Pascqualli's Island instead."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"A very readable account of expat life in Italy, revolving around the shananigans of a cunning lawyer. Some of the characters are better drawn than others, particularly the English couple - Harold is pretty unattractive, but you can understand why, and by the end of the book I saw his wife as a rounded, though not totaly attractive character. The gay Italian couple and the odball German I didn't find very convincing."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"I have read almost all of Barry Unsworth's books and am extremely disappointed in &quot;After Hannibal&quot;. In part, this may be because I live in Italy and have some idea of the expat scene here. But there's more to it than that, since I absolutely loved &quot;Stone Virgin&quot; which is set in Venice and to my mind is one of the most intriguing and mysterious novels I have read in the last few years. Barry Unsworth usually steeps himself in the historical background of his subjects, as was the case with &quot;The Rage of the Vultures&quot;, &quot;The Sacred Hunger&quot; and the more recent, and fascinating &quot;Morality Play&quot; (not to mention &quot;Pascali's Island&quot;. This one gave me the impression that perhaps the author had a contract to fulfill and therefore didn't do more than go through the motions. Che peccato!"},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"After Hannibal is another fine example of Unsworth's ability to brilliantly incorporate historic narrative into contemporary fiction. His droll storytelling is made sharper by the fine portrayal and exploration of characters -- and his lyrical descriptiveness."},{"Title":"After Hannibal","review":"Barry Unsworth is one of my favorite authors, and I have read all his books.

Feil puts not only a human face on the diagnosis of dementia, but with that face, she explains the basic human need that lies within; to be validated. People are more than their age, their diagnosis, their care plans and their &quot;issues&quot;, but all that is often lost, particularly in a long-term care setting and the individual is reduced to dehumanized terms. But Feil reminds us of the unique needs of the -individual- and illustrates effective means of communicating with -people- with dementia (not dealing with &quot;dementia&quot; as though it were some sort of creature divorced from the person) based on -their- comforts and abilities, not the caregivers. Comunication techniques using music, gentle touch accompanied with verbalization and a variety of other methods (custom fit to your client) proved successful when I implemented them for my clients. A wonderful book which puts the human dignity of each client front and center. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I will admit that this book did a good job of pulling me in. The action and intrigue were well paced and written in an easy and flowing manner. The characters were cookie-cutter but still interesting to see. The dean, frat brothers and alumni made for a nice villan and an interesting alternative to the whole \\"one big bad guy\\" idea. Instead of one head honcho, we have three to contend with. Each with their own motives and mission. However, there is one thing that spoiles a book for me and makes me give a bad review. With all the words in the English language, why is it that authors feel they must use the four-letter ones? The \\"f\\" word was on every page...used as a noun, a verb and an adjective. There are many words in the English language...perhaps the author should have taken some time and found them...."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I'm going to keep this review extremely short.

However, I found that I could not put it down. Outstanding. To the average reader it may be an indictment against the fraternity system. I would disagree. I shows what many so-called fraternities have become in the U.S. But it also explains what fraternities are supposed to be. Although some fraternties chapters have become the hazing, evil institutions this book represents, I still believe most chapters are trying to provide the true brotherhood and &quot;family&quot; that these characters where searching.Excellently written and captivating."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down and I highly recommend to others!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I enjoyed The Pledge, although I thought the author was trying a bit too hard to be &quot;literary&quot; - too many flowery descriptions, etc. As a Bowdoin graduate, though, it was fun to read the book and hear some of the phrases and nicknames for things that I haven't heard in 10+ years.

I would recommend this book to anyone who like a mystery/thriller book."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I picked this book up at a bargain table &amp; am glad I did. The other reviews describe the plot so I don't need to, but it kept me reading right until the end. It's a classic good vs. evil story, with the good being very good &amp; the evil being really evil."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I picked up this book because i'm fascinated by fraternities. I've never belonged to one, but i'm fascinated by the whole concept of the secrecy of the initiation rituals and what might possibly go on, and how most frat brothers would go to their grave first before telling what happened. Which leads me to believe that they experienced things and had things done to them that were either really embarrassing or humiliating.This book is a great page-turner. I usually shy away from novels of this length, but the fact that it was a murder mystery/suspense story centered around a frat house was too good to resist. I'm thrilled to learn they are making a movie of this book because as soon as i was finished, i thought how great a movie this would make. The rhythm and flow of this book reads like a screen play.Unfortunately, knowing how Hollywood can totally ruin a good book, the movie version will proabably be a major disappointment. As a matter of fact, i'm willing to bet that the movie version will have people who read the book saying, \\"The book was so much better.\\"Anyway, pick up this book. It's a lot of fun. Just be sure to suspend your disbelief at the door because there are some plot points that might be a bit hard to swallow as far as believable.An excellent first novel."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"An amazing first novel by Rob Kean. His characters are detailed down to their chipped teeth (Once you read the book you will understand). Each character takes the story deeper and deeper, creating a real novel about the perils of Fraternity Life.The story takes us into the twisted (yet believable) world of a fraternity that will do anything to make itself and its members flourish and succeed in life. Everyone will get involved in the fraternity's most recent scandal. But, Jesse (the main character) must deal with his own past fraternity life/scandal to solve this new one. It seems like there is no way out of the twisted lies for Jesse.If you love stories involving Fraternity and College life, you will love this one."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Rob Kean's first book was a success in every sense of the word. The story kept you entertained, guessing, surprised and not wanting to put the book down for what might occur next. I attended an Ivy League college, joined a frat, and played a college sport. These connections made the story even more captivating for me on a personal level. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick, fascinating read about the powers and extremes of fraternal brotherhood."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I think this was an outstanding book.

I cant wait until he has another book out!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I picked up The Pledge just to read the cover summary. I knewthis was a must read. I'm not going to go into an overly detailed account of the book. I read a review on this website which said the plot was unbelievable and too complicated. On the first, isn't that why we escape into the world of fiction? Secondly, the plot was complicated, but that's part of what made it so wonderful. The book had more twists and turns than a scenic road on a mountainside. It thoroughly held my interest. Like any book it had certain slow spots, but it would quickly pick up. The review I read stated the characters were not well developed. Nothing could be further from the truth. All the reader doesn't know is the characters' blood types. It's a 718 page roller coaster that's better than any amusement park ride. I could go on, but if you have a strong affection for your college days, enjoy surprises with the turn of a page, and want to be completely consumed by a book....READ THIS BOOK!!! If it were a car, it would be the ultimate driving experience."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The Pledge was one of my favorite reads of the year, and I have read a lot of books. It is the type of book that just grips you and has you looking forward to reading every chance you get. After you read a chapter you are always left saying well maybe just one more, and then another. It is quite long, but reads very fast. The characters are well developed and likeable, and there are numerous interesting subplots weaved into the main story. There is also some humorous moments, especially involving the dean. The main plot is very compelling, and the plot twists are numerous. I hope Rob Kean has another book this good up his sleeve. I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The Pledge's account of the shady dealings of a snooty college, it's big name frat, and the people who will stop at nothing to make them both accountable for the hazing death of a student, is a quick and easy read.

This one is a standout! Definitely a book you cannot put down. Well written, great plot!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I tussled with giving this book a 4 or 5 star rating. In the end, I decided on 5 stars. It was a very good book that kept my attention the whole way through. It was somewhat predictable, but the way the author presented the storyline, it still did make you wonder whether what you thought would happen really would happen. The hero is an everyday guy, who kind of fell into his role. At first you didn't know whether to cheer for him or boo him. The frat parties were graphically depicted and I have no doubt that some of this stuff happens out there in the world. Whether or not a \\"brotherhood\\" of frat alumni would form is questionable, but certainly within the realm of possibility given the not so distant steps from hazing events to a brotherhood. Along the way, the author adds some rather dramatic \\"asides\\" in the story line - eg, the family of a dead student visiting his grave. At first these seemed to be too numerous and not pertaining to the storyline, but by the end of the novel, I realized that these asides DID actually add to the atmosphere of the story.In all, an excellent first book by this author and I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Ok--I picked it up because it looked entertaining, but The Pledge just wasn't that great. The plot, on top of being drawn out and convoluted, was implausible. What kind of exclusive fraternity bids a pledge without knowing one blessed thing about his past? And come on, generations of former brothers that still hang around the frat house? It reminds me of the thirty year old guy who trolls around teen dance clubs trying to pick up high school girls and impress people with his fancy car. And, I was very dissatisfied with the way the story ended. I was hoping Mark would at last reconcile with his fugitive father, who was sort of at the center of the entire conflict--but we never even met the man!For me, the best parts of the story were the rhymes that Mark and the other black cloaked figures recited. Maybe the whole story could have been in rhyme--that would've been something!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This review is for the UNABRIDGED AUDIO BOOK.What an interesting read (listen). From the beginning when a pledge of 'big bully' frat (Sigma) was hazed to death, I knew it would be non-stop and it was. The story takes place at Maine's Simsbury College. The characters in this book are many, so you really have to pay attention at first to individual personalities. This book stirs a bevy of emotions within the reader.It boggled my mind to think how these Sigma apes got off on all the humiliation they inflicted to the pledges, and I can't help wonder... does this go on in real life? The college is run by a self serving, spineless man, Dean Templeton - and I was ever so happy how he 'got it in the end.'The story has a nice ending. Kean did a very good job of closure to all of the characters except for the two main parties, Mark and Sean. It left room for the reader to consider their fate - either separate or together. All in all, a good book to invest your time in to read or listen.PS... if you listen to audio books, please get the UNABRIDGED version. With all of the details and story of this book, I fear the abridged version would leave you somewhat baffled. In fact, never listen to anything abridged. It's like looking at a newspaper with no print!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although the plot is a little far fetched at times, it has enough suspense to keep you interested. The characters were well developed and you really got a sense of how a private school might react if something like that did occur. While reading it, I thought how this book would make a great teen horror movie. Hmmm...I guess I'll have to wait and see!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"If you went to college in a small town, this book will be very familiar to you.I went to school in a small town at a selective university, and many of the people, places, etc. are all familiar, making this book a very good and easy read.I hope Mr. Kean comes out with a follow up soon."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I certainly enjoyed reading &quot;The Pledge&quot; being a fraternity alum who went to the same high school as Rob. I could relate to many of the stories, humor and descriptions of greek life and the students at a small liberal arts college. I especially was impressed when some of the character names resembled similarities to our town upbringing. Additionally, some of the character actions put me in sync with Rob's mindset. I do, however, agree with some of the other readers comments about some of the characters actions being a little too unrealistic in addition to the overuse of certain four-letter words. Nevertheless this book is a thriller in the end. Anyone who has been a part of the greek system will certainly relate. My favorite quote about the attractive blue-eyed blonde girlfriend of the hero, &quot;a body that roughly fifty percent of the campus longed to hold, and the other fifty longed to resemble.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I'll be the last to describe this as a classic, it's much more of a page turner than anything else, but for a light read, especially when you're on vacation, you could hardly do better.Set on fictional New England college campus, The Pledge is about a Godfather-ish fraternity that controls everything at the college and in the surrounding town, as well as having their teeth sunk into many things nationally as well. The fraternity accidentally kills one of their pledges during a hazing stunt, and the book details the acts the chapter undertook to cover it up as well as just how ruthless they can be.As a Greek myself, I can say that very little of what is written in this book is true. But if you can suspend your disbelief, you'll have a book that you won't be able to put down until you're finished."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Good captivating charactors. There are enough plot twists and charactors to keep the suspense through the entire book. It was set in a college, and the students were quite believable. Looking at the descriptions, I could just about find someone from my college days to fit each of Kean's charactors. Some of the \\"alumni\\" weren't as believable, however, this may be due to my pre-set convictions. It was a page-turner to the very end. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys best sellers."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This is a fine debut novel from an an author I hope we see more from. Rob Kean has given his readers a gripping story on how power corrupts and things that people will do to maintain that power.Being a young man not too far removed from his own college days has also permitted Mr Kean to keep his details current, lively and informative. This is a book that could be read by college students AND their parents and both groups would be able to enjoy it. In addition to a deftly paced plot, the author also provides a morality play within the courtroom and murder subplots that co-exist within the pages of this great read.While set on a fictional college campus, this is primarily a murder mystery with some really well done courtroom drama thrown in for amplification. Kean does a fine job of building his characters as well and by book's end, I am sure every reader will have found a new level of respect and admiration for Kean's hero, Mark Jessy.I really enjoyed this book and can heartily recommend it to to college aged folks and their parents with equal fervor. Pick it up and read a great debut novel. I don't think you'll be sorry you did."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Simply written, with the pace of a James Patterson, the story line of a Sydney Sheldon and the plot of a Pat Conroy (Lords of Discipline) - this book held my attention for the three nights it took me to read it. Though reviewers seem to worry about whether it could happen or not, I'm thinking &quot;who cares?&quot; It's a good read, there are NO slow parts, and Mark Jessy is a hero, a la Will McClean of Conroy fame. Good for you Rob Kean, good for you. I eagerly await your next syllable."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"It's not often that I can't finish a book; usually if I can't it's due to a lack of plot interest. This is the first book I haven't been able to finish because I disliked every single character, even the two so-called good guys. The first hundred pages had nothing but evil characters manipulating and getting away with everything. I disliked the main good guy (can't even remember his name) for ever being involved in such a disgusting frat, and his girlfriend for going out with him; for someone who was so against frats, it seems strange that she should be going out with a former frat member.One hundred pages into the book, and there was not even a glimmer of hope that the evils of the frat would be punished. All of the actions of the characters were infuriating and just depressing to read.Thanks goodness I didn't buy even the paperback version of this book; it would be one that I couldn't even display on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I picked up this novel as a way to spend some time at the pool and while I wasn't disappointed, I was surprised at how predictable the plot line was written. It is a novel that explores that element of what makes frat houses and their inhabitants &quot;connect&quot; to one another, but this frat house, Sigma Delta Phi, not only expects psychological support from their members, they expect a kind of pseudo/robotic loyalty. Naturally, this enslavement comes with an incredibly high pricetag-namely being willing to forego any comfortable moral or ethical considerations. A subplot, involving the interactions of males versus how women interact, is, again, interesting yet shallow. The females that inhabit the book are either heavyset, hateful lesbian types or the sultry, intellectually vacuous ones. The only positive female of Rob Kean's novel is a blonde(naturally), yet brilliant and serious student whose first goal was to make Mark Jessy fit her preconceived ideas of what &quot;frat boys&quot; are really all about. This gorgeous protagonist, Shawn Jakes, then learns more of the human side of Mark Jessy (after convicting him on a date-rape charge as a member of the school disciplinary team). This relationship seems quite contrived--a man's pov that men perhaps don't view this crime in quite the same way that women do and perhaps don't wish to. All-in-all a pleasant read, although not enough to make me hope for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"As a national officer of Alpha Epsilon Pi, the last remaining Jewish fraternity, I picked up this book on a lark. Hazing is still a large issue in today's fraternity world, much to the dismay of most responsible participants.This is obviously a work of fiction. There are horrendous cases of hazing but nothing like the sadistic brand written about here. Also, while I recognize this was fiction, the absolute stretches made in this book, strained my ability to believe in the characters and the story.Yes, there are other flaws (how many people can be killed, bought off, etc. without anyone raising an eyebrow) and why isn't a Sigma on the board of directors if they donate so much and dominate the campus?But, it was a fun book that was a little escapist, a little scary and more than a litte silly."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I had seen this book on the bargain table a few times and thought I might like to read somebody's perspective on fraternity life, as I had been in one myself. After finally buying it, I read the jacket and realized it was Rob Kean's first book and that he went to Bowdoin and lived in Boston and I was anticipating reading it just to see what kind of writer he was to get such a lucrative book deal. Before I got a chance to read too much, being the Amazon junkie that I am, I ended up checking out reviews, and found that, sure enough, some people loved it, and some hated it. By this time I was dying to see why the reviews were so mixed. So, I finally finished the book I had been reading and focused on The Pledge. I would like to share my views by reviewing the reviews.Here are my thoughts regarding the negative reviews. This guy wrote a book while working full time, and he did a good job. It was something that kept me reading to the end. I personally thought that most of the plot was farfetched. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a work of fiction. If you are reading this book to find out how a fraternity operates, then you are going to the wrong place. I know that some of the elements are true, but there was just too many things that I couldn't buy. Oh yeah, this is a work of fiction! To think this is how a real fraternity operates is like thinking that you can bury your pets in a Pet Semetary and they will come back to life.My thoughts on the 5 star reviews. I wonder what other books these people have read. I'm not sure how this book can receive the highest available rating. My impression of Rob Kean is that he is an imaginative and talented writer, but the talent is raw. If he writes or has written another book, I would hope he took the time to improve his writing skills. I will read him again, but I can't really compare this to the best books I've read in terms of overall reading pleasure.All in all, this book has some quality, depending on what your reading tastes are. If you can't stomach plots that seem quite unrealistic, then don't read it. If you are the parent of a fraternity child, understand that it has more fiction than truth. If you are looking for a great work of literature, don't get your hopes up. If you are looking to be entertained for a week or two, give it a shot."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I'd heard this book was really hot ... And I'll admit, there were some good &quot;hazing&quot; scenes, but overall, I found Kean's writing pretty tame. Not nearly as good as Alan Dickson's _The Greek Way_ or Michael Nambla's _Barely Brothers_."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book certainly did not read like a first novel. It was excellent! The story takes place at a small private college in New England. The main story line revolves around a very rich or rather well endowed Fraternity.The trouble begins when a pledge dies, following a night of hazing and a party. The Sigma's feel like they will get off without a hitch, because Mark Jessy, a former Sigma brother, is on the Disciplinary Squad that will be looking into the pledges death. Mark is sure that it had to be an accident, and that his former \\"brothers\\" could not possibly have caused the death.Mark's girlfriend, Shawn Jakes, who is also on the Disciplinary Squad does not like the Sigma's and wants to get them shut down. She is determined that they will not get away with what they have done.The third and final member of the Disciplinary Squad is Simon Schwitters. He is planning to become a lawyer, and is therefore very interested in the case.The Dean of the college, Anson Templeton, will serve as the Judge, should the Disciplinary Squad press charges against the Sigma's. Templeton, however is very dirty. He is out to make a quick buck. He is on the payroll of the Sigma alumni. The Sigma alumni is responsible for most of the donations to the school, so they need to be kept happy. Dean Templeton is usually able to make problems disappear for them. However, this time, maybe not so...this book is rather long, but is worth reading. I found myself sitting up past midnight reading, not wanting to put it down. I enjoyed it and I am sure you will too."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Wow. This has to be absolutely one of the worst novels I have ever read (and I've read some of the stuff profiled in Pronzini's GUN IN CHEEK and SON OF GUN IN CHEEK). This is the literary equivalent of an Ed Wood movie-- ludicrous situations and dialogue so bad they have to be read to be believed. Jaw-droppingly awful. How did this thing even get published?"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I hate reading a book and having questions about what happened to the characters at the end. The author had way too many things going on in this book. It is almost as if he wanted to included every idea he has ever had in his life in one book. Additionally, the verse was way too poetic. The subject matter was not beautiful, so it was unneccessary to use the imagery that he did. In my opinion, there were just too many things going on in this book and its a shame that they went unresolved. This book would have been just as good if it was half the length."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. What a great debut book! Can't wait til he comes out with another one!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"An excellent read! He's right up there with Patterson and Grisham. Why hasn't he wrote any others??"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"amazing talent and this first novel is a showcase of what is yet to come - i can't wait. the setting is a college back east, the first chapter indeed the first few pages are horrific, there is a mysterious death, a chanting fraternity, and the evil presence of the unknown. i don't want to give too much away, but the writing style was smooth, the characters believable. enjoyed this book immensely."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"As a first novel for this author, I thought that he wrote an excellent novel! I enjoyed this book so much! The story revolves around a fraternity and the secrets they keep at the expense of others. A former member of the fraternity is conflicted about the novelty of brotherhood or the truth that must be found! There are questions of who to trust and who really is behind all of the bad things happening! This was a mystery which also showed how dangerous greek life can be. Although it was fiction, I think that there are some real issues with hazing in this story. I would definately recommend reading this story!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"i don't usually get into novels, but this one was fantastic. intriguing and keeps you guessing right along with the characters. i laughed, i cried, i loved it."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"An excellent novel. Believe the 5 star reviews, it's all true."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Which of Bowdoin's fraternities kicked Rob Kean out? And why did he leave Bowdoin before he graduated? (The jacket copy says he &quot;attended.&quot;) My husband, a Bowdoin alumnus, refused to read this book beyond the first chapter saying that it bore absolutely no resemblance to his experience.People have commented about the unrealistic characters of Mark and Shawn. How long would a college of the stature of &quot;Simsbury&quot; put up with a dean like Templeton or a befuddled president?Also, if Sigma were indeed the all-powerful, brothers-to-the-end, world-controlling fraternity it is made out to be, why was it that NONE of the Simsbury College trustees was a Sigma?"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Imagine the nice college boy, the son of your neighbors, this well-educated guy being member of one of the most famous fraternities, this friendly person is about to become a member of a corrupt trust undermining the market, political power, law, and order. In order to maintain and enlarge their world wide web of business, money, and power, this mafia recruits young students for their fraternity Sigma Delta Phi. The selection process for the &quot;pledges&quot; is pretty hard, and it is vital for the fraternity that the &quot;wrong&quot; people never become brothers. They have to be removed from the pledges, from the brothers.Chad Ewing is removed from the list of pledges by his untimely death. For some strange reasons, the only official investigation of his passing is in the hands of a &quot;disciplinary squad&quot; formed of three students: Former Sigma brother Mark Jessy, his girlfriend Shawn, and Simon, a prospective law-school student. This gang is headed by Dean Templeton, a corrupt man without reasonable qualification besides the fact that he is from Oxford.The book describes the squad's search for evidence to relate Chad Ewings death to the pledge activities of Sigma. Their efforts are permanently undermined by the Dean and by the mighty alumni of Sigma. The description of this process is well written, gripping, and makes it hard to put the book down. The effect is enhanced since for quite a while, no happy ending is in sight (and I leave it to the reader to judge the actual end of the book).&quot;The Pledge&quot; reminds me a bit of the good old &quot;Dallas&quot;/&quot;Dynasty&quot; soap operas: A few good guys surrounded by a world of evil brothers. The power of money and economic strength is clearly displayed. However, like in &quot;Dallas&quot; the characters remain relatively simple (although the author grants some of them - especially Mark, the main figure of the novel - at least a certain evolution).Another question is of course why reasonably intelligent people should want to become members of a fraternity with those pledge activities.An interesting plot - conspiracy - students - sex&amp;crime (I must have been at the wrong university) - silly rituals - a strong polarization of characters - 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I am a sucker for any novel set on a college campus, prep or boarding school. Unfortunately, I found the book to be suffering from the toos - too wordy, too long and too much going on and not enough fully explained for my liking. I think the premise was a good one but needed some good editing and then some pulling together."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book is probably one of the worst and unrealistic things I have ever read. The characters (especially Shawn) are unrealistic, as is the portrayal of a fraternity full of murderers, rapists, and thieves. Sometimes I wish someone would write the truth about what fraternal organizations do...this kind of trashy libel is getting old."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book lacked any factual representation of Greek organizations and seemed to be simply out to get a rise from people who have sons and daughters in those organizations. The plot was weak and unfounded, the portrayal of the fraternity members ridiculous and stereotypical. Perhaps Mr. Kean should do that thing called &quot;background research&quot; before he writes another novel."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I read the first chapter of this book at the bookstore one night and it was pretty catchy. I then decided to buy the book and was extremely disappointed. This kind of prose would never make it past any self-respecting college professor. How it got past an editor at a major publisher is beyond me. The writing is so childish and predictable. The author seems to have a vast knowledge of adjectives and somehow feels that no noun is complete without one. The story is filled with many subplots that take far too long to develop and only serve to annoy, not add suspense. Obviously the author never learned one of the golden rules of creative writing: more words (700+ pages for a murder mystery/thriller??) does not always equal better."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The Pledge is a fast-paced and exciting debut by Ron Kean that will most likely find wide appeal among both younger and older readers. It will definitely hold your attention from beginning to end. So why a &quot;3&quot; rating and not higher? Basically because the plot and characters, while interesting, tended to stretch my willingness to extend credibility beyond the breaking point in too many instances. While I understand this is a work of fiction and some implausability is 'allowed&quot; in order to maintain suspense, The Pledge, for me, went too far too often to rate it more than three stars. Nonetheless, The Pledge is worth reading and I'm looking forward to Kean's next book."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This being Rob Kean's debut novel, there are two elements of this book which can be forgiven which might not with a more experienced novelist. First and foremost, after about 350 pages of very well-crafted confusion keeping the reader involved hoping to unravel the mystery, a character appears and lays it all out on the table in 5 pages. Never mind that the explanation for this character being in the know is fairly weak; we just don't want to have it handed to us after the air of suspense has been built.The second problem is with the believability of the plot. Without going into spoilers, the chances that the powers-that-be in the book would go unnoticed for so long are low, especially considering the particular way that Simsbury College is portrayed: as a fine but small liberal arts school. My college was in the US News and World Report top ten every year as well, and there's no way a rise to power inolving *my* school would go unnoticed by some form of outside authority.If the preceding paragraph seemed cryptic, by all means, read the book. It kept me involved even as the aforementioned doubts crept into my mind. Rob Kean has a knack for unique prose and strong characterization. I look forward to his next book."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Great read! If you are looking for a page turner for the summer holiday this is the one. Yes, as some have mentioned the story line is a bit sensational at times, but isn't this true of most action/suspense novels? The story was gripping and certainly one we can all relate to at some level. I couldn't put this one down.Great first novel"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Like a movie of the week, this one droned on and on never really managing to break the surface of what was behind all the hatred. (Someone give Kean a hug.) This book is far too jaded for someone with so much promise (as the book jacket claims). How many times can a reader tolerate phrases such as &quot;partying like rock stars&quot; without it sounding hackneyed?"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. I read it over the Christmas holidays a few years back. This woulud make an excellent motion picture. It reminds me a lot of \\"The Skulls\\" movie that came out a few years ago. I like the issues with the college and fraternity life and like the protagonist and his mission to help clean up the dirty things that he finds. I have recommended this book on several occasions for people to read and those people have echoed my thoughts of this book. Very well written, feels almost like a James Patterson book."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Wow, I'm surprised that anyone gave this more than 2 stars. This is a candidate for the worst book I've read in my life. It starts bad and gets worse, with stupid characters and absurd plot twists.Most grating is the consistantly bad writing; Kean simply writes poor sentences, and it can be painful to read them. I mean, I don't expect Nabokov, or even Grisham, but this was just an amateur effort throughout. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised after reading Kean's thanks to his collegues at a big consulting firm for their support. Hey Kean, go back to your day job shredding documents rather than writing them!Maybe I just felt cheated because I had to lug this 720-pager home from the library and back."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Chad Ewing dreamed of being popular. He was a young man who wanted to &quot;fit in&quot; with the popular crowd, pledging the Sigma's would fulfill his dreams. The dreams are shattered when his naked, graffity covered body is found, broken and twisted beyond belief, dead.Chad's death is ruled as a suicide or an accident, but as his family and fellow students question the myserious death, it becomes clear that something sinister is going on behind the closed doors of Simsbury College.Mark Jessy, once a Sigma brother himself, and girlfriend Shawn Jakes, are part of the college committee investigating the death. As they begin pulling away the layers of a cover-up they will be pitted against a group of individuals who will stop at nothing to keep their good name, and their fortunes.Mark will question everything he has ever believed in, including an incident in his past that will somehow be connected to the recent death.&quot;The Pledge&quot; is an interesting novel. Complex plot, and fast-pace keep the pages turning.The novel would have earned 5 stars from me, except, I found it was peopled with too many characters, and it's a little too long in length.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The author shows some promise: the plot is intriguing and fairly unpredictable. But his characters are hackneyed and two-dimensional and his style is extremely immature: overblown, self-indulgent, trite prose. A strong editor could have improved this book immeasurably by cutting 50 pages and several hundred adjectives."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Several things bugged me about The Pledge. One, I thought it was terribly written, full of cliches and stereotypical characters that bogged down every page. Author Rob Kean desperately needs an editor; the book's 514 pages could have easily been sliced by a third. I was skimming through the final pages, something no novel should ever make you do. Plus, there was another thing that nagged me throughout about The Pledge - it should have been set in the 50s! Eliminate the few references to cell phones and e-mail, and Kean's bunch of mafia frat thugs would have been much more believable conducting business in any era but the '90s."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book invited me inside and made me wish the story would continue even after I had finished the last sentence, primarily because of the feeling underlying what Mr. Kean has written. Kean obviously has passion for the craft of writing. It's apparent in every paragraph that he loves words and goes nuts when he has a good story to tell. The plot is interesting, though in places it is needlessly obfuscated. The main character, Mark Jessy, is beautifully drawn, fully realized, and totally believable. On the other hand, the females in the book are less believable, tending more to sound like juvenile fantasy figures than real women, but that's forgiven because the book works."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I was most impressed reading Rob Kean's book, &quot;The Pledge.&quot; The storyline flowed remarkably well, and I found myself unable to put the book down. In fact, it took me two sittings to finish, the second one of which ended at 5:15am one Saturday night/Sunday morning. The characters are well developed, and I found myself laughing (yes, out loud) at their mishaps, cheering their triumphs, and scowling at their foolishness. I highly recommend this book to those in college (for its relevance) as well as for suspense lovers of all ages who enjoy a good read."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"At Simsbury College at Sigma Delta Phi, the most exclusive frathouse on campus, pledge Chad Ewing is found dead, with vicious, sickpoetry scrawled on his body. While the powers that be try to pass off his death as a suicide, Mark Jessy a former Sigma brother and his beautiful girlfriend Shawn Jakes begin an investigation into Chad's death, and uncover scandal, extortion and corruption that dates back to the fraternity's inception two hundred years before. Kean writes well and has delivered an exciting page turner, and in Mark Jessy, has given us a reluctant, yet honorbale hero. This is the perfect summer thriller."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Having never been a fan of sororities or fraternities, I found this a very compelling book. The author did a great job taking the meaning of &quot;brotherhood&quot; one step further. With all that is written today about college hazing, this certainly brings home the impact these organizations can have on young minds. It's a book you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The Pledge is a novel that speaks to current day events on college campuses. While it is fiction, it rings of more truth than the casual reader would imagine. There is nothing really unbelievable about this other than that in real life the ruthlessness would be far greater and more clandestine. The book reads like a fast-paced Grisham novel and smacks of understanding and intellectualism approaching Donna Tarrt's Secret Society. With hazing again on the rise and more and more injuries and deaths attributed to it, this book appears in a time when students, parents and university administrators need to take a careful look at what is really happening. This book speaks volumes of truths for those who will listen. For those who simply ignore this book as a work of fiction are extremely naive to the machinations of some Greek organizations, Alumni influence, and university indifference and greed. This book is a must reading for the college freshman interested in a Greek organization. Anyone who is familiar with Greekdom and academia will secretly confess that this book could really be more truth than fiction."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Rob Kean is a master of suspense. Even the most minute details will keep you spellbound as the author does not divulge anything without having you read more.This was one of the best books I've read in awhile. I even took the book to school, gave my kids an assignment, and continued to read.I'm not usually enamored with books about collegiate shenanigans, being long past that age myself, but this book kept me riveted. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading about mystery, abuse of power, and a fast paced - can't put it down story line."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Rob Kean did an excellent job on his debut. Once I started reading The Pledge I couldn't put it down. He keeps you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this book to anyone. I look forward to reading more from Rob Kean in the future."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"As a whole, I thought the book was very, very intriging. However at some points of the story it got somewhat confusing, without giving too much of the plot away, regarding certain members of the Sigmas, and what was their motivations for certain things. My favorite, however, is Mark Jessy and I thought he handled the investigation perfectly. The ending was rather good, and justice was served."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Good book, but not great. I would have preferred alot less description and more story. If you want to revisit your college years, might help some."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Seldom do I not finish a book, even a bad one, but this novel was more than I could take after 100 pages. The author, a genuinely nice guy I heard in an interview, fancies himself a writer, but I found little in the story beyond stereotypes and cliches. I am astonished that the book was not edited more tightly. I am even more astonished that Kean received a $1 million contract for this book, a second, and movie rights. All the best to him, for in matters of taste, we are all experts. What a country!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I couldn't put this book down! It kept me so intrigued until the very end. Rob is as charming in person, as his writing is chilling and believable. Who doesn't like a book that brings you back to college days? Keep writing!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"So nice to get away from the legal mysteries and medical thrillers. May be a little far-fetched but couldn't be more exciting and fun to read.Never knew what was coming next. Loved the writing style and the author's clever way of describing things. Particularly, rumors."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I loved this book and literally could not put it down. In fact, I woke early one Saturday [5:00 a.m.] and didn't get out of bed till I'd turned the last page at noon. Shawn Jakes is no more of a fantasy than James Bond, and I'm looking for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Couldn't put it down!! A book you pick up as soon as the kids are on the school bus. A great book for anyone who simply reads for pleasure but as a mother of 3 sons rapidly approching college age I was a bit frightened after reading this book. I guess that means that I think things like this could actually happen on a campus. Thanks Rob for your insight!!!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I was hooked from the first page. Kean has an ear for dialogue and a gift for suspense. I kept thinking I would stop reading at &quot;end of this chapter,&quot; but then something would happen and I would have to read on. Is he working on a sequel?"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I loved this book- great characters, great action, great read"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I thought the book was great... people who are criticizing its stereotypical characters are ignoring the very intriguing and original story line. The characters are type-cast, but they are also well-developed and interesting. I was hooked from the first couple of pages, and I couldn't put the book down! The story was involved and exciting, and I highly reccomend it for a thrilling read."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Who says great writing has to be realistic? Yeah this storyline is far-fetched, but at the same time, it could happen. Anyway, I found it hard to put this book down and couldn't wait to get back to it when I did. Mark Jessy became my hero from the start and I was hooked 'til the end. This is a very entertaining novel and I'd love to see the movie!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I devoured my fingernails, laughed out loud, and even had to dab a tear or two! Rob Kean's ability to evoke so many emotions may be unprecendented among first-time authors. Sure to inspire some unhappiness among short-sighted &quot;brothers,&quot; it really shouldn't offend fraternity boys any more than the work of Thomas Harris angers doctors or caucasians. And this former Greek finds it every bit as compelling as Harris' &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The characters are funny; dialogue whips along; horrific feminists turn out useful; memorable personification of Rumor; a little too many surprises at the end; probably a realistic view of the college drinking and hazing. I hope not."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book is quite possibly the best novel I have read this year and I read a lot. Rob Kean should be praised for his debut work. This novel has many pages, which some consider a fault, but it reads so fast. The story begins with the mysterious death of a Pledge, hence the title, at a rich, powerful and shady Frat house. This fraternity will do anything in it's power to conceal the truth, and they do have the resources at their fingertips! This is a story of money, power, greed, love, and the author combines them so well. The characters are deep and you will feel for them. You get to know them and how they think. Mark Jessy is the Super hero, a mysterious, yet intelligent young man with a complicated past. Shawn Jakes is the beautiful, extremely intelligent, motivated star. There are so many well developed characters. The Dean is a interesting person, to say the least. The frat brothers are muscular, brainy, good looking and Dangerous. My favorite, of course, is the former Marine who will crush anyone who crosses his path. The freshman Pledges are so perfectly portrayed. This book will make you cry, be happy, smile and imagine the possibility of this really happening. You won't be able to put it down. I can't wait to read his next book, which I hope is on the horizon. The movie, which he was reportedly advanced $1,000,000 for the rights, should be spectacular. Critics have also stated that the events in this book are farfetched, they must have not noticed the words FICTION in the cover. Enjoy this book, I did."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Rob: I was surprised and delighted that I didn't have to close the covers of your book because I didn't have the stomach for more gore, sex, and jerky transition-less prose. You are a fine writer. You write with depth, ease, and coherence! Even one of my favorites, Grishom has come undone with the new pattern of jerky switching in time and place and thought. (Or else he has been ghost written).I am early in the book and delightfully pleased.Work on Number 2!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Ok----I read several of the reviews and decided to purchase this novel with high anticipation. Now being a type of person who LOVES reading but has a hard time finding ample time to do so, I MADE time to read this book. Fantastic characters, plot and suspense. Everything was vivid; I felt like I was right there. However, the ending really disappointed me. All sequence of events were very descriptive and pulled me into them. The ending did nothing but summarize what happened. This novel is a major page turner and I promise you'll read it fast...you may want to throw it against the wall when you get to the ending.....very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Maybe it was because I am currently a pledge for a fraternity. Maybe it was because I have a love for nature, boats, and costal villages, as do the two main characters. Maybe it was because I hadn't read a novel for pleasure in 10 years. I can't quite put my finger on what endeared me to Rob Kean's first ever novel, The Pledge, but I really liked it.I had heard about the novel while my pledge brothers and I were cleaning up the dining room at our fraternity house one evening after the actives had finished dinner. Two of the actives had hung around after dinner and were talking about some book called the Pledge and that it was one of the best books that they'd ever read. I got on-line, read some reviews and without much hesitation clicked on the &quot;Confirm Order&quot; icon.The Pledge delves into a fictious fraternity, Delta Sigma Phi, at a fictious New England, Ivy League school, Simsbury College. It chronicles the events that occur following the death of a pledge at Simsbury's most prestigous, most revered fraternity, known to all simply as &quot;Sigma.&quot; The main character, a former brother himself, is torn between loyalty to his &quot;brothers&quot; and his obligations as a member of Simsbury's &quot;D-Squad,&quot; which is charged with investigating the death of Sigma pledge Chad Ewing.As I became more and more engrossed in the story it became increasingly more difficult to put this book down; to the extent that I actually skipped a class because I didn't want to stop reading. I finished the final 500 pages in 5 straight hours.I would recommend this novel to anyone interested in college life, anyone interested in fraternity life, and anyone who believes that just because a man graduates from college and becomes a successful businessman he is honest, just, ethical, and possesses a clear sense of what is right from what is wrong.If you've read this review, you WILL LOVE this book."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Set in Maine at an exclusive private college, The Pledge is a worthwhile first effort by Rob Kean.The Pledge, not surprisingly, is set in a long established and incredibly wealthy fraternity. Alumni support and ongoing involvement is a way of life.While fraternity pledging seems to have been tamed down in recent years by most colleges, the Brothers have apparently not heard. The process of belonging seems to be a traumatic series of events aimed at degrading, humiliating and absolutely breaking down the new candidates. There is an uncomfortable air of torture in the actions of the Brotherhood toward their aspirants.The reader becomes quickly engaged in the bizarre life of this fraternity in the death of freshman pledge, Chad Ewing. Cover-up becomes the order of the day when Ewing loses his life after a night of horrifying pledge activity. The college administration responds quickly to limit it's responsibility and any fair investigation of what took place the night Ewing died. College leadership seems primarily invested in the second in charge, Dean Templeton, an unsavory human being if there ever was one. Everything he touches is dishonest and seemingly rigged.The fraternity shows its true colors in the diabolical actions that its members take to absolve themselves of any responsibility for Ewing's death.There is saving grace to the horrors of the actions at the college found in two students, Shawn Jakes and Mark Jessy who are charged with leading the Student Review Board, which has responsibility for reviewing the death.While the fraternity brothers and the Dean are not at all worried about the Student Review, complication after complication occurs as the investigation proceeds.Ultimately and at great odds, justice is finally served as the story winds down. We are rocked from the depths of evil to the refreshing integrity of two college students whose lives are literally at great risk.Readers and reviewers have had mixed reactions to The Pledge. While I might agree that it could have been pared down by probably more than a hundred pages, the story is indeed gripping for those willing to stick with the story.As a reader, Kean tapped into an enormous range of emotions that don't usually surface in most things I read.I believe those who enjoy a good mystery and undaunted by a long one will enjoy The Pledge. Some bumps and wrong turns here and there. However, Kean does a fine job in his first work. He will undoubtedly develop as an important writer. A following is definitely in Rob Kean's future if he continues to work as hard as he has in crafting The Pledge!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The book was written to read fast - I read the whole thing in one sit (I missed some classes too, oops) The story line is well thought out and flows evenly, but I find that the descriptions of the charecters and scenes a little too perfect for reality, aside from the coruption. However, it is well made up for with the many plot twists that grip the reader to continue reading."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This was a very well written book (I was surpised to learn it's his first novel). I look forward to reading his future works."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Wait for the mass market paperback.Though I read this in one sitting it was more to study what not to do when writing, and for the record this is one of the rare times I agree with Kirkus' scathing review. A terrible freshman effort starts this two book deal with Warner; lets hope the second novel is actually edited."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book was a great mystery. I picked it up and didn't put it down until it was done. Kids need to know that sometimes these things happen. Parents also need to know that this is a fictious book. Although the hazing and partying is true, the awful things that were done are not."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This phenomenal first novel by Rob Kean kept me from my work for two days straight. Everytime I stopped reading I was left wondering what would happen next...and immediately pick it back up. Expect the unexpected as the pages turn rapidly and leave you wondering how long do I have to wait for Rob Kean's next nove"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Being an alumnus of a fraternity(and one with Sigma as one of the letters), one would think I would be outraged at the treatment Greek life gets in The Pledge. However, being a Greek alumnus who also enjoys a well-written, break-neck paced thriller, I loved this book. I think maybe because I know my fraternity was nothing like the Sigmas in this book, or maybe I can separate fiction from reality, either way this book is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it for anyone searching for a good page-turning thriller that is not set in the usual places, with the usual characters. Some were written very stereotypically, yes, but overall, everything worked for me. And for those parents reading this...most fraternities are not like this."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This novel is riveting, taking the reader through a byzantine maze of danger and intrigue juxtaposed against moral imperative and a young man's torturous conflict of having to choose between the only brothers he's ever known... and the realization that he, alone, holds the key to breaking the multi-generational chain of cover-ups and murder by one of the most powerful fraternal organizatioins in history. And a love story to boot! No wonder they're making a movie out of it!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Rob Keane has captured the suspense, intrigue, and politics in a way suggestive of Alan Greshham. He however, applies his unique spin to the settings and plot to keep you hooked!As a parent paying &quot;ransom&quot; in the form of tuition to 2 major universities, Rob adds to my suspiscions that administrators are not there for the interest of the student."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book quickly accomplishes what a thriller should - as soon as I began reading it I was dying to find out what was next. As a former small college athlete myself, I felt the characters were extremely well developed extensions (although at times exagerated - but isn't that the point) of many of my classmates. The complexity of the plot and the techniques Mr. Kean used to slowly reveal it left me almost disappointed when I turned the last page. I am anxiously awaiting his next effort."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who wants an inside look at the Greek system of fraternities in America's elite colleges. It's like the dark side of Animal House, where instead of a bunch of goof offs, serious students and goal-oriented people lose their sense of humanity and perspective when drawn into the web of power and greed of fraternities."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"In The Pledge, a first time thriller by Rob Kean, I really enjoyed it. I could see some spots that should have been pruned vigorously (Shawn is not exactly a realistic woman, she is somebody's(probably most men's) fantasy. Mark Jessy the hero is interestingly flawed, the scenes with the parents of the murdered pledge are poignant in the extreme, the rhyming gets a wee bit tiresome, and in short, Animal House meets the Firm. I could almost see Neidermeier spitting out &quot;pledge pin!&quot;, although Jessy was entirely too appealing to be Bluto. Ah well, I'm dating myself. Two thumbs up, a good read."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"If your looking for an entertaining read,pick up this book. Make sure you keep inmind the definition of fiction and you won't have a problem. The time frame setup of the book was a new approach to me and enjoyable.Great start for a first book,worth the price."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't have predicted it if I tried. It is well written, and well thought out. I can hardly wait until the next one is on the shelves. Mr. Kean is obviously an insightful and talented writer."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"The collegiate greek system setting promises intrigue, but what a disappointment: movie-of-the-week level plotting, female characters a notch above caricature, cliche after painful cliche. Waste of cash and time."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"As the mother of a college freshman, I was horrified to read The Pledge. Although this gifted novelist fictionalizes life inside the Greek system, I'm afraid some of the hazing and partying is right on the nose. The Pledge is a fast read, the writing superb. I was surprised to enjoy it so much and look forward to Kean's next book."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"You gotta love picking up a novel by a first time author and not being able to put it down. I was totally absorbed from the first chapter to the last. Rob Kean packs a punch and plenty of surprizes, along with some truely interesting main characters that you love to hate. I have heard of &quot;hazing&quot; that goes on at some universities, and read some pretty ghastly stuff surrounding some deaths due to hazing and perhaps the highly disturbing motives behind these deaths, reading this work of fine work of fiction was an eye-opener!! Kudo's to Mr Kean - looking forward to your next novel!!"},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Too bad that Mr. Keane doesn't understand what fraternities or humans are actually like. In an effort to write a drama, he fails to write realism--the characters were as shallow as those found on 50s sit-coms, and the ruthlessness portrayed in the Sigmas was previously reserved for Lex Luthor. A cheap attempt at cashing in at the unfortunate dark side of the Greek system, the book ignores all the good that fraternities and sororities do."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"Coming from a small liberal arts college in New England myself, The Pledge vividly portrays life within the cliques of these small schools. From the &quot;jock fraternity&quot;, to the &quot;women lib leaders&quot;, the story rings true to life at a small school. The twists and turns always leave you guessing the ending. Overall, a fine effort by Mr. Kean."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"This is hands-down one of the best, most thrilling, most tangible works of fiction I have ever read. Mr. Kean captures the essence of fraternity life so completely, it's as if he lived, ate, and slept at the &quot;Large white house on the corner of College and Maine&quot;. His acute descriptions of the Maine winter scenes rival Jack London's recounts of the Alaskan Wilderness. Meanwhile, the depth and richness of his characters would make Tom Wolfe proud. This is a must read! Throbba Kid has scored on a corner-high blast from outside the box."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I picked up &quot;The Pledge&quot; because I had heard it compared to one of my favorite books, &quot;Secret History&quot;. I was disappointed to find that it was nowhere near as good, although it was a nice try. As a college student, I found that the characters were, for the most part, unrealistic, especially Shawn Jakes- the author seems incapable of describing realistic female characters. I thought the book would've been better with less predictable plot. Also, the rhyming WAS tiresome. Still, it was interesting...I wasn't happy with the ending tho. I had the feeling it was trying too hard to be deep and missed."},{"Title":"The Pledge","review":"I read the advance copy of this book so it might be different than the published version, but I really enjoyed it. It is well thought out, and it makes you think in order to follow the story, you can't just read the first hundred pages and figure out the whole story from that. This was not the very best book I've ever read, but it is a very good book."},{"Title":"Live Sound Reinforcement, Bestseller Edition (Hardcover & DVD) (Cengage Educational)","review":"I bought this book hoping that it would help me in learning how to use a board (mixer), an equalizer, a compressor, but all I got was a catalogue of equipment. Maybe it tells you one or two things that are helpful but it isn't really worth the money I paid. I would gladly pay double of what I paid but if it were a book with helpful information. As an example, it doesn\`t tell you how to set gain for microphones, it only tells you which knob is used for that matter, but it doesn't explain what the \\"ideal\\" setting would be (a reading in the LED meter of your mixer). It tells you that compressors are used in sound reinforcement but it doesn't explain how to set the different controls so you can achieve whatever it is that you need. As I said before, it is a somewhat good catalogue where you will learn about the existence of a lot of pro audio equipment but that's all, you won't get anything that will help you mix better or make a band sound better. You will be better off by searching for free info on the net, maybe by checking videos on YOU TUBE where someone explains what you are looking for, and it will cost you only a little time. Maybe the DVD is a little interesting but it won't help you much either. I hope you find this information helpful."},{"Title":"Live Sound Reinforcement, Bestseller Edition (Hardcover & DVD) (Cengage Educational)","review":"Covers all basics. Great book and DVD.

Good value."},{"Title":"Live Sound Reinforcement, Bestseller Edition (Hardcover & DVD) (Cengage Educational)","review":"I've been looking for this book for years and I finally got it from Amazon just 2 days back. I am dissapointed on delivery as it was damaged on transit, the hardcover and the pages on the top are crumpled. I immediately repaired the damaged portion and now I am happy reading it. The contents and the illustrations are not as I have expected to be in this book. The diagrams and illustrations are rather too plain and simple. There are no colour photographs either. On the other side, the attached DVD is much better and have more depth to the subject. But I know comparing a book and a DVD is not fair. The book is fairly written well and the texts are rich. More photographs, be it B&W or colour and precisely drawn illustrations and diagrams would have made this book No 1. Overall : A must have book for any amateur or \\"on the road\\" sound engineer or any PA System rental company. A good buy after all."},{"Title":"Live Sound Reinforcement, Bestseller Edition (Hardcover & DVD) (Cengage Educational)","review":"This book is complete, but the illustrations are rather hokey. Some of the sections get bogged down in unnecessary detail, and other leave stuff out. This is obviously something that was written a while ago, and partially updated without going through the trouble of making the illustrations better.At the same time I bought this book, I also bought The Live Sound Manual: Getting Great Sound at Every Gig but Ben Duncan, #0879306998. This was a much more readable book, although lacking in illustrations, and geared slightly more to the professional. The only thing in Live Sound Reinforcement that wasn't in The Live Sound manual that I found useful was the one page on 'ringing out the room' to address feedback before it happens.Both books gave good step-by-step instructions for setup and good explanations of theory, but the latter just did a better job."},{"Title":"Live Sound Reinforcement, Bestseller Edition (Hardcover & DVD) (Cengage Educational)","review":"This book was well thought out and is explained in very clear terms. This book gives an overview of all of the equipment involved in a sound system, everything from a mic cord to a compressor to a cross over.

It covers all the topics one should be familiar with, speakers, amps, frequencies, microphones etc. and what they do. The discussion of practical techniques was rather slim, although a book to cover even a decent quantity of scenarios would be huge and expensive, and people may not want to part with knowledge for which they receive fat paychecks! As a musician and amateur soundperson for the school where I work, I was familiar with most of what was written and only found a few new ideas for doing sound reinforcement. A great book for anyone getting started."},{"Title":"Live Sound Reinforcement, Bestseller Edition (Hardcover & DVD) (Cengage Educational)","review":"I received a copy of this book when I was preparing the curriculum for a college course I taught as an adjunct professor for two years. I believe it gave my students not only a good classroom study book, but also a useful reference book for the \\"real-world\\" after graduation! Scott Stark gives great rule-of-thumb knowledge, as well as deeper technical fundamentals behind the knob turning and fader moving decisions that every sound engineer will face at the helm of a live sound reinforcement system, no matter whether for 100 or 100,000 listeners!"},{"Title":"Live Sound Reinforcement, Bestseller Edition (Hardcover & DVD) (Cengage Educational)","review":"I've used this book myself and have been referred to it by the best sound guys around.

I have read other books (such as Yamaha'sThe Sound Reinforcement Handbook) which detail the science of sound and sound equipment, but was looking for something more \\"hands-on.\\" Live Sound Reinforcement came close but, I felt, stopped short of giving me the real-world examples and ideas I wanted.This is not to say that the book is not utterly complete and extremely well-laid out. I was quite impressed with the methodical approach to understanding sound reinforcement; it was the best I have read so far. I felt no guilt skipping over the sections I already knew and enjoyed reading the chapters I was less familiar with.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for more foundation in sound reinforcement, or even to someone curious about sound waves. I was pleased that there wasn't tons of out-of-date equipment discussed, but rather concepts of what certain types of equipment do to your signal. The diagrams were appropriate though not as modern as some. Te writing style was like listening to a professor who was passionate about his field, not just filling in the blanks.

Stark starts off with the basics of sound, then covers microphones, smaller scale PA systems, then concert touring systems. His language is easy to understand, and his book provides information on all aspects of live sound, from miking to processing. The use of diagrams are very helpful, and he breaks the book into sections which make it easy to use as a reference guide. However, this book is not for the professional, or someone who is very knowledgable about sound or sound reinforcement. I would recomend this to a beginner or an intermediate level sound person who wants to learn more about how to reinforce sound. In short, if you have taken courses on sound, or are very knowledgable this book isnt for you, but if you want know how to wire a full concert PA system will all the works, this book is for you...

It covers every aspect of sound, from physics to mixers and outboard gear. Shame it's not suitable for touring, because it's a bit heavy and big.Each topic is deeply explained with easy-to-understand texts and many draws and pictures. I found these draws to be the best part of this book, they really complement the texts and help the reader spell out the ideas. The DVD is not as high level as the book itself. It covers topics that are better understood with movies, like mikes placement and FOH positioning. It's 3 hour long, so it covers many topics.

This is no ordinary story: It took over 60 years to build the Shrine, which is dedicated to the glory of the Virgin Mary. It is a tale of charismatic churchmen and of ordinary men and women; of near defeat, years when Shrine stood neglected and unfinished; and, finally, of splendid triumph upon its completion. As Tucker makes clear, the Shrine really is &quot;America's Church&quot; -- it exists because of the ordinary Catholic men, women and children who contributed to it over the years. In telling their story, Tucker furnishes us with more than a story about a building but with a history of Roman Catholicism in America. . The book is beautifully designed, with photographs -- which made me realize that the shrine is as majestic as the most beautiful of Europe's cathedrals. You don't have to be a Catholic to enjoy America's Church."},{"Title":"America's Church: The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception","review":"What a great informative book!

I liked this book a lot. The Tale of Matsura is an ancient Japanese literature, written by an anonymous intellect of that time. This tale per se is such an amusing story, but in many other ways (what ways? Read and find them out yourself. I leave the fun part for you!), this literature will invite you to a voyage in medieval Japan. Lammres constructs this book with two parts. Read the second part, the main body of the tale, first if you are not familiar with the tale. Lammer's translation of the tale is one of the best jobs done on Japanese literatures. Then, move onto the first part, Lammer's analysis. His analysis is very insightful and thorough. Therefore, it might appear to be daunting, but don't be afraid. It won't bite you. In the end, you would realize it has been worth reading.

What is striking about this book is, first of all, that Petrin advocates restructuring the economy slowly, not with shock therapy that has been so prevalent (and unsuccessful) in other parts of Eastern Europe. Petrin shows evidence that this approach has paid off for Slovenia, which is now on the inside track to European Union membership. The second unique aspect of Petrin's book is that she deals with specific parts of restructuring, such as privatization in Slovenian industry, and she prescribes specific policy solutions for making transition successful within the existing economic framework."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"As a CPA I marvel at two things: First, the amount of wealth that is being transferred from the Greatest Generation to their children, the Baby Boomers, and how much of that wealth will be added to and passed on to the Boomer's children. Second, how many estates are badly planned (or not at all) under the impression that \\"we're not rich, so we don't need to do anything\\". (Guess what: if your estate consists of a modest house and/or an IRA, the systems of probate and estate taxes may consider you very rich!).The Baby Boomers may be the first generation to need to understand estate planning in order first to guide their parents' estate planning, and then to plan their own. In both instances, they will need a good attorney, and they will need to know how to talk to her/him.The author walks the reader through a complex body of knowledge, and makes the techniques, process and pitfalls of estate planning understandable. Rather than placing yourself completely at the mercy of an attorney (even a good one), or facing the peril of trying being your own lawyer, the book gives information to help you make the most of an attorney's services to achieve your goals."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"I am a CPA, a CLU and a consultant in the small business retirement plan field.

I read a number of estate planning books, but Cornwall's was far and away the most helpful. Written in simple layman's language, Everything a Baby Boomer Should Know demystifies the legal process. The book is also refreshing because the author discusses real-life topics. You think you have complex family issues? Consider what Bonanza's Ben Cartwright would face in today's legal environment. These are the types of clever examples Cornwall laces through the chapters. I can't afford the kind of legal muscle Gates and Buffet have, but I can certainly follow their example by knowing all my options and taking charge of my legacy. This book is definitely one of the most informative and easiest to read books on this topic."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"An excellent resource for estate planning. Concise and straight to the point with easy to read language, charts and graphs. The questionnaire at the end of the book is a must-do before seeing an attorney. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"As the title of the book says \\"before talking to an attorney\\", it isn't a book that descibes how to create your own will or trust. The examples are mostly multimillion dollar estates in California, not the norm but points out the need to see an attorney if you have an estate of that size. It also points out the need to plan your estate even if it is a smaller estate. I think a focus on smaller estates would be better as I would hope anyone with that kind of money has already been in contact with an attorney. Perhaps the author has found this not to be true. But it is good information for all to read even if you'll never get to have a million dollar estate. For the smaller estate and a do-it-your self approach, also get Quickens Willmaker (the book, which is over 500 pages) which comes with software to create your own wills and trusts. It explains a lot if you don't mind several hours of reading. It is also less expensive than buying just the Willmaker software alone. And if you really love this stuff, the book Plan Your Estate by Denis Clifford is great. But if you want to read just one book before you head to the attorney, Everything A Baby Boomer Should Know is great and will be time and money well spent."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"Everything a Baby Boomer Should Know, simply put, is an extremely well thought out estate planning guide. I found Mark Cornwall's book to be extremely intuitive, shedding light on estate planning in a fun easy to understand format. From the very first moment I picked up the book and flipped through a few pages landing on one of the many lively flow charts things started to make sense.This book is a MUST READ and will save you $1000s just for knowing what questions to ask an estate attorney."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"Even though I am a bit young to be called a baby boomer I was interested to see what this book had to say. Needless to say, I am bummed that I had just paid an attorney to tell me the same thing that I read in Mr. Cornwall's book. Believe me, it was far more than $25.17. The attorney didn't send me away with flow charts and all the information that this book had to offer as well.Do yourself a favor and spend the money on this book before you go and waste your money on an attorney, NO MATTER WHAT AGE YOU ARE!!!"},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"If you're at all like me, the last thing that you want to set aside time for is planning your estate. Its a chore that we all want to put off. Why feel guilty that we're going to leave our family a mess of an estate to settle when we're gone? Just buy this very easy to read, eminently understandable guide to estate planning, and put this important task behind you. Estate planning can be overwhelming. This book gives a great overview and is superb preparation for your meeting with an estate planning attorney. The first thing I did when I finished this book was to call a lawyer and finally do the right thing for me and my family."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"\\"Everything a Baby Boomer Should Know\\" has provided answers to our many questions regarding estate planning. My wife and I wanted to provide for our only daughter, however, we do not have millions. \\"Everything a Baby Boomer Should Know\\" helped us eliminate the legal wills and trusts that did not apply to our financial needs, and thus saved us money that we would have spent in attorneys' fees. This book gave us the tools to communicate to an estate planning attorney exactly what we thought we needed, which was then confirmed by the attorney. \\"Everything a Baby Boomer Should Know\\" really helped map out a plan and the graphs made it easier to see what direction we wanted to go.We would highly recommend this book to anyone doing estate planning."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"This book was supposed to introduce a novice to estate planning. It did and was fairly easy to read, but the examples and the author's bias actually got in the way.

It does a decent job of explaining things in plain english, but the organization is poor, and the author seems to think everyone who needs to do estate planning must live in California. He doesn't even qualify CA-specific legal statements with \\"This is the law in CA\\" (let alone offer a state-by-state chart), he just presents them as if CA state law would be the only body of law that could possibly govern estates."},{"Title":"EVERYTHING A BABY BOOMER SHOULD KNOW - An Insider's Guide To Estate Planning","review":"This book did not give me what I was looking for. I wanted to know about issues like how you should hold asset---Tennants in Common, etc. versus the other possibilities and how the this owership designation will affect the transfer of assets at your death. The book's title says it includes \\"Everything\\" a baby boomer should know---it didn't and now I have to purchase another book to get that information."},{"Title":"Politics and Government in the Visegrad Countries","review":"I bought this book while researching Czech and Slovak politics, and got quite a bit less than I was expecting from it. Perhaps the title misled me: I was expecting an overview of politics in the region, but what I got instead was a handbook that, to a large extent, summarised the constitutions of the four countries.What I found disappointing was the author's sometimes uncritical quotations from constitutions and party programmes. Rather than repeating what is supposed to be, he could have done a better job of informing the reader about what is by bringing in observations and opinions from other political scientists.In certain areas, Fitzmaurice's urge to summarise leaves the book thin on the ground. For example, the author uses a single paragraph to describe &quot;constitution building&quot; in Slovakia.The book also shows signs of a poor editing job. The author is quite patchy in his use of diacritics in Central European names; he uses them in some names, while ommitting them in others. He also manages to misspell the names of two leading Slovak politicians. Further, the book is not free of factual errors: Fitzmaurice writes about Poland's Marshal Pilsudski fighting &quot;against the Soviet Union in 1920&quot;, when more careful research would have shown him that the USSR was, in fact, not founded until 1922, after Communist Russia's war with Poland was over. Such errors and ommissions reflect badly on the author's knowledge of the region.Finally, given the title of the book, I expected more attention to be placed on regional issues and on relations between the four countries. While the author does maintain a comparative framework throughout the book, he devotes a handful of pages explicitly to relations between the four countries.Thus, in short, while the book does provide useful background information on the four countries' politics, the reader would be well advised to look elsewhere for more in-depth information and analysis."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Writers are prone to eavesdropping. It's one of the ways we come up with our characters and plots.Agatha Christie allegedly was inspired to write this book after eavesdropping on a conversation in a caf&eacute;. The name of a woman being discussed sparked creation of a character central to the novel, the second she wrote and the first to feature Tommy and Tuppence.Though I was successful in unmasking the illusive Mr. Brown before the conclusion, Christie did manage to deceive me a few times on other elements and suspects. The characters are a bit light, the plot more quirky than realistic and the use of contemporary slang definitely dates the narrative. Still it's a quick and entertaining read and there are worse diversions."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I've loved Poirot, but not Miss Marple.I never tried a Tuppence and Tommy story, but free for the Kindle? Sign me up!Well, the short answer is that it was better than I expected.Like some others, I missed the plot twist, so I appreciated that. I found Tommy and Tuppence more likable and interesting. They explain the post-war troubles pretty well.I don't think the Bolshevik threat plays too well anymore, but I'm sure it was quite timely back then and worked better.If you like mysteries, give it a shot. Hopefully, we get more free Christie over the next few years."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"\\"The Secret Adversary\\" is the very first adventure of Tommy and Tuppence, Agatha Christie's pair of amateur sleuths, and what an adventure they have. Tommy Beresford and Prudence 'Tuppence' Cowley manage to solve a threatening international crisis, by luck and intuition it would seem, rather than more ordinary methods of detection. As an introduction to the pair, who would have further adventures after their marriage, \\"The Secret Adversary\\" is fast-paced and intriguing.Having met each other once again by chance, Tommy and Tuppence, old childhood friends, decide to advertise themselves as \\"Young Adventurers\\" who will take any charge that's well paid, no matter the danger. But before they can even post their ad, they are drawn into a mysterious web of intrigue regarding a missing draft of a peace treaty and a young girl named Jane Finn. By what seems like sheer coincidence and luck, Tommy and Tuppence, together or apart, are able to come across clues as to where Jane Finn may be, and what knowledge she has about the missing treaty. As they uncover clues, they also uncover danger that threatens their lives and friends who may just turn out to be the very adversary they are searching for.As usual with an Agatha Christie mystery, just when you think you've figured out the final twist, she throws even more at you. \\"The Secret Adversary\\" is a smart, well-plotted thriller, a testament to Christie's brillance, as this was only her second published novel. While the book may seem dated in language and certain expressions, it is only at a surface level due to the very real nature of the modern intrigue that moves the plot."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I love Agatha Christie and I was so glad to find this series. This was the book I chose to see if I could get past reading a \\"real\\" book and convert to a e-reader. I found myself so caught up in the story I didn't even realize I wasn't turning pages but tapping a screen. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good fun mystery."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I love a good mystery and of course Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery! While I'd classify this book as light reading, it's certainly not frivolous. The story is well-crafted, with several twists and turns that will keep you guessing from beginning to end. You'll fall in love with the characters Tommy and Tuppence and you won't want to leave the exciting world that THE SECRET ADVERSARY creates around them."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This novel made an interesting addition to the books of Agatha Christie. Using neither Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, this book ventures off into the spy world after World War I. The book is reasonably fast paced and has an interesting story to it. However, my problem with the book is that supposedly, all the Labour party leaders are secretly Soviet. I must say that detracts from the plausiblity of the story, and therefore also it detracts from the excitement of the book. Other than this major glitch, it has interesting characters, a dubious and diabolical foe, and a surprising twist at the end, good for any mystery. It is also free, which is obviously a major plus."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"The Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie is our introduction to Tommy and Tuppence. After not seeing each other for several years, they run into each other and since both are almost broke, they decide to form a company called The Young Adventurers, Ltd. Quite by accident, they stumble upon a situation involving the government. Hired to work the case, they are joined by a rich American, looking for his cousin who is involved in the case Tommy and Tuppence are working on. Their goal, to save the government from ruin and track down the elusive Mr. Brown. Christie keeps you guessing to the very end as to who the mysterious Mr. Brown is, and I will admit, I pegged the wrong character."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I found this little novel to be a real page-turner and a heck of a fun Kindle read (especially for a freebie--at least as of this review). Tommy and Tuppence are a fun pair and the story virtually never drags. I am a fan of Christie's Poirot and like the genre, but found this book to be a refreshing change of pace and tone. Go ahead and download it--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Agatha Christie's THE SECRET ADVERSARY is her first full blown attempt at the 'thriller' novel, which was an extremely popular format in the year it was published (1922). In those days, writers like Sapper and Edgar Wallace were creating best-sellers for an ever-appreciating public. Therefore, it is not surprising that Christie would try her hand at the format as well. The results of this book are slightly mixed, but only if you take it too seriously. For after all, Christie was a brilliant woman and knew EXACTLY what she was doing. What THE SECRET ADVERSARY is is a parody of the thrillers that were currently so popular. Does this mean that we should not take it seriously? No. But it may help you enjoy the book more to realize that some of the elements of the book were added to tweak those other elements that were taken so very seriously in other thrillers.For example, how many coincidences can this book have? All Tommy and Tuppence (the extremely engaging heroes of the story) have to do is mention a name and they are immediately plunged in the enemy's lair. Even Tuppence cannot refrain from mentioning how 'amazing&quot; it all is! Definitely this is Christie with tongue-in-cheek. Additionally, it is amazing that the villians (who are playing a very serious game indeed) do not dispatch with our heroes the moment they are detected. Again, this is done with a slight jab to other thrillers where the heroes are typcially caught by the bad guys once or twice and they NEVER, EVER kill the heroes off. They always give them multiple chances to escape. Christie knew how silly this all could be, but included anyway to play the game that she so obviously enjoyed.You might think, by all I have said, that this is not a book for you. You also might wonder why I am giving it five stars. First of all, it is Christie after all, and her style is breezy and extremely readable. Also, Tommy and Tuppence are delightful characters and their banter is worth the rest of the book. Plus, there are some very effective moments in the book, which only a master like Christie could manage. The discovery of the poisoned body is very well written and actually created a chill that shot down my spine. Yes, it is not Christie's greatest work by a long shot, and yes, there are some incredible implausibilities in the story. But I believe that they were there for a purpose. Besides, if all you are looking for is a diverting couple of hours, you could do a lot worse than this book. It's a lark, and that is exactly what Christie intended it to be from the first."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I was surprised to find this novel so boring. Tedious.

They work to stop a Bolshevik plot that could bring down the British government.Thoughts: I wasn't sure what to expect (okay I had the thought that I'd be getting a good mystery because it's from Agatha Christie) but this was not quite that. Tommy and Tuppence are quite young (early 20s) and speak in what seems a very affected style but may actually be true for the time period. I find their words a little weird but mostly endearing. They were FUN characters and I think I like them more than Miss Marple and certainly more than Poirot.The plot was fast-moving, much to Tuppence's preference. They are looking for a way to make a bit of money and end up entangled in a plot seemingly plotted by the Bolsheviks (I'm not entirely clear on that point). They meet a variety of characters in a confusing but fun plot. It definitely leans a bit more to the thriller side.As to the ultimate mastermind, the so-called Mr Brown, there are two main candidates and I of course picked the wrong one because I liked him in his other guise so much. The ending is quite satisfactory though.Overall: A welcome change from the usual Christie! I will definitely be reading the other T&T; books sooner rather than later."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Tommy and Tuppence are great. They're fun, young, and full of ideas. The other characters are just as entertaining and 'seeable': Sir James Peel, Marguerite, Jane Finn, etc. The S.A. is very easy to read. Your eyes just skim from page to page, which is really quite usual with Christie. Nothing is overly confusing, the plot is comparatively easy to follow. The dialogue is clever, humorous, and fun. The denouemount, however...If you're looking out for it even a little, the whole thing opens up blatantly for all to see. But even then, the story was so entertaining that all I really felt was proud of myself for figuring out a Christie ending before the end, rather than jilted."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Christie was never at her best in novels of international espionage but this has to be her best effort in that genre.Tommy and Tuppence, the 'Young Adventurers', set out in search of Jane Finn and are embroiled a mystery concerning missing sensitive government papers.The young detectives are at their most engaging in this, their introductory novel,the plot is a thriller and the end when it came was a shocker. Inspite of this ,in comparison with Christie's finer works this pales.Her handling of spies is nowhere near as good as her tales of what Poirot would call 'the crime intime'.Average."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"First I would like to say something, I LOVE Tommy and Tuppence. The young and lively Tommy and Tuppence (portrayed in Secret Adversary and Partners In Crime) not the middle aged couple the later novels made them to be. The mystery itself is pretty good (it is Agatha were talking about, after all) but what makes this book stand out from the rest are the two main characters. Their dialouge is witty, their romance (they are in love, aren't they??) is sweet. This is easily one of my favourite Agatha Christie books."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Agatha Christie is at her best.

It is a fast moving and entertaining yarn, provided that you can suspend disbelief that the British security services would entrust the defence of the Empire against a Bolshevik conspiracy masterminded by a dastardly master-criminal working under the pseudonym of 'Mr. Brown' to two complete amateurs, especially when the latter seem quite prepared to spill the beans about everything they know to complete strangers on the off-chance that they may be able to help. Along the way there is a murder, with basically only two possible suspects (unlike the usual dozen or so in most of Agatha Christie's novels). You can of course guess which of the two is the villain, but as in her later novels the author provides subtle clues to enable you to deduce the culprit. Overall, an entertaining read, but Tuppence and Tommy are not as convincing sleuths as either Poirot or Miss Marple."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This book introduces Christie's readers to the Young Adventurers, Tommy and Tuppence, a couple of charming young English friends struggling to make do in the post WWI years.

I could not sleep at night because I wanted to know how the story went on. I read wherever I could, in the cantine, in the bus, in the waiting queue of a shop, on the loo, etc.(B) The dramatic fluency of the plot is perfect.

It doesn't have to be to be excellent escapist fare, and in this it succeeds very nicely. Characters are well-defined and engaging, and the locations well-depicted but not tediously so. I enjoyed its length as well; the story is not told in a rushed style, which helps build suspense.Read on a bad weather day, tea at your side, cat or dog on your lap, and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This short mystery novel has held up to the test of time.

If you have not read it, enjoy this charming edition!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I've been an avid Agatha Christie fan for decades now, but had yet to read one of Ms. Christie's novels with the characters of Tommy & Tuppence until now that is....Tommy & Tuppence are a nice, refreshing change from Miss Marple & Hercule Poirot. They are young upstarts in this novel looking to earn a decent living in an era where the economy isn't great.... So, Tommy & Tuppence, whom have been life long friends, decide to embark on a new career as the young adventurers in search of new adventures.They end up doing under cover work, off the record, for the British Government, in search of some important documents lost in World War I. These documents if recovered by the enemy, could have dire consequences for the allies now that the war is over.The Secret Adversary is a nice, tightly written novel by Ms. Christie and this novel keeps you guessing until the very end which character is the bad guy."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"After all, this novel was about an important document that would turn history on its head. In the days of great ocean liners, a secret document was sent to America for safekeeping aboard the Lusitania. The ship sank, but not before the man who kept this document gave it away to someone. Fast forward to Tommy and Tuppence who were both almost jobless and had no rich boyfriend/girlfriend to turn to. Tuppence had the idea to turn themselves into an adventuring couple and sent an ad to the news. What follows is a rigmarole of mistaken identity, blatant lies and international intrigue.'The secret adversary' effectively introduces Tommy and Tuppence as the power couple of the detective world. The Queen's narrative is as lively as the characters itself, and you'll find yourself reading this to the wee hours of them morning."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Moving into a writing career that was to make her the world's most published author, Agatha Christie sent his book to her publisher in the early 1920s.Already her strengths are evident: her gift for story telling, her ability to engage a likely readership aged from 8 to 80, her ability to pull a fast one on her readers, and her ability to reproduce actual ordinary conversation. In the 1920s it was normal to hear young adults calling each other \\"Old Bean\\" and \\"Old Thing\\", and they do so here. A weakness still is her inability to devise a means of dispensing with the requirement for long explanations, at the end of a mystery novel\\"The Secret Adversary\\" is not a pure mystery novel, however. It is part romance, part adventure, part ripping yarn, and part whodunit. Agatha Christie takes up some of the props found in each of these types of fiction. There are the lively young adults, Tommy and Tuppence, eager to make ends meet by undertaking a little detective work. There is the hunt for a secret document that will determine the fate of the great nations of the world. There are the apparent adversaries (\\"The German\\" is one of them), and the incredible eavesdropping and kidnapping situations.Avid Christie readers will want to sample this early work, but general readers should choose from her productions of the 1930s."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This 1922 adventure is Christie's second novel. It does not feature Hercule Poirot but instead introduces Tommy and Tuppence. The pair are childhood friends who went their separate ways during WWI and chance into each other in postwar London. Both are trying to find jobs and are, like most of the other returning veterans, not having much success. They hit on a plan to become 'adventurers' and soon find themselves caught up in a chain of events that had begun years before with the sinking of the Luisitania. The plot is wildly fantastic involving international conspiracies, secret agents seeking secret documents, American millionaires and romance.This is one of Christie's 'master criminal' stories, very much in the same vein as THE MAN IN THE BROWN SUIT and THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY among others. If you enjoyed these or are a P. G. Wodehouse fan you'll love this one but if you are looking for a challenging or more realistic mystery look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"The Secret Adversary introduces Tommy and Tuppence Beresford to the world. Young and rather foolish, Tommy and Tuppence offer themselves as paid adventurers to the general public. &quot;No unreasonable offer refused,&quot; their ad claims. When someone actually takes Tuppence up on the advertisement, the duo find themselves in the midst of a mystery. A man known only as Mr. Brown is seeking a top-secret document that could destroy Great Britain, a document last held by a young girl who survived the sinking of the Lusitania. It is up to Tommy and Tuppence to recover the document and discover the identity of Mr. Brown. The Secret Adversary will keep you guessing to the end, and after you think you've solved the mystery, Agatha Christie plays her trump card and you will find your theories incorrect. If you like books by P.G. Wodehouse or the Lord Peter Whimsey series, you will enjoy Tommy and Tuppence's dialogue. If you love spy stories, you will enjoy the plot of this book. I highly recommend The Secret Adversary to anyone who loves Agatha Christie and to anyone who loves adventure."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"The Secret Adversary is a very entertaining read seventy-nine years after it's first publication. Sure there are some things that are dated but I like to think of that as adding to the authenticity. And yes, by the time everything is sorted out at the end, it's pretty easy for the reader to say that the clues were all out there in plain sight. But as you read, Dame Agatha does a nice job of keeping you guessing. (This is due in part to her spliting up Tommy and Tuppence for the better part of the novel. The reader learns what each of them learn but they don't always have the chance to communicate with each other.)I enjoyed the political espionage aspects of the book as well as being able to see the evolving romance. The Russian Revolution is a very real thing for these characters as is the post-war readjustment.I haven't read any other books in the Beresford series but I really like the mix of spunk and pragmatism in these two. They have a youth and spirit and are a nice contrast to Marple and Poirot. I'll keep reading all three series but the Beresfords may get a bit of priority."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"The Secret Adversary introduces Agatha Christie's characters of Tommy and Tuppence, an out of work young man and woman who decide to become \\"adventurers\\" out of a lack of anything better to do. They quite accidentally get sucked into an international mystery that reaches to the highest levels of British government.This story takes place shortly after WWI, and there are a few obscure terms -- even to my British coworker -- but they don't hinder the enjoyment of the story. It is interesting to see attitudes and philosophies of early 20th English perspective.It's Agatha Christie, one of the best-selling authors of the 20th century, so you can expect good work. The characters are well-written, the story is quite gripping, and the ending is satisfying (if a tad predictable). This made me want to read more Christie and more Tommy & Tuppence.A little hint if you want it: Pay attention to the telegrams."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I have not been a big fan of the Tommy and Tuppence episodes on PBS' Agatha Christie series; however, this is a surprisingly well-written thriller even for Agatha Christie. The plot is convoluted, in a nice way, and the dialogue believable. I missed the mark completely in identifying the villain. Tommy and Tuppence are a nice break from Miss Marple and M. Poirot, and I recommend the book for anyone who enjoys Agatha Christie's style."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I've recently become addicted to crime shows and books. In the age of \\"24\\" and CSI and all these hyper-tech worlds, there's a novelty in going back to the 1920s when people left telegrams and couldn't track the bad guy on satellite-powered traffic cameras.This version for Kindle doesn't have an active table of contents. However, I just make a bookmark at the beginning of each chapter, so I don't see what the big deal is. Thanks whoever made it available to us for free!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I am a devoted fan of Agatha Christie and usually rate all her books &quot;5-stars&quot;. In this case however, I would give it &quot;4-stars&quot; because while the characters of Tommy and Tuppence are really well drawn and it's great fun to read about them, the book is more shakily plotted than many of Dame Agatha's other books. I spotted the master criminal almost immediately and normally never do that. Also the basic plot line was thin at best and never really hung together in any coherent way. I got the feeling that Christie enjoyed creating and writing about Tommy and Tuppence so much that the mystery became almost secondary in this case. But the characters are so entertaining to read about that it's impossible to not enjoy the book! If ypu enjoy reading about post-WW1 England and the struggles of young people who find themselves suddenly at a loss to get by, all done in a most light-hearted, fun manner, then you need look no further!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"In her second novel, Agatha Christie introduced Prudence &quot;Tuppence&quot; Cowley and Tommy Beresford, old friends who are both newly discharged from the service at the end of World War I. By chance, they meet in London one day and to fight their boredom launch a detective firm together. Their first case involves tracing a young girl, Jane Finn, who disappeared during the war with a folder of important government papers. This is also Mrs. Christie's first of many novels to use the &quot;master criminal&quot; plot, a device she will use many more times in her writing career. The suspense is thrilling as is the enthusiasm of Tommy and Tuppence, two characters who will return in &quot;Partners in Crime,&quot; &quot;N or M?&quot; &quot;By The Pricking of My Thumbs,&quot; and &quot;Postern of Fate.&quot; But it is in this first novel that the two are most endearing, especially when Tommy asks Tuppence to become his wife.Adding to the mystery are Mr. Whittington, who by attempting to hire Tuppence to impersonate Jane sets the couple off on their adventure; Mr. Carter, a mysterious government official; Julius Hersheimmer, Jane's American cousin; and Albert, a young boy who will remain with Tommy and Tuppence and become their life-long friend.In the end, the British government is saved, Tommy and Tuppence realize they are in love, and Young Adventurers, Ltd. is a thriving business. A most satifying read."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"A mystery thriller and full of intrigue...Tommy Beresford and Tuppence Cowley go through such adventures as being kidnapped, false messages, An anonymous fugitive, murder,international terrorism and all because of a long lost girl carrying a vital draft treaty to the United States after World War One. First, Tommy follows a strange man and ends up being kidnapped! Tuppence, thinking Tommy was dead was asked to work as a house maid for a suspicious woman. After struggles, Tommy escapes just in time to find Tuppences' boss dead! Murdered! They eventually find the girl (working as a house maid for Tuppence's boss too) and the papers only to find that the person that they had confided in the most was Mr. Brown! The Criminal Mastermind behing international affairs! The book never lets you down, you may never be able to put the book down! I gave it 4 stars. So I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"It was a real treat to come across this Kindle edition of the first Tommy & Tuppence adventure. They're so young in this story -- \\"Their united ages certainly would not have totaled forty-five.\\" But their experiences in World War I had made them more mature than average twenty-two year olds.I've read a lot of Agatha Christie's works, most of it back when I was about twelve or thirteen. For a summer when Nancy Drew suddenly seemed too childish, but I wasn't ready for adult books yet, Agatha Christie came to the rescue. At a rate of nearly a book a day, I went through all the Agatha Christie the public library and used bookstores had to offer. I liked the Miss Marple stories, maybe because Marple stayed in the background for the most part. Hercule Poirot seemed silly and cartoonish to me even then. I loved Tommy and Tuppence, but there weren't many stories that featured them.The Secret Adversary is a spy story rather than a murder mystery. It's not bad, twisting back and forth, but I particularly enjoyed the glimpse at the young Tommy and Tuppence, before they were a couple, and for the authentic descriptions of post World War I London. I thought I knew Central London fairly well, but I was stumped when Tuppence left the Dover Street Tube Station and walked toward Piccadilly. I found out that used to be the name of what is now the Green Park Station.One thing that stands out is how independent Tuppence is. She seems to have little trouble finding work (even as Tommy is having a hard time finding a job even a year after the War) and even turns down a proposal from a rich American, much to her own surprise.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Agatha Christie, The Secret Adversary (Dodd, Mead, 1922)The good thing about buying a Kobo: it came pre-loaded with one hundred classic (read: out-of-copyright) books, most of which were either obscure titles by authors I knew, stuff I'd outright never heard of, or stuff \\"I mean to get around reading sometime in the future\\". The bad part about buying a Kobo: they were all in some weird format that didn't make sense to anything but Kobo. So after a long night of erasing the weird proprietary format, pulling them all off Project Gutenberg, and reloading them, I was ready to get started. I just didn't know where to go. My clumsiness decided for me; I was reading something else, I no longer remember quite what, and I clicked on &lt;em>The Secret Adversary&lt;/em> instead. So from then until I finished the books in front of it, it sat there taunting me on the \\"I'm currently reading\\" screen saying \\"1% finished.\\" Which it was going to keep doing short of my deleting it--again--and reloading it--again. At which point I decided it would be the first classic I tackled. (I'm quite glad I didn't accidentally click on &lt;em>the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&lt;/em>, which I'm saving for when I have a terminal illness and need to bargain with Death.)The first of Christie's five books to feature amateur sleuths Tommy (Beresford) and Tuppence (Crowley), &lt;em>The Secret Adversary&lt;/em> begins with our hero and heroine, without a dime to their name, deciding on a lark to become adventurers. They are overheard, by coincidence, by someone in need of one. Which unleashes quite a powerful raft of coincidences, but I'm getting ahead of myself. In any case, they're hired to find a missing girl and the documents she was carrying, which are very secret and could do irreparable harm to the government were they to get out. (Of course, the bad guys are also looking for them.) The search involves a good deal of chasing, being chased, secret meetings with highly-placed government contacts, infiltrating communist cells, a stereotypical Texan with unlimited funds (the missing girl's cousin), and, of course, all kinds of romance.Give Ms. Christie one thing--once the pedal hits the floor in this book, which is does roundabout Chapter Three, it doesn't let up until the very end. The pace is breakneck in the extreme, the excitement is always palpable, and the identity of \\"Mr. Brown\\", the head of the conspiracy arrayed against our young folks, will keep you guessing until the (overly-dramatic, to be sure) Big Reveal. As a straight-up genre mystery, it's got all the hallmarks, and will keep you turning the pages.On the other hand, it's an early novel, the second she ever published. It relies on the raft of coincidences I mentioned before to advance major plot points, the minor characters are stereotypes of the highest order, and one can detect a touch of paranoid ethnocentrism in a number of Christie's depictions of the members of the Bolshevik Conspiracy(TM) arrayed against Tommy and Tuppence (\\"He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face, and Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole\\", for example). Of course, whether Christie was caught up in the politics of the day or lampooning them is for the reader to decide, but I didn't really see anything to indicate the latter myself.Genre fiction that doesn't aspire to be anything else, and that's not a bad thing, but ninety years later some of it may make you a bit uncomfortable; recommended, but proceed with caution. **"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"amazon should not give this kind of books that can't be read in the kindle! The Secret Adversary is not readable at all! large pieces of black blocks are in the middle of the text, as well as a lot of unintelligible words copied from a scanner."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Tommy and Tuppence were sparkling creations by Agatha Christie (and their ability to transfer deliciously to the small screen is also a proven fact.) But sadly they were never given as strong mystery material as Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot were and have, therefore, languished on the literary sidelines to a great extent. Their first appearance, in the Secret Adversary, is a good example of this problem. Christie is weakest when politics are involved and the story is hopelessly naive with the fate of the world being controlled by one man, Mr. Brown, who ultimately is rather easily bested by those two crazy kids of the flapper Twenties, Tommy and Tuppence. The author never, ever, succeeded in achieving anything remotely approaching a spy thriller. Still, this book will hold interest for anyone wanting an early glimpse of the crazy duo who are always a pleasure to spend some time with."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"The Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie\\"The Secret Adversary\\" is a smart, well-plotted, tightly written novel. The novel introduces Tommy and Tuppence as the power couple of the detective world."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Christie's variety can often astound those who first come across her. Whether it be a tense, well plotted detective story, a sharp psycholgical thriller with twists at every turn, an adventure, a spy story, a tale of international intrgue, she never fails to dissappoint. This time she turns her hand to an incredibly exciting adventure story, introducing two heroes who are even more enjoyable to read about than Poirot or Marple. (Perosnally, of all her detective, T&T; are my favourites. I wish she'd done more books with them in.)The story begins incredibly well, aboard the sinking Lusitania. A secret document is passed to a young girl, who escapes the floundering ship. Years later, someone wants that document badly, and is even prepared to kill for it...as it contains secrets which could bring down Britain.Enter Tommy and Tuppence on the trail, and thus begins an incredibly entertaining tale of intrgue, adventure, and death. Lots of action, lots of suspense, murder and mystery added in for extra spice.I have to say, i did guess the identity of the culprit (mind you, it was almost the only Agatha Christie book in which i did.) But that is not a bad thing. When, in some cases, you guess the culprit correctly, it can bring the reader an intense sense of satisfaction, knowing that, just this once, Christie didn't manage to outwit you completely. (After all, these books are challenges to the reader to work out \\"whodunnit\\" before the detective.)Tommy and Tuppence are incredibly likeable, and i was immensely pleased to discover that she had written more (if few) books about them.This one is a refreshing must for all Christie fans. (Mind you, if you are a Christie fan, i need not tell you that. Doubtless you plan to read them all anyway. As you should.)"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This was my first Agatha Chrstie novel and I loved it. The story was fun amd quick-paced, and it was made even more enjoyable by the 1920's London settings. My favorite part of the novel, however, was the clever conversation between Tommy and Tuppence; I hope all of Christie's novels include such likeable heroes.

A chance encounter with an eavesdropper promises a mysterious yet intriguing task, but quickly falls through when an uncomfortable Tuppence gives a false name to her would-be employer (Jane Finn, a name dropped by two passing gentlemen when Tommy himself was eavesdropping on conversations) and is accused of blackmail.Money no longer a concern, The Young Adventurers, LTD., as Tommy and Tuppence have christened themselves, decide to sleuth to satisfy their own curiosity about the nondescript Jane Finn and why the girl is suddenly so popular. Soon they are employed for real, charged by Jane's millionaire Americn cousin to find the girl, missing since her rescue from the sinking Lusitania, and implored by one Mr. Carter to retrieve documents believed to have been on Miss Finn's person at the time, documents that could threaten the entire security of Britian and threaten the validity of post-war treaties. When a potential witness is murdered before she can offer any helpful information with regards to Jane and &quot;Mr. Brown,&quot; the ringleader of the organization behind the threats, The Young Adventurers find enough adventure for two lifetimes.In Secret Adversary, Christie offers perhaps one of her most complex mysteries -- a forerunner to the contemporary political thriller. The combination of Tommy's deductive intellect and Tuppence's wit and zeal are compelling to read, yet sadly addictive. Given the dearth of stories featuring these two, one may be left to wonder about the large gaps in between the Tommy and Tuppence novels and what adventures may have happened in the interim. For any mystery fan, however, Secret Adversary is a must read, a story that despite its setting will always be ageless."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"If you love Agatha Christie you will love this adventure.

I am sure that I will be on the lookout for more of these books."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"One of Christie's earlier books, as well as the first to feature amateur detectives Tommy and Tuppence, \\"The Secret Adversary\\" is less of a mystery story as it is an espionage novel. Personally I prefer the former to the latter, and several kinks in her writing at this early stage still need to be ironed out, but for the most part this makes for a diverting, quick, and entertaining read.Somewhat adrift after the first World War and desperate for money, old friends Tommy and Tuppence decide to hire themselves out as adventurers, willing to do anything for a price. It's not long before they're caught up in an intrigue that involves national security, top-secret papers, and a missing girl with the unusual name of Jane Finn (derived from a conversation overheard by Christie concerning a woman called Jane Fish). At the back of it all lurks a shadowy, sinister figure: a man known only as Mr Brown, considered a criminal genius and a formidable foe.Helped along the way by an American millionaire in search of his cousin, Tommy and Tuppence use little more than their wits to infiltrate a foreign spy-ring, each chapter alternating between each one as they deal with kidnappings, criminals, red herrings, false leads, secret identities, poisoning, sinking ships, car chases and gun fights. As with many Christie novels, contrivances and coincidences are high, but then a book called \\"The Secret Adversary\\" was never meant to be taken seriously, and the pacing is so quick that one hardly notices the leaps in logic.By today's standards, there are a few idioms and references that have dated considerably, and the conflict is very much between stereotypical evil foreigners versus the stiff upper-lipped Brits, but then that's all typical Christie as well. The real appeal of these novels is the characters of Tommy and Tuppence, both spirited and intelligent youngsters who long for excitement. They're a perfect match, and they turn up in several other Christie books:Partners in Crime,N or M?,By the Pricking of My ThumbsandPostern of Fate.The touching thing is that they aged alongside Christie, appearing years older with each subsequent story. Here they are in their mid-twenties, and by the final book, are in their twilight years. It's a touching portrayal of a long and happy marriage, all the more so because they were written over a period of several decades. Throughout it all their banter remains fresh and involving, and their dual personalities can be summed up by their views on marriage, detailed on the final page of the book: \\"Marriage is called all sorts of things, a haven, a refuge and a crowning glory, and a state of bondage, and lots more. But do you know what I think it is? A sport!\\""},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This is the first Agatha Christie book I read since highschool. You can tell she was exceptional at weaving a story together from the innocent duo - boy and girl in their 20s, just trying to make a bit of money, to getting themselves mixed up in a scheme above their heads. it was exciting to see how it unfolded. i think their navie nature allowed them to get ahead where a professional spy could not."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I can't believe I didn't review this when I read it.

After working my way through the usual suspects (Ms. Marple, Poirot, etc) I turned to this, the first in the wonderful Tommy and Tuppence series.One of the things that makes Agatha Christie a superior writer is her characters. Beyond each well crafted and mind bending mystery are people with connected lives, stories and emotions. Each novel hinges on very universally human emotions and motivations, and the Tommy and Tuppence mysteries are no exception.The Secret Adversary introduces us to two friends, both short on cash, who team up to become sleuths. The whole thing sounds very adventurous and romantic until they find themselves embroiled in a very real conspiracy involving the sinking of the Lusitania, a missing woman, and the elusive \\"Mr. Brown\\".

Tommy and Tuppence, two young people who are out of work and implausibly drafted by the government, are trying to stop them. Despite the substantial amounts of disbelief that must be suspended and the fact that I figured out pretty early on who Mr. Brown actually was, this book was great fun to read, mostly because Tommy and Tuppence were written so vivaciously.

In this book they have to do some investigating and find their adventure.This is a very nice mystery-story set just after WWI. I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I haven't read any Christie books in quite a while, and I've never read a Tommy & Tuppence adventure, but now that I've read this one I'm hooked again. This collection has a different, but wonderful, flavor from her other collections. This book is full of wit and dry British humor, while still being dramatic and suspenseful. It's perfect for people like me who like mystery and action mixed in with a little meaningful comic relief. Whether you're a Christie fan or a new reader, this is a must."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I love Tommy and Tuppence as they age -- thoughtful, careful, smart. However, this (early) work is a bit of let down. The plot isn't that great and their characters are more cliched than they are as they grow older. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This is a book you can read for the pure joy of it. Suspense, mystery, well developed charactors and hard to put down. What a relief to be able to read a book and then hand it over to my 14 year old daughter and say, \\"You'll love this.\\" No gore,foul language or sex. We desperately need some current authors who are willing to write intriguing stories without vampires, monsters, demons, gore, sex, foul language and such."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"As a first time Agatha Christie reader, this mystery was smartly written and clever in clues and plot twists. The main characters are engaging and have a timeless appeal with their quit witted intellect and independence. I mostly read contemporary fiction but found this a refreshing read. Secret Adversary relies on good writing rather than most current fiction that leans heavily on sex, gore or violence for the plot twists."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I remember watching the shows on PBS from time to time, but nothing beats reading Christie! This is the first T&T; mystery, and it does not start small, its about missing documents that could lead to a communist take over of England! Not a bad first case for the pair of adventures!Totally loved this mystery, I'm sure you will find it delightful as well!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Fighting off boredom, poverty, and unemployment at the end of the first World War, two young friends, Tommy Beresford and Prudence Cowley -- we're told \\"their united ages would certainly not have totaled forty-five\\" -- decide over a lunch of tea and cheap biscuits to hang a shingle as the Young Adventurers, LTD. From that point on, the two are entangled in an enjoyably comic, suspenseful search for a surviving passenger from the doomed ocean liner, Lusitania. The whole adventure is, of course, more dangerous than the two initially realize, but the characters never falter, or lose their unflappable charm.A great, and fun, introduction to Agatha Christie (that I enjoyed reading a second time) ready for perhaps a new generation of readers."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Although I read a great number of Agatha Christie books as a child, I never came across any from her \\"Tommy & Tuppence\\" series on my mother's bookshelves. So I thought that it might be fun to try the first of them to see what Christie's \\"other\\" series was like. And this first in the T&T; series is like is a strange mix of John Buchan and P.G. Wodehouse -- it's an espionage story, but often reads like a parody of one. The title's play on the Joseph Conrad novel hints at a certain tongue in cheekiness, as does the use of every possible spy adventure clich&eacute;.The story opens with a prologue aboard the sinking Lusitania in 1915, as a mysterious man entrusts a secret diplomatic packet to an American teenage girl. We then leap forward to 1919, where we meet Tommy and Tuppence, a pair of lovely young adults who are somewhat adrift and broke following their wartime experiences. Running into each other in London, the childhood friends cook up a scheme to advertise themselves as \\"Young Adventurers\\" for hire. Thanks to a wildly improbable coincidence (a snatch of overheard conversation), they find themselves in the midst of a plot to destroy England.It seems that some secret mastermind has managed to unite all of England's enemies (Bolshevik Russians, defeated Germany, Irish Republicans, and the English working class) in common cause. All they need to do is provoke a general strike that will topple the government and unleash anarchy (exactly how or why this is the case is left murky) -- and the packet entrusted to the girl on the Lusitania is the key. Apparently it contains some kind of draft treaty whose contents are so explosive that public revelation would throw England into just the desired state of unrest (again, just how this old treaty would do that, or who the signatories are are left to the reader's imagination).In any event, Tommy and Tuppence take on these plotters on behalf of the British government (who presumably would have more qualified people for the job), and there's much tailing, eavesdropping, impersonation, and general thrills and chills as first Tommy, and then Tuppence are captured. Naturally, neither hero nor heroine are simply killed by their captors, as that would make too much sense. Amidst all this toing and froing, they come into contact with a cast of colorful characters including an energetic young American millionaire, a crafty lawyer, a sinister society lady, a spunky kid helper, and Inspector Japp from the Poirot series. Since the reader knows full well that the plot will be foiled, the real mystery is the identity of the unknown mastermind, Mr. Brown. Alas, careful readers will realize less than halfway through, that barring some kind of \\"locked room\\" shenanigans, the identity of Mr. Brown must be one of two people.So it's rather an odd book, perhaps best read as parody, but enjoyable as an old-fashioned ripping yarn with two engaging leads -- who naturally fall in love. Definitely left me curious to read further adventures of Tommy and Tuppence."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Great light beach reading in this little known series of Agatha Christie's Young Adventurers. In this first appearance, the soon to be husband and wife team of Tommy and Tuppence cast off their post-war boredom by hiring themselves out as adventurers.They soon find themselves Britain's only hope against an unbelievable collection of thugs, unionists, and socialists bent on destroying the empire in ways that can only be spoken of in whispers. The chrismatic yet unknown Mr. Brown is behind all of this, and no one knows who he is. Join our heroes as they chase him down with several false leads and misidentifications. After almost a century this tale still holds up well. The sinking of the Lusitania and other events of the Great War play a prominent role as Victorian life provides our setting."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Being one who is far from fond of the characters of Tommy and Tuppence, I picked up this book wary of what I would find unfolded in the pages. However, my fears were unallayed. This book is in no comparison to 'Postern of Fate', the last book featuring this daring duo, and also one of few mysteries of Agatha that entirely lacks a plot.From the first pages, the story has a tightly woven plot that toils for more of a surprise effect than realism. Reminiscent of 'The Big Four', another fantastically interesting mystery, 'The Secret Adversary' is made for those seeking adventure in their lives, not a feasible plot.With Christie swinging her signature style of convincing you the murderer really IS the other person (when in reality it is the man on the right), nothing could be more of a thriller and relaxing story than 'Secret Adversary'. My suggestion: read this. After all, there's practically a money-back guarantee you'll like it."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Not the best Agatha Christie mystery. Does not hold your interest. Had to make myself finish. Will purchase more as I do love most of her books."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I haven't read this book, but I like Agatha Christie.

She was a terrific writer of suspense."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I LOVED IT!! Easily one of the best books I have read in awhile. It had spies, mysteries, intrigue, and romance! It kept me guessing until the end!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Includes some true history from world war 1 , exciting story that keeps you guessing and has a surprise ending"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I find Agatha Christie novels both interesting and comfortable to read. The characters are well-developed, but never painful, and the stories flow well."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This is the second novel by Agatha Christie, and is the first novel that \\"Tommy & Tuppence\\" make an appearance. We are introduced to Tommy & Tuppence as two young adults, who have emerged from the war and are in search of more adventure. They go in search of \\"Jane Finn\\" who holds deadly documents that could change the current political regime.I have read a few books with Tommy & Tuppence, but they are all when they are long retired, and it was great to read them as young things out to find adventure. You can see the spirit that they both have in later books was \\"over the top\\" in their younger years and it was great to read how they started out.In many of the later books it mentions their earlier adventures, especially in \\"The Secret Adversary\\" and \\"N or M\\" so its always nice to piece together this different parts of their adventures and characteristics.I'm definitely growing to love Tommy & Tuppence the more I read them."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Once again the mind of Agatha Christie is brilliantly shown in this novel. This particular book is a wild adventure from the beginning, a constant goose chase, so to speak, with leads changing constantly. It is a complicated plot, but a thrilling ride the whole way through."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This is the first ebook I have gotten for my ereader. I rated 4 stars due to the quickness of download, sharpness of print, and the ease of use. I plan to stock the library on my tablet so I can use my ereader instead of carrying bulky books with me on trips."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Love to read! Now with my new Kindle Fire I can read at night, day, anytime, anywhere and read what I want.

They are both out of work at the end of WW1 and decide to join forces to become \\"adventurers\\" which is another word for investigators. They are immediately involved with an international mystery that could topple the highest levels of British government. What is not to like about Agatha Christie, one of the best-selling authors of the 20th century. The characters are a likable and intellegent. The story keeps you interested with a happy ending for all. I really want to read more Christie and more about Tommy & Tuppence."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"She got me again! I had my suspicions though.A very good read, and I have read all the Poirots and Marples."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Really fun mystery. I enjoy Agatha Christie's style of writing, and this is an especially good example of it. The book keeps you guessing and even though I figured out who Mr. Brown was, I still wasn't certain how things were going to happen and seeing the way the mystery unfolds is half the fun of reading one. The main characters were endearing and you really root for them."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This was my first Agatha Christie book--now I see why she is still so popular.I am finally getting around to reading authors like Agatha Christie after spending years of college research and professional reading. I am certainly glad that this was my first Agatha Christie book. The plot was very intriguing and unpredictable. Her characters really come to life and are interesting from start to finish. I am now a fan and will definitely read all her works."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"It has taken me several years, but I'm finally down to reading my last few Agatha Christie novels. I was quite pleased to see that one of the books I'd yet to read, Secret Adversary, was free on the Kindle.This is a cute, rollicking story set in the 1920s. It has a light air about it, and one can't help but adore the characters of Tommy and Tuppence, who are featured in several other Christie novels and short stories. I found the writing style to be quite different from the usual Christie novel: it was gay and sunny and fancy-free, and although I was somewhat taken aback by it at first, I found myself falling for how fun it all was.The mystery itself involves spying, a secret government treaty, and other twists and turns, with an ending that could be considered shocking only if you weren't paying any attention. Secret Adversary is one of those nice little books to read when you don't feel like thinking very hard, and I loved it for that very reason."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I love Agatha Christie, and I had never read any of the Tommy & Tuppence series, so I decided that if I was going to try one, it ought to be the first (it also didn't hurt that it was free). I thoroughly enjoyed the book, although I felt that the \\"brown book\\" reading at the end was superfluous, and decided to read the remaining 4 books in the series.Imagine my dismay to find that only one more book (the second in the series) is currently available for Kindle. Ah, well, I'll wait..."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This is the first book in the Tommy and Tuppence series by Agatha Christie. This book is still a good read, even if some of the characters may be a little dated or painted broadly (Julius, for instance). I have read this book a few times and even watched the TV adaption of this particular episode, but I notice something new every time I read it. If you are a Christie fan, give this one a try!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This is the first of the Tommy and Tuppence series, which begins with the two becoming reacquainted and, being both bored with life, deciding to become adventurers. The two soon become involved in solving a complex plot to destroy the English government, and the key to solving it is finding the mysterious Jane Finn, for whom everyone else seems to be searching. The criminal mastermind behind the revolutionary plot turns out to be someone both Tuppence and Tommy considered an ally. It's a fast-paced thriller that's a delight to read and attempt to figure out before all is revealed. I had some suspicions, and I deduced the culprit just as the duo did! Agatha Christie's books are a stimulating, joyous read."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"As the famous Lusitania sinks during an afternoon in 1917, a young American girl is surreptitiously entrusted with an oilskin packet containing important government papers. She is to take them to the Ambassador at once as soon as she is on land. Her name is Jane Finn, and her ordeal is just beginning. It'll be five full years until her life is safe from danger - and the mystery is solved - by one of the most famous pair of sleuths of all time: Tommy Beresford and Prudence - Tuppence - Cowley.The pair run into each other while at their tethers' end and scrounge into one of London's tea-rooms. The war has made things tough, and none of them has a job. It all changes when Tommy hears the name \`Jane Finn' by chance up in the air, in reference to a girl who seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. Just for the fun of it, they decide to place an ad in the local paper searching for information. Responses do not take long to arrive and, faster than one can say \\"conspiracy\\" The Young Adventurers, Ltd. is in business. The job is dangerous and the adventures many, but that would not deterred neither unimaginative Tommy, nor intuitive Tuppence. Under the hidden commission of the UK government - all expenses paid - they take up rooms at the Ritz and start on Jane Finn's toes. All the while, UK's most wanted master criminal, \\"Mr. Brown\\" is on their own toes. First is Tommy who gets kidnapped, then Tuppence, until finally, and after many misapprehensions, \\"...Mr. Brown is in this room...\\" and he's got both Tuppence and Jane! Or has he?This is more a story of espionage rather than a mystery an it has a superbly intricate plot. It is very interesting that Christie chose for her second novel a total departure from her first and most famous creation, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot; and chose to create two totally different characters. The strong plotting and the eagerness of the story might almost suggest she would have taken upon writing many more Tommy and Tuppence novels than she actually wrote, with the very possible exception that when the Cold War was over, their destinies were sealed.This is a novel where all the pieces are scattered at the beginning and, coming to an end, they all get put together dutifully using that great Christie wrap-up style. It is also possibly one of her most candid books."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Although best known for her tightly plotted murder mysteries, Agatha Christie occasionally turned her hand to the purely outrageous adventure--and in this area THE SECRET ADVERSARY, a tale of two amateurs pitted against a master criminal--is one of her most successful works.Much of the book's charm arises from its period feel. Written in the 1920s, it effectively captures the \\"anything goes\\" quality of the era through both its outlandish story and its leading characters: Tommy Beresford and Tuppence Cowley, two \\"bright young things\\" who find themselves without jobs in the wake of World War I and who casually advertise their services as \\"young adventurers.\\" The absurdity of the story, which concerns a kidnapped American survivor of the ill-fated Lusitania in possession of important dipolmatic papers, combines with the lighthearted personalities of Tommy and Tuppence in a very enjoyable way, and although some may dismiss it as too lightweight an effort to rank among Christie's finest, most will find it very amusing and extremely charming in an purely escapist way.On a purely personal note, THE SECRET ADVERSARY was the first Christie novel I ever read. As I recall, I was about twelve years old, I thought it was tremendous good fun, and even these many years later I still occasionally return to it for the innocent charm of its witty characters as they romp through 1920s London on their ridiculous, funny, and extremely entertaining spree. It is nonsense of course, but no less enjoyable for it. Lots of fun!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Agatha Christie in her early days demonstrated her skill that she would refine the rest of her life. This is a fun romp that recalls a bygone era. It is suspenseful and innocent all at once. The bad guys were bad. The good guys were good. And the villain was a bit of a surprise with so many red herrings to follow."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"As always, A.C. keeps you guessing til the last moment! Not too long but quite enjoyable. Going to find another short story from A.C. now!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Great detective story.

Read on!"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I really like Christie's writing style. It's simple and direct , easy to read. Her detectives seem to be ordinary people ( apart from Hercules Poirot : nothing common about him). This is one of my favourites. It caught my attention from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Read it this book was so good it kept m&#8220; interested the whole time i was reading it amazing author"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Fabulous, fantastic, the adjectives that poorly describe this marvellous deed!Agatha was ahead of her time and is still very contemporary."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This is a Tommy and Tuppence book. Evidently it is the first in the series of stories. And as always, when Agatha Christie writes, I enjoy.The book starts after WWI when Tommy and Tuppence have both been returned to civilian life. He was in the military and she was a nurse. They are broke and are trying to figure out a way to make money.From there, the improbable crops up and they are sucked into a plot that will bring down the British government. The book was written at a time when the British class system and ideas of equality were no where in sight, or maybe on the far horizon.There is mystery with villains and red herrings. There are kidnappings and gun shots. Basically this is a typical Christie mystery. If Dame Agatha were writing now, she would have a much different perspective on things, but for the times, she is ahead of the game by making one of the sleuths, an actual young woman.If you like Agatha Christie, you will like the book. I would recommend it as a fun read."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book I read and It was fascinating. Although I had a suspicion about who the real Mr Brown was, I would attribute it to having been subjected to countless detective movies and TV series."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"Let me start by saying I do like Agatha Christie, but this effort was quite weak. Problem? The Advesary isn't a secret! Halfway through the novel it becomes clear that the mystery person can only be one of two people. Typically A.C. makes things much more uncertain. I was dissappointed."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I always go back to this book when I feel a yearning to slip into English life via an Agatha Christie book. The characters, Tommy and Tuppence, are witty and charming, and will captivate instantly. These two young people meet after the war (WWI) in somewhat desperate straits- neither has a job, and each is facing the none-too-desirable notion that they will soon have to live with their families again. But they would rather have adventures.The romantic tension is light, but visible, as these two hatch out a plan to become Adventurers, and they meet adventure sooner than they realize. A name slipped out quite unconciously hurls them into the middle of international espionage, kidnapping, gang violence and more. Before they can blink, they are befriended by a rich American and a top British Government Intelligence agent, but who can they trust?The plot twists and turns adroitly, as only Agatha can write, leaving the reader wondering about the loyalties of every character, before laying out the final solution in a pulse-quickening final scene.Agatha Christie is known for her mysteries that leave readers guessing until the last chapter, and also for her depiction of English life from the 20's to the 70's, and this book has both of these. But this book is also a page-turning spy thriller, which you won't be able to put down until the very end.&lt;P"},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I can see why this book was free because, quite frankly, you'd have to pay me to read it again.Tuppence and Timothy, two friends who are very poor, hatch a plan over lunch to get some fast cash, even if that means doing something illegal. Somehow, they stumble into the midst of an international espionage ring, trying a find a secret message that could topple governments and start world wars.Sounds exciting and, yet, it just wasn't. This isn't a traditional mystery because there's really nothing for the reader to do--no brain cells required for this. Just sit quietly and read. This book was so long. It took forever for the thin plot to get going anywhere and most of the story just seemed so pointless. It finally starting picking up the pace a little more than halfway in and can honestly say I enjoyed that part. Alas, though, it was too brief of a moment to save my interest.Dame Christie, I'll just catch another series."},{"Title":"The secret adversary","review":"I don't believe Agatha Christie wrote this thing. It is totally a piece of junk. The beginning 4% of the book (that is how much I can carry on reading) are all about two losers babbling the most mundane conversation.

I can't make it any simpler than that, ya chowderheads.But to elaborate...the Gangster of Love provides us with the kind of advice we really need in the 20th century wars of romance. But will we listen to his wise counsel? He is a prophet without honor in his own country, a lonely voice crying out in the wilderness. Also, he has a strange fascination with the Harvey Keitel movie, &quot;The Bad Lieutenant&quot;. He does sympathize with the wounded, the outcast, and the lonely. Burned once too often, he understands your pain and wants to tell you, &quot;It's too late for me, save yourself.&quot; But you won't listen, will you? And so you're gonna take the fall.His material sorta reminds me of Hunter S. Thompson, but maybe that's just me.Sadly, other than this one book, I've never found any other evidence of the Gangster, though I've searched and searched. In these troubled times, we could use his insight.I'll just quote from the end of one of his replies to a reader inquiry to give you a taste of his work:'And crying's just not good enough anymore, is it? Not if no one hears it. Not if someone doesn't say, &quot;Please stop crying, I'm sorry I made you cry, I never want to see you cry again.&quot;And months and years really do matter now.

I read it from cover to cover in just a few days."},{"Title":"The General","review":"The novel \\"The General\\" is a war story of one man's rise through the British military as they face the Germans in Europe during World War 1. As the novel begins, Herbert Curzon is a subaltern in a British calvary unit in South Africa. Herbert is noticed for promotion, when he leads his unit down a trench and attacks the German flank, catching them unaware and winning the battle. This victory beings a meteoric rise for Curzon. For each battle he participates in, his superiors are wounded or killed off, thus causing him to ascend up the military ladder. This rise is further assisted, by his marriage to a Duke's daughter. Eventually, Curzon is promoted to Lieutenant-General and fighting in the trenches of Europe. It is here where C.S. Forester's writing comes in describing the old school tactics of trying to overwhelm the enemy with superior infantry numbers and prolonged bombardment by planes and artillery. It is amazing to see the tactics used and the stubborness of the British military as they continuously throw men at the German lines, in order to be mowed down my machine guns or be caught in barbed wire. And with each failure, the British command along with Curzon's advice, believe that all they need to succeed is to march more men at the Germans.\\"The General\\" was an informative novel about the thought processes of decisions made by the British military during the trench warfare of World War 1. And it is a story of one man's determination to rise and succeed at warfare, by using previous successful military tactics, that currently were wildly out of date. Even though a bit slow in parts, I enjoyed reading the novel, and was interested to see where Curzon's stubborness and thinking would eventually lead him."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This is the best anti-war novel I have ever read. It shows the creation of motivations for war and military action that come out of the personal issues of Generals and politicians. It underlines very clearly the massive destruction of lives as a brutal meaningless war (WWI)in the trenches went on for no reason except the personal ambitions of generals and politiians."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This relatively slim volume is in fact a great story with universal lessons for all. \\"The General\\" ranks as high as a general in teaching lessons about how lessons ought to be taught to our leaders, political and military."},{"Title":"The General","review":"Not one of Forester's best. It is clear that Forester has an agenda, and this agenda gets in the way of the story-telling. But the strikingly odd thing is that what he tells you and what he shows you are different. Forester tells the reader that Curzon is old-fashioned, militarily; that he still believes in cavalry charges and that he disdains modern weapons such as machine guns. What he shows, on the other hand, is Curzon fighting dismounted, making effective use of those new-fangled weapons he so dislikes. He might not like modern methods of war, but he is smart enough to know that they can't be ignored. He is not the stupid, antiquated luddite he is described as.Despite that flaw, it is a good, entertaining story. In some ways it puts me in mind ofThe Life and Death of Colonel Blimp."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I know that this N&A edition is priced high but I payed the $25.95 here at Amazon and I was not disappointed. The General is one of the best war books I've ever read. It tells the tale of Herbert Curzon as he rises through the ranks to being a general in the British military. It's brilliant in revealing the world, social and political, of WWI Britain. One admires \\"old-school\\" Curzon and those like him and yet one is also shocked at the inadequacy of \\"old-school\\" tactics and their results. This book is gritty and polished, much like the British officers it illustrates. The war bits are very good though tragic. I had read The African Queen and disliked it. This is the second book of Forester's that I've read and I thought it was brilliant."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I live in England and read evey CSF book I could find 20 years ago. Whenever I visited the local public library I had several authors I knew would entertain me. Fleming, AJ Cronin, and my favourite, CS Forester. His Hornblower books are exciting, but his other books are just as as well written and enjoyable (probably better, read The African Queen). I did a search on Amazon and found this book....The memories came flooding back.This book will teach you what it was like to be an upper crust, English gent in 1914. The bumbling ways we the British conducted ourselves in the The Great War. However, it will also tell you about how brave man can be.If you think Tyson is tough, well the General is tougher.READ IT. You will not be disappointed..."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I bless the day many years ago--in college, I think--when I found it in a bookstore quite by accident (for I am not a naval buff and have read none of the Hornblower novels.) It was out of print for many years, and I welcome it back.This is an anti-war novel written by a military historian who grieves over the way his country fought the Great War. It has parts which are hilariously funny (Curzon's courtship and marriage, the family he marries into, the wedding night (nothing graphic here, of course--Forester is a gentleman); it offers a scathing view of England's class system at work; it is dead right (is there a pun here?) in dealing with trench warfare.Buy it, savor it, re-read it. If you happen to teach, assign it to your students along with All Quiet on the Western Front. This is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"The General","review":"Forester is best known for his works of historical fiction with maritime themes. _The African Queen_ and the exceptionally wonderful Hornblower series are his best known works. _The General_ takes a completely different tack on multiple levels.- On a simple level, _The General_ is Forester's only foray into ground conflict. Herbert Curzon (the title character) is an &quot;old school&quot; cavalry man who is promoted (several times) during World War I and eventually has responsibility for large numbers of land forces: infantry, artillery, etc.- On a deeper level, I think that this is Forester's &quot;anti-war&quot; tome. His subtle, yet indelible, criticisms of the bloody trench-war tactics wielded by Generals who believed in honor through sacrifice. Millions of young lives were sacrificed in useless and ridiculous frontal assaults that benefited only the casket makers.Curzon is a mildly interesting character, consumed with his Generalship and taking only brief moments away from the war. During one such break, he meets his wife-to-be, the daughter of a Duke. His in-law peers are none too happy to have their daughter marrying &quot;beneath her&quot;.Without deeply analyzing Curzon's motives - which appear relatively pure - Forester makes it crystal clear that such social climbing had enormous benefits for one's military career. Curzon is portrayed as an honorable man. But he is not very bright, nor skilled tactically or strategically. He is exceptionally dutiful and is filled with a sense of honor at all cost. It is this belief among the British military leadership that leads to the needless deaths of so many.Curzon learns little during the course of his successful military career. The same tactics are employed over and over again with dismal results.I rate this book nine out of ten. If you haven't read Hornblower, you _must_ read the entire series first. It is not be missed. If you are already a Forester fan, read the _General_ for a completely different perspective on combat and the nature of conflict."},{"Title":"The General","review":"While most of the authors novels were set during the time of Napoleon, some were set at later times including the well known novel, \\"The African Queen,\\" and this lesser known novel, \\"The General,\\" both of which were set during World War I. It has often been said that generals plan tactics based on the last war. Napoleon had developed tactics based on an artillery barrage followed by an attack by infantry and cavalry. The British Army was still trying to use those tactics at the start of World War I, ignoring the change in armaments which included the introduction of machine guns.Herbert Curzon is an officer from the old school, entering World War I in command of a lancer regiment, expecting to charge the enemy on horseback. Command of machine guns had been relegated to a lieutenant \\"who did not sit a horse very well,\\" and most officers did not study the tactics of their use. They did not expect to fight on foot, and did not carry entrenching tools. The machine guns quickly became the most critical part of the battle, and men had to dig in the best they could in the muddy ground.The British were slow to learn new tactics, and still adhered to the tactics developed by Napoleon well into the war. Curzon is given promotions, partly because he survives and impresses the War Office with his reputation for holding his positions, and partly because he marries the daughter of a Duke who has a position in the government. He rapidly rises to Lieutenant General and Corps commander. The novel ends when he is badly wounded trying to rally his men against a German offensive which is breaking the British lines.The novel illustrates the muddle that occurred during the war. Officers had little experience trying to handle the orders necessary for the movement of half a million men, and there was an insufficient number of experienced officers. Reserves were in the wrong place, roads became clogged preventing movement, officers had a fixation on large assaults across torn up ground that their own artillery had rendered impassible. It rained, turning land into swamps where the artillery had destroyed the drainage systems. Changes to tactics were very slow. Observations were by balloons and airplanes instead of cavalry patrols. Tanks were introduced, but too few, and not readily accepted by the generals.Hundreds of thousands of men were lost for little purpose. It is truly amazing that the government did not totally collapse, but they did not have the news media of our present day; and they had almost hysterical patriotism, with young women publicly shaming men who would not volunteer to go to the front.The novel ends halfway through the war, when Curzon is badly wounded.The novel was published in 1936. The forward indicates that it was used as a military manual in some countries."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I read 'the General' shortly after I finished Forester's 'Hornblower' novels and was pleased to find that the same depth and adventure that Forester brought to the British Navy of the 19th century he also brought to the bloody battlefields of WWI Europe. 'The General' lets us into the mind of a British General in the opening months of the war. Forester's protaganist reflects the mindset of those who conducted the war and allowed it to become the bloody mess that history remembers. An Amazing novel."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This is one of C.S. Forester's first novels about war, published in 1936 and hence pre-dating Hornblower.Like almost all the novels which Forester wrote before he created the Hornblower books, this is brilliant, far less well known today than it deserves, and consequently quite rare. The author H.G. Wells described \\"The General\\" as \\"a magnificent piece of work.\\"Some of Forester's other books, particularly those describing battles against opponents of whom he strongly disapproved of such as Hitler's nazis or indeed Napoleon, can come over as patriotic to the point of jingoism or chauvinism. This story does not come into that category and it would not be far from the truth to call it one of the first great anti-war novels.If you collect books about war, and you are fortunate enough to find a copy of \\"The General\\" for sale at a remotely reasonable price, buy it at once.This novel describes the military career of a fictional first world war general. It begins and ends between the wars, with a sharp pen-picture of the retired general Curzon sitting in a bathchair on Bournemouth Promenade, having lost his leg during the great war and never managed to learn to walk properly with an artificial one.Then the story goes back to Curzon's first battle as a subaltern in 1899 during the Boer war, and follows him through to the climax of the book at the battle of St Quentin on March 21st 1918 when the last desperate German offensive nearly snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.Forester appears to have set out to do three things; to entertain, inform, and explain. He entertains with an engaging story; he informs by describing the ghastly conditions and waste of life which was the first world war in the trenches; and he tries to explain one possible answer to the question of how British commanders could possibly have given the orders which sent hundreds of thousands of young men to their deaths.One of the most memorable passages in the book describes the debate as generals and senior staff officers of an army corps prepared a report of why the attack they had just organised had failed and how to succeed next time. \\"In some ways it was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed they were devising methods of applying more force still ... they could hardly be blamed for not guessing that by rotating the screw it would come out after the exertion of far less effort\\".But that does not mean that Forester is simply repeating the popular caricature of First World War generals as dangerous idiots. Although he is critical of the mistakes of the generals who wasted so many lives, his criticism is far more sophisticated than the old \\"Lions led by donkeys\\" cliche.Although Curzon, the central figure of this book, is old fashioned and conventional, he is intelligent enough to change his mind when confronted with clear evidence of the need to do so, and decisive enough to enforce that change of mind on others when many men would freeze in panic. Had he been as stupid as some reviewers make out, Curzon would not have survived the first few months of World War 1, let alone been rapidly promoted.He is intelligent enough to realise that his men need to eat and to make sure that they are fed properly, and to make use of officers who understand newfangled things like engineering, railways, or how many men it takes to carry a gas canister. He is ruthless enough to sack staff officers who are not up to the job even when one of them is his wife's cousin.Within minutes of arriving at the front and seeing what artillery and machine-guns can do, Curzon abandons his pre-war attitude of deliberately evading training on how to dig trenches, and instead orders his men to dig for their lives, demanding compliance from junior officers who are afraid that the men might get dirt on their uniforms. \\"God damn it, man!\\" he explodes, \\"Get your men digging, and don't ask damn fool questions.\\"In the first round of battles in the Great War, heroic efforts from Curzon in the face of greatly superior german numbers prevent the British from being flanked and probably defeated at the First Battle of Ypres. Having fought with distinction up to this point, he is promoted to much more senior positions. But then things start to go wrong.Forester makes a great many good points about the need to use the tactics which will win the current battle rather than the last war: indeed, that even the tactics which won earlier battles of the current war should be dropped if they are out of date. But that is not the only message he is trying to put over.The main theme of \\"The General\\" is a World War One version of the Peter Principle. The very qualities which make Curzon successful on the battlefield up to and including the command of a brigade have disastrous consequences for England when he is a Lieutenant-General commanding an army corps, and when both he and all the other senior officers of the army are still displaying the characteristics which colonels and brigadiers need to hold their regiments in the line.Forester states quite explicitly in the book that the very strengths of the World War One generals, not just their weaknesses, were part of the problem. I quote - \\"It might have been ... more advantageous to England if the British Army had not been quite so full of men of high rank who were so ready for responsibility, so unflinchingly devoted to their duty, so unmoved in the face of difficulties, of such unfaltering courage.\\"This book is an unforgettable classic."},{"Title":"The General","review":"Forester's main character, Gen Curzon, is from the old school, where one does not question orders, nor does one make waves. That being said, from a military leadership perspective, if one has a method, even if it doesnt work, it will continued to be used time and time again. Curzon's character is a representation of the level of British generalship in WWI. Unyielding, unimaginative, and willing to toe the line at all costs, with the blood and treasure of England.The story has a humor woven throughout the narrative. It looks at Curzon's social climbing, his promotions (through no fault of his own, and his old school belief system. If it werent for the tradgedy of the hundred of thousands of lives which were expended based on the unimaginative battle techniques, it would be a very humorous story. Unfortunately, the death toll of WWI is a sobering reminder, thanks to Forester, of the repercussions of Generalship as displayed by Curzon.HIghly recommended. An excellent insight into the class structure of the British Army of WWI."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I love C.S. Forester's writing, but this one isn't particularly well-done on his part. He is trying to convey the hubris of the old British Regular Army in WWI, and in a sense he achieves his goal. But the main character is pretty unlovable, and the points Forester sets out to make are done at the end of a sledgehammer. If you're interested in Forester's work, try 'The African Queen' or 'The Gun' and leave this one for Forester aficionados"},{"Title":"The General","review":"This was one of the best books that I've read in a couple of years.

If you want an accurate look at the British military between the World Wars this is a nice read."},{"Title":"Imperial Overstretch: George W. Bush and the Hubris of Empire","review":"Imperial Overstretch at first glance seems an odd title for a book about a nation that was founded in a revolution against an empire. Indeed, the principles upon which it was created were based on the democratic concepts of the Enlightenment. The United States of America was to be a republic whose ideology held the concepts of imperialism and colonialism to be anathema. The authors, however, in this concise, well reasoned, and well-documented book, present a compelling case for the fact that the US began its imperial growth virtually from its beginning.Empires have existed since the beginning of recorded history. As a civilization becomes successful, it grows, conquering new lands in hopes of increasing its wealth. Paul Kennedy described the organic process of the growth and decline of empires in his book The Rise and Fall of Great Powers. It is from Kennedy that the authors get the term imperial overstretch. As an empire grows, it expands its wealth and the military power needed to protect that wealth and to make new conquests. However, this process of growth contains the seeds of its own destruction. The larger the empire becomes, the more of its economic production is devoted to the military costs required to maintain and expand its power. At some point, the imperial power reaches overstretch and begins its decline as the cost of maintaining that power becomes more than the economy can sustain. Sustainable power ultimately results from a strong economy rather than a strong military.Roger Burbach and Jim Tarbell have applied this mode of analysis to the United States at the beginning of the Twenty-first century. Although the US does not have a colonial empire like Rome or Britain had, its military and economic hegemony translate into imperial power. The book shows how the current Bush administration in general, and the war in Iraq in particular, have pushed the nation into imperial overstretch and decline. The heart of this slim, eminently readable volume is an analysis of the Bush administration and the war in Iraq. It shows how the war is part of an attempt to establish US hegemony in the oil and gas rich areas of Southern Asia. It looks at how the Bush administration achieved power, and the incompetent way it has abused that power, especially in Iraq. It gained power with the support of an unprecedented fund raising apparatus among the ranks of corporate conservatives, especially in the energy industries, and a well-organized fundamentalist Christian right. Unfortunately the ability to gain political power does not guarantee the ability to govern effectively. Influence over decision making within the administration is tightly controlled by a group of hubristic neo-conservative and militarist zealots. The war on terrorism, and the war on Iraq, which the administration has dishonestly convinced the American public are one in the same, has been a series of arrogant, bad decisions that were disastrously executed.All of this has appeared in the media, but not enough of it in the mass media. The best selling books on the war in Iraq tend to focus on narrower subjects. Burbach and Tarbell have put it all together into a coherent analysis, which shows how and why it happened. It places the war into an historical context, and presents the likely economic results of the debacle. It is an important book that is essential reading for anyone who wants a comprehensive understanding of the war in Iraq and its likely outcome.It is easy to understand the tragedy of the Iraq war in terms of human suffering and wasted resources, but why should one be concerned about the decline of yet another imperial power? The United States gained its international hegemony after World War II, in no small measure due to the encouragement of its allies. At that time, it was responsible for roughly 50% of the world's economic output. But the Cold War was basically a series of wars of containment. The Bush administration has gone beyond that by trying to expand its imperial power through wars of preemption, with dangerous disregard to international institutions and alliances. The US has become a rogue nation. The international system that was created at the end of World War II is in danger of collapsing. (Bush to the UN: Vote with us or become irrelevant.) The dangers of war and terrorism have increased. Secondly, the US is still the world's largest economy, and the rest of the world depends on a healthy US economy. The trade deficit is currently about a half trillion dollars per year and growing, and the United States has a net debt obligation to the rest of the world of around three trillion dollars. Projections for the future are even bleaker. Most of this has been caused, as Kennedy suggests, by the military expenditures necessary to try to maintain global hegemony.Burbach and Tarbell, however, refuse to succumb to bleak depression. They find hope in such growing grassroots movements as environmentalism, anti-corporate-globalization, and anti-war. They see the ultimate solution as a fundamental change in our current capitalist system (something which they admit could take centuries). Unfortunately, neither the US nor the planet can afford to wait centuries. Something needs to be done now. What is required is a change of government to one willing to work within the international system to maintain peace and stop despoiling the environment. This is more than imperial decline. It may be our last chance to avoid global decline"},{"Title":"Imperial Overstretch: George W. Bush and the Hubris of Empire","review":"On the evening of 9/11, Bush told his cronies, \\"This is a great opportunity.\\" The US ruling class seized the chance to expand its empire.Its attack on Afghanistan killed more than 3,000 civilians and overthrew the Taliban government - which had not attacked the USA. It failed to get the Al Qaida leadership, which had attacked the USA. Then Bush, with Labour's support, attacked Iraq, which has never attacked the USA, killing, according to The Lancet\`s recent estimate, more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians, mostly women and children.The US occupation government in Iraq and its puppet have kept Saddam's labour laws banning some trade unions and forbidding all strikes. In June 2003, US troops stormed the Iraqi Workers' Federation of Trade Unions' offices and arrested its leaders.The authors trace the bones of empire in the drive for oil and bases. They describe the Bush crowd and Bush himself. They note the traditional US ruling class aim of \`scaring the hell out of the American people.' As ever, empire brings aggressive wars \`to prevent war', violent military occupations and vile war crimes.The US is indeed a giant with feet of clay. Its military forces are dispersed over 153 countries. Its leadership is pathetically inadequate to the impossibly huge tasks of running an empire. Its economy is overstretched. The government deficit was $375 billion last year, the trade deficit $435 billion, so Bush had to borrow $500 billion abroad. An empire in decline produces chaos at home and abroad.How do the authors suggest that we beat this empire? By building links between the campaigning environmental, peace and anti-globalisation groups, and by ever-bigger demonstrations and Forums! But occasional international contacts between activists change nothing. The endemic failures of the Second and Third Internationals prove this beyond doubt.Their approach is pure anarchism. It rejects working in trade unions and rejects workers' nationalism - it is a recipe for permanent subjection and defeat. Only solid working class politics, rooted in national trade unions, can defeat the capitalist classes who run the empires."},{"Title":"30 Days in the South Pacific: True Stories of Escape to Paradise","review":"I find it interesting that nobody has posted a review of this book. Perhaps they finish the book and immediatly leave for the South Pacific, they are all nibbling on lobster somewhere in the Marquesas, waiting for global warming to wash them to higher ground. Well, the South Pacific certainly conjurs up a picture in most minds of palm trees, scantily clad natives and warm tropical breezes. These stories will enforce some of these beliefs and dispel some of the others. Paradise is fairly elusive and the lack of civilization that is much of the draw of paradise can turn around and bite you in the posterior.I admit that I hand picked the stories initially reading some of my favorite island commentators, so I started with Laurence Shames, Thurston Clarke, Eugene Burdick, J. Maarten Troost and P.F Kluge. My favorite story was Eugene Burdick's \\"The Black & The White\\" an engaging tale of lessons learned in paradise. I will reveal nothing of the story, but it is a surprising tale from a different perspective.All in all the book relies on Islands magazine for a lot of the stories, so if you are a long time reader of the magazine, you will have read the majority of the stories. The stories are engaging and well constructed, hopefully your interest will be aroused and you will further investigate the region. The South Pacific is a wonderful place, much of it has changed very little in the last fifty years. My hope as a travelwriter that covers this region, is that the stories work as kindling, wetting your appetite to read more and eventually visit the region."},{"Title":"30 Days in the South Pacific: True Stories of Escape to Paradise","review":"Fun book!

John Henry Blunt was a learned and prolifically published divine, of an admirably high sense of purpose all too lacking these days, of the Church of England, back in that Church's better times (the 19th cent.). Unlike many of today's apologists Blunt truly was deeply educated and unquestionably orthodox, and although Blunt holds back nothing in his attacks of the worst of heretics and sectaries, he always does so with an elegance of style and rapier-like exercise of analysis and discernment that add all the more to the punch of his deeply considered arguments. His comments about the L.D.S. Mormons alone would make this book referring to, but there is so much more covered of man's religious diversity or outright folly. Tangy stuff, this is, and it has not lost its savour or its relevance!"},{"Title":"A Secret History","review":"I don't know, for some reason I was already doubting the validity of this book when I read the little bio of the author on the dust jacket describing Taylor as \\"the ultimate Beatles insider\\". It also said that \\"only one person knows exactly what was behind the Fab Four.\\" Please! Actually, only the four Beatles knew that and then only what was in their own individual minds. We are not a race of telepaths!I should right off tell you that Alistair worked for the Beatles or more correctly, their manager, for a period of years and then was fired and after not amounting to much in life after that is finally exposing all their secrets for the world to know! This book is packaged like a National Enquirer but the inside is quite tame.Taylor hired on to Brian Epsteins record store and discovered alongside Epstein those then scruffy, cursing, leather-clad teddy boys who would later become our suit wearing Fab Four playing in the Cavern Club. Alistair soon came to be called \\"Mr. Fix-it\\" by the Beatles and handled all the grub work of the group and Epstein. This book tells about his years with the Beatles, and offers nothing shocking but still is entertaining for some of the personal anecdotes. For example, one time when George Harrison wanted to look at a house, he disguises himself as a chauffeur while Taylor and Patti Harrison charade themselves as a married couple looking at mansions. It does offer glimpses at the personalities of all the Beatles but only in snatches.The Beatle that Taylor seemed to be closest to and gets the most attention in the book is Paul McCartney. Taylor makes a big deal of how Paul had to cry on his shoulder, literally after his break up with Jane Asher in the 60s. It is basically put on that Taylor was the only person Paul could turn to and there's a little too much self-satisfaction in his reaction to it. Look at me, I was there for a Beatle!Ringo is hardly even mentioned and is even insulted in my opinion. He seems to be characterized as dumb and just lucky to have landed in the band. John is seen as a genius while Paul is just a good songwriter. George, like Ringo, doesn't really appear in the book even though Alistair does mention that he could have been a good songwriter in his own right if he had stuck up for himself. I guess this erases the fact that towards the end he was writing better songs than Lennon or McCartney (Something/ Here Comes the Sun).I took a lot of this book with a grain of salt. It feels too much the work of a disgruntled ex-employee sometimes. Or the work of wounded friend who believes in the aftermath of rejection that he had a special connection with the Beatles when it seems as if he was just an acquaintance. With the packaging of the book, it seems like an exploitation. Sometimes, it almost feels like Taylor is going to say \\"If it hadn't been for me, the Beatles would never have existed.\\"It is not a secret history. I learned nothing new. Just heard some new stories about the boys personalities, but no new facts. But I did like it though. I welcome any new perspective, however biased, about the greatest group that has ever been....well, ever been to this point."},{"Title":"A Secret History","review":"I believe Alistair writes it as he remembers it. When facts here differ from other versions, I think he honestly believes what he tells in this book. Aside from Neil Aspinall and Mal Evans, he was probably the next closest insider to them from early to the end. He questions Peter Brown's version which is interesting to note. Much here is anecdotal and told in a conversational manner. It is true that there are not too many secrets revealed, but like other &quot;insider&quot; accounts,it does shed light on it all. Most interesting is how the Fabs refused his calls when Allen Klein gave him the ax. Oh, and Taylor co-authored &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; but is too humble to ask for his name as co-writer."},{"Title":"A Secret History","review":"I just finished reading this book and I must say I'm very impressed. Alistair has written a no-holds barred book about his history with the Beatles that is frank, controversial at times and just plain entertaining. While I'd say some of the things he claims are probably based on personal opinion versus fact, I think he's done so out of loyalty not only to the Beatles themselves, but to his employer and mentor, Brian Epstein. There are some amazing stories in there as only Brian's \\"Mr. Fixit\\" can tell, like the time John told him \\"buy me an island\\", to nightly late-night visits from a crying Paul McCartney after his break-up with Jane Asher. The story of \\"The Long & Winding Road\\" brought tears to my eyes, and I couldn't help but laugh out-loud at some of the things John said and did to him. Alistair was a very simple man, with simple needs and he only tells the stories he was there for. After he was \\"sacked\\" as the chairman of Apple, the book ends. I think he figured if it didn't happen to him, he had no right to talk about it.

If you are a fan of George Harrison or Ringo Starr, you will be disappointed as they are rarely mentioned individually."},{"Title":"A Secret History","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to know the other side of the Beatles. It is written in simple language and English colloquial terms and phrases which are very easily understandable. It is basically a rectification, as the author claims, of a considerable amount of myths or rumours about the Beatles and Brian Epstein, their manager. The author also described his personal relationship with Brian Epstein and the Beatles.As a personal assistant of Mr. Epstein, the author had first hand knowledge of the personality and daily affairs of his boss as well as the artists his boss was managing. That gave the author a certain amount of credibility in the account he made in the book and I have no reason to doubt otherwise. Overall, the author seemed to have an excellent working relationship with Mr. Epstein and the individual members of the Beatles. Nevertheless, he had committed the biggest mistake of being an employee of an institution- he did not merely consider himself as an employee, he became too personal with his boss (Mr. Epstein earlier and, following his death in 1967, the Beatles later) and even regarded, viewed and treated himslf as a close friend of his boss, particularly with Paul McCartney (as he claimed to be).That is very dangerous. A friend is a friend, a good friend is a good friend, a close friend is a close friend, but a boss is and always remains as a boss. You do not have a close friend who is also your boss and vice versa. It is also doubtful whether your boss will view and treat you as a friend, a good friend or a close friend even though you feel, claim or treat yourself to be so. Mind you, you work hard for your boss and make a living from the salary he pays you for your hard work. Your boss will not pay you a salary just because you are his friend, his good friend or his close friend. He pays you because you are worth to be his employee, and your ability as an employee is worth for the amount of pay and worth to be employed continuously. If you are not worth your pay, your salary will be cut. If you are not worth to be continuously employed, you are fired. It is as simple as that. Your boss will not stop firing you just because you think you are (or treat yourself to be) his friend, a good friend or a close friend. Being an employee, you must draw up for yourself a line not to cross from being an employee of someone to being too personal with that person. If you fail to do so or if you allow yourself to cross that line your judgment would be clouded resulting in your work messing up with your personal feelings.That would affect your work in an adverse manner, and will not be leading you to a successful (professional) career.If the author was careful enough not to have become or to have enabled or allowed himself to become a friend of his boss, he would not have had such a terrible resentment after being rejected and fired by the Beatles (and I believe he still bears a grudge against the Beatles considerably).My account sounds very cruel. Nevertheless we are living in a cruel commercial world and we must always protect ourselves and not allow our feelings from being hurt by anyone within our business circle."},{"Title":"Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost","review":"At the time this book was published, in 1988, it was an amusing and telling example of how much (or how little) could be deduced by forensic techniques from a putatively closed society. As such, it remains of interest in the 21st century, where there are still putatively closed regimes (Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea) that are rightly suspected of being up to mischief.By 1988, had a long record of uncovering mysteries in the Soviet Union, especially in their space program. His biggest coup was revealing the existence of \\"missing cosmonauts.\\"That tale was retold here, along with a fascinating retrieval of unreported news stories about mayhem in all walks of Soviet life. Some remain controversial, at least in benighted quarters, like the reactor failure at Chernobyl.Oberg concluded that while glasnost was real, it had not penetrated the Soviet military. \\"Uncovering Soviet Disasters\\" covers the period through late 1988. Subsequently, some military circles in Russia became more open, but on the whole his judgment then is good now.The importance of this to arms control is obvious. Oberg's book is valuable on this and several other levels. Not the least reason for reading it is that it's a good mystery.But nobody who reads this book will ever fly on a Russian airliner."},{"Title":"Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost","review":"When this book was written in 1987-1988, many of these mysteries were totally unknown and likely to remain so. But the collapse of the USSR in 1991 opened its secret archives and in many cases (such as the 1979 anthrax epidemic in sverdlovsk) made some chapters obsolete. Others -- such as dead cosmonauts, or the Antarctic station disaster, or aviation catastrophes (including the Korean Airlines 007 shoot-down and other border attacks on lost airliners as well as military reconnaissance planes), or especially the treatment of nuclear disasters -- provide still-relevant and still-useful insights into what was really happening inside the Soviet Union and what it can teach us about safety in our own lives.The book was well received at the time. Here are some examples.&quot;Oberg's book... fills gaps in our knowledge of recent Russian history. Well documented..., the book serves as a fine interim report on the effects of glasnost.&quot; NY Times -- also, EDITORS' CHOICE of &quot;recent books of particular interest&quot;. &quot;A remarkable job of detective work!&quot; [Nick Daniloff]. &quot;Highly recommended!&quot; [Library Journal]. &quot;A fascinating exploration... written with the flair of a detective novelist&quot; [American Library Association's BOOKLIST]. &quot;A clear, relaxed, journalistic style...

Understandably, the majority of these facts didn't find exposition in the Soviet media, especially before perestroika.... Silence, life shows us, forces us to repeat terrible mistakes. The unlearned lesson is a new armed landmine. Oberg argues: nobody can long succeed at keeping truth hidden. Information one way or another seeps out, it finds a way. But it's important that this occur more quickly.&quot; Ivan Illesh, in IZVESTIYA, p.6, &quot;Kak Eto Bylo (How It Was)&quot;, Moscow, Nov 13, 1989.That last review was particularly impressive, since it was from the former newspaper of the Soviet communist party, then reformed by glasnost, and reporting approvingly of Oberg's attempt to get the full truth out.You can visit the author's home page atwww.jamesoberg.comto see what else he's writing along these lines."},{"Title":"Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost","review":"I read this book thinking that it would bring forth some evidence to prove that some of the rumored Soviet disasters were more than just urban legends. Instead, the book was just chapter after chapter of &quot;An Unnamed source reported that an Unidentified plane (or boat or sub, etc.) crashed due to Uncertain causes at an Unknown location, killing an Undetermined number of fatalities.&quot; Then the logic is &quot;We said it happened, they said it didn't. This proves they are liars and always have been.&quot; It was a shame, because many of the stories would have been potentially interesting if there was some evidence demonstrating what actually happened. Too many maybes, probablys and most likelys in this one. Also, I'm wondering why the author was surprised that the Soviets didn't publicize military disasters, especially one that disabled their defense system for a while. I'm not sure if we'd be putting that on the front page of the Times, either. At least not willingly. Anyway, I would rate this one as a real disappointment, especially because I had very high hopes for it."},{"Title":"Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost","review":"I bought this at a second hand book shop for 1 ($2), I would not want to spend much more than that.The book suffers from two major problems; the date of publication and the author's journalistic style.Regarding the former, the book was published a few years before the collapse of the Soviet Union and now that the archives have been opened (to an extent), some of the chapters are inaccurate.The latter problem is the author's style. Oberg is a journalist and this is no academic text. The book has no referencing whatsoever, no foot noes, no bibliography and even no index - we simply do not know where Oberg got his information. Oberg also has a tendency to write in a hyperbolic fashion that seems more at home in a tabloid newspaper.These two problems combined mean we get a lot of speculation, guess work and unnamed 'sources'. Oberg simply doesn't know what happened in a lot of cases."},{"Title":"Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost","review":"After reading Oberg's excellent documentary/book, one must: FIRSTLY - emphatize with those thousands of well-meaning, country-serving people affected by their perfidious Government, One Party System and simply lousy Management.SECONDLY - wonder why we were stupid enough to enter with the same people into a demanding and dangerous venture such as the International Space Station. Maybe, after the International Space Station has been cancelled, there's another book for Jim Oberg to write."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"Some books excite you; some bore you; some interest you. This book embraces and engulfs you. It is impossible to imagine anyone reading it without both raging and exhulting. A wonderful, beautiful, searing book. The first paragraph (which I read to my students as an example of 'The Event That Most Changed My Life') will suck you in so far you'll read it with fury, passion, and an intensity that makes both most autobiography seem limp and most writing seem pale. Richard Rhodes is a fine writer, but this book is more than written. It is bled."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"I did not read this myself, but heard it read on a local FM station by Dick Estell - the &quot;RADIO READER&quot;. I could hardly wait for each day's half hour installment. As the heart-wrenching sorrow and confusion of abuse and abandonment of the author and his brother turned into rescue, trust and healing, this story kept me glued to the radio. Though out of print, it will be inspiring to anyone who loves to see the wonder of human helping human, and the spirit's ability to heal and overcome adversity."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"I read Hole in the World while writing the story of my own dismal childhood. It made me realize that mine wasn't as bad as I had thought, even though it was pretty bad. This is a shocking book, one that causes tears to fall thinking about this boy suffering at the hands of a stepmother while his father did nothing, abandoning his responsibilities as a father. It is shocking that school officials and neighbors didn't intervene. Hurray for Stanley's courage in going to the police. Most shocking of all is to know, from volunteer work I do now as a retiree, that this kind of abuse continues and, if anything, society is even less able now to stop it or cope with the effects on its victims."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"This is a moving memoire of Rhodes' abusive childhood and how he grew out of it but still carries much of it with him. He is such an exquisite writer that every page aches with anger and regret. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand what some foster children go through. One of America's best writers."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"This is a beautifully written memoir of childhood hardship, cruelty, and neglect. The author's candor and equanimity in examining a painful history is remarkable, as is the poignant outcome."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"This is a story that tells itself because the events are so riveting and the prose so clear, there is not need for embellishment. And although it's more or less a straightforward memoir/narrative, it culminates in a wonderful epiphany for any reader who is eager to learn how someone can turn personal tragedy and hardship into a life of contribution. Recommended for humanities, cultural studies, and social science teachers looking for a text that can actually teach the essence of what being human and its trials and adversities is all about. That it is 'unavailable' is truly a travesty."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"\\"A Hole in the World\\" was recommended to me by people that had read my memoir. I was astonished to see how much our childhoods were alike. Although my story involves being raised as an Old Order Mennonite, we both had childhoods filled with anguish and fear, the deprivation of a mother's love, and behaviors tailored to whatever you had to do to get through the day. And we both had an essential ingredient that helped us make it in life, and that was teachers that saw potential within us. Mr. Rhodes knew he had raw intelligence, and with the positive influence of his teachers, went on to become the successful writer and person we so greatly admire. He clearly cites his personal difficulties in his adult life for he did not know how to be a father, how to have a happy home. I think as the title of his book alludes, he will always have an ache that can't be filled. This is a book everyone should read for it shows the importance of good teachers and mentors. Their encouragement can say to a child that gets it no where else: You are somebody and you have value."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"Mr Rhodes' writing is clear as a pristine lake, to the bottom of which one can see, with all stones, underwater plants, fish and monsters visible in sharp outline. I could not put the book down; it made me weep; following his story made me feel both tenderness and horror, and led me to both healing of brokenness, and deeper sorrow for brokenness that can never heal."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"I devoured A Hole in the World on a long airplane ride, having been impressed by the author's classic \\"Making of the Atomic Bomb\\" many years ago. The book demonstrates how someone can channel a meager and then abusive childhood into becoming a writer of great sensitivity. At times the story reminded me of Angela's Ashes although the circumstances were different. You really feel and empathize with the children (Richard and Stanley) and wonder at the closed emotional state of their father to acquiesce to his second wife's treatment of his children, and then to (fortunately for them) lose them to state care. I found it significant that none of the adults who could infer the abuse of the boys by their behavior or appearance condition to the authorities. Congratulations to Richard Rhodes for the courage to tell this story; may it serve to remind parents of the paramount responsibility of nurturing the young lives put in their care by intent or accident, and to remind other adults of a communal responsibility towards vulnerable children."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"A tough story and also a cautiously encouraging read. Richard Rhodes abruptly drops us into a searing moment - the suicide of his mother in his childhood. I hesitate to write this as for most that sentence alone will stop further interest in the book or even this note I can only advise the book does reward the reader - not with a Hollywood ending but at least with a hopeful one. He and his brother end up in state care and fortunately at a farm privately endowed for boys under supervision.The book conveys the lack of reason or sense the world has for kids in these circumstance and the painful sense of going from certainty the world cares to one wrapped in confusion, times of immediate joys, moments of near perfect beauty and kindness all framed in harrowing questions of food, protection or lack of it, clothes, hunger. Then there is watching neighbors and classmates live in a parallel world that seem Disney like in comfort, heated rooms - alien assurance. These brothers can sometime visit and even find odd and unexpected times of shelter and good persons doing kind acts. The race is about a narrow line of how to survive and swing whatever odds when you are children toward light, safety and always food. It is also about giving up internally and then taking up another round at things through imagination, theft, self-destruction, reading, anger, trying to be kind. The brothers have different approaches to life and how to handle things. While they sometimes fail each other at crucial times each often is able to support the other.I am impressed with how candid the author is about the question of forgiveness, belief and the uneven steps one make as an adult - imagine a tree unbending itself and growing in any case. Read knowing this author is writing from a better point in the world. May others children of these events cannot write, sort and are not with us.Having lost a mother through sickness as a child and the tragic episode of watching our Dad drop into alcoholism when we were young, then foster care and also with fortunate interventions of good people this story rings - at times a bit close Richard confronts how twisted his own memories are as he tries to reconstruct his childhood - something the uneven pressure of the emotions and strange mix children have on reality almost certainly distort. The emotional beam that makes this work is knowing the author is writing as a an adult and he is writing - a measure of success right there. The good and sometimes funny moments are seemingly random but they are crucial to live this childhood - and to read it.The afterward is welcome in the anniversary edition.This is not a great book but it is a crucial one for anyone who has gone through foster or state care as a waypoint for sorting out their whole trajectory in life. It also reminds us to be thankful again for the kindness of strangers, relatives and this who take a careful second look and do what they can as people for children in these circumstances."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"I first read this book many years ago after seeing Mr. Rhodes do a television interview. Although it was very sad, it was a great story, as told only by someone who had lived through it. I have several of Mr. Rhodes books. All of them worth the read!"},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"This is a book about Richard Rhodes' childhood, complete with wicked stepmother, heroic brother who saves them both from almost certain death from starvation, biological father who chooses the wicked stepmother over the lives of his children, and redemption through the caring and love of many at an institution for children.I first discovered Richard Rhodes' by reading his follow-up book to this one, \\"Trying to Get Some Dignity: Stories of Triumph over Childhood Abuse.\\" I was sorely disappointed by that book due to its confusing organization, lack of clarity and organization--the reader was never sure who was who in the book. It was, dare I say, almost mean to the reader because of the effort it took to establish who was speaking. However, as Mr. Rhodes is a Pulitzer prize winner and this was a follow-up book, I decided to give this author another chance by reading \\"A Hole in the World.\\"In both books, Mr. Rhodes is generous with pictures, but he does something that drives me, as the reader, crazy. He puts no captions with the pictures. In \\"A Hole in the World,\\" he lists at the beginning of the book a list of the pictures so that when you come upon a picture (the pictures are scattered through the book) one has to turn to the front of the book to see who is in the picture. Would it have been too much trouble to caption the pictures on the pages where they appeared? As he did this in both books on this subject, it had to have been done on purpose.Not to discount the work involved in writing a book, any book, I am being generous with three stars. A writer should leave his reader in no doubt as to what he is trying to say, should not purposefully confuse his reader, and should strive for clarity. The writing here is superficial and lacks depth and self-knowledge, both qualities which should be mandatory when writing a memoir."},{"Title":"A Hole in the World: An American Boyhood","review":"I came to this book quite late, just finishing it a month ago. I read a few non-fiction books by the author and liked them quite a lot, so I grabbed this recently at my local Friends of the Library used book sale. Actually, since I am a domestic violence social worker, reading autobiographical accounts of various kinds of abuse experiences is part of my continuing education. Sad to say, I have read tales of abuse suffered in childhood which are even more disgusting than what Richard and his brother endured, and which lasted much longer than the two-plus years of horror the Rhodes kids experienced at the hands of a vicious stepmother. This is well-done, and the suffering depicted is probably understated...my sense is that Rhodes did not want to rub the readers' noses in his agony, but rather present a message that acting to protect the multitude of neglected and abused kids all around us sometimes does pay off in big ways. If you have an interest in the survival of a bad childhood, this one should be read, but probably would be even more powerful if paired with Dr. Laura Schlessinger's upcoming book, \\"Bad Childhood, Good Life\\" due to be published in January, 2006."},{"Title":"Clock Guide.

It would be nigh on to impossible to select my favorite from the many children's books she has illustrated. I think of the irreplaceable \\"Wizard of Oz\\" with a perky little Dorothy in her apron and red hat or the wonderful \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" with the rosy cheeked girl pushing the dreadful witch into an oven. One could go on and on. Each time I come across another book illustrated by Zwerger I think it's even better than what has come before.This Vienna born artist has a vision, I think, and she brings this to each of her works. She has been quoted as saying that her favorite authors are the Grimm Brothers, Charles Dickens, and Hans Christian Andersen. Yet, when she paints, she does not see these stories as they've been presented in the past but with a completely fresh approach. That's certainly true with her paintings for \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"Begin with the end papers, shiny reflections of water's depths and then our first view of the sea king's castle with its coral walls and shell roof - dwarfed by the immensity of the sea. Each full page painting is framed in white, adding to the pristine quality of the images. Sea shells and fish decorate margins. Zwerger brings both wit and understanding to her work; it's unlike any other and totally captivating.Surely, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the translation from the Danish by Anthea Bell. Here is no Disney mermaid, but the fully realized story as written by Andersen, full of wonder and hope.Yes, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" would make a wonderful gift, but you'd best buy two - one to keep and enjoy.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"Growing up, Disney's version of this story was probably my favorite movie. Id really never known that there was a book until I came across it in the library(which is silly, because this is something of a classic.)Reading this book rather enraged me. The ending is quite different from the Disney ending and I dont understand why they felt the need to change it. This is a lovely tale of unrequited love as well as failure and disapointment. Every story need not have a happy ending and unfortunately most children's tales do. Maybe Im a pessimist, but it seems that stories where everything works out in the end might be sending children the message of a perfect world where disapointment is out of the norm.I just wish there were more stories of this sort to give kids a more realistic view of their future, because they have to learn sooner or later."},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"I really loved this version of The Little Mermaid. It was very beautiful and sad at the same time. I loved the part where it was talking about each of the mermaid's 15th Birthday that they would go up to the serface and see what it was like. The book was sad in a way. It was when the little mermaid was talking to her grandmother and found out that they don't have a soul after they die. The part about the sea witch was kind of scary... but not. Though I didn't like how she had to cut the mermaid's tounge off. The mermaid does give up everything and her life... because the one whom she loved fell in love with another girl. You have to read this book for yourself. I really loved this book! I hope you will too!"},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"This is the true story of The Little Mermaid. Unlike the Disney version where she gets the prince, the mermaid dies of a broken heart when the Prince whose life she saved marries another. The tragedy of the ending is what made the original version so touching. A beautiful mermaid gives up her voice, her family, her life in the sea in order to be with the one she loves. The promise is the love and the soul of sacrifice. It was a love dependant on another, being the Prince, and the risks she took were considerable. When the Prince falls for the woman he thought rescued him at sea it is the end of the Little Mermaid's quest for eternity. But since she doesn't kill him and his new bride she gets what she wanted all along ... a soul ... and no longer needs the Prince to live as a spiritual being in eternity. Not only is the little mermaid free from the curse of the Sea Witch but she earns her soul on her own volition. The Prince was merely a conduit to her wish. It is more poignant this way since the little mermaid no longer needs to earn love from anyone except herself.[...]\\"Among the daughters of the air,\\" answered one of them. \\"A mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being. On the power of another hangs her eternal destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not possess an immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for themselves. We fly to warm countries, and cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the flowers to spread health and restoration. After we have striven for three hundred years to all the good in our power, we receive an immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind. You, poor little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing; you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit-world by your good deeds; and now, by striving for three hundred years in the same way, you may obtain an immortal soul.\\"The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun, and felt them, for the first time, filling with tears. On the ship, in which she had left the prince, there were life and noise; she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves. Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride, and fanned the prince, and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether.\\"After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the kingdom of heaven,\\" said she. \\"And we may even get there sooner,\\" whispered one of her companions. \\"Unseen we can enter the houses of men, where there are children, and for every day on which we find a good child, who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love, our time of probation is shortened. The child does not know, when we fly through the room, that we smile with joy at his good conduct, for we can count one year less of our three hundred years. But when we see a naughty or a wicked child, we shed tears of sorrow, and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial!\\""},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"Long before Disney created Ariel, Hans Christian Anderson created the real Little Mermaid. This book is a rare collector's edition, and an absolutely beautiful rendition of the original story. I love it!!"},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"If you're expecting anything like the Disney movie, you will find *very* little here. This story isn't even for little kids, since some parts are rather painful. In Disney's movie, Ariel had only to give up her voice. Here, the mermaid not only has to deal with that, but the witch also tells her that with every step she takes it will feel like knives stabbing into her feet, and even in some tellings of this story, bleed.The ending is a bit preachy, what with the fact that the little mermaid lacked a soul and could only earn one through good deeds and/or the happiness of children. I like this story, but it's also very bittersweet."},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"This is a very nice book. A very delightful story that is written in a style both classical and modern at once. This is basically the same Little Mermaid that most are familiar with (The old Disney movie). But this book does have its differences that are essentially evident. The pictures' realistic colors and proportions fit this story well. This was a well-put together story.I'll admit that it is my personal preference for books where this book loses a star. The Little Mermaid movie and book have always struck me as a tale with many moments of heavy sadness, and that turns me away. The fact that this book is a love-story with fantasy tie-ins doesn't help my attitude."},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"One shouldn't expect the cliche' in this book's artistic approach. It is original and understandable, making it possible for children and adults alike to have an image of Hans Christian Andersen's wording.

(She loves everything Little Mermaid)I opened the package and was pleasantly surprised with this book. It's a bit bigger than I expected, but its beautiful! The layout is like a children's story book, but even non-children can enjoy this fairly long story (long for a kids story). The book looks thin but its substantial material. The illustration paintings are just lovely. If you're considering buying a copy of the Little Mermaid, buy this one. You wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"PARADISE FERMENTING","review":"The title pretty much sums up my opinion of this book.

I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great novel, and to anyone who's never been to exotic locations but wishes he/she could go."},{"Title":"The Desire to Heal: A Doctor's Education in Empathy, Identity, and Poetry","review":"As a pre-med student, this book caught my interest because of its focus on the side of medicine that is internal to the physician: the medicine that works in a physician's heart and mind. Campo gives a poetic and well-constructed testimony of his struggles and triumphs in reconciling his personality with the world around him and the difference between simply wanting to practice medicine and having a &quot;desire to heal.&quot; I definitely recommend this to anyone with an intense desire to see the humanity of a field that is so often seen as something sterile and impersonal."},{"Title":"The Desire to Heal: A Doctor's Education in Empathy, Identity, and Poetry","review":"I almost didn't read this book. I was expecting a discourse on the healing power of the creative arts as an alternative therapy in medicine. Campo may write about that elsewhere, but not here. If anything, the book concerns the power of poetry for the physician in need of healing.Campo's book is part memoir, part polemic. Chiefly, it recounts his struggles to forge a single identiy as doctor, poet, Latino, and gay man. He articulates with considerable and painful clarity the many ways in which these separate identities have been in conflict. They seem finally to come together in his role as a physician to AIDS patients. But even in that there is conflict, both with the devastating nature of the disease and the efforts of managed health care to diminish his best efforts to fulfill his calling as a doctor.As memoir, his book retraces the steps of his life journey into his profession (at the time of the book's writing he is still a young doctor, in his early 30s). We meet his Cuban-American parents, learn of his middle class suburban background, and hear of his struggles of sexual identity, which produce in him intense shame, anger and fear. We follow him to Amherst, where he meets and falls in love with a fellow med student who becomes his life partner, and from there to residency in UCSF hospital in San Francisco. He describes his bout with suspected cancer, discovered after a skiing accident. And he tells of a patient, Gary, dying of AIDS, who teaches him much about being both a doctor and a poet.As polemic, his book argues against homophobia (even as he overcomes it in himself) and its contribution to the continuing health crisis for gay men. He argues that the catch phrase \\"safe sex\\" diminishes the fragile self-esteem and challenges the identities of gay men. He argues that modern medicine, with its reliance on technology and pharmaceuticals and insistence on professional objectivity, robs young doctors of the compassion, empathy, and desire that drew them into the profession in the first place -- and thus makes them less effective in the delivery of health care. And he argues for the legitimacy of poetry as both a practice and a guiding metaphor for the role of physician. He notes that poetry and healing are both arts; one informs and supports the other.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the practice of modern medicine, the training and self-education of physicians, and journeys of self-discovery. It is especially affirming in its embrace of same-sex affection, love, and passion. As companion volumes, I recommend two other books: Richard Rodriguez' memoir \\"Hunger of Memory\\" and Abraham Verghese's account of his experience as an AIDS doctor, \\"My Own Country.\\""},{"Title":"The Desire to Heal: A Doctor's Education in Empathy, Identity, and Poetry","review":"Eloquent, honest, beautiful. It's obvious Campo is a poet at heart, and that he brings his poet's sensibility to his life as a physician. Although the details of this book are personal and particular (his Cuban heritage, life as a gay man, experiences caring for AIDS patients at the height of the epidemic), Campo's observations are universal."},{"Title":"How to buy hearing aids with confidence","review":"Mr. and, I presume, Mrs. Groom have presented in an unbiased and clear way what a person needs to know to intelligently purchase hearing aids.

With a bias more towards history than economics, the book reads like storytelling sometimes, with less analysis than I had hoped for. The description of today's Brazilian economy is shorter than I had hoped for, but sufficient for a basic introduction.The book serves as reference as well for any historical fact affecting Brazil's economy, especially in the late 20th century."},{"Title":"The Brazilian Economy: Growth and Development 5th Edition","review":"This book has been one of my favorite resources in research on the economic development of Brazil. The book revisits what happened in Brazil from the turn of the century forward. This is imperative to appreciating and understanding why decisions were made the way they were made. It also gives fantastic details on what exactly happened with each new policy that was implemented. Most pieces fail to do this seemingly basic work. Quite a few pieces get caught up in the politics to the point that they provide unfair accounts of what happened. This book, though it provides some commentary on what happened in the political sense, primarily gives you the facts (data) and connects those facts, sans all the opinion and vibrato of other pieces.Thumbs up!!"},{"Title":"It's Quacking Time!","review":"This book is a great introduction to talk about a new addition to your family.

With failing health and too weak to write or type she dictated, what to her was a story that must be told. As she approached the project, she reminisces in the dedication, that she had the story in her head from start to finish, and it was actually a warranted way to take her mind off of her miseries and impending death.The story begins with the astonishing arrival of a woman who has been missing for well over two decades. From this moment on we are led down a path of injustice and redemption. The characters are so real you can feel their hearts beating from the pages of the book. Adverse as their lives are they find joy in each other and the simple moments of the day.I will miss this author, it is good to know that her works will live on for years to come. Kelsana 3/23/02"},{"Title":"The Silent Lady","review":"Set in London in the early twentieth century, as are many of Catherine Cookson's novels, this book tells the story of Irene Baindor, once a beautiful woman of high class and musical talent, who was mysteriously ejected from her home with the rich, powerful and dangerous Richard Baindor. The book begins with Irene showing up at the Armstrong law offices in a tattered coat and hat, looking like a street person, having disappeared many years ago and presumed to be dead.The book then back-tracks to uncover her past with Bella and their ragtag band of lads. Bella is a kind hearted but poor woman who helps out those worse off than she is by providing food and lodging for a pittance. She'll take in any decent person as long as they aren't violent or alcoholic. A mysterious, timid waif of a woman shows up in her yard looking like she had been homeless for a while. She is frightened, particularly of strange men, and almost mute, and Bella takes her in. She calls herself Reenee, but seems to have few memories or her past, and is often scared into a semi catatonic state. She proves to be a hard worker and becomes very dedicated to Bella and her lads and they gradually form a family of sorts.The years go by and the mystery of Reenee's past is never solved, until one day the name of Dr. Baindor is mentioned in her presence. She decides to visit the doctor, who turns out to be the son she hasn't seen since he was 4. As her memory gradually returns, and she is reunited with her son, the sad and awful truth of her destructive years with Richard is revealed.Bella is a loveable well-developed character, and the dichotomy of the richest and poorest classes is evident in this book as in other Cookson novels; however not enough of the inner thoughts and motivations of the main character, Reenee (the Silent Lady), are revealed until too late in the book to allow the reader to truly develop any empathy or understanding of her plight."},{"Title":"The Silent Lady","review":"In 1955 London, a woman in tattered clothing arrives at the law firm of Alexander Armstrong &amp; Son. The receptionist starts to toss the vagrant out, but hesitates when the woman mentions Mr. Armstrong by name and says she is Mrs. Baindor. The receptionist still has doubts, but informs a higher up who informs Alexander. Upon hearing the name, a stunned Alexander races out of his office to see the disheveled woman. He arranges for Mrs. Baindor to enter his sister's nursing home.Over twenty-six years ago, Irene Baindor vanished after a particularly nasty argument with her abusive spouse. Alexander has been looking for her ever since with no success until she arrived at his office wearing the same garb she wore over a quarter of a century ago. She holds a package in a death grip refusing to let it go, but his willing to cooperate on everything else as long as Alexander gets her son to visit her. Still, he wonders, as he has since she vanished, where she has been all this time?THE SILENT LADY is an exciting mystery that works quite well when readers glimpse the enigmatic Irene's abstruse past. However, the action bogs down when others pontificate with endless soliloquies. Irene is the key character whose past makes the story line hum when it centers on her, but when someone else like Alexander takes the stage, the plot loses momentum. Though she died in 1998, Catherine Cookson is still cooking those engaging early to mid twentieth century British relationship dramas that have made her a household name.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Silent Lady","review":"I think this was one of her best novels.

The book has so many photographs and discusses hoof anatomy so precisely that it has given me the knowledge and confidence to help bring a damaged hoof back to life. And there has not been a day that my horse has been sore on the hoof since! This book would be great for anyone with a horse with bad or sore feet, or someone who wants to learn about how beneficial it is for horses to go barefoot.

It explains everything (and in plain language) from hoof balance and hoof \\"reading\\" to why to go barefoot in the first place. It also touches on other reasons that may contribute to hoof lameness. It has been an eye opener. Even in Equine massage/rebalancing I knew the hoof could affect my job, but to such an extent - I had no idea!! I think every horse owner whether they prefer to shoe or not should at least read this."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This is the best hoof care book I've ever read. It is both clear and persuasive.When I became a horse owner in 1997, one of the great mysteries to me was hoof care. Everybody I talked to and everything I read told me something different. It took me a while to find a farrier I trusted, and two years later he had to give up his practice due to heath issues.About that time I attended a Clinton Anderson seminar in which he devoted almost a whole session to natural hoof care. He sang the praises of Pete Ramey. So I bought Pete's book.I was looking for a better understanding of hoof care in general, but I was also hoping to learn enough to start doing my own trimming. This book was a great help with both. Now for the first time I feel like I can look at my horse's feet and have some confidence that either they look like they're supposed to or I know what to do to make them better.I've been doing my own trimming for over a year now. Here's some advice for anyone who hopes to do the same. Ramey's book is not a beginner's guide. He assumes you already own farrier tools, know how to use them, and that you know how to stand while you pick up a horse's hoof.My advice is to start with just a $20 hoof rasp and some kind of a stand. I put a short piece of 4\\" PVC pipe on a wooden base, but an automotive jackstand or a real hoof stand would be better. Read the book, watch your farrier closely, ask lots of questions, and start applying what you've learned.In the beginning you won't get much done. You'll gain new respect for the difficulty of a farrier's job as you fight your horse and become exhausted before you finish the first hoof. If your horse wants to move, I find it helpful to do what Clinton Anderson calls \\"touch and rub\\" (or porcupine game in Parelli language) - cheerfully lead the horse away from the trimming area and have him turn little circles for a while, then lead him back to the trimming area and give him the option to stand quietly. Smile and repeat as necessary. At some point he will get it. The more frequently you go through the motions of trimming, the quicker your horse will learn to cooperate. My horse will stand quietly now without being tied.Even if your horse is an angel you will still become rapidly exhausted because you will be asking muscles to do something they've never done. So don't wait until it's time for the next trim before you pull out your rasp for the first time. Ramey recommends that you trim every four weeks, but I try to keep to a weekly schedule. Do what you can, concentrating on eliminating flare and maintaining a nice rolled edge on the hooves.If you miss several weeks you'll find it hard to catch up with just the rasp, and a good hoof nipper will set you back $40-$90, so you might want to call your farrier back and start over until you're satisfied you'll be doing all your own trimming. I shared the book with a friend who does his own trimming and learned a lot in a hurry by working with him.If Ramey ever comes my way with a seminar I'll try to attend. There's no substitute for being able to watch, ask questions, and get your hands dirty. Meanwhile, the book is a great resource. I think every horse owner should read it.Edit, 12/24/2009I bought some Clinton Anderson DVDs on the Black Friday sale. One of them was RFD TV Downunder Horsemanship episode 127, \\"Natural Hoofcare With Pete Ramey.\\" This 2007 one hour episode of Clinton's TV show features Pete Ramey doing natural trims on two horses, with commentary as he works. Ramey's book was written in 2000, and he's learned a lot in seven years. He has become much more conservative, removing less material initially, as experience has taught him that much of what he once achieved by carving comes naturally with time. The video retails for $19.99. If you really want to master natural trimming, buy Ramey's ten DVD set, \\"Under the Horse,\\" a full 20 hours of instruction for $250. He has additional DVDs available at [...]. But if you can't afford a $250 set of DVDs, the Downunder Horsemanship episode is an extremely helpful supplement to the book."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"I would suggest to anyone looking into natural hoof care for their horse, to buy this book.

He is absolutely astounding! Truly cares about horses and has a wealth of knowledge. He presents his own education/experiences in a matter of fact way and will also let people known when he doesn't know something. A very rare thing to have happen especially in the farrier community.I have grown to a better horse owner and hoof groom because of his book and his insights to natural hoof care.Not every horse can be fixed and many have long-term problems, but if you are looking for a possible solution to your horse's problem then this is the book to start out with."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This is by far the best book yet on the subject of barefoot hoof care.

After reading this book, I had an excellent understanding of how all the pieces of the barefoot puzzle fit together and what I needed to do to make it work for me. I read this book before going to a live 2 day clinic by Pete. He is the real thing and what he writes is honest and from his heart.

I highly recommend his seminar, especially for the \\"layman.\\" I Personally preferred reading this book first then proceeded onto reading Jaime Jacksons book next. I found that Pete gives a great overview, & Jaime goes a step further into greater detail.The only draw back that I find is the book is missing the before & after radiographs, which can probably attributed to a timing issue. However there are numerous radiographs posted on his web site. It is unfortunate they are not in the book because they really helped me to understand the mechanics of this, why it works & why traditional hoof care falls short.

(sorry)I think every horse owner should have a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"A really good trimming manual, teaching the basilar elements to understand barefoot trimming. On Pete's website you can find articles and updates to the book."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"I first heard of Natural hoof care through Joe Camp's book \\"The Soul of a Horse\\". I have had horses for years and boy was I blown away to finally understand what I was doing to my horses by putting shoes on them. I am an avid trail rider in the hills of Tennessee, so obviously going barefoot with a gaited horse, no less, seemed rather daunting. I ordered this book to better understand this whole concept. Pete Ramey's dedication to the wellness of all horses and his passion for learning all he can about the natural hoof of wild horses as well as natural care of horses pours through on every page. He presents the fundamentals of natural hoof care as well as the keeping and diet that is the necessary wholistic approach to \\"gravel crunching\\" hooves and a healthy horse, no matter what the horse is owned or used for. I had no knowledge of horse trimming or shoeing other than \\"watching\\" farriers - very good farriers - trim and shoe a horse. But Pete's book is written so comprehensively and so \\"in laymen\\" terms that readers will have no problem understanding. It is not a thick, complicated book, cumbersome in technicalities, but clean and simple just like the wild natural hooves he bases his studies on. The book is full of actual pictures from start to finish as well as diagrams that will lead even a doubtful reader (which I was) to the obvious truth. He was a \\"traditional\\" horse farrier and with humbleness shares what he used to think was correct to what he and Jaime Jackson (father and founder of natural horse and hoof care) have learned after years of studying wild horses. Suffice it to say that Pete has trimmed hundreds of horses and has never failed to bring a horse to soundness - (including many foundered horses and horses veterinarians suggested be put down) through what he teaches on these pages. The best money I have spent on horse stuff ever - and I have bought a LOT! Get it, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"Even if you shoe your horses this book has great information. It helped me understand what my horses hooves needed to do. We don't shoe our horses, and this has helped my boyfriend do a better job at taking care of our horses feet."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"Pete Ramey says he wrote this to give the practical advice not given in the \\"HOG\\" or Jackson's \\"Horse Owner's Guide...\\" I'm really glad he did, because I understand the Jackson book doesn't actually tell you how to trim hooves. Ramey's book does. It's not a thick book, but then it's not really (or at least shouldn't be) a difficult subject. Trimming hooves so that they will, given time and good nutrition and healthy exercise, grow into something nearly identical to the \\"wild horse model\\" is not rocket science. It takes a couple of years to learn how to nail on iron shoes professionally, and a couple of days to learn how to correct the problems those same shoes cause, using the very direct and straightforward advice here.I've read it twice and will read it probably twice more. It's clear, well illustrated, and very helpfully repetitive. The shapes and angles and techniques require a good dose of repetition before they soak in. Most horse people are used to seeing a post-farrier \\"perfect\\" (ha ha) foot shape that looks like it was popped out of a mold, and the curvy, swervy, rough and ready look of a naturally trimmed hoof takes some getting used to. But it's the beginning of a longer, healthier, happier life for your horse, of more years under the saddle, of better traction, less pain, and less disease and fewer visits from the vet. And you'll never ever have to worry again about a thrown shoe, except the old ones you throw in the garbage that last time they get pulled off.Go for it."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"Every horse owner and farrier should own Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You!! This wonderful book provides golden information about horse hooves, hoof care, and trimming. I had been trimming my naturally barefoot horses for a few years when I first read this book, but it quickly became an invaluable resource. The excellent guidance provided in the material and honest evaluations of natural trimming compliment the excellent trim photographs. The photo progressions helped me to see what Pete Ramey did with each situation. He shows foot trims of different breeds, and each hoof tells it's own story. I continue to refer to the book any time I have a new question about one of our horses' hooves."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This is one of the best books on horse hoof care ever made.

Full marks to him for admitting that he was wrong in the first place but the book is way overdue for re-writing. It has been demonstrated many times that the wrong approach to hoof trimming can lead to far more problems than it cures and using for reference a book that contains misleading information is a recipe for disaster."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"Great book. Great concept. A must for 'natural' horse care people. Would like to see more specific how-to in a chart or chapter."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"Ramey's book is a real eye opener. What he advocates goes against much of what I have been taught about hoof care. However, it makes more sense than traditional farriery and the results are nothing short of amazing.

Contrary to the review here he does not repudiate this book, but just feels it is very basic and he makes DVDs now instead of updating this book. We knew this before ordering and are still 100% happy with this book because we prefer written material.Also, on page 13 of this book it says:&#34;Reading the Horse Owners Guide to Natural Hoof Care is prerequisite to learning anything from this book.&#34;That book is by Jaime Jackson, so you might want to order them both together."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"I bought this book after being frustrated with my natural trimmer who was not helping my horse get better. The horse had locomotion issues and she (apparently) wasn't trimming her feet correctly in order to let her move the way nature intended.I read this book and trimmed my horse once and took her for a ride. She did wonderfully and was moving like a regular horse for the first time since I rescued her. This horse who had been fitted for hoof boots and I was basically told that was as good as I was going to get is on her way to a full recovery thanks to these trimming methods.Great book for the beginner?home trimmer.

Great information for the horse/donkey/mule owner as well as a farrier getting into natural hoof care."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"Good read if you are trying to get into doing your horses' feet on your own. I found it informative and a good way to decide if I want to continue with my education in this field."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"In reading this book I really appreciated the concise and verbally descriptive approach to taking care of your horse's feet. I feel confident after reading this book that I can take these steps and apply them in real life. In fact, I have and after a month of putting this information to good use I am impressed with the results. My horse now has absolutely no trouble handling gravel roads or basalt rock outcroppings. He has been barefoot for 6 years but due to improper trims aimed at preparing a horse's foot for a shoe, he has always felt a little tender on gravel roads. Now he opens up like never before. His feet are visibly tougher and his freedom in movement has improved. There is still more work to be done but nothing has been more rewarding for me than to prepare his feet for nature to really do its work.I am disappointed with the lack of quality in the accompanying photos within the book. The resolution, contrast, and overall lack of visual detail leave much to be desired. The photos are in black and white (I'm sure to cut down on the cost of the book) so to really study pictures of hoof models you would have to purchase/rent/borrow more material. That's not really a drawback since entering into this kind of lifestyle should require you to glean as much information from as many sources as possible in order to become as proficient a natural horseman as you can. If you are really interested in taking care of your horse's feet yourself don't expect your journey to stop here."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This is the Bible of natural hoof care and a must read for anyone who wants to go shoeless. It begins with the theory of going shoeless and then gives a step-by-step lesson on how to trim. There are certain steps that require photos to make the text understandable but instead you just have to read it over and over again and eventually you will grasp what is being said. The only photos are in black and white so it's sometimes hard to know what to focus on. However, if you take it slow and are conservative about rasping or cutting this book will help you figure it out without hurting your horse. Trimming is physically demanding on your back but it's not all that difficult. Removing the mystery and doing it yourself is also very empowering."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This book gave me all the information I needed about the care of hooves. My horse was diagnosed with navicular disease and I was told to put him in egg bar shoes with pads. I purchased Petes book and started my research on natural hoof care because I knew there had to be a better way. After reading Petes book and finding a natural hoof care speacialist in my area my horse is now out of the shoes and pads and walking just fine and ridable!! His hooves look amazing and are healthy, not smelly with thrush like they were with the pads and shoes. Both my horses are totally barefoot and always will be. Horses don't need shoes, just a good farrier."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"I've been trying to educate myself on the subject of natural hoof care, reading and asking questions of the farrier when she cames to trim my horses' feet, but I still know very little.I've looked at so many before and after photos, watched hoof trimmings, etc. but it's been one of those things where I hear an explanation but it's just not clicking. I just don't see what I'm supposed to be seeing, you know?This book actually gave me a couple of \\"clicks\\" of understanding. I wished that I'd gathered more from it than I did, but I'm happy for what I got. Not exactly a page turner, especially when you only partly understand what you're reading, but it may mean more to me as I learn more. I wish that the photos of before and after feet had been in color, but maybe that was by design?All in all, I'd say this is a down to earth book on natural hoof care."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This book is a great orientation and tutorial for introductory natural hoof caregivers. It does pre-suppose that you know the basic anatomy of the hoof, but other than that, Ramey uses easy to understand language and photographs/diagrams to illustrate the concepts.I would not recommend you go out and try a trimming after reading this book, but it does give you a basic idea of how natural hoof care works. Ramey does have a video/DVD series that is more comprehensive for those who want to learn natural trimming, which I also recommend. I STRONGLY advocate that anyone who wants to undertake this skill do so ONLY under the supervision of a skilled natural hoof care practitioner, as Ramey is very clear about \\"every hoof is different\\" and it is pretty easy to mess up your horse if you don't completely understand the skill involved.Bottom line: Read this book. Then, go on to read and study more. Tell your horse friends. You may help save a few equine lives!"},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This book should be in every horse owner's library.

I see no reason for my horses to ever wear horse shoes again."},{"Title":"Making Natural Hoof Care Work for You","review":"This book was invaluable to me when my own horse suffered a bad case of founder. I was lucky to have Pete trim my horse's feet at one of his clinics 8 months after her acute illness. This book helped me through the tough times when I doubted my horse would recover.

It's great! I like how the book has so many parts to it. In The Far Side of the Loch, the big excitement is Martha's relitives coming to Farlie, but in Down to the Bonny Glen, there are many different things going on. From Miss Norrie to Miss Crow, from Mrs. Sandy to Mrs. Gow, from Schorcha Gow to Annie Davis, and from Martha to Grisie, this book is wonderful! If you especially like Little House in the Highlands, you will almost certainly love Down to the Bonny Glen."},{"Title":"Down to the Bonny Glen (Martha Years)","review":"Beautifully written (like all little house books, even though this one is not by Laura). The Martha years are the first set of books in the little house series, Martha is Laura Ingalls great grandmother.

There is a wedding, new governesses, a flax harvest, and other events that add up to fun in this book. And, as usual, Martha finds a way to get into mischief in everything. Melissa Wiley has a marvelous ability to bring this time period to life for us. I enjoyed this book because it makes learning history fun by bringing it to life."},{"Title":"American Intervention in Greece, 1943-1949: A Study in Counterrevolution (Columbia Contemporary American History Series)","review":"One of the most important events in the beginning of the cold war was Harry Truman's demand for American support for the government of Greece in its war with pro-Communist guerillas. In fact, as Wittner shows, the history of the Greek civil war was far more complex than this. The Communist forces were not Soviet puppets. In fact, Stalin freely gave Greece to Churchill as a British sphere of influence. In fact, as a direct consequence of Chruchill's actions, the wartime resistance of the EAM was savagely and treacherously attacked by the Greek right, many of whom had been Nazi collaborators. Intimidation and electoral fraud made civil war inevitable and when the British had to leave in early 1947, the Americans had to take over. Wittner, relying on more than 75 sets of private papers, gives us many fine details on the process that lead to &quot;victory.&quot; The United States lied when it claimed it was looking for UN mediation. American officials approved of the exectution of Jehovah's Witnesses, and even denounced them as Communists. Greek military tribunals were so unjust that one American official was called to testify against two people accused of murdering him. Greek politics were crudely manipulated, economic injustice was ignored, and trade union elections overriden. And the consequence of this &quot;victory&quot; was the establishment of a psuedo-democratic government, and later dictatorship. Not until 1974 would Greece securely become the democratic republic it had wished to be when the war ended. This is a book no student of the period should ignore."},{"Title":"Realism in Our Time: Literature and the Class Struggle","review":"Lukacs' critique of modernism accurately reflects the socio-historical strictures of vulgar Marxism. All deviations from realist representations of \\"The Social Totality\\" are identified with bourgeois ideology, and are therefore mere acts of reification, ideology, or false consciousness. While not as dogmatic as the worst social realists, Lukacs has placed literature in an aesthetic straightjacket, which is probably why he misses the formal beauty of figures like Joyce, Kafka, or Beckett. While the essays in this volume represent an important contribution to the debate on realism within the critical theory tradition, one can't help but feel that something is fundamentally misguided in its approach. Although Lukacs is correct when he says that radical aesthetics is not equivalent to radical politics (the examples of aesthetic radicalism coupled with reactionary politics are too numerous to recount), it is nevertheless dangerously nave to castigate aesthetic experimentation in the name of revolutionary consciousness."},{"Title":"Relics","review":"Cruz accomplishes a great deal in her treatment of notable Relics of the Catholic Church.This is an easily dramatized subject, and the greatest contribution Cruz makes is to approach the Relics in a scholarly, matter-of-fact style that conveys the history and impact of the Relics without engaging in argument.Consequently, the book carries substantial value for those motivated in their Faith by material evidence. And yet there is simultaneous value for the more detached reader.Perhaps the clearest indication of the tone and style of the book is in the Introduction's quote from the biography of St. Gertrude the Great: &quot;If you desire to have some relics which will draw My Heart into yours, read My Passion, and meditate attentively on every word contained therein and it will be to you a true relic which will merit more graces for you than any other... thence you may know and be assured that the words which I uttered when on earth are the most precious relics which you can possess.&quot;It is clear throughout that Joan Carroll Cruz has taken this message to heart - approaching the Relics she describes with reverence, but with proper perspective."},{"Title":"Relics","review":"Relics provides an excellent introduction to the practice of relic veneration that is followed within the Catholic Church. After giving a brief background on the theological basis for the ritual, Cruz immerses the reader in stories about the various types of relics populating Catholic churches around the world. The result of this study is both interesting and educational.While the book is a valuable resource, it does suffer from being a bit dated. It was printed in 1984 and hasn't been revised since then. An updated version would allow the reader to learn recent developments in the verification of these relics, like the tests performed on the Shroud of Turin in the 1990s. By providing updated information, Cruz would give the reader a better basis to understand all aspects of this ritual.Even with this shortcoming, Relics is a good starting point for anyone wishing to learn more about Catholic relics and the devotion they inspire."},{"Title":"Relics","review":"A fascinating (almost encylopedia) account of the history, stories, mysticism, and veneration of Relics (including some photos) --- Relics of Jesus (Eucharistic miracles, Seamless Garments, Holy Grail, ...), the Passion (Holy Cross, Holy Shroud, Veil of Vernonica, ...), the Blessed Mother (Cincture, Veil, ...), Miraculous Icons and Statues of Our Lady (Czestochowa, Good Counsel, Guadalupe, Perpetual Help, Virgin of the Pillar ...), Apostles and Saints, Statues of the Infant Jesus, Crosses and Crucifixes, Buildings (Loreto, ...), Blood Miracles (Naples), Manna of the Saints.

It should be pointed out that Cruz's book was published in 1984 and it is written from a decidedly Latin Catholic perspective. With this in mind, Cruz's work is a very hand reference for brief summaries of the traditional histories of numerous different relics.\\"Relics\\" includes traditions for the whereabouts of relics of Christ's passion, such as the Holy Stairs, the Scourging Post, the Crown of Thorns, the Holy Cross, the Nails, the Title, the Holy Sponge, the Lance, the Shroud, the Grave Cloth and the Veil. There are also the traditions for Eucharistic miracles, the Manger, the Swaddling Cloth, Christ's Garments and the Holy Grail.Beyond relics associated directly with Jesus, this book contains traditions for relics related to Mary, such as her chair, veil, shroud, cincture and houses. There are also the traditions of other Biblical figures such as Lazarus, the Magi, Mary Magdalene and the traditions of the resting places for each of the Apostles and Evangelists.Finally, the book includes the histories of numerous miraculous images and statues of Mary and Jesus, and the stories of the relics of more than fifty different saints.Joan Carroll Cruz's \\"Relics\\" is a good starting point to learn about the traditional history of all of these venerated objects. The book is not exhaustive and most entries are no more than very brief summaries. I would however recommend this book to people looking for an introductory work on this topic.

Ms. Cruz is a diligent and competent researcher, and she brings together information on this arcane subject from a wide range of sources. I eventually found her credulity tiring, but not before I had read through the sections on the True Cross, Crown of Thorns, Holy Nails, Holy Sponge, Holy Shroud and Veil of Veronica. Having just returned from Italy, where I personally viewed what purported to be some of these items, I found her descriptions particularly interesting."},{"Title":"Relics","review":"Miss Cruz's book is easy to read.

While the focus of the book is on money management, the first half is spent in the description of developing a trading system, this so that the reader has a firm understanding of the system used as the example for the money management techniques discussed in the second half of the book. This first half however, has a number of &quot;big picture&quot; overviews of system design and testing strategies that I found to be very informative. The section on money management techniques was likewise informative in a &quot;big picture&quot; kind of way.I would highly recommend this book to beginning traders who are looking into system design, and to anyone who wants a broad overview of money management techniques. Given its limited length, there's a whole lot of good information here. The Author has filled the limited pages quite effeciently with ideas. On the other hand, if you are already familiar with such techniques as Maximum Adverse Excursion, Maximum Favorable Excursion, Drawdown Support, Fixed Fraction, and Optimal F techniques, you won't find anything new here.A couple of things to note:The Author is affiliated(or at least appears to be), with RINA Systems, and relies on data analysis using tools developed by that company. You might consider this book to be a bit of a house organ for that company, but this is not at all blatant and does not detract at all from the materials presented.I found the position sizing examples rather odd with abnormally large percentages allocated to individual trades in the examples. In fact, I rather expected this book to be primarilly devoted to position sizing, and this aspect of money management is only briefly touched on. Some would argue that position sizing is what money management is all about, this Authors definition howver covers such things as adding to existing positions, locating optimal stop points, etc."},{"Title":"Profit Strategies: Unlocking Trading Performance with Money Management","review":"I disagree with the dissenters!I usually find these Amazon customer reviews useful, especially the dissenters who rate a book poorly.

What is so insightful about the book is that it not only traces out some of the history of Reformed liturgy, especially times and places long-forgotten, but that it ends with chapter on the principles of our liturgy that need to be applied in our times and places.Chapter 1, \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" makes the case that there are two fonts of Reformed liturgical thought and practice: Zurich and Strasbourg. Unfortunately, as Hageman rightly points out, the Reformed churches ended up influenced more by Zurich than by Strasbourg.The Zurich paradigm for worship was the Medieval pronaus (also called the prone) service. The pronaus was the vestibule of the church, what we might call a lobby or narthex, but think much bigger. It was the first room you entered before entering the nave, or, sanctuary. The prone was a service in the vernacular that consisted of the Lord's Prayer, Ave Maria, a sermon on the Gospel lesson for the day, prayer, the Creed, the Decalogue, confession and absolution. As such, it preceded the Latin Mass. This service was used by the Evangelicals in Basel, Zurich, as well as by Luther in Wittenberg. As one can see, the \\"highpoint\\" of the service was the sermon.The Strasbourg paradigm was a liturgy of Word and Sacrament, following the historic liturgy of the Church. This was used by Bucer, adopted by Calvin, used with modification in Heidelberg, and taken en masse into the Book of Common Prayer. Yet, Hageman notes, our traditional affinity for Zurich shows itself in viewing the sermon as the highpoint of the service and \\"celebrating\\" infrequent communion more as a funeral than as a celebration.Chapter 2, \\"Into the Shadows,\\" traces Reformed liturgy from roughly 1650 to 1800. This era Hageman calls the \\"unexplored territory\\" of our history (36). Hageman's chapter is telling, as his thesis is that at the beginning of this period, every Reformed church had a fixed liturgy that was found in the songbooks and prayer books of the churches and was used without alteration. The Dutch Synod of Dort in 1580 stated, \\"We deem it entirely necessary that everyone abide by the form of prayers both before and after the sermon as it is given in the Catechism and that no one utter or compose prayers of his own\\" (47-48). Hageman gives a fascinating story of this reality from the end of the 17th century, in which a Dutch Reformed minister in New York recounts a 5-year old catechumen reciting the long pastoral prayer from memory before the congregation as part of her catechetical lesson (39). Hageman then moves into the Church of Scotland, which used John Knox's Book of Common Order without alteration or complaint against \\"liturgy.\\"This liturgical life of the churches entered the \\"shadows\\" under the influence of pietism. In the Dutch Reformed churches, the influence of men such as Labadie and Koelman was felt, as they taught against \\"formalism\\" and in favor of \\"free prayer.\\" As Hageman writes, under this pietist movement, a minister's ability to pray long, extemporaneous prayers was the mark of whether a man was qualified for the ministry by the mid-18th century. This also became the case in Germany, while in France and Switzerland, pietism did not make inroads until 19th century. One of Hageman's interesting side notes is that when the French Huguenots fled to America, they joined the Episcopal Church, and not the Presbyterian because of the influence of pietism in American Presbyterianism.Chapter 3, \\"The Gothic Age,\\" recounts some liturgical movements to return the Reformed churches to their roots. Hageman details the work of Ostervald in Neuchatel and Vallangin, France, and the liturgy their, which became the liturgy of the Huguenot congregation in Charleston, South Carolina (and which remains to this day). Hageman also details the work of George Bethune in New York among the Dutch Reformed in reviving its liturgy during a time of many members leaving for Anglicanism, Charles Baird among the Presbyterians, Bersier in France, and van Nest in Holland.Chapter 4, \\"The Liturgy Finds a Theology,\\" chronicles the work of Edward Irving and his influence. One place of influence was among the German Reformed churches in America, in the persons of John Williamson Nevin and Philip Schaff. Hageman quotes from the writings of these men, showing their theology of liturgy in which worship is objective as Christ works through the liturgy. Our subjective feelings do not make the liturgy more or less effective. Finally, Hageman moves to the Netherlands and the work of the Liturgical Circle and then the Worship Circle, in which men such as Abraham Kuyper sought to revive but also revise the Reformed liturgy in their land.Chapter 5, \\"Toward a Reformed Liturgic,\\" closes this fine book with some principles of Reformed worship. He intentionally does not give a specimen liturgy, but only articulates the theology behind such a liturgy. Although he does evidence his dissatisfaction for the Regulative Principle, this chapter is insightful. First, because of the Incarnation, Reformed liturgy is a Word and Sacrament liturgy. Second, because the liturgy is a Eucharistic liturgy, Reformed liturgy needs to be joyful. Third, because of the command \\"do this,\\" we are to be obedient to the Lord's pattern for the Eucharistic liturgy. Fourth, our Reformed theology must be a part of our liturgy. Hageman notes here that a study of our hymnals \\"could start enough heresy trials to keep [us] going a lifetime\\" (119). Our worship, then, must be Reformed in deed, not only in word. Fifth, the eschatological hope of the coming of the Lord must be evident. Here the classic Dutch Reformed liturgy of the Lord's Supper echoes in the ear (see the Psalter Hymnal for this liturgy).Overall, then, Hageman's book is a fine contribution to the literature on Reformed liturgy, and one that we need to let soak into our collective experience as pastors and parishioners."},{"Title":"Pulpit and Table","review":"The title of this book tricked me. I assumed it would be reflections on the two cornerstones of worship in the Reformed tradition--Word and Sacrament. But the subtitle: \\"Some Chapters in the History of Worship in the Reformed Churches,\\" explains what the book is really about, and in the end I was not disappointed. In five chapters, Hageman deals with the following topics:1 - The two main fountains from which Reformed liturgics arises, those being Zwingli and Calvin.2 - The period of Reformed orthodoxy and rationalism (post-Reformation through the Enlightenment).3 - The Medieval revival of the Romantic period (19th century).4 - The recovery of a properly Reformed view of the Lord's Supper, as represented by the Mercersburg movement in America, as well as related movements in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries.Using just enough detail vividly to illustrate his points without boring the reader, Hageman outlines the achievements and failures of those who shaped the worship of the Reformed churches in each of these periods. All this, however, is only a leadup to the final chapter, which is the finest in the book.5 - The title of the chapter is \\"Toward a Reformed Liturgic.\\" In it, Hageman summarizes the lessons to be gleaned from the previous four centuries of Reformed worship. In so doing, he focuses on the following factors, which in his view should inform the way Reformed churches structure their worship lives:- The biblical factor. Reformed churches have often been tempted to fall into a false dualism between spirit and matter, thus creating a false antithesis between Word and Sacrament. Hageman contends (and rightly, I think) that a church that loses one must eventually lose the other. So, as much as the Reformed churches must recover the centrality of the sacrament, as the Mercersburg theologians discovered, it is equally important that they recover the idea of the sermon as a mediation of Christ's presence, rather than a moralistic or exegetical treatise.- The Reformed factor. As Hageman says, \\"Cultus must express creed.\\" Thus, Reformed churches cannot simply borrow liturgical forms from other traditions regardless of what kind of theology is implicit in those forms. Borrowing from outside the tradition must be done in a thoughtful way. The Reformed factor dictates also that the liturgy must express the priesthood of all believers, so that the whole people of God may join with the minister in thanksgiving, praise, and intercession. In a similar way, Reformed worship must give a central place to the reading of the Bible, and the biblical text must determine the content of the sermon, not vice-versa. At the same time, the Reformed churches must never absolutize one particular liturgical form; after all, these are human responses to God's grace, not divinely prescribed archimedean levers.- The ecumenical factor. Reformed worship need not be narrow and parochial, but may and should borrow freely from what is truly catholic in the diverse traditions within the church. There is no need to be liturgically different just to be different. Also, Reformed churches must be conscious of the close relationship between liturgy and mission. The New Testament has but one word for worship and service, and Hageman thinks this is significant.It is difficult to find a fault with this book. If I had to point to one, it would be that Hageman shares the tendency of many 20th century Protestant theologians to look down on the theological thought of the period of orthodoxy. But Hageman mostly concentrates on the liturgical thought of that era, and he does manage to find a bright spot.That said, though, there is a lot of sober wisdom in this book. While I was in seminary, I was exposed to Hageman's liturgical thinking through the text of a talk he gave which is reprinted in Gregg Mast's book In Remembrance and Hope. This book expands on the same concepts. But in any case, if you are a student of Reformed worship and have never heard of Hageman at all, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Pulpit and Table","review":"During his lifetime, Dr. Hageman was the dean of Reformed Liturgics. His insights in this field have not been eclipsed. This work is a definitive book addressing the balance in reformed liturgy between sacraments and the proclamation of the Word in preaching.

I still think it is about what America is trying to offer the rest of the world, but now intellectual activity is so empty, it is easy to see that McFadden is right in his book Discovering the Comic, we apply sitcom expectations to how we few things, and the eleven-to-fifteen-year-old-student in the story is able to offer actual experiences to the young man who spent his life in school. TV laugh tracks help convince us that we are each a small part of a bunch of snickering idiots, and Morgan Moreen would be the best character in a sitcom at the most cultured level. McFadden mentions a shipwreck and a lifeboat in figuring out what the plot of the story turns out to be. Running out of money is funny in a way that makes Henry James a comic writer, according to the conclusions of Discovering the Comic."},{"Title":"Great Short Works of Henry James","review":"The Introduction by Dean Flower to GREAT SHORT WORKS OF HENRY JAMES contains one of the few misprints I found in the book. Instead of \`her,' the description of \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" which correctly states, \\"it is her ordeal to be the only one who sees\\" when the ghosts appear, then has \\"but here ordeal subtly changes into obsession.\\" (p. ix). In the story, \\"The Beast in the Jungle,\\" the word \`bankrupt' is given an extra r, so the list of things which the main character has not been branded by reads, \\"It wouldn't have been failure to be brankrupt, dishonoured, pilloried, hanged; it was failure not to be anything.\\" (p. 471).The characters in \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" are man and woman, concerned with an idea which she brings up when they finally meet again, \\"that again and again has made me think of you since; it was that tremendously hot day when we went to Sorrento, across the bay, for the breeze.\\" (p. 453). Mostly he had tried to remove the element of comedy from their conversation. \\"What he had asked of her had been simply at first not to laugh at him. She had beautifully not done so for ten years, and she was not doing so now.\\" (p. 455). He had furnished a deep sense of foreboding that he might be overwhelmed by something \\"possibly annihilating everything, striking at the root of all my world and leaving me to the consequences, however they shape themselves.\\" (p. 456). After ten years of thinking about how it might happen, she was brave enough to ask, \\"Isn't what you describe perhaps but the expectation--or at any rate the sense of danger, familiar to so many people--of falling in love?\\" (p. 456). Those who have fallen off the deep end in the other direction might have more ideas for weird movies than this story ends up with.On a more comic note, I think this book illustrates American ideas as being like a little girl who is expecting to be queen of the world, but when she is growing up, she discovers that she is only Daisy Miller. The story, \\"The Pupil,\\" might be a sign of how readily America could adopt the task of teaching the rest of the world America's democratic values, only to discover that the world doesn't want to be pandered to as much as it would like real support. Short works of Henry James amount to only six stories in 490 pages, ranging from 18,000 to 71,000 words each.I also have a book by Stephen Donadio called NIETZSCHE, HENRY JAMES, AND THE ARTISTIC WILL. Published in 1978, a major part of that book (pages 62-118) started me thinking about the relationship of \\"American Identity, Universal Culture, and the Unbounded Self.\\" Henry James was born a year before Nietzsche and lived to the middle of World War I, so their lives had some common elements, and Donadio had a lot to say about Ralph Waldo Emerson, who died in 1882, as someone who appeared to be one of the most advanced thinkers of the time to both Nietzsche and Henry James. Donadio's index lists four of the stories in GREAT SHORT WORKS OF HENRY JAMES, all but \\"Washington Square\\" and \\"The Aspern Papers.\\" He found a lot of interesting comments in the Prefaces of Henry James, notebooks, and other papers. Anyone who wants to gain familiarity with the actual works might start with GREAT SHORT WORKS OF HENRY JAMES, and it is good that one of the shortest of these stories, \\"Daisy Miller,\\" is first."},{"Title":"Fort Starke","review":"Westerns have loss their spot in the reading world and that is ashame.

While it predates the obvious comparison, think of this as a really, really dark and twisted Being John Malkovich without the ear tunnel.David Brooks was one of serial killer Dean Corll's two teenaged associates. As the book opens, Brooks has been in prison for some time, and has turned to puppetry as a form of art therapy. With the exception of a few closing pages, the entire story takes place at one of Brooks' puppet shows; Brooks has the audience (and us) read two pieces which he hasn't yet been able to conceptualize in puppetry yet, and plays out long scenes with the puppets at other times. (Note; don't take any of this, despite the historical accuracy of some of the characters, as accurate; it is Corll's other associate, Wayne Henley, who has become known for turning to art therapy in prison; his paintings are in demand on ebay.) Having now read a few of Cooper's novels, I have to say that the short form, I think, works somewhat better for him; \\"Jerk\\"'s brevity plays up the essential weirdness of the scenes Cooper creates, without ending up at an emotional state that comes off as overly world-weary.Nicely done, and a pretty good intro to the weird world of Dennis Cooper."},{"Title":"Jerk","review":"WARNING: THE TWO PUBLISHED VERSIONS OF JERK ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, BUT AMAZON HAS LINKED THEM (AND ITS KINDLE EDITION) SO THAT THEY SHARE THE SAME EDITORIAL REVIEWS AND CUSTOMER REVIEWS.Mr. Ledcke's complaint relates to the Kindle edition only.The Library Journal's editorial review and Mr. Beveridge's review relate to the Cooper/Blake edition (Artspace Books).THIS REVIEW RELATES TO THE COOPER/VIENNE/REHBERG ZAGZIG/DIS VOIR EDITION OF 2011.This package consists of a book and a CD. The CD is a fine recording of a theatre performance of the short story \\"Jerk\\", and runs 56 minutes long. The work is read alternately by Dennis Cooper (author) as narrator, and Jonathan Capdevielle as puppeteer/perpetrator. The reading style is appropriate to the detached and chilling nature of the story, and is complimented by a subtle and wonderfully evocative score by composer Peter Rehberg. The CD alone is easily worth the price of admission!The book is titled \\"Through Their Tears\\", and consists of photographs by Ms. Vienne, sequenced by Ms. Vienne and Mr. Cooper. This is a 64-page book of full-color photographs on heavy stock paper. The book contains no text (the story \\"Jerk\\" appears only as read on the CD). The book is designed to resonate with the CD recording, and consists mainly of photos of puppets apparently representing emotionally-shut-down teenaged androgynous boys of the type favored in Mr. Cooper's writings.Highly recommended for any Dennis Cooper fan, and well worth the price!"},{"Title":"Jerk","review":"Enjoyed the story but from the description it says that the book is over two hundred pages and in reality this story is less than thirty pages"},{"Title":"Jerk","review":"Shocking and graphic... yet quite moving.

Sometimes, it is nice to read a quick-flowing book as opposed to an exhaustive work. However, one can still learn from a novel like this: \\"Salvatore was careful not to get drawn into a real discussion or exchange of views... He remained non-committal until he had thoroughly cased the situation\\". Most people just talk, and talk...BUT the real guys allow you to continue speaking, so that you hang yourself with your own words.... They are the ones \`taking the backseat' so they can watch everything unveil.All the usual players are mentioned here: Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Frank Costello, Murder Inc. and much more... Having roots in East Harlem, I found it interesting to finally see a book with some mention of the 107th Street Mob, and the infamous \`Murder Stable' on 125th street as well. If you weren't born in the East Harlem neighborhood, you would never believe there was a stable located there with all kind of animals: horses, chickens, etc. If you could deem that much to be true, then it is another stretch to imagine that anybody who entered the \`Murder Stable' never came out alive.Lucky above all things was \`Sub-Rosa', acting below the radar at all times. This word is mentioned many times in the book. In the business of illegitimacy, you must be removed many times over to last as long as Luciano did in this \`world of corruption'. In addition, I would say you need a little bit of Luck as well. He made it known that his name was not to be used in the street. Lucky was way ahead of his time. He was more situated in the shadows then everyone we read about in the newspapers today. I was once told, \`Every generation loses a little something from the previous one' (that street-savy stemming from a unique education). When you add the fact that police authorities are much more sophisticated today, the result is a \`recipe for disaster'. If you're looking to live the life of a street hoodlum in today's society; the odds are stacked against you. The \`glory days' mentioned in this book are long gone, and they will never be seen again...One downfall to this publication is that you get the feeling of uncertainty with specific issues that arise in Lucky's life. Towards the end of the book especially, it assumes that Lucky had his hand in every major conspiracy around the globe. I think if the authors were able to tighten up the latter part of the book (after Lucky gets deported); the novel would have been a much better read. I would not consider this to be the definitive biography of Lucky Luciano. I don't know if one has been released yet.

The book is about Melanie Martin and her family's vacation; her mom Miranda and her dad Marc have some business in Spain so they bring their daughter Melanie and her son Matt with them. While they are there they make plans to see Miranda's old boy friend from Spain and his son Miguel, and Melanie meets Miguel's cousin.I like the book With Love from Spain Melanie Martin because it's about a girl I can relate to. For instance Melanie is ten and I'm ten; she's in fourth grade and I'm in fourth grade. She keeps a travel diary just like I do and we both travel a lot. I also like the book because Carol Weston includes interesting facts in the book. For example, Picasso painted the same painting many times in many different ways and they're all hanging up in a museum in Spain. I recommend the book for readers age 9 to 15.Ciao, [ch-ow]Carner Round"},{"Title":"With Love from Spain, Melanie Martin","review":"The Martin family band together for a two-week Spring break vacation as seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Melanie. Readers join Melanie through the pain and confusion of first love as she fills her senses with the compelling Spanish landscape. This is an amusing linguistic travel adventure written in diary format. Because the author phonetically spells the Spanish words Melanie learns, I found myself saying some of the words aloud and learning quite a few things along the way. An appendix of all the foreign words Ms. Weston used would have been an added benefit to the book.

They are such wonderful stories for my friends and I to cherish and pass on to our kids, and their kids, and their kids, and their kids..."},{"Title":"With Love from Spain, Melanie Martin","review":"Carol Weston has proven once again that she can entertain and educate at the same time. Her latest children's book, With Love From Spain, Melanie Martin, provides an amusing linguistic travel adventure for kids ages 8 and up. Adults will chuckle and relate to the main character of Melanie, who feels the pain and confusion of first love while filling her senses with the compelling Spanish landscape.The Martin family band together for a two-week Spring break vacation as seen through the eyes of eleven-year-old Melanie. The author offers her readers a consistent, even tone throughout the book. Melanie's sometimes childish, sometimes teenage view of the world sets the stage for all that the Martin family experiences. From art museums to foreign cuisine, the author takes the reader with her wherever she goes. An additional plus to the book is that she phonetically spells the Spanish words that the fictitious Melanie learns. I found myself saying some of the words aloud and learning quite a few things along the way. An appendix of all the foreign words Ms. Weston used would have been an added benefit to the book.You can almost smell the musty old four-hundred year-old paintings and taste the fresh pescado in the various bars and outdoor restaurants in which Melanie and her clan dine. One of my favorite lines in the book comes in the section \\"Angel's apartment, incredibly late\\". The author writes: \\"Spaniards don't believe in bedtime. They believe in nighttime.\\" The cultural differences are fascinating to the reader, made all the more real by Melanie's enthusiasm and joie de vivre.Luckily, Ms. Weston does not harp too long on the lovesick side of Melanie which could, to the adult reader, have become tiresome fairly quickly. Nonetheless, the reader is satisfied with the outcome of Melanie's relationship to the Spanish Migue who is 1 years her senior. Readers will be relieved to know that they can read more about Melanie and Miguel in the fourth book in the series: Melanie in Manhattan.With Love From Spain, Melanie Martin will make you want to take your kids on a European adventure of your own, no matter where you live in the world!

Although there are a few questions accompanying the &quot;procedures&quot; these do not probe deeply enough, in my opinion, and it would be quite possible for a student to perform the experiment and fill in all the blanks without understanding much of what s/he did. There are &quot;review&quot; sheets preceeding each experiment which touch on the theory, but again in a mechanical way. It does not seem to me that the experiments would provide any opportunity for creativity or real *experimentation* for students, and therefore the authors' goal of &quot;stimulating your interest in elecricity and electronics&quot; is unlikely to be met."},{"Title":"Electricity & Electronics: With Laboratory Activities (Study Guide With Laboratory Activities)","review":"Great service on delivery, product was everything it was advertised to be, would use provider again in future if they have something I need."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"This book was FANTASTIC!!! I am an avide reader, and can honestly say that the three books in this series were the best I have read in many years. I laughed and cried and sat up till the wee hours of the morning not wanting to put down these books. The storie put such an increadable spin on the King Arthur tails, and made me want to read everything I can find on the ancient Celts.The only negative thing I could say about the series is that it is probably more of a \\"Chic\\" book than something a guy would get into."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"This is a good book--even though it perpetuates the flaws seen in Woolley's previous Guinevere books, _Child of the Northern Spring_ and _Queen of the Summer Stars_. Woolley's Guinevere still has a habit of distancing herself from the story, briskly rattling off the legendary happenings like an anchorwoman for the Camelot Nightly News. Woolley's desire to tell the Arthurian legend without the use of \\"magic\\" or \\"fantasy\\" still results in cumbersome and byzantine plot devices as the author attempts to explain magical events without the magic. Her characters still borrow heavily from other authors--Cai is straight out of Phyllis Ann Karr, and Morgan is a twisted reflection of Bradley's Morgaine. But all of this aside, this is still a good book.In _The Legend in Autumn_, the dream of Camelot begins to fall apart. There are quarrels--Guinevere and Lancelot fight bitterly over Elaine of Carbonek, whom Lancelot accidentally slept with. And Mordred, whose best friend is a Saxon captive, comes to believe the Saxons are basically OK, and wants to include them in the Round Table--but Arthur, veteran of countless Saxon wars, holds his old prejudices dear, and refuses his son's request. And into this tumultuous court comes the young bard Taliesin, singing of the Grail, and the Round Table warriors begin to scatter to the four winds in search of the mysterious object.Woolley deftly describes the tale told by each returning knight; she does a great job of showing how the Grail means different things to different people, and what sort of meaning each man finds. (And woman, too, for Guinevere will find her own personal Grail by the end of the story.)Also wonderfully done was the treatment of Guinevere's punishment for adultery. The usual retelling shows Arthur standing by heartlessly as his Queen is sentenced to the stake, and Lancelot ruthlessly killing his friends to save her. Woolley has a more complicated but more believable theory about what reall happened behind the scenes, one that rings true to the characters of the brave Queen, the idealistic King, and the deadly but good-hearted knight. I won't give it away, but it's good.After Lancelot makes away with Guinevere, they flee to Joyous Gard, where they live simply and happily--until the threat of war looms. Guinevere is supported by the counsel of Isolde of Cornwall, who has grown wiser since her star-crossed love affair with Tristan, and together they see what must be done. Far from being the downfall of Camelot, Guinevere will now give her all to save it.This book ought to be remembered, above all, for its sensitive portrayal of the Arthur/Guinevere/Lancelot love triangle. Gwen and Lance truly have a love for the ages, but Gwen also shares a special bond with Arthur, which holds Camelot together more than they realize. Guinevere is the human touch that balances Arthur's ideals."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"It baffles me that my favourite series is out of print! This trilogy is refreshingly told from the perspective of Guinevere, starting with &quot;Child of the Northern Spring,&quot; continuing in &quot;Queen of the Summer Stars,&quot; and finally culminating in &quot;Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn.&quot; This book is fabulous, but to fully appreciate it, you must begin at the beginning. Persia Woolley's portrayal of Arthur's queen will have you laughing and crying through most of her life, so get this book! Don't be discouraged that it's out of print--it's wonderful!!!"},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"Ms. Woolley's conclusion of her trilogy is spellbinding and heartbreaking, following Gwen's life's journey in a clear and beautiful first-person narrative."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"This book was masterfully written,it matches up to the other two in her trilogy. This is my favorite aurthor. It has all of the romance and adventure, everyone should read all three of these books. She should recieve an award, Guinevere, Aurthor, and Lancealot are beautifully painted."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"In this third book of her trilogy about Arthur, Guinevere and the Knights of the Round Table, Persia Woolley ends the telling of her story. It is above all the story of the triangle that King Arthur, his Champion Lancelot and his Queen, Guinevere, are tangled in. Both men love Guinevere, but they also love each other as brothers and would do nothing to hurt each other. Guinevere, in her turn, loves them both. Arthur is her wedded husband, who honors her, takes her counsel and has her rule at his side. He cannot, however, express his love easily in words, as his emotions have been trained to be hidden from others. Lancelot is her true love, but one she is forbidden to have, for fear of hurting Arthur and tearing apart the kingdom.But even more than the love story, this is a story steeped in historical fact that gives the reader insight into the times. The reader learns of daily life with its proscribed tasks for each member of the royal household, the petty intrigues of court, the quest for adventures that periodically takes the Knights away. The rise of Christianity and its gradual erosion of the pagan religions is explored. The strength of family is evident, but betrayal for position is also common.The central theme is the trial of Guinevere for treason and adultery, her condemnation to death, and her rescue by Lancelot, aided by Arthur. Above all, each individual in this triangle is called by a love of country and the people, and will sacrifice whatever is needed to insure that the country survives as a strong entity. This book is recommended for readers of historical fiction. While it is the last in the trilogy, readers probably know enough of the story to enjoy this one as a stand-alone, but many will choose to then go back and read the first two to see how Woolley interprets the beginning of this magnificent saga."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"This is the final book in a trilogy and it picked up nicely where the earlier books left off. This book was the third in a trilogy about the legand of King Arthur and followed Guninevere's story to a nice conclusion (if you can call it that). The author told Guinevere's story using a modern perspective and did a nice job reconciling the Author v. Lancelot story. She presented Mordred's rebellion in a understandable way and knit the legand together in several ways. For any one interested King Arthur this is a must read."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"This trilogy is perhaps the most underrated and one of the best Arthurian trilogies out there. I found myself in tears at some of the parts in this beautiful last book of the series. Persia Woolley's writing has poetry and presence that you don't find very often. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"I have read many stories concerning the Arthurian Legends. One of those was The Mists of Avalon, which told the story of Arthur from the Goddess' point of view. Another was Mary Stewart's cycle of books on Merlin. But, Persia Woolley brings a fresh perspective to the Arthurian books, from the point of view of his Queen. I highly recommend this series of novels of Guinevere, for their sensitive treatment of this most wondrous of Queens. Before she was a queen, she was a woman. Many of us too easily forget that fact."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"I really enjoyed this book, as the final installment to the series.IN this valume, we see Camelot falling apart as the Grail Quest consumes the companions. Lancelot and Guinevere finally consummate their relationship.The relationship between Arthur ans Mordred, his son by Morgause, comes to a head, and the story ends as it usually does. But, this story makes it all fresh. Its morew realistic them MZBs story, without all the magic interfering. Don't get me wrong, MZBs book was, and still is,one of my favorites. But its nice to see a book(or trilogy) where for once, religion isnt such a large part. Its the people more at center stage. This book is more historical fiction then fantasy."},{"Title":"Guinevere: The Legend in Autumn","review":"I love reading the Arthurian Legends from a &quot;woman's point of view.&quot; I loved Mists of Avalon because of that feature, and I adored these books about Guinevere. I knew there had to be more to her than traditional Camelot portrayals! I am surprised the 3 books in this series are out of print. I was lucky enough to find the first 2 (Child of the Northern Spring one year and Queen of the Summer Stars the next year) in hardcover on a clearance book cart at 2 different locations! What a treat! I had to order this final one in paperback. Each time I got the next book I went back and re-read the previous one, until finally, when I bought Legend in Autumn I re-read all 3 one after the other. I was sorry to see it end.

She was founder of, and first president of the National Organization for Women (NOW). She also wroteFountain of Age,Life So Far: A Memoir,It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement, andBeyond Gender: The New Politics of Work and Family.She wrote in the \\"Acknowledgements\\" section of this 1981 book, \\"This book evolved slowly in my consciousness over the last ten years as I was involved in the exhilarating actions and the disturbing impasses of the women's movement, and as I was beginning to formulate, in my teaching, writing, and conversations with personal friends, the concepts of what I came to call the second stage... While my original sense that we must move now into the second stage came from my personal questions and observations of the conflicts of the young and not-so-young women, and men, trying to live in terms of first-stage feminism, the emergence of full-scale backlash with and after the Reagan election in 1980, when I was halfway through this book, gave enormous political immediacy to my task.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"Reviewing the history of the original feminnist movement and why it failed to alter the lives of most American women... the trouble was rooted in the movement's unwillingness to tackle the problems of the family. Most of the early American feminists were either young single women opposed to marriage and family or else married professional women who didn't have children or preferred to concentrate on loftier issues, such as the vote. They assumed that winning suffrage would automatically usher in equality and purify society... the only way that equality between the sexes could have been achieved was through a 'revolution in family life'... a revolution that the first feminists never attempted. And that is why the original feminist movement collapsed after the vote was won in 1920.\\" (Pg. 25)\\"...many feminists knew all along that the extremist rhetoric of sexual politics defied and denied the profound, complex human reality of the sexual, social, psychological, economic, yes, biological relationship between woman and man. It denied the reality of woman's own sexuality, her childbearing, her roots and life connection in the family. But our voice was drowned out, for a time, in the media, and even in the movement itself, by the more strident, titillating, angry and less politically risky message of sexual politics... It was easier to fulminate against the male chauvinist pig in your own bedroom and liberate yourself from the missionary position than to take the test for law school, get the union to fight for parenting leave or lobby the state legislature to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.\\" (Pg. 31-32)\\"For women to live their personal lives as a political scenario ... surely violates basic human needs for intimacy, sex, generation.\\" (Pg. 62-63)\\"...certain American and British feminists, pursuing more exotic sexual issues now that abortion and homosexuality were becoming banal, were launching a veritable crusade on clitoridectomy... Third World women rose up and told the American feminists to please lay off... they had more pressing problems to worry about right now, such as the fact that technological 'development' ... was taking away from women the chores in the field that used to give them some economic function and power.\\" (Pg. 163)\\"The public programs, which once seemed the solution if women and men are to share the joys and responsibilities of parenting, as they must now by necessity share the burdens of earning, are hardly conceivable in the face of political reaction, economic recession, inflation, unemployment and the energy crunch.\\" (Pg. 188)"},{"Title":"The Second Stage","review":"In 'The Femine Mystique' Betty Friedan told us that housewives were responsible for all the ills of modern society. Idle and underoccupied at home, we turned our malignant attentions to smothering our husbands and children with unwanted attention, meddling in their lives, making them miserable, and generally behaving in a thoroughly destructive manner.In this book however, she not only blames us for all the ills of modern soceity, she also tells us that we are to blame for the Trojan War, which personally I think is going a bit too far (apparently if Agamemnon, Menelaus etc had had career women for mothers, they would never have thought of going to war against Troy).Although in the Feminine Mystique she told us that housework was so easy it could be done in an hour, leaving plenty of time for women to have careers without troubling men for any help around the house, she here seems to have changed her mind, and tells us that men should help around the house, and indeed with childcare too (something she never troubles to mention at all in her first book, as far as I can remember). she is quite unrepentent about having said otherwise in her first book though, there is no \\"oops, I was wrong about that\\" or any such similar comment.However, despite the fact that she now acknowledges that the housewife's life is not quite as easy as she formerly suggested, she still doesn't like us much. The sentiment is, as far as I am concerned, reciprocated."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"The scientific accomplishments of James Clerk Maxwell are astounding! To think that he was able to accomplish so much in electromagnetism, optics, thermodynamics, etc., in so short a life boggles the mind. This biography is well done. The writing is clear and engaging, The various scientific explanations give a good indication of how Maxwell the scientist approached and solved physical problems. His charming personality and his wittiness stand out to give one a good overall impression of Maxwell the man. Notes at the end of the book provide added information on some issues discussed in the main text. Complete with an index and a bibliography, this book should be read by anyone interested in knowing more about one of the greatest, but less known, all-time giants of the scientific world."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"James Maxwell was a phenomenal, and perhaps underappreciated, scientist, and a wonderful person. Basil Mahon, who obviously loves Maxwell, has done a wonderful job of summarizing his life. Biographers of such prodigies have to avoid deluging their readers with too many details on the one hand, but on the other hand they have to avoid being so brief that their subject ultimately remains elusive to their readers.Mahon has done a masterfully dealt with this dilemna. By going through the more important stations in Maxwell's life, but always providing more detailed sources in the appendix, often with insightful critiques of these articles, he has opened a doorway to understanding the Maxwell's life and works. If you are looking for a good biography of Maxwell, or simply just a good book to stimulate your interest in science, for you or your children, I highly recommend this book.\\"He achieved greatness unequalled.\\" -- Max Planck"},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"James Clerk Maxwell is one of the greatest scientists not only because of his many great contributions but also because he inspired so many others who went on to become outstandingscientists. The impact of his work is so far-reaching that itis difficult to find the right words to describe it. Thus, itis rather curious that no major biographies of Maxwell have been published.This biography by Basil Mahon attempts to address this void.This is a good book that is enjoyable to read. James' strengths, both scientific and personal, are presented inan engaging style. But, one cannot but feel that, given the greatness of the subject, the biography is not as vast in scope as one might expect. This is a simple biography of a great man."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Certainly not only mainstream physics is not on the right track- see my review of The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, by his same father, Erwin Schrodinger- but history too.After reading this excellent biographical book by Basil Mahon, of the greatest physicist of all times, James Clerk Maxwell, who was not only that, but a great husband, a great son, a great friend and most importantly a great human being to whom mankind owes such a great deal. In effect why the great public and specially the young ones do not know such an example of a truly human being?But let me share with you in this review some of the points I have pointed out in my copy of this book:- James was invited to give a lecture at the Royal Institution on his work on colour vision...and so... The Royal Institution audience saw the world's first colour photograph.Pag93- He believed strongly in the power of subconscious thoughts to generate insights...pag94- James had shown how the electrical and magnetic forces which we experience could have their seat not in physical objects like magnets and wires but in energy stored in the space between and around the bodies.pag106- Light must consist of electromagnetic waves. Some of the great leaps in science have come when two sets of apparently different phenomena are explained by a single new theory...This was one such leap: at a stroke, he had united the old science of optics with the much newer one of electromagnetism...pag109- It was at this time, busy as he was with experiments... that Maxwell produced a paper which will remain forever one of the finest of all man's scientific accomplishment,A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field. Its boldness, originality and vision are breathtaking.pag119- The negative idea was negative feedback... He wrote a paper called On Governors. It was the first mathematical analysis of control systems and became the foundation of modern control theory.pag140- To James scientific facts were incomplete without the knowledge of how they came to be discovered.pag154- We know little of Katherine- James's wife-...Whether or not Katherine deserves her reputation... It is also clear that they were loyally devoted to one another, with a strong spiritual sense of union, that they always shared their deepest thoughts, and that James always put Katherine's welfare before his own.pag169- What is done by what I call myself is, I feel, done by something greater than myself in me...pag173Recently when I have been investigating about the Eastern Inner science of Taoism, I find it perplexing how the West has its own great Masters, and without such a difficult trayectory, but by concentrating the mind on the great ideals of science."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"This Biography of James Maxwell started off with an introduction of his surroundings. His surrounding's included his place of living, parents, and more. He grows up in a safe, free, and open enviroment. His father is in the field of law and has a pretty good source of income. His mother dies of afailed surgery but his father is still very supportive of him. Even though his father wants him to go in to the law field, James feels the urge of following his dreams of being a scientist. Other family members, and close friends cansee James's talent for mathmatics and they persuade James's father to let him study science. He goes to different schools, does very well, meets lots offriends, and succeeds in what he concentrates on. Even at a very young age, he experiments with his own theories and makes remarkable discoveries.I beleive this book has been one of the best scientist based biographies I have read. The format of the book was very logical and easy to follow. It did not jump around and was sequential like a story. Basil Mohan, I beleive, wrotethis book because James Maxwell was never really recognized for his work that he has done. He hasn't done any major, life changing work but he has affected the world of science and math. Most of his work was based of other mathmatician's work so he was never a big super scientist star. He did make corrections on previous works, simplified them, and wrote new updated formulas for out of date work. He did a lot of work with electromagnetic waves and found the basis of how to further technology which was based with electromagnetic waves.This book is very readable and that's why I suggest it to you. Even though it is a biograpghy of a scientist, he was a unique character. I have never heard of him and now I see that there are scientists in the world who's name might never be heard of. There is a very good flow between the chapters and I enjoyed what I learned. Also, the book had a very happy tone and story-like readability so if you would like to read a book that has historical reference yet interesting facts I suggest this book to you."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"\\"The Man who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell\\"Mahon is a suberb biographer, one of the finest currently in print. Biographies of notable people in history can be one dimensional; but a two dimensional approach is necessary when writing about a scientist. The author must not only convey the personal elements, but also explain his significant discoveries in greater detail. The critical balance is whether or not to emphasize the the personal elements and go soft on the science; or to emphasize the science in greater depth, yet somehow reveal the person behind the scientific mind. The second choice, to include more of the exactness of the scientific discoveries is the choice of author Basil Mahon.Mahon reveals James Clerk Maxwell through his science, rather then showing, by human anecdotes, a personality that eclipses the scientific accomplishments. Maxwell lived in the age when science was more fluid and generalized, not so specialized as it is today. That is why Maxwell, a mathematician, made discoveries in the nature of Light, Electricity and Magnetism, and also worked in astronomy.In fact, in the 1800's, the title \\"scientist\\" did not exist. The study of natural phenomena was placed in the ancient classification of \\"natural philosophy\\". Fledgling scientists in the mid 1800's typically were wealthy individuals who pursued science as a hobby. The Law and Clergy were fields drawing bright young men.Mahon tells of of Maxwell's formative years, and covers the years at Edinburgh University, and Cambridge in depth, and throughout these years, Maxwell is performing experiments of his own. His character was generous towards others. He was quiet amongst total strangers, and vocal and stimulating amongst groups of his friends. He got up at 2 AM each night, and jogged through his lodgings until 2:30 AM. Maxwell was in these years, and for the many thereafter, a prolific letter writer, confiding in many acquaintances and advising them on their personal and public matters."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Anyone who has taken college physics course, and even some who have only taken high school physics, should have been exposed to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and his work on the kinetic theory of gases. This book shows that Maxwell did much more. It shows how Maxwell thought and how he developed his great contributions to our understanding of the physical world. I particularly found the information on Maxwell's work on color to be most interesting as I was previously unaware of this work, or that he was a first rate experimentalist in addition to being a theorist. I was also interested to learn of his use of analogies and his belief that physics must be based on experimental results. Many of his contributions are explained, but only in general terms and without the use of mathematics (although a few equations are mentioned).This book discusses much more than Maxwell's physics as it covers his whole life. While Maxwell did not live an exciting life in the sense that most people use the word, he was excited by physics. He led a multifaceted life, holding several University positions and was involved with his estate at Glenair. The book discusses his family life, schooling, interactions with his classmates and teachers and his marriage.This is a fascinating and well rounded portrait of a man little known by those not interested in physics, but one whose contributions rank with those of Newton and Einstein. The book contains 16 pages of black and white photographs, clearly printed on glossy paper. It also contains a chronology or principle events in his life and a list of people who influenced his life. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of science and the development of some of the seminal ideas of physics."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"I have been reading Maxwell's original papers while having a go at electrodynamics and have been astonished at the clarity and beauty of his thought. While many undergraduates have encountered Maxwell's equations or Heaviside's reduction of them, few outside of the physics community know of him. I wanted to know more about this inspiring scientist. Mr. Mahon's clearly affectionate biography provided me with an eye-opening sense of the depth and breadth of this remarkable man. His biography examines several facets of his life and provides a sense of how widely his curiosity and accomplishments ranged. From early work on curves to a theory of color and a color diagram that has bearing on the RGB system used in computer and television screens, to the stability of the rings of Saturn to the kinetic theory of gases to the pinnacle of Maxwell's achievement, the \\"Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\\", Mr. Mahon clearly shows the genius of the man. In addition, though, the reader gets the sense that this was an exemplary man, who inspired those around him. Maxwell was that great rarity, a person of great accomplishment who retains an appropriate sense of humility and tentativeness regarding \\"underlying reality\\". That he was polymathic and was imbued with a keen appreciation of poetry and a sense of quiet mischief also becomes clear in this excellent biography. Maxwell was a Mensch.Why James Clerk Maxwell isn't held in higher regard, particularly in his home country, is a question that naturally comes to mind and Mr. Mahon provides some thought-provoking speculation as to why this might be. I wonder if a BBC production of Professor Maxwell's life would not, in addition to this biography, result in relieving this excessive quiet regarding the greatest scientist of the 19th century.Mr. Mahon provides a superb bibliography that serves as the basis for further reading about James Clerk Maxwell. Thank you, Mr. Mahon for this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"A great book written by obvious fan.Very easy to just pick up and read from start to end.I've always wanted to know more about this remarkable man, and after reading this book - well, he was even more remarkable than I realized.A modern scientist decades before the era of modern science. The author argues, reasonably persuasively, that Maxwell is the prototypical modern scientist in that his approach combined hard core maths with rigorous experiments (Hmmm. come to think of it, we seem to have lost that !)I also didn't realize the Maxwell's famous Equations were treated with disdain his peers and for a couple of decades later; right up to the point when Hertz actually discovered the traveling electromagnetic waves that the equations forecast.Can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"James Clerk Maxwell was an extraordinary man. From his quiet beginnings in Glenlair to the building of Cavendish Laboratories, James excelled in creativity, innovation and persistence. Beginning in the Edinburgh academy, James was constantly questioning the world around him, and often asked, \\"How does it work?\\". From generating the first standard measurements for electromagnetism using an ingenious mechanical apparatus, to creating the first color photograph and a system to produce any color on the spectrum, Maxwell was as focused as he was well rounded. Though he was faced with many challenges, some physical, some institutional, Maxwell was able to adapt and overcome resistance to his theories as he tackled newer and more challenging topics. His groundbreaking theories led to many things, including general relativity and a new form of science, stress analysis. He was inspired by almost everything, but most of all the world around him. Basil Mahon wrote this biography not to chronicle the events of Maxwell's life, but to shed light on his discoveries and contributions to science. By far, Maxwell is one of the top ten scientists, and came up with many things that today we take for granted. Yet, very little credit is give to him where it is due. Mahon wants to change this and expounds not only the details of his discoveries, but their implications as well. His book provides interesting insight in to the though processes behind some of the greatest theories of all time, linking all forms of electromagnetic radiation together. This book brings the reader in to the early days of science, when it was truly a gentlemen's pursuit, and filled with odd personalities, literature, odd contraptions and science experiments done at home."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"In the history of science there are only a few true human beings who used their genius in a humble and open fashion to uncover some of natures best kept secrets, while remaining true to their principles, friends and family. James Clerk Maxwell was one of these largely unsung heros.[ As was Paul Dirac who started his studies in Electrical Engineering some decades later]I recommend this book to all those engineering and science students interested in how a fundamental pillar of modern science and engineering, electromagnetics, actually came into being.One hopes that some of todays students will be able to follow in the footsteps of such a true scientist and well rounded human being as James Clerk Maxwell."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"As a manager, I have often heard of &#34;Maxwell's equations&#34; but have never understood where they fit into our scientific constellation.

I was absolutely transfixed by every word and stunning discovery this Genius was responsible for providing mankind. The best tribute I can pay Maxwell is, that in Einstein's office at Princeton hung a picture of Maxwell; he was thought so highly of by Einstein."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Basil Mahon has filled a void in my knowledge. In a very readable way he answered my questions about how Maxwell came up with his ideas about EM theory, colour vision and statistical mechanics. I also thank Mahon for describing what a fine person Maxwell was."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Interesting Book on How Maxwell started putting equations together as he found patterns in many Life Systems.. then kept improving his formulas over time... Also it covers his Background /Education, w/his Life doors, opening & closing thru many UK Educational Institutions. Fairly fast reading for a Math / Technical book.Maxwell wished to understand how the world cycles together, Thus he made fundamental Theories in most branches of physical science. i.e. discovering the nature of electromagnetic waves, so others could develop communications networks: television, radio, radar and the mobile telephone. He put together a first Colour RGB photograph plus introduced the system of thought experiments,His influence across all science fields is enormous. Many of his concepts were ahead of his time. Sometimes it took many years for others to confirm his Works.Universities and Science has always recognised Maxwell as a key contributor. Maxwell holds a unique position among them, inspiring both wonder and affection. In life, he was a blend of opposites - a serious human who saw fun everywhere, plus a \\"hopeless teacher\\" but who inspired myriad UK Eductors & his students."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The life of James Clerk Maxwell, by Basil Mahon, John Wiley, 2004, 248 ff.Maxwell's is not a name that is likely to be as familiar as those of other great scientists we learn about in school: Newton, Boyle, Hooke, Faraday, for example. This may be because following much of Maxwell's work requires university standard mathematics. However, in this fascinating biography that moves through the chapters of his life, this higher mathematics is mostly confined to the Notes.Maxwell was born in Edinburgh in 1831 and died at Cambridge in 1879 at age only 48. His study of philosophy at Edinburgh University stood him in good stead for his scientific work. He developed a great interest in geology, inspired no doubt by the work of those pioneer Scottish geologists Hutton, Geikie and Lyell. From this interest, Maxwell was one of the first to study glaciers and he invented the seismograph for the measurement of earthquakes. His interest in the properties of polarised light was stimulated by a visit to the workshop of Edinburgh optician, William Nicol. James already had three years at Edinburgh University behind him when he went to Cambridge University at only 19. At Trinity College he came under the tutelage of the famous polymath, William Whewell, as Master of the College. Here, as well as his academic studies, he wrote satirical poetry, \`much closer to W.S. Gilbert than Tom Lehrer', as Mahon puts it. This early background is engagingly told by Mahon.But it is for his papers on electromagnetism that Maxwell is best know. The fact that charges and magnets act on one another through space gave rise to two theories - the \`action-at-a-distance', like gravity, favoured by Newton, and the \`lines-of-force' theory advocated by Faraday. Maxwell resolved this controversy in favour of the latter. He also worked on diffusion in gases and a mathematical study of the nature of Saturn's rings, so the electromagnetic equations are only the most significant of his studies in a number of different fields of science. He helped to found the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge and he was a friend of Faraday's and also of William Thomson (later, Lord Kelvin).This is an interesting, informative and highly readable biography, though as it deals with some quite difficult scientific concepts, some background in maths and science is undoubtedly an advantage in getting the most out of it. There is perhaps too much room devoted to Maxwell's uninspiring poetry, but the book has a Chronology of Maxwell's life, a short Bibliography of related books, a couple of dozen pages of additional Notes, which include some of the more mathematically difficult stuff, and a good, detailed Index.Isaac Newton by James GleickThe Man Who Knew Too Much by Stephen InwoodThe Electric Life of Michael FaradayHoward Jones is the author of The World as Spirit"},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"If you have interest in any kind of Science, you'll love this book. But even if you're an Electrical Engineer, you will love it!It's a book about some important Science Discoveries in the mid-1800's... and James Clerk Maxwell, who was one of the prolific discoverers. Other names you've heard are also in this book, and how their lives & discoveries intertwined w/ those of Maxwell's.A definite THUMBS-UP!"},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"An excellent easy-reading account of Maxwell's life.After reading this book and discover all the fundamental work developed by Maxwell you can not help to wonder why he is less known than Newton or Einstein. He almost started all the new physics of the XX century but he is barely known beyond professional circles.In sumary, a worth-reading book even for non-science inclined persons."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"This book is a comprehensive look at the life of James Clerk Maxwell, one of the greatest physicists of all time. Although author Basil Mahon tried to explain Maxwell's work, the physics was still rather complicated. But the physics is not really the most important part of the book.Mahon gives us valuable insight into Maxwell's life; his early childhood, his curiosity, his important relationship with his father, and his premature death. Also interesting was Maxwell's relationship with Michael Faraday, the subject of a biography entitled \\"The Electric Life of Michael Faraday\\" by Alan Hirshfeld. While these two physicists never really worked together, Maxwell developed the mathematics that provided the theoretical backbone to Faraday's brilliant experimental work. Mahon also does a very good job of explaining Maxwell's place in history, with his discovery of the nature of electromagnetic radiation. Even the notes at the back of the book were interesting and I recommend that you keep a bookmark there for handy reference.Overall, this is quite a compelling book and I recommend it for anyone interested in the history of science. To gain the maximum benefit from this book I suggest that the reader first read the story of Faraday as a preamble to the life of James Clerk Maxwell."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"I applaud the author Basil Mahon for having written an intimate story of one of the great minds of all history. I knew Maxwell from my physics studies but had no idea of the range and depth of his impact in science. I particularly appreciated the effort the author invested in describing the complex but artifical mechanical models Maxwell had created to initially explain electromagnetism (although I felt he fell a bit short in recounting the transformational leap leading to \\"the Equations\\").All in all, the book presents a good balance between Maxwell the man and Maxwell the scientist. I walked away feeling as if I actually knew Maxwell and actually mourned his inevitable but too-early demise. As the pages dwindled I kept hoping there would be an alternative ending. This man had positively touched so many and had advanced several scientific fields so irreversably that I felt deep gratefulness for what he had achieved, as well as for the story Mahon had written."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"+++++Who wrote these poetic lines?\\"Trust me spring is very near,All the buds are swelling;All the glory of the yearIn those buds is dwelling.\\"The obvious answer is some famous poet. Right? Wrong! These are the lines in a poem written by a forgotten icon in science named James Clerk Maxwell (1831 to 1879). Learning that this great scientist was also a poet is just one of the facts you'll find in this extremely well organized, well-written, easy-to-read book authored by former engineer Basil Mahon.Even before plunging into the main narrative, I was impressed with the material beforehand.Take the table of contents. At a glance, I can tell you what happened anytime in Maxwell's life. For example, what happened between 1856 and 1860. I just have to glance at the table of contents. For chapter 6, it has the title \\"Saturn and Statistics: Aberdeen 1856-1860.\\" (Saturn is the sixth planet in our solar system.)There is also a \\"chronology\\" that lists the \\"principle events in Maxwell's life.\\" For instance, what significant event occurred in 1858? Answer at a glance: Maxwell was awarded the Adams' Prize for his essay \\"On the Stability of the Motion of Saturn's Rings.\\"As well, there is a \\"cast of characters.\\" That is, a summary outline of \\"Maxwell's relations and close friends\\" found throughout the book. For example, who was William Thompson (later Baron Kelvin)? Answer at a glance: He was a friend (and mentor of the early stages of Maxwell's career) and Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University.In his main narrative, Mahon tells us everything about Maxwell beginning with his early years and ending with his early death. We learn about his world-shaking scientific discoveries as well as about the man himself. With regards to this entire book, the publication \\"Nature\\" said it best:\\"not merely an absorbing account of Maxwell's life [but] an explanation of why his work is at the foundation of the modern world.\\"Mahon's main narrative shines with his last two chapters entitled \\"Last days\\" and \\"Maxwell's legacy\\" respectively.In the former case, we learn the actual words of a doctor treating him for his medical condition: \\"No man ever met death more consciously or more calmly.\\" (This is another bonus of Mahon's book in that he punctuates it with the actual words used by those who knew Maxwell or uses Maxwell's actual words.)In the latter case, we learn of Maxwell's extensive legacy. His achievements are too numerous to list but perhaps Einstein said it best:\\"One scientific epoch ended and another began with James Clerk Maxwell.\\"There are more than twenty black-and-white illustrations located in the center of this book. I found these interesting.You don't have to be a science wiz to read this book. However, it would be helpful to have some basic science background or have access to a good science dictionary if you want to fully understand the science parts of this book.Once you've finished reading the main narrative of this book, that's it. Well, no. The Notes gives some interesting information that did not make into the main narrative.Finally, I was surprised by two things:(1) Mahon did not mention the curious coincidence that the year in which Maxwell died (1879), was the same year that Einstein was born.(2) There was an electromagnetic unit named after Maxwell called, appropriately, the \\"maxwell\\" (symbol: Mx). It has been recently replaced by another name.In conclusion, this is a fascinating book that gives us insight into a neglected scientific icon. I'm glad this book gave me the opportunity to know a little about James Clerk Maxwell!!(first published 2003; list of illustrations; preface; acknowledgements; chronology; cast of characters; introduction; 12 chapters; main narrative 185 pages; notes; bibliography; index)+++++"},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"It is amazing that such a pivotal figure in physics remains relatively unknown to the public at large. I even asked a British friend of mine -- who actually went to Cambridge -- if he knew who James Clerk Maxwell was. He hadn't the foggiest.So it's a shame that this narrow biography (barely 190 pages of actual content -- excluding end-notes, etc.) does not deliver a more compelling picture of both the man and the scientist.A good biographer must do more than collect a series of chronological facts and array them in a sensible order; he must know how to tell a story. A science biographer has an even more daunting task -- he must tell the story of his subject while at the same time unraveling the wonder of scientific discovery. Mahon fails at both of these.Mahon's style is factual and competent, but he fails to convey any essence of the man himself. Who was James Clerk Maxwell? I know where he lived, where he taught, and what he did, but I have no greater insight whatsoever into what drove the man. What were his hopes, fears, ambitions?While it is possible that there was not enough historical source material to paint this picture, I highly doubt it. A prolific letter writer (by Mahon's own account), I would have appreciated far more quotes from Maxwell's own writings (both private and published). Anything -- realy -- to give greater insight into the man.Pehraps equally disappointing is the limited play that Mahon gives Maxwell's science. While he does provide a cursory view of some of Maxwell's greatest achievements, I believe he does not go deep enough. I admit that the topic of electromagentic field theory is complex, but a greater effort shoud have been made to explain how important this development was to the development of modern field theory. Oddly, Mahon spends time explaining Maxwell's equations (i.e., the meaning of the terms), but is not able to truly convey their beauty or importance to the layman. More importantly, Mahon fails to demonstrate exactly why the subject of his biography lives up to the book's title \\"The Man Who Changed Everything.\\"In many ways, James Clerk Maxwell's fame seems inversely proportional to his influence on the historical development of modern physics. So it's regrettable that it has been left to Mahon to write the modern biography of such a great man."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Maxwell was a man for all times; unassuming till the end, but always striving to research something, to help others, to understand nature and technology. There is no telling what other gems he might have uncovered if he had not died relatively young.The book does not mention Oliver Heaviside and other \\"maxwellians\\" who further interpreted and cleaned up his equations (from the nightmare quarternion to the practical vector spaces), but it is a tribute to his genius nonetheless. I enjoyed every page."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"When I started reading this book, I have seen something similar to the history of one of the greatest mathematicians, Euler.Euler and Maxwell were probably similar in several ways, they were true genius but still kept in contact with normal people and enjoyed life. Their fame is not proportional to their contributions, Maxwell and Euler are in the same category as men like Einstein, Newton, Da Vinci.Basil Mahon has done a great job of telling Maxwell life and presenting his contributions to science in a way that a lay person can understand. The great thing is that he presents the methods or models used by Maxwell to reach his conclusions. It makes easier for us to understand the thought process of a genius.Clearly Basil Mahon admired his subject, and by extension the reader will get involved."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Ever wonder what the rings of Saturn were made of and how they are stable? Maxwell made his prediction in 1859, (for added emphasis 1859!!!!) and was completely right! The Man Who Changed Everything is an excellent book if you are interested. It details the life of James Clerk Maxwell, perhaps one of the most important scientists of the 19th century, yet almost completely unknown. Most importantly Maxwell unified the theories of electricity and magnetism; he also advanced Kinetic gas theory, took the first color photograph, developed ways to analyze stress in a structure, and even laid the foundations of cybernetics. The book's style is easy to read but in depth both in detail and Maxwell's theories. I would highly recommend this book to someone with an interest in physics or anyone willing to learn about one of the greatest minds in science."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Unlike most science-related books, there were only a few pages within this biography that dealt with diagrams and equations. the majority of the novel consisted of stunning information regarding the life and mind of James Clerk Maxwell, who is often forgotten by the general public in favor of more prolific figures such as Joule and Farraday.Although I'll go as far to admit that as a high schooler, this type of literature is not my favorite, I was surprised to find that this book captivated by imagination and allowed insight not just into the work but into the mind of Maxwell. For research purposes, this book contains a very useful index for efficient and easy fact-finding. Furthermore, the technical diagrams and equations were explained very well, and with sufficient time and patience could be understood.Most amazing was Maxwell's life and career. His early entry into science and math (age 16) is both awesome and inspiring. Basil Mahon brings Maxwell's achievement into plain view with ease and language and an interesting style of writing so rarely found in science books today."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"For those of us hooked on science biographies, Mr. Mahon's take on Maxwell is an engaging work. The author weaves autobiographical detail smoothly into a story of critically important scientific discoveries (field theory, color theory). Like Kepler and Galileo before him, Maxwell saw no contradiction between science and faith. And while he was respected in his day, many of his most important theories were not proven until long after his death. Einstein credited Maxwell with laying the groundwork for his own seminal work."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"The scientific accomplishments of James Clerk Maxwell are astounding! To think that he was able to accomplish so much in electromagnetism, optics, thermodynamics, etc., in so short a life boggles the mind. This biography is well done. The writing is clear and engaging. The various scientific explanations give a good indication of how Maxwell the scientist approached and solved physical problems. His charming personality and his wittiness stand out to give one a good overall impression of Maxwell the man. Notes at the end of the book provide added information on some issues discussed in the main text. Complete with an index and a bibliography, this book should be read by anyone interested in knowing more about one of the greatest, yet less known, all-time giants of the scientific world."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"This is a quite thoroughly wonderful book. Among other things,it achieves the extraordinary feat of explaining Maxwell'scontributions in a way that's both entirely honest and entirelyclear even for lay readers. Then it transcends this feat bymaking the science not just clear but riveting. A lesser authormight have watered down the ideas to make them palatable;Mahon adds flavor instead.

What an achievement - a triumph!The author does a magnifcent job of showing the chronology of his life, his character, the current state of knowledge and the environment he inherited, gives us some insight into his thoughts, his insatible curiosity, his gift to apply mathematics to natural phenomema, and the significance of his work.I read one review that was unhappy that it didn't have enough mathematics in it. If you want differential equations, look elsewhere - like a physics book or Maxwell's treatises which are readily available.I was surprised to learn of his extensive researches into color theory and that he made the very first color photograph. It seems that Maxwell was the first person to apply statistical methods to natural phenomena - specifically thermodynamics and the kinetic theory of heat.

What are they composed of, and how do they stay In place, without evaporating into space (if they are liquid or gas) or crashing down onto the planet, if composed of solid matter? In 1856, the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell attempted to solve the problem, which had been posed by a Royal Commission. The successful prize entry would win the Adams prize, a prestigious science award. After two years of intense intellectual activity, Maxwell submitted his entry....the only one, it turns out. Nobody else even attempted it. The completed entry weighed twelve pounds, mostly mathematical equations. His conclusion, explained in these simplest terms by his biographer Basil Mahon, \\"Could fluid rings be stable? This depended on how internal wave motions behaved. Would they stabilize themselves or grow bigger and bigger until the fluid broke up? He had thus shown, by elimination, that although the rings appear to us as continuous they must consist of many separate bodies orbiting independently.\\" In 1981, the Cassini spacecraft, flying close to Saturn, sent back dramatic photos verifying Maxwell's theory.The secret of Saturn's rings was only one of Maxwell's discoveries. He was equally conversant in fluid dynamics, optics, force fields, chaos theory and his primary discovery, electromagnetism.Maxwell was \\"The Man Who Changed Everything\\" according to his biographer, Basil Mahon, While that may be a bit of hyperbole, it wasn't far from the truth. Maxwell came along at the right time: Edinburgh was a beehive of intellectual and scientific activity. Lord Kelvin was working with temperature and electronics; James Hutton was discovering the basics of geological time; and Joseph Lister was developing procedures for sterile operations and antiseptics (prior to that, most surgical patients died of infection). The Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow were pre-eminent Intellectual bastions. Adam Smith wrote \`Wealth of Nations\\" while a professor at Edinburgh and David Hume was a key figure in the Scottish Enlightenment.No less a giant of physics than Albert Einstein said that two figures deserved heroic status in physics: one was Isaac Newton, the other was James Clerk Maxwell. But like other scientific giants, including Nikola Tesla in radio and alternating electrical current, and Alan Turing, an early inventor of computer theory, Maxwell was forgotten over the years.Like Tesla, whose 700 plus patents are still being used for everything from radio wave transmission to electric motors, Maxwell's work is being rediscovered. Thomas Edison believed Direct Current was the key to electricity; Tesla proved him wrong. Marconi got the Nobel Prize for \\"discovering\\" radio, but Tesla did it first. Seems like good marketing trumps good science. (Some reviewers have remarked that the book lacks adequate scientific explanations. That may be true, but this is a short, popular biography of a little known man and a lesser known science. Equations and formulas may be helpful to some, but they'e a turn off to others. There are plenty of technical explanations on the internet with all those squiggles and formulas that drove me crazy in school)Alan Turing: The EnigmaTesla: Man Out of Time"},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"James Clerk Maxwell was an extraordinary yet under appreciated scientist. Although he lived a short life, his accomplishments help to compensate for this. His many accomplishments include his electromagnetic theory and his groundbreaking discoveries on the properties of colored light. He began learning at a young age in a family that entertained one another with poetry and recreations of famous plays. Maxwell's extensive and extremely productive education began in the laboratory of James Forbes, who allowed Maxwell to learn freely. Along with Forbes Maxwell began his work on light and how the human eye perceives it. When Forbes became ill, Maxwell began to research and experiment on his own. His scientific career soon took off.This book is truly fascinating and does not require extensive knowledge of physics to understand. Anyone interested in reading a biography of a scientist would be enthralled by this novel. Basil Mahon does a phenomenal job of explaining the reasoning behind Maxwell's experiments without making it impossible for the common reader to understand. He also does an excellent job of portraying Maxwell as the influential scientist that he truly was."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"The first eleven chapters of this book provide a competent biography of James Clerk Maxwell. The last chapter attempts to give a big-picture assessment of Maxwell's scientific legacy. The biography is very good. The author integrates material from many different sources. The organization is chronological and the prose is simple and direct. There are several pages of interesting photographs, nearly twenty five pages of end notes and a short but adequate bibliography. These features are just what most engineers want and expect from a biography. Maxwell's decency, honesty, modesty and wry sense of humor come shining through the pages. Some of the details of Maxwell's personal life came as a surprise. For example, as a young man Maxwell fell in love with his 14 year old cousin Lizzie. They planned to marry after she turned 16, but their families persuaded them not to because of fears about cosanguinity. At the age of 27 Maxwell married the 34 year old daughter of the Principal of the College where he was teaching. He was happily married for more than twenty years before dying of stomach cancer, a disease for which his family had a strong genetic tendency.The descriptions of Maxwell's work on color theory and statistical mechanics are adequate. It is obvious that author does not really understand Maxwell's Equations, but very few people do. The main problem is that the author appears to be unaware that Maxwell's theory evolved for approximately 25 years after his death before achieving the form known as 'Maxwell's Equations.' Interesting aspects of this development include 1) the incommensurability of the Continental and British paradigms during the second half of the 19th century, 2) how George Fitzgerald, Oliver Heaviside, Oliver Lodge and other 'Maxwellians' modified Maxwell's formulation in various ways, some of which were counter-productive, 3) how the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 undermined Maxwell's ether-based ontology, 4) how, after electrons were discovered in 1895, charge was grafted into the theory, 5) how the Vogt transformation (now known as the Lorentz transformation) was used by Poincare and Lorentz as a way of compensating for limitations of Maxwell's ether-based ontology, and 6) how Einstein developed the Special Theory of Relativity as a way to obtain the Lorentz transformation from two postulates. If the book had included a brief synopsis of this period I would probably have given it 5 stars. Instead, the last chapter makes unsupported claims that will seem highly exaggerated to people who are familiar with the history of science during the 19th century.Maxwell was a very fine scientist and a very fine person, but he was not 'the man who changed everything.' I give this book four stars for what it includes and subtract one star for what it neglects, resulting in an overall rating of three stars."},{"Title":"The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell","review":"Maxwell didn't do anything of interest outside of physics. His personal life had no hint of scandal. He had no children, a happy marriage, and no outrageous relatives. He was bullied at school, but no more than most of us. He suffered no career hardships, moving from one UK university to another with ease, but also without fanfare.Unlike Newton, he wasn't an intriguing recluse who ended up in high public office. Unlike Einstein, he never became a media star or leader of world opinion. Unlike Darwin, he avoided great voyages of discovery and arguments with the church. I can't imagine anyone with less \\"back story\\". I'm surprised a professional biographer would attempt a life of Maxwell. And, indeed, Mahon isn't a professional biographer. He's an engineer, and also ran the British census. In fact, reading this biography is like reading the census. A lot of names and basic details, but nothing much of interest.What is interesting, of course, is Maxwell's work in statistical mechanics and electromagnetism. But Mahon contrives to make this boring as well. There is far too long a discussion of Maxwell's early work on the \\"spinning cell\\" model of electromagnetism. I bought the book hoping that this might provide more philosophical insight into what \\"the field\\" *actually* is. Instead, I soon realised that Maxwell and Mahon aren't much into philosophical insight. At least I gained insight into how the \\"spinning cell\\" model had fallen out of fashion and never recovered!Mahon would have been better providing a longer explanation of the famous Maxwell equations. He quotes them, but provides an inadequate explanation of them. Instead we get stultifyingly long explanations of dead theories and far too many of Maxwell's stultifyingly boring poems. If you really want to understand Maxwell, then get hold of a good physics textbook. Feynman's lectures are recommended (not Feynmann's as Mahon recommends, in an example of the abysmal copy editing in this book.)"},{"Title":"There's No Toilet Paper . . . on the Road Less Traveled: The Best of Travel Humor and Misadventure (Travelers' Tales)","review":"I don't know what I was expecting, but the level of humor in these stories varied fairly dramatically. Maybe the \\"if you don't find our stories funny, it's you not us\\" line in the introduction should have been a warning. Some were laugh out loud funny (I have to say A Simian in the Cinema was the most memorable, and the two Bill Bryson stories didn't disappoint) and some were able to coax a smile out of me. But many others just weren't that funny. Some just weren't funny to begin with (An Irishman in Vurjinny and The Duck of Peace come to mind) and many others ended just as they seemed to be getting into a groove. In general, this collection seemed to be going for quantity over quality. Fewer, longer, and better stories would have been more effective.The title is deceiving as well ... the \\"road less traveled\\" apparently includes places like Disney World, Virginia, and Caribbean cruises. Some stories do not disappoint, in terms of exotic locales at least, but the vast majority of the stories rely on slapstick/situational humor of relatively low sophistication or physical humor that is disappointingly context-free. I suppose this book would make for fairly decent light-reading in an airport or on an airplane, but the quality of the promised \\"best of travel humor and misadventure\\" is a bit lacking. Heck, even I have had funnier and better \\"misadventures\\" on the road than most of these stories.

It was kind of hit and miss with the stories. They were either really good, or not so good at all.Don't be misled by the name, this book is just a collection of short stories on the humors of travel. Its not about someone lacking toilet paper. These stories were written by various authors, some well known travel authors like Bill Bryson, others from people I have never heard of. They could range in location and a couple took place in the United States but the majority were over in Europe and Asia. Some were about the perils of travel in a foreign country, others about avoiding land mines in the desert. A particular favorite of mine took place on a luxury cruise ship where the author had difficulty with target shooting. But I had a lot of least favorites as well, like the story about what a new ride the author thinks should be at Disney, a bus ride in a developing country. It just kind of fell flat.As said before this book had its ups and downs. There were more downs than ups, or at least flat lines though. But the few funny ones really did make the difference and I even giggled out loud for a couple of them. You could tell the regular humor writers apart from the others. Bill Bryson for example had some of the better narratives and having read some of his books I think he kept to the same tone as what he uses in them. The ones I didn't care for as much just seemed to illicit that feeling when someone tells a terrible joke and nervous laughter echos through the room. It just isn't comfortable. The stories are pretty mild and I think they'd be appropriate for just about anyone. There is a tad bit of adult humor but nothing too overwhelming.Not bad but not awesome either. This was an overall average travel book. The stories were short so time passed quickly and I can see someone taking this along to the beach for some light reading.There's No Toilet PaperCopyright 2005184 pagesReview by M.

It should still make sense and be an entertaining read.And still I trudged on.I enjoyed the first story about Ravengar and just as I was beginning to like him the story changed to another character.

For centuries, the dynasty consistently politically outwitted their foes. However, the real power behind Silvertree is wizardry for this clan consists of the most powerful wizards known on Aglirta.

Each tale contains an underlying caution based on Lord Acton's concept that power corrupts, etc. The key characters are often bewildered as to why they did a deed as Ed Greenwood cleverly delves into cause, effect, and after-effect through a person feeling guilt and questioning their motives though acting courageously. These heroes understand they make mistakes and though suffer pangs of sorrow, they can admit errors.

Why me, I asked? Read it, he said.A sunny day down by the river seemed an appropriate moment to begin. Six hours of riveted attention carried me through almost to the end. And so, I, too, say, read this book. You will be transported into a world of sport, but one which requires endlessly fascinating manipulation and relentless diligence. Years of exploring the shifts in nature's underwater mysteries, the currents in streams and vast waters.No mere how-to or informational projection, Tirana settles into a spirituality with which he imbues fly fishing, a God-like communing with nature that is at once intimate with one's own soul yet conjoined with all human emotion. Deftly, he reveals our need to reach beyond ourselves to grasp the worldly bindings between man and his world, and how precious, indeed, are these resources. Tirana unravels these ties as he stands alone in watery spaces. Often, he invites in his children and his wife, and here we smile at familial adventures.Upon closing down the last page, you will long for a stream, a pair of high boots and a fishing pole over your shoulder. Unraveling the details of this glorious and little-known sport, its history and its various technical aspects, Tirana holds us fast with evocative, lyrical writing, contemporary in its relevance but as fine as any nineteenth-century poetry."},{"Title":"Fly Fishing: A Life in Mid-Stream : Recollections and Essays","review":"The trick in this kind of book is to be both expert and entertaining, and Tirana pulls it off.

Never having cast a line in my life, I found it intriguing, front to back."},{"Title":"Fly Fishing: A Life in Mid-Stream : Recollections and Essays","review":"Turhan Tirana throws together a few loosely organized essays, with no common thread tying them together, one perhaps a little duller than the next, and produces a rather unremarkable read. Part memoir, part travelogue, with a little history thrown in, Tirana writes of fly fishing without the self deprecating humor of John Geirach or beautiful prose of Bill Barich. He somehow manages to make moments which lend themselves perfectly to writing-like courting his wife and being held at gunpoint-and make them drab and boring. It is a quick read, a little snobbish, as one reviewer has stated and certainly not the worst book ever, but really just another fly fisherman who feels compelled to tell the world the joy we receive from our sport, and fails to convey its beautiful aura."},{"Title":"Fly Fishing: A Life in Mid-Stream : Recollections and Essays","review":"Once again a rich somewhat snobbish writer thinks he has &quot;captured&quot; the essence of the sport.

This book is very well written, full of entertainment, action and adventure. If you are looking for a book with a compelling story, well-rounded characters, and lots of adventure this is your book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Personally, as a sophomore in high school, I enjoyed the First Part of the Lord of the Rings immensely. The plotline was very unique, making it the original story involving non-mortal creatures such as elves, dwarves and hobbits. Although extremely creative, the plot successfully avoids tangling into a giant mess that is hard to keep track of. The premise is simple, and the characters are well described. Tolkien is wonderful about letting his characters' true identities shine through their actions, rather than long wordy descriptions. Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mount Doom, even though he knows it will end in most likely in death; Legolas befriends Gimli, despite the long history of conflict between their two species (elf and dwarf, respectively); Gandalf tells the others to leave him at the Mines of Moria to save themselves, and leave him to deal with the Balrog. All these actions show the characters' compassion and bravery, without outright stating so. Yet the characters are not divine beings; they have plenty of flaws too. Boromir, and his greed, are revealed when he tries to persuade Frodo to \\"lend\\" him the ring to save his homeland of Gondor. Even though Boromir has good intentions, he is made more realistic in the eyes of the reader, due to his relatable weakness. The settings are also artfully described; the picture painted of L&oacute;thlorien is indeed beautiful, making me almost wistfully wish for some mallorn trees in my back yard. All these are evidence of Tolkien's strong and descriptive writing, yet sometimes this can almost go too far.When Tolkien writes about how Frodo and the three other hobbits (Sam, Merry, and Pippin) journeyed to Rivendell, I sometimes wanted to fall asleep. While I understand the immense lassitude they had to overcome, I still feel as though Tolkien's words were superfluous and often repetitive. Some might disagree that this brings a sense of realism to their journey, but I disagree. I feel as though all his descriptions of their daily meager meals were almost too much, and at some extremely barren parts, I almost wished for an airplane to take them to Rivendell, just to end this tedious \\"torture.\\" Also, while I appreciate the effort Tolkien put into his many songs and poems, I wish there were only a few, to have a bigger impact, rather than many losing their significance from the sheer amount of poems in the book. These two shortcomings made the novel at times not as engaging as one would hope.All in all, The Fellowship of the Ring was an outstanding book, despite being overly descriptive. The characters, story, and settings were all believable, yet whimsical with enough creativity so as to capture the reader's interest. The book would be great for fantasy lovers, especially those who enjoy longer books such as Eragon or other fantasy novels such as Dragon Rider (in spite of an apparent lack of dragons). Readers of Holly Black would probably also enjoy this; and of course, anyone who has seen the movies should definitely give this trilogy a read!

This book was amazing and possibly the greatest book I've ever read. Even though I had already watched the movie, there was a new twist around every corner. And I loved this book because of Tolkien's word choice. He used descriptive words in every sentence. I read this for a project in school and could barely read the book because I was taking so many notes on word choice.In this book, a young Hobbit named Frodo inherits a seemingly harmless ring after his uncle Bilbo's disappearance, but as soon as he puts the ring on, everything changes. Monsters from the evil land of Mordor begin to follow him to take the ring, for this is no ordinary ring. This ring is the master ring of the evil lord Sauron. The ring begins to control him as well. Every time someone asks to see it, he draws back, hissing, and overcome with greed. Soon Frodo realizes it is not safe in his home, he must leave to talk to the elf king Elrond to discuss this matter in Rivendale. Along the way they meet new dangers and assistance until they reach their destination. There, at the council it is decided that nine people will go to destroy the ring, in the fiery pits of mount doom, the only place it can be destroyed. The group of nine, or The Fellowship of the Ring must set out to complete their quest and destroy the ring, once and for all.I would give this book a five out of five, and more if I could. This book is perfect for boys and girls of all ages, although it is a pretty hard read so I wouldn't read it until maybe 7th grade. This book has something every reader loves, action, funny lines, romance, and much more. Also, this book isn't a book to fly through just to get it done; with this book you want to sit down, relax, and have a good time reading it. I really wish that everyone would read this book because it can teach us all a valuable lesson that the entire world needs to know: Great power can cause even the best of us to be overcome with greed. You can learn a lot from this book, so I hope you will read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was VERY well done. the details and description was amazing and the storyline was so wonderfully unique. i would definitely recommend this book to people who love adventure and something that they cant put down."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I loved the movies but the books are a whole lot better.

I especially enjoy it on my kindle!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have been a fan of the movie for years. I have lost count on how many times I have watched them. I can't believe it took reading the Hobbit to finally read this. If you love the movies read the books. You will fall deeper in love with middle earth and be awe struck by Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"But these people do a truly lousy job of telling it. If you can't find a better version of audio book, just buy the bound version and read it instead."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This really applies to the whole set, but it's great to finally have an unabridged version of the books. Earlier versions are dramatizations, mostly for British radio, (erroneously listed as &#34;unabridged&#34;) but this is word-for-word. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The 3 books are 44 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Epic battlegrounds and awesome excitement. One of the best books ever.

We read these with our children years ago and they are just as enjoyable today. What a master storyteller he was. These are fun for all age groups."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings (and The Hobbit) are my favorite books of all time. I've read them at least every five years since I was fifteen. There are no words to express what these books mean to me. The performance of Rob Inglis was very good and convincing. He actually did a very decent job singing the songs rather than just reading them, which added a lot to the feeling of the recording. The packaging has a little to be desired being made of a cheap thin cardboard with cutouts for the CDs to be put in. I just don't think it would protect them over time and a lot of taking them out and putting them back in."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It's fantastic! Cover looks cool and it fits nicely in my bookcase. I'd recommend it to anyone. Lord of the rings rocks :)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is another one of those books I started and put away unfinished many times when I was in school. Now, after discovering Goodreads, I found the motivation to finish it.I'm glad I finally did. It's good... but it's not as outstanding, jaw-dropping, eye-popping-ly good as everyone makes it out to be. I'd give it 3.5 stars.One thing I can say about Tolkien is that he absolutely could write! His talent for describing in excruciating detail every single leaf on every single tree is admirable - but it gets a bit much. The book took me just less than two months to read, and if I were to hazard a guess, I probably took in... 60% of it. Tops. I have a tendency to \\"zone out\\" while I'm reading, and have been known to read twenty pages or more and have no recollection of what I've just read. That happened a lot with this book.It's a good story, though. As other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the things in this book can be interpreted as being clich&eacute;d, but you need to understand that they're only clich&eacute;s NOW, because Tolkien invented them! And that's how I tried to read this book. I read it for the HISTORY of the fantasy genre, the history of wargaming, of Dungeons & Dragons and just about every fantasy role-playing game, story or movie that has come since.For people interested in the history of the genre, or people with loads and loads of time to read, I highly recommend this book. Will I be reading the other two parts? Probably - I wouldn't be able to stop myself!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The book captures you in from the first pages all the way to the end. The story develops well and has great references back to the story of the Hobbit, but not so that it takes away from this read if you have not read the story. Very enjoyable and really draws you into the word that has been created! Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Very good best fantasy book I've ever read expect for Harry potter which is also very good book and Percy Jackson"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I had to write this review due to the one star reviews of people saying the book was too detailed for them. Go back to reading Harry Potter. This isn't a novel, it's literature. It may be above your head, but don't deny it for that. It's not the book's fault. Simply put, these books defined fantasy. Very few fantasies out today haven't lifted a page from Tolkien. If you can't handle the book because it's deeper than Xena, fine. But, respect it for what it is."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There used to be two ways to read The Lord of The Rings, now there will be three. It used to be that you either read this book before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit. Now it will also be either before or after you've seen the movies which you saw before or after you read the Silmarillion and the Hobbit. However you arrive you will not be disappointed. If you come from 'The Hobbit' it continues the story of the One Ring as it passes from Bilbo to Frodo, and as they, Gandalf, and the world become more aware of what has happened and what the ring really means. While reading this book you'll hear clues to many other, older, stories and myths of ages gone by (the three ages of Middle Earth) and at first you'll pass over them, and you'll enjoy the adventure of Frodo and the fellowship facing their collective and individual destinies.If, however, you read the Silmarillion before reading this book, you'll immediately recognize people, places, and things that carry a much greater history, which can add greatly to your enjoyment. The meaning of places and items encountered will carry the wealth of meaning associated with mythology in our literature. It has been said that these stories all grew out of Tolkien's attempt to invent a language, and his awareness that you can't invent a language without inventing a mythology and history to go along with it.Another option is to read all of them several times, and the good news is that they hold up. These books are all good enough to be enjoyed with several readings. Which leads to the further temptation of all those other Middle Earth books that Christopher Tolkien has been editing.For now, if you're just starting, start with 'The Hobbit', it's an easy read, it introduces many characters that are referenced in 'The Lord Of The Rings' and gives you a general introduction to the land and people of Middle Earth. Then 'The Lord of The Rings'. As much as you may like to read just one, the three all go together and they are a compelling tale. Then, if you really want to know more about those characters, and the history that precedes them, The Silmarillion. By that time you'll be a true fan and can decide on your own whether to go back to the beginning or on through all the other bits and pieces that are being discovered.This is a really rich fable. It's been written out of a deep love of language, literature, history, and religion, and the more you read the more you'll wonder about the mind that could invent it, and the man that would keep working on it for so long without passing it on.There is a great love here and bit of it rubbs off on each of us while reading it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I really liked this book, but like other people, I was sorta brain-washed by Harry Potter. It got really hard to read when they were constantly on the road and describing every single bird that flew by, but by the end it was all worth it. I think you need to read the whole set to appreciate the story. After you read it all, it will hit you and what came to me was, &quot;Everyone should have a faithful friend through even the darkest evil, just like Sam.&quot; These books bring to light just what real friendship and brotherhood are. So, if you and considering reading the books, give them a chance and I am 99% sure there will be something there for you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Before reading this book, I had heard a lot of things about how good Lord of the Rings was. Before reading this book, I didn't realize how amazing this story could actually be. Fellowship of the Ring is the first step in the amazing Lord of the Rings novel (it has three parts, each containing two books for a total of six books).Though Fellowship of the Ring has less fighting and &quot;action&quot; in it as it's two sequels, I probably enjoyed it the most out of all three books. The way that the book begins, with Bilbo leaving his precious ring to his nephew Frodo; all the way to the end of the first part where Frodo is left with a difficult decision and Middle-Earth's fate in his hands. Frodo's character develops beautifully. At the beginning he's nothing more than a regular hobbit, Bilbo's nephew, son of Drogo. By the end, Frodo has been through so much that his character has been shaped into something that one wouldn't have imagined when he first left Hobbiton. All in all, Fellowship of the Ring is a fantastic book and a perfect start to a perfecet novel."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What if your uncle suddenly disappeared on his birthday leaving you with an evil lord's ring? This is what happens to Frodo in The Fellowship of the Ring by J. R. R. Tolkien. Frodo travels and collects a party of people, but on his journey many unfortunate events occur.

Lord of the Rings was the series that started it all. if it were not for Lord of the Rings we would not have many things that we have today. We would not have Dungeains &amp; Dragons, we would not have Robert Jordan. Tolkien was the one who perfected the fantasy epic, and these books are just as good now as they were when they were published. Someone posted a review that said the characters had no depth, they didn't like the poems, and they didn't understand why it spent a lot of time talking about Hobbit families. Well....someone obviously doesn't really understand what these books are all about. They complaied that the orcs were just evil and and that there were no twists. Well...Tolkien INVENTED Orcs...whay should he HAVE to twist them? And as for the characters having no depth.....that simply isn't true. Anyone with an imagination will enjoy this books. Anyone expecting a book to create an imagination for them needs to go study accounting and never have anything to do with art or fiction. This is a timeless tale that will stay with you forever....and you usually don't just read it once. Every couple of years you'll pick it up again and read it. Wonderful story and great fun."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Rings is one of the best books I have read. It is amazing how Tolkien goes into all the detail, like when the bad guys drowned in the river when the current picked up. It has lots of adventure and excitement. When you start reading you don&#65533;t want to stop. There are also two more books after this one. I would suggest first reading The Hobbit, which is a prequel to the series. I would also highly suggest reading this book. It is at a high reading level but it is very exciting."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When two years ago a friend of mine, older in age told me in a spooky style the name: T O L K I E N and H O B B I T, I didn't ever imagine that this authro would be my one and favorite. I have read 8 of J.R.R. Tolkien's books and I can't say anything else but praise this person's work. My favourite books are The Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. But LOTR has taken the first place of my heart. The amazing Lord of the Rings is my personal beloved book. I like it more than any other book of the trilogy, especially the chapter: The Bridge of Kazad-Dum, the climax of the book. The Lord of the Rings isn't just a book. It is a masterpiece, something historic. Tolkien is the Homer of the 20th Century and his &quot;Odyssey&quot; is the Lord of the Rings. I highly recommend this book to every single person and it is sure that anyone who completes it will love fantasy and will search other works of the same writer too."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best books I have ever read. In this book you will find a great cast of characters and learn learn a whole lot of new words. This book starts out really boring in the beginning but then it picks up and becomes such a great book that you will not be able to put it down. You might want to read the Hobbit before you read this book so u do not get lost at times in the story and characters. The story is about Frodo Bagginses(Bilbo's nephew)and three other hobbits Sam, Pippin, and Merry. Throughout the story a wizard named Gandalf will accompany Frodo and his companions. As you go farther through the story there will be new characters and it will get much more exciting. Once you finish this amazing book you will definitely want to finish the rest of the Lord of the Rings book series by J.R.R.

All of his Tolkein books are well worth the purchase!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is a classic. The story, the characters, everything about it. J.R.R. Tolkein is a genius. The story that is unfolded is exciting, action packed, and every other aspect you could want in a book. The characters are unique and truly awe inspiring. From the tiny hobbits with stout hearts to the strong and mysterious ranger Strider. This is a story that will capture your imagination and your heart. You'll cheer for Frodo as he carries the burden of the ring and be touched when Sam shows his everlasting loyalty and friendship to him. The Fellowship of the Ring will reach out to you like no other book. Not only are the characters inspiring, but the places are truly astounding. From the hobbit holes to the beautiful elven city of Rivendale. My personal favorite is the underground mines where the dwarves had awakened a monster from the depths of the earth. Something so terrible that even the great Gandalf is scared of it. Another I think is just as amazing is where an elf queen resides. It's an entire town in the trees. All the locations in this book are just beautiful. J.R.R. Tolkein has created a book that will enhance lives throughout the ages. It will touch people with its intriguing story and truly unique and amazing characters and open your imagination with its environments. This is a must have for everybody. And it never gets boring. This book will amaze you and inspire you; it's definitely a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of The Lord of the Rings, continues the chronicles of the small folk known as Hobbits and their role in the War of the Ring. Longer, more complicated, and far darker than The Hobbit (\\"the enchanting prelude to The Lord of the Rings,\\" as Ballantine Books' marketing division puts it), this first installment of three places the destiny of Middle-Earth in the hands of a hobbit.It's been over 50 years since Gandalf the Wizard and a party of 12 Dwarves enlisted Bilbo Baggins to serve as their \\"burglar\\" in their quest to recover the Dwarves' treasure hoard from the dragon Smaug, who terrorized the lands near the Lonely Mountain. After facing trolls, giant spiders, and orcs (called goblins in The Hobbit), the survivors of that adventure returned home and went on with their lives....But even though Bilbo Baggins returned to Hobbiton with a bit of treasure and a tale to set down on paper for future generations, he also brought back a dangerous piece of jewelry, a ring he had found in a cave during one of his misadventures as the \\"burglar.\\" Plain and apparently ordinary, the ring had the ability to render its wearer invisible. This power helped Bilbo escape from the ring's previous owner, the strange creature known as Gollum, and saved the hobbit and his friends from several sticky situations.The Fellowship of the Ring's narrative begins with a long introduction that explains the book's connections to The Hobbit. Tolkien gives us more background information on hobbits, their history and traditions, and even a short treatise on pipeweed, the Middle-Earth version of tobacco. After this explanatory preface, the narrative focuses on the next generation of hobbit adventurers, especially Bilbo's nephew and heir Frodo, his gardener and loyal friend Samwise Gamgee, and his cousins Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took.Gandalf, the Wizard who'd enlisted Bilbo more than 50 years earlier, returns to serve as both mentor and protector for Frodo, and it is he who reveals to the younger Baggins the true nature of Bilbo's ring. It is, as all Tolkien readers know, no ordinary magic ring, but a dangerous Ring of Power, forged in secret by the Dark Lord Sauron to control the other Rings of Power crafted by Elves he had deceived into making for him to rule over the three major races of Middle-Earth. It's also Gandalf who enlists Frodo to go on a perilous quest to take the One Ring out of the Shire and to find a way to destroy it forever.Tolkien's tale is entertaining and at the same time a challenging piece of literature. He uses different styles of writing to tell his tale, ranging from straightforward narrative prose to poems full of references to Middle-Earth mythology, some of which makes more sense after reading his posthumous work The Silmarillion. Some readers (especially younger ones) may feel overwhelmed by all the songs and epic saga-style poetry, but patience with this book is a virtue with its own reward. The Lord of the Rings is one of those rare fantasy tales that has stood the test of time, as proved by its enduring popularity and the popular and critical success of Peter Jackson's film adaptations."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the one of the best books I have ever read because it is a story of an adventure and love to read adventure books. I knew this was going to be a great book because I have read the Hobit and that was a good book too. Yet I wouldn't read any of the Lord of the Rings books until you've read the Hobit because the Hobit is the first book of the series and would be confusing if you didn't read the Hobit first. The Fellowship of Ring may be a long book, over 400 pages, but is a great book none the less and is worth spending a little time to read it. If you like books about dragons, wizards and other fantasy characters this would be a great book for you because what the book is about a hobit, who's the heir of Bilbo, must overcome many difficulties to try to get the ONE RING destroyed by tossing it in the belly of Mt. Doom."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book (and when I say \\"this book,\\" I mean the entire trilogy) is an extremely intricate and powerful book that rewards multiple readings. To call it a good \\"adventure book\\" or to note that modern fantasy literature is virtually all just sincere flattery of Tolkien or to observe that Tolkien's own precedents were epic and mythological literature or to wonder at the depth, consistency, beauty and, above all, REALITY of Tolkien's Middle Earth is to damn with faint praise. Read it again. There is always something more.What struck me during my most recent reading was the deeply Christian ethos of the book. The ring is, of course, the power to indulge one's pride, the capacity for ultimate self-aggrandizement. The heroes of the west are all great because they are all able to deny themselves that power: Bilbo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Galadriel, even Boromir (after a moment's slip) are all great because they are humble. There's a wonderful passage in Mordor where Sam is wearing the ring and sees himself as the irresistible gardener, striding through the wasteland with a flaming sword and using the power of the ring to restore the land. It's delightful characterization and powerful writing.(...)"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"How does that adage go: &quot;Some books are to be tasted, others nibbled upon, others devoured whole&quot;? I am used to reading &quot;pop&quot; fiction that can be ravaged in a day or two. Reading this book, however, gave me a new experience altogether - taking my time to see each image in my head and ponder each happening. It's a &quot;nibbling&quot; book, if you will.Tolkien has painted an incredibly detailed world in Middle Earth. After reading the 40-page forward, you can really appreciate how much thought he actually put into this. I found the forward a bit tedious, but it refreshed my memory on the Hobbit (read years ago) and gave me a good backdrop of the story.The characters are fantastic, and although a few of the secondary characters are little-mentioned, the main characters (Frodo, Sam, Pippen, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, et. al.) are rendered in great detail so that you soon begin to like them all very much for their feats (and their faults). Every adventure, every turn in Frodo's great quest to return a dark and mysterious ring, is so fascinating that I could only read about 30 pages at a time before closing the book, closing my eyes, and pondering and recreating what I had just read in my mind. I think that anyone willing to take the time and not rush through this one will really enjoy it. Happy trails!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Following the advice of my good friend (and a much more experienced Tolkien reader), I read \\"The Hobbit\\" before tackling the Lord of the Rings trilogy. \\"The Hobbit\\" is the prequel that introduces the creatures (hobbits, elves, and dwarves) and their manner of adventuring. This is particularly useful when facing the prologue to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (the first book of the trilogy followed by \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\").*** Tolkien uses his prologue in \\"Fellowship\\" to give more background about hobbits as creatures and their history. You have to delay satisfying your appetite for adventure while Tolkien gives you this important set-up. -- Have patience! You will be rewarded.*** Hobbits and dwarves are physically not unlike people -- except for the height difference and the mortality rates (humans are taller and shorter lived). There is a rustic beauty in Tolkien's cast of creatures. They pass on their stories and traditions through song and folklore. But there is also magic at play -- for good and for evil.*** The basic story is this: There is a Ring, created by dark powers and once thought to be lost, that is now in the innocent possession of a young hobbit named Frodo. The Dark Lord, Sauron, sends his servants, known as the Ringwraiths or the Nine Riders, to reclaim the Ring from Frodo. Thus pursued, Frodo engages the help of three fellow hobbits (including the ever-faithful Sam) and learns that the fate of the Ring will determine the fate of the world itself.*** Tolkien creates a very detailed epic. Admittedly, readers may be discouraged by the prospect of all the names and places. However, the basic story is never lost. A helpful trick is to see yourself in Frodo's shoes. The young hobbit is confused himself, but always in the thick of the action. He meets up with amazing companions like Gandalf the Wizard and the heroic Aragorn, and finds refuge in the idyllic elven realms.*** Danger lurks and strikes in one adventure after the next. Frodo and Co. are in it for the long haul and most readers will be too. If you've made it through to the end of \\"Fellowship\\", you'd better have the sequel, \\"The Two Towers\\", close at hand!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My daughter tells me I should occasionally read fiction. \\"To be more 'well rounded',\\" she says. She asked me to read Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. I had tried reading Tolkien about thirty years ago. I just couldn't -- too many odd, invented proper nouns. And worse. Elves, dwarfs, Hobbits, trolls, orcs, Barrow-wights, Dark Riders, wizards, Rangers, a Balrog (\\"This is a foe beyond any of you\\"), and even more mysterious beings? Be serious -- not worth the effort, I thought.Well, I read The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I had difficulty making my peace with those strange place names and those stranger character names, yet I pressed on. Eventually I found a pretty good story. In truth, I believe the story is something beyond the genre-pioneering work of epic fantasy that critics generally consider Tolkien's Rings books to be. There are certain philosophical and spiritual themes as well. This strong undercurrent is not difficult to find, yet the reader need not recognize it (I'm guessing that many do not) to enjoy the adventurous journey, as Frodo warns his friends: \\"You speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\\"Some say the story beneath the story is one of environmental stewardship (I don't know, this wasn't a burning issue in Tolkien's England). Others tend toward the theistic themes of providence (an abstracted 23rd Psalm?) or the relentless conflict between virtue and evil. Some cite social or even political themes -- a bit of a reach on the latter, I'd say. Only a servant of the Dark Lord would deny the theistic themes. The story is rich and deep enough to support all of these ideas, and too much may be made of them; if Tolkien had wished to pen a philosophical dissertation he would have done so. The Fellowship is the first of the highly imaginative Rings trilogy. A good book, even if fiction will never be a genre with which I spend a high percentage of my reading time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As of this writing (Mar 2011), only this title, The Fellowship of the Ring, and the third book, The Return of the King, are available on the Kindle.

For people who have seen the movie before reading the book, it can be harder to figure the book out. The book has more characters and many more details about different events. The book can seem to drag at times, while the movie is action packed. Many events inn the book are written completely different then they are shown in the movie. Some parts of the book made me completely confused. Considering that this book is long, I would suggest that coach-potatoes stick to the movie. Real readers should defiantly read the book, and possibly watch the movie to get a better feel of it all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"just noting: all of the one star reveiws say its too wordy or slow. is this commenting on their intelligence or the book?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This a book depicting the classic conflict between pure evil and the good that is fighting it. What makes this story great is it's scale. Of such magnitude that it would be an understatement to call it an epic. The story begins with a genuine innocence, but becomes increasingly darker and full of more action as it goes on. Tolkien's brilliance can easily be enjoyed by falling in love with the characters he has created. He has formed and effectively layed down the ground work of fantasy/science fiction for hundreds of authors to follow in his footsteps by creating such ideas. When it comes to such stories, Tolkien is the master. This story kept me wanting more the entire way through. What really intrigued me as a reader was the intense details Tolkien uses to describe every aspect of the action in the story. With this amount of intensity and this magnitude of fantasy, a person who enjoys fiction can only enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Author Bio: J.R.R. Tolkien writes this book \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\"; he was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa on January 3, 1892. His memories of Africa are Vivid, but one encounter with a big hairy spider stuck in his mind. He wrote his first book \\"The Hobbit\\" and this was published in 1937. He Died on September 7th, 1973.Annotation: Bilbo Baggins acquired the right more that 90 years ago. On his Eleventy first birthday he disappears, leaving the ring behind for his son Frodo. Saran, once a great wizard, has joined the dark side, and is trying to take over middle earth.. Frodo now has to run from evil, the evil he encounters, you can't even begin to imagine...Evaluation: This is by far one of the greatest book/series of books ever written. Tolkien creates a whole new world; it has elves, dwarfs, men, and of course, hobbits. Being the major RPG/Adventure buff that I am, the Lord of the Rings series was right up my alley. This book, though, isn't just for RPG buffs; anyone who wants to have some adventure in their lives must read this book. It grabs you from the first line, and rips you till the last word. My greatest feeling on this book is that it can be so widely imagined, you imagination can run wild while reading this. The movie also goes great with the books, there are a few parts that they left out, but the movie is very gripping to watch. \\"Two Towers\\" the second of the trilogy is an amazing movie. Lord of the Rings is an amazing trilogy, and I wish more people would read it. Trust me, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I first heard of Tolkien when I read The Hobbit for 7th grade reading. I started reading The Lord of the Rings when the movies were starting to come out. I started reading the Fellowship of the Ring during the time when the first of the three movies was coming out. I am now reading the Two Towers which is starting to get a little interesting in the plot. The story is very well written and created thanks to Tolkien's years of commitment of creating a very giant world filled with humans, elves, dwarves, and a variety of creature races that are good and evil. The writing style of Tolkien is simple in a way, making young people also able to read the book. Since Tolkien created such a huge world and a series of time periods that spanned for years and years, it was kind of hard to understand some of the terms that existed in this book were confusing and made me do some research on Tolkien's world and had to flip on the atlas which is actually quite useful. It's a good beginning to a great adventure as I read Frodo starting to begin his new adventure with Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli the dwarf, and Legolas the elf. It also ties well to the movie but it has more detail, extra scenes, and more characters that pose a great significance to the story (like Tom Bombadil and Glorfindel). Why the four stars? It's a very impressive book but not the best book I've read. The book is a great beginning to this series and I'm looking forward to see what the Two Towers has to offer. Before you read this book, read The Hobbit, because it tells some more detail on Hobbits, Dwarves, and Gandalf as it will give the inside track on what happened before Frodo got the Ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"i liked this book however it was kind of difficult to read. there was way too much details and names to remember therefore making this a slow read book. the plot and charactors were described and written magnificantly throughout the book. i have also seen the movie and there are a few parts not in the movie, but that does not really matter. it was a great book, i recomend this book to someone that has a very good reading skill and likes to read, if they dont like to read and dont have a very good reading skill than this will be a difficult book for them."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Finally, a book I actually like, in and out! Tolkien amazes me with his ability to imagine the diverse characters and places in The Lord of the Rings. This book portrays leadership, and the long enduring of good in an evil world. I am very pleased with the detail that Tolkien puts into the novel so that the reader can understand completely each situation. Tolkien writes the book so that the readers feel as if it could be real. It's an outstanding novel that teaches us that we need to bear our burdens and stick together so that good can prevail in a world of such turmoil.Tolkien has made me think a lot more about my characteristics and whether or not I would be able to bear the ring. Would I be able to withstandthe temptation of putting on the ring? Or using it's power for my own good? It's an outstanding concept. This book leaves you in anticipation for the next. The suspense of what is going to happen next is nerve-racking.Overall, I just enjoyed the material, and I feel that Tolkein is a very experienced writer. He knows how to captivate readers, and enthral their minds into the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Brilliant. Awe-inspring. Masterfully written.J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.And Tolkien's story evolves--parallel to the turbulent and terrible years of World War II, when he was working on Part 1, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. The book, as it progresses, takes on a darker, more ominous tone, a reflection of the inherent danger manifesting itself in Great Britain under a relentless Nazi attack.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING begins in a lighthearted, almost whimsical fashion, much like Tolkien's prequel, \\"The Hobbit.\\" Case in point: Tom Bombadil. When Frodo and fellow companions Sam, Merry, and Pippin are bewitched by a menacing willow in the Old Forest that has magical powers, Tom Bombadil bursts onto the scene spouting poetry, saving the day. Better yet, when Frodo and his friends fall victim to the Barrow Wights, Frodo recites a poem that instantly brings Bombadil to the rescue. This is fairy tale prose, very much like the tone from \\"The Hobbit,\\" where even when a character is in danger there is no sense of doom or foreboding.And yet, the story evolves, because Frodo's quest becomes more dangerous, disturbing. From the attack at Weathertop, to the confrontation with the Nazgul at the Ford, to the Council of Elrond, the crossing of the Mines of Moria, the imposing majesty of the Argonath, to the breaking of the Fellowship at Parth Galen on the banks of the Anduin, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING becomes a sweeping, vivid account of Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring--to save Middle-earth.Hobbits, elves, dwarves, men, wizards, orcs...Tolkien gives us a rich fantasy world that is as believable as it is dangerous. Enriched by its similarities to medieval lore, this is storytelling unsurpassed. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I thought The Lord of the Rings \\"The Fellowshipof the Rings\\" was really fantastic.

I can't wait to read The Two Towers. I also would reccomend The Hobbit, that is an awesome book to."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As a lover of Science Fiction and a moderate consumer of fantasy, this book easily ranks up there with the best either has to offer. Dune and Ender's Game being personal favorites, this book offers elements that were never attained in either of the aforementioned. In particular, the details with which Tolkein encapsulated the true settings and feelings of places and characters is unmatched. Like another reviewer remarked, I have to agree that this novel was not written to give the reader a symbolic hidden message underneath the beauty of his writing, but rather entertain the reader with a land of magic and fantastical delight. I have yet to read a novel where i thought it would be astonishing to see how a movie could be made based on this. I am afraid that there is no way possible a movie will encompass what Tolkein has created and that those who fall victim to exchanging the reading for the viewing of the movie will be at a loss. Simply wonderful."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book shoves off the greatest trilogy ever written. Some people might say that it is long-winded and boring.

But i can understand that some people find it boring. I heard about it and decided to read it in 6th grade. It was slow and after three chapters of dragging myself through it, i returned it wondering what was so great about it. a year later, i was brousing for a book to read when it caught my eye. I was incredibly bored so I decided to give it another try. Afterall, fantasy is my favorite genre. From then on i was caught. I read the book three times and loved ALL the characters, (even the EVIL Sauron, which,i admit, is odd). The middle earth is so believable that for days after i expected to find orcs lurking about at night. This is a fantastic trilogy and a fantastic book you HAVE to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"\\"In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of Numenor, ere it fell.\\" This is the archaic tone you will need to endure to enjoy this book. This, the endless mentions of places, people, and things that have nothing to do whatsoever with the central plot; the mind-boggling barrage of songs and poems; and the book's drudging pace curbed all of the enthusiasm I had going into reading this epic story. The story itself is creative and wonderful; of course, how couldn't it be and be so popular. \\"The Hobbit,\\" though, was a much better reading experience in both style and pace. It had a clear beginning, middle and ending. \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" seems from the beginning to concentrate so much on laying down the foundation for the trilogy, that it really doesn't move. The ending is not an ending at all, but the most blatant lead-in to a sequel you could imagine. I expected a lead-in, but I didn't expect that this book would end completely unresolved in every way. Also, so many of the character's physical descriptions are so vague that I still can't really say what the difference between a dwarf and an elf is. What does an orc look like? I'm not too sure, yet the geography is often described in painful detail. Now I understand all the dubious remarks about this book that have kept me from reading it over the years. It's good and agonizing to read at the same time. In my case, the agony wins out."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A new wave of readers are devouring \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" thanks to the arrival of the epic movie hits. And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned. Tolkien also demonstrated his skill in keeping the \\"feel\\" of the different races separate; without being too obvious, he emphasized the subtle differences between Elves, Dwarves, hobbits and Men. There are faint but distinguishable differences in their speech patterns and thought processes. You could never get Frodo mixed up with Legolas.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers. Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. Self-sacrifice is his middle name. Unlike Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter, Frodo also has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the start to what is probably the most loved epic fantasy series ever written. From the first pages when Bilbo Baggins makes his secret departure from Hobbiton, you are drawn in to this lush story. Tolkien tells a wonderful story and is able to do that while keeping the reader hooked from page 1.&quot;Fellowship&quot; is the start of the trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; In this first installment, Bilbo Baggins leaves Hobbiton and leaves The One Ring in the hands of his cousin, Frodo Baggins. When gandalf the Grey tells of brewing trouble the Hobbit says he's going to move to Buckland. He departs on a quest that will change his life forever. He takes along friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. The hobbits finally reach Rivendell and an important counsel is held. This is the point in the book where the plot starts to skyrocket. To tell you any more on the plot would most likely ruin your reading.Tolkien's detail on nature and history is astounding and only makes the novel even greater. He is always describing the surroundings and I just couldn't get enough of it. Some may not like this detail because they say Tolkien just drags on and on. This couldn't be furthur from the truth. His detail only adds to this beautiful story.For those of you that are interested in reading this book because you loved the movie need to know what you are getting into. This is the start of one of the biggest and best fantasy epics of all time. Don't think that you're going to be opening a book that anybody can handle. That is not the case. Only people that are willing to make a commitment to a fabulous and sometimes complicated novel should buy this.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the start to what is most likely the best fantasy epic of our time. There is not enough that one could say about such a riveting novel. I strongly recommend this to anyone that is interested in a wonderful fantasy that is willing to make a commitment. The best thing about &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is that there are two more novels that come right after it.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of a novel which some have called the Greatest Novel of the 20th Century. Personally I have never liked such titles, but I will say this is an amazing work. J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination is matched only by that of Frank Herbert, in my humble opinion.The novel starts off innocently enough with the departure of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who was the hero in The Hobbit. Soon, however, we learn that one of the items his nephew Frodo inherited is not as it seems. It's belongs to Sauron, the Dark Lord who, for ages, as tormented Middle Earth. Thus begins a journey of epic proportions.Tolkien developed full-fledged languages for the various races which inhabit Middle-Earth, inlcuding the Elves, Dwarves and others. He also developed a history for all the peoples which gives the story added depth, a depth unparalleled in fantasy novels which attempt to recreate the magic of this work. Authors such as Robert Jordan would do well to re-read this novel and learn the fact that sometimes brevity is best. Tolkien has the ability to give the reader enough information to make the story interesting while not loading him/her down with useless details.The reader will, by the end of the novel feel as if he/she has read a history of a world gone by, a place which truly exists. You will find yourself wanting to visit the Shire, to walk down the old road to Rivendell and visit the elves who dwell there. From the fields of Hollin to the darkness of Moria and the evil power dwelling in Barad-Dur, this novel is excellent. If you read only one novel this year, read The Lord Of The Rings."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Few can compare to Tolkien for fantasty writing. Every time I pick up this series I find myself astounded by the beauty of the writing and the richness of the characters. It's different now that I've seen the movies. I find myself trying to picture places and things from viewing them on the TV screen instead of relying on my imagination more. Once I finally start to imagine things again though it's like Dorothy stepping into Oz - full blown color, brilliant scenery and fantastic creatures that I've known since I was a child.One of my favorite characters was left out of the movies and, while at first I was disappointed, getting reacquainted with him in reading was made even more pleasurable. Tom Bombadil, in Tolkien's own words, is an enigma. He does not fit the molds, fantastic though they may be, created for the other races and characters. In speaking to my dad about this read through I mentioned that it's incredible to me how Tolkien wrote in such a distinct way, not only in describing and speaking as individual people in the book, but also how sweeping he wrote about their races as a whole. When the Hobbits speak, they are Hobbits. The same with the race of man, elves, dwarfs and even the council-folk. Each voice carries the weight of history of their kind behind it and that's not an easy thing to accomplish and one that, in my opinion, is often forgotten about or overlooked.I love re-reading these books. I still feel the same thrill when Elrond says, \\".. This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great\\". I still quake with fear when the drums beat deep within the heart of Khazad-dum. I wonder at the description of Galadriel but still can feel a kinship with the longing for home and a hearth that Sam often wishes for. I could go on for house speaking of my love for this story.. but this is not the time or place for it.If you haven't read it, I highly encourage you to do so"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Words cannot describe my love for this book. Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring has a plot and storyline superior to most books that I have read. I loved reading it to the end. Tolkien set out to create something far different than what had been made up until this point: Just a regular story with little background on the characters and places. Tolkien created something a thousand times better. He did a great job introducing all of the characters and actually writes about them in such a way that makes you feel like they are real. The plot is very original, especially for the time period that it was written in, and shows the thought and time that Tolkien put into writing it. Throughout the book, the reader is able to picture some amazing things in their mind, and allowed to really create his or her own world based on what Tolkien has written. The reader can visualize the different places and people in the book, and it is fun to do so.As for the characters themselves, there are quite a few of them. They each have a mind of their own, with all of them coming together seamlessly and creating a great book. One of the characters that I think is most significant is Frodo Baggins. He is a hobbit, a normal half-ling, that gets thrown into a quest to save Middle-Earth, and I like how Tolkien didn't try to create some supernatural character for this story to accomplish this task. Frodo had many flaws and had to overcome his weaknesses.Although it is one of the best books that I have read, there are a few minor criticisms that I have for the Fellowship of the Rings. Since Tolkien spends so much time describing the story and since he needs to explain so much, the book does become slow during multiple points of the book, as some other people have mentioned. However, most books have slow points, and this really is not a true reason why anyone should not read the book. I personally think that so much description adds to the high level of praise this book deservesAnother setback is that the story gets confusing due to all of the places and people of Middle-Earth, and the events that take place in the book. It makes it hard to follow and you might end up with a need to reread some of the pages to fully get a grasp on what is happening.Overall, this is an amazing book and I would recommend it to anyone that loves fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is perfect for the person with time on their hands. You can't just read it once, read it over and over again, you'll have to.

I couldn't believe how much I was in the adventure, and how much I felt for the characters. J.R.R. Tolkien does a tremendous job of attracting readers of all ages. This book, along with the others, are loaded, from cover to cover, with adventure. It seems that as soon as the fellowship gets out of trouble, there's another group of orks, wizards, or any of these creatures that are described in great detail. This is one of only a couple of books that I actually felt and cared for what would happen to Frodo, Aragon, and the rest of the fellowship og the ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the novel The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring as an exercise for his profession in linguistics. The beautifully written adventure is about a man and an important task that befell him.The tale begins in a small hill in Hobbiton called Bag End where Bilbo and Frodo Baggins dwell. Frodo receives and heirloom from Bilbo that will put him on an adventure of a life time. He leaves Hobbiton with only one companion but ends up with eight, also meeting friends along the way. As Frodo passes through the land of Middle Earth, he meets great evil, but he also has his friends to help him through.As I read this book, I kept thinking about how the story was an epic battle between good and evil. Every day Americans face bad situations with drugs and violence. This is a great book for the adventurous at heart and people who want to travel to a distant land with out actually going anywhere. Tolkien uses great feeling and emotion when writing the elvish songs and chants. He also describes the landscape so well you can visualize it in your mind. In one of the songs, it talks about an elvish queen, Galadriel, and the land she rules, Lothlorien. \\"An elven-maid there was of old, a shining star by day: Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, her shoes of silver grey. A star was bound upon her brow, a light was on her hair, as sun upon the golden boughs, in fair Lorien the fair\\". I highly recommend this book to any one who loves adventures and I also would recommend that you would wait to read the series until about seventh grade. Over all on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a 15!In conclusion, this story about a man and his adventure was excellently written and well thought out and a wonderful story for all who might take the time to read it.

Tolkien's storyline is rich, his characters are deep, and his world incredibly detailed. Therein lies the problem. While I do love the story, the books tend to drag. Tolkien had a great fondness for convoluted stories, thus you have a great amount of extraneous information. There are characters that have no real plot value (which is fine as long as you don't spend much time on them). He also spends too much time on character development at times. I don't like to spend so much time singing songs, reading poems, or perusing the menu...bring on the Nazgul!!! I think this book should be required reading for school writing courses however. At the very least it must be respected as the prototype work for the entire fantasy genre. As much as I love the story however, (I read the series at least once a year) this is one of the rare occations where I feel the movie was more entertaining than the book.

He seeks the Ring he forged 2,000 years ago, holding within the small golden band the power to enslave the world. All he must do is find it. This is the precise situation that the people of Middle Earth had to go through in the Fellowship of the Ring the first book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds. From the dark halls of Moria, to the Enchanted Golden Woods of Lothlorien, the reader watches Frodo Baggins and eight companions, on their journey to destroy the one ring. This can only be accomplished by throwing it into the fires of Mount. Doom, located at the heart of the Dark Lord's territory. The Fellowship of the Ring has exceptional fighting skills, and a strong will, but neither of these are enough to ward off the evil amongst them, and it won't be long until the lust for the Ring is so great, that the members of the Fellowship cannot resist it, and crave it for themselves.

After Frodo is attacked he has help and is taken somewhere. Before he goes any further, more people come along and helps him out. As they are traveling they go in a cave and fight all these goblins to get out. Now they are out on the field fighting and almost everyone dies for Frodo so he can get to the fire then travels down into the land of Shadow.The book is very long but is so exiting and fun to read. I think this because I can read this particular book without going away and not reading it again. It was hard to read were there was a lot going on but the book is so interesting it makes you want to read it.My favorite part of the book is were there is war in the beginning was started by a king who made the best ring out of the fire and people were fighting for it because it had power over all. When the war started there was a whole lot of rings that only the most powerful of all held. About 15 rings were on the earth. Before this time there was a story of Frodos uncle of how he got the ring. He passed it down to Frodo because his days were almost gone and he couldn't live with it because soon or later someone would find him and kill him.I found something very interesting about the book but I must not say. It happens all in just one day. I convince you to read this book, one, it would give you something to do and you can do all your project off of this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I loved &quot;Lords&quot; in the movie theater and was excited to add it to my budding dvd collection, but I could never get the video to work on my dvd player.

This ring is a ring of power that will give the evil lord Sauron ultimate power. It turns out that a hobbit named Bilbo has acquired the ring over time. The ring has a bad effect on Bilbo after years of having it because of the evil power inside it and gives it to his nephew Frodo before he leaves reluctantly. Frodo learns about the evil power of the ring from his good friend Gandalf the wizard and decides to destroy it and THEN.........You will have to read it to find out. Well anyways the book is a little hard to read and very big but it was good and very enjoyable and I had a good time with it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Against all odds good overcomes evil in a struggle for middle Earth. Frodo is the ring bearer, he carries the all powerful ring. He is being hunted by the evil Sauramon, the creator of the ring. Frodo's goal is to destroy the ring in Mt. Doom, the only place the ring can be destroyed. The only problem is everyone is turning evil, and they are al after Frodo. Can Frodo and his companions make it to Mt Doom. In this book I had many favorite parts. My favorite part is when they are traveling through the mines of Moria. This is my favorite part because that would be really cool if the mines were real. There are many themes that you can get from this book. The theme I got is never give up on what you are trying to do. In the book Frodo is going to make it to Mt Doom at all costs. There are many things that I like about this book. The main thing that I like is how descriptive the author is. The author describes things so well that it makes a vivid picture in your head. The only thing that I would change about this book is the reading level. He should lower the reading level and make the book easier to read.

Most of my friends wouldn't go near this book because it is so complicated, you really have to hold your breath and read. I have to say though, from my view point, I find the chapters long and exhausting. J.R.R. Tolkien has a very overwhelming sense of writing. But so unique it's story becomes classic. It took me months to read this book, and it will probably take me longer to start the second.

You will start your magical journey inside Tolkien's world with this book. And you will finish it with The Return of the King. No waiting for book 12 to come and go. It seems many of today's fantasy writers have decided it takes 5-10 volumes to get their stories going. Tolkien will grab you from the start, entrance you throughout, and leave you breathless at the end. And there is an end. A very happy, heroic, satisfying end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is it, boys and girls. The ultimate. Fantasy doesn't get any better than this. What more can be said about Tolkien and his work? The man practically invented what we think of as modern fantasy. Yes, yes... I know Tolkien took much of his material from older myths and legends. Trust me, I know; I wrote a 170 page paper on it. But that changes nothing. Without the earth-shattering publication of LOTR in the mid 20th century, fantasy today would be vastly different.Thus it is safe to say Tolkien is the father of modern fantasy. Yes, I love George R. R. Martin, and Robert Jordan, and Goodkind, and all those other guys too. They're great writers (for the most part). Often I just can't put their books down. But none of these writers can hold a candle to Tolkien. Pick your favorite fantasy work and I'll tell you how Tolkien influenced it. After reading LOTR you could probably do it yourself. Think of Tolkien as their (modern authors) muse. He is the master. The creator of the most intricate and detailed fantasy world ever conceived. For God's sake, the man invented his own language and put it in his books! If that's not dedication I don't know what is.Suffice to say, this book (and the other two comprosing LOTR) is incredible. Just amazing in every aspect. The pinnacle of high fantasy. And PLEASE, if you have seen the movie and are considering the book now, expect there to be discrepancies and additions in the writing. Peter Jackson did an excellent job directing the movies, but there is absolutely no way he could incorporate all of Tolkien's genius onto the big screen, even with several 3-4 hour long movies. This alone should give you an idea of the scope of the world Tolkien created."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is AWESOME!!!

The voices are diverse and rich with character without being over-the-top. The narration perfectly captures the beauty, scale, and terror of Tolkien's world. The only small problem with the recording is how much Gandalf's voice changes from Book 1, when he is in the Shire, to Book 2, where he is featured prominently. Also, this recording is not only completely unabridged, but contains the original Foreword and Prologue to The Lord of the Rings.

I FIRST READ THE HOBBIT WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I LOVED IT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE EXISTANCE OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS AND WAS DEPRIVED OF ITS RADIANCE FOR A FEW MORE YEARS. SINCE THEN I HAVE READ THE TRILLOGY THROUGH THREE TIMES (UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ONE OF THOSE READINGS WAS UNINTERUPTED). TOLKIEN IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY LARGEST INFLUENCES TO DATE AND I OWN THE TRILLOGY (THE BOXED SET, THE ORIGINAL SET- BOTH INCLUDING THE HOBBIT, AND THE CENTENARY EDITION IN ONE VOLUME AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOK I OWN), THE SILMARILLION, UNFINISHED TALES, THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH, THE TOLKIEN COMPANION, AND VOLUMES 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, AND 11 OF THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE EARTH BY CHRISTOPHER TOLKIEN. MY MATERIAL ON MIDDLE EARTH TAKES UP NEARLY A FULL SHELF IN MY BOOK CASE AND I TREASURE IT. A PREVIOUS COMMENT IS CORRECT ABOUT TERRY BROOKS, HE CAN'T BEAT LotR, HE CAN'T AND NEVER WILL, FOR THAT MATTER NEITHER WILL ANYONE ELSE. TOLKIEN IS SIMPLY THE GOLD STANDARD OF FANTASY LITERATURE. NOT THAT THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER GOOD LITERATURE OUT THERE (I.E. ROBERT JORDANS WHEEL OF TIME SERIES, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY TOLKIEN INFLUENCED BUT IS RE-MOLDED ENOUGH TO BE UNIQUE). I NOTICE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE CONFUSED COMPLEX AND HIGH WRITING WITH POOR AND RAMBLING WRITING- TOLKIEN DOES NOT RAMBLE, HE HAS A SLOW AND ELEGANT STYLE OF STORY TELLING AND ONE MUST PATIENT, FOR EVEN IF THEY FINISH THE BOOKS, THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE WRITING IF THEY RUSH IT. TOLKIENS GREATEST ACHIEVMENT IS NOT HIS NEAR-LIVING CHARACTERS OR HIS GRAND DEPICTION OF WORLD ALTERING BATTLES, NOR EVEN THE TORN ROMANCE BETWEEN ARAGORN AND ARWEN AND EOWYN, BUT IN THE FACT THAT HE HAS CREATED A GROUP OF GODS AND MYTHS AND LEGENDS (THE SILMARILLION IS MIDDLE EARTHS OWN GENESIS STORY). HE HAS CREATED NATIONS AND BLOODLINES WITH THE HISTORIES TO JUSTIFY THE FAMILIES'S NOBILITY. THE ELVES, THE DWARVES THE NUMENOREANS, THE MEN, AND THE SERVANTS OF SAURON ALL HAVE DEVISED AND DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY PUT INTO PRACTICE. HE HAS CREATED A WORLD WITH A BACKGROUND AS BELIEVABLE AS OUR OWN. THE WORLD WITHIN HIS PAGES SEEMS TO EXIST AS YOU READ THEM AND ONE SINCERELY WISHES THAT IT DID WHEN ONE REALIZES THAT IT DOES NOT. IF YOU READ IT FOLLOW SAMWISE GAMGEE, FOR I THINK HE IS THE TRUE HERO OF THE STORY AND I SOME TIMES CONTEMPLATE NAMING MY SON AFTER HIM, IF I EVER HAVE A SON. I WISH SOME DAY TOO THAT AN FAITHFUL MOVIE VERSION IS RELEASED, FOR FILMS ARE A GREAT WAY OF EXPOSING PEOPLE TO NEW THINGS. PEOPLE WHO SEEK TO CRITICISE TOLKIEN MASTERWORK SHOULD DO SO IN PRIVATE FOR THERE ARE SO MANY LEGIONS OF &quot;RABID FANATICS&quot; THAT THE FLAME MAIL WOOULD CRASH HIS COMPUTER FOR PUBLIC NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. IN MY OPINION, ANYBODY WHO CAN'T REALIZE THE GRANDUER THAT IS TOLKIEN SHOULD BE TOSSED TO SMAUG AS PUNISHMENT.

Since I haven't read the entire trilogy, I can't judge the three as a whole. There are some chapters that you can't stop reading, and there are some that you just can't wait to be over. It takes perseverance to finish, but well worth it in the end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have read many of the reviews concerning this book and I have to agree with them. Tolkien is the master of them all. It may be rather difficult to read initially, but if you have the patience to do so you will be rewarded by its empathic prose that will guarantee a long rewarding read. Whoever wrote that Terry Brook's The Sword of Shannara is better should consider the fact that that novel is generally regarded by many as a rip-off of The Lord of the Rings. It's that influential. The only authors of this genre that would come close are David Eddings and Stephen Donaldson. But Tolkien is still the king of the pack."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I simply have to laugh at the one-star review below. To compare Tolkien to Brooks is like comparing Mozart's Don Giovanni to Cats. One is art, the other is light entertainment. Not that art can't be entertaining (I find the LoTR immensely so), or that there can't be art in entertainment (I very much enjoy Brooks' work myself, although I don't think he's a particularly brilliant writer), but they just aren't on the same level. Tolkien's writing is certainly difficult, which may put some readers off, but there's no question that this is one of the masterworks of fiction of this century. It spawned an entire genre of high fantasy, and few if any authors in the genre can claim to be uninfluenced by his work. The trilogy rewards multiple re-readings. Fans of Tolkien's work, I suggest doing some research into Old English literature (Beowulf, for example) -- this was Tolkien's area of study, and you can see the influences from that tradition in LoTR."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This trilogy is like Michael Jordan: the best there is, the best there ever will be.

And to J.R.R Tolkien, who dwells now in the gardens of Vinyamar in the Uttermost West: Thank You."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Tolkien's saga is a magnificent work. Unparalleled in scope and detail. Few other works of fantasy even come close to creating the mythic appeal that this novel has evoked. I believe Tolkien's work is now considered a form of mythology than a mere novel. It's characters are profoundly relevant in thought and action. While the political scheme and the places are far different than earth, the characters live like us and act like us, they come with all the quips and foibles of our character. In short Tolikien expresses this profoundly encompassing work as part metaphor, part fantasy story. This is more than a great read, as one reads it more and more, one is drawn into the world of Middle Earth, drawn into its history and its characters. This is not a novel to be read but a saga to be experienced."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Long ago in a distant land, there were nineteen magic rings forged for the Elven-kings, Dwarf-lords, and mortal men. The rings were magical and had bound in them the strength and will to rule. They were all deceived because the giver of this great knowledge was Sauron. Sauron then forged a powerful ring to rule all. Sauron takes advantage of this new knowledge by conquering Middle Earth. But not all resisted to Sauron. There were men who fought against Sauron to destroy his powerful and ominous empire. There was a great battle in Middle Earth. The battle was fought for the freedom of the men and other creatures for Middle Earth. During the battle, Isildur, heir of the throne of Gondor cut the Sauron's powerful ring from his hand. Isildur then tries to use the ominous power of the ring to perform the acts of good. One day Isildur was heading toward Minis Tirith, his home city, when an orc killed him. The ring left him. The ring was then lost, until a hobbit named Bilbo found the one ring of power.... If you want to find out the rest of the story, read the book!I loved the book for its exquisite details and amazing plot! This book will awe readers' imaginations. It gives readers a sense of hope as Frodo pursues to destroy the ring of power. I have learned the learned many things from this book, including the value of friendship, loyalty, and companionship."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When Tolkien began writing The Lord of the Rings, it was supposed to be a sequel to The Hobbit. But Tolkien wanted to write a myth on an epic scale, and he could not resist allowing his story to grow from a simple children's tale to the greatest fantasy saga of modern times.The transition is a little strange. The first half of this book is written in a tone similar to The Hobbit, so it seems somewhat juvinile. However, by the time we get to the chapter The Council of Elrond (about half-way through the book), the story becomes much more serious and adult in nature. And yet this works, because we see the great events depicted in the story through the eyes of the hobbits, who begin as innocent, sheltered country-folk, and end up as worldly adventurers. It is a story about growth. It is also about loss, death, and the passing of great beauty from the world.Fellowship is the first part of three, and in my opinion the least of the three. It certainly has its moments: The Mines of Moria chapter (particularly Gandalf the Wizard's confrontation with the monstrous Balrog) is fantastic, and Boromir's confrontation with Frodo over the Ring is extremely powerful. But I give Fellowship only four stars where the other parts in the trilogy will get five.Please read this book. If you've only seen the movies (which I loved, by the way), you only know part of the story. And although the books get better, you must start here, at the beginning. Better yet, start with The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Umm, hello? To people out there who said that they &quot;came to know every Elf, Tree, Stream, Ent, Rock, Dirt Clod, Hobbit. . .etc.&quot; and that they &quot;nearly danced a merry jig when Boromir died&quot; did you read another cheap copy of Tolkien or something? Are you talking about Terry Brooks and one of his characters of a similar name???Ok, I read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; before I ever read anything by Brooks. Well, actually, I read the first 80-some pages of &quot;The Sword of Shannara&quot; first but at that point I had already seen the movie &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; plus, I owned it and watched it many times in a row. I found Brooks' book to be TEDIOUS, BORING, A COPY and TOOOOOOOO DESCRITIVE. Then, after I saw &quot;The Return of the King&quot; I immediately started reading the LOTR trilogy. I LOVED IT! The descriptions were not boring AT ALL! Plus, may I remind the person who so mistakingly wrote the review I am referring to, THERE ARE NO ENTS IN THE FIRST BOOK!!! Merry and Pippin had not yet gotten separated from the rest of the Fellowship long enough to escape the Orcs and meet the Ents!Anyways, I found the descriptions all to be relevant, there was not a WORD out of place! Tolkien truly IS the Fantasy Master of anyone's time! I mean, why else would so many people try to copy him and end up doing such a poor job of it? It's disgusting. Truly, J.R.R. Tolkien brought us a new world of wonder, fear, hope and triumph and at a time when believing in success over a great evil was so important! Tolkien saw World War II, he saw a great darkness spreading over the land from East and West and he saw it ultimately conquered by people who had faith in Justice and Freedom.I found these books to be so entertaining, they really drew me in! I finished the first two within a matter of days. Unfortunately, Return of the King took longer because I had to start college again after Holiday break. However, the books are, believe it or not, better than the movies! I believe that if you have not read the books yet you should watch the movies first, then when you read the books you will be able to picture all the people and places even more clearly. Although Tolkien does a superb and INTERESTING job of detailed descriptions that are DEVOID of boredom!He was able to create a real and interesting dialogue between characters, and you can really sense the strong bonds of friendship between Sam and Frodo, along with Merry and Pippin and of course Gandalf. I felt that I knew these characters like old, trusty friends, the same feeling I had with all the people in C.S. Lewis' &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. I also liked that the trilogy was all about the continuing adventures of our friends and NOT their descendants! I have complaints with Brooks about that. (Three dark powers, three sets of &quot;friends&quot;, three hopeless quests: all carbon copies). With him, he stops when we get to know the characters and starts out again with their carbon copies in the form of descendants.With Tolkien, we know all of the people, their dialogue is always relevant, interesting and real, the descriptions are precise, to the point and necessary, AND the storyline is ORIGINAL!!! Tolkien wrote the Epic Adventure first, remember that, all you who think Tolkien is just yet another fantasy writer of a particular genre. When he wrote, HE was original, all the hordes of others came in the footsteps of Tolkien.Again, Tolkien had a flair for language; after all, he was a professor of that subject! He knew his stuff, and he was able to write wonderful relationships between people; he could make you feel the struggles and suffering; he brought a vivid world into my mind that has not disappeared! More people than not definitely know how good he was, judging from the fact that both a cartoon series and the recently done cinematic films have been made. Tell me where all of these are for Terry Brooks?The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is an epic for all time. It tells how the &quot;little people&quot; can triumph over seemingly insurmountable obstacles! These books should be treasured as a symbol of ultimate triumph! They are not just fantasy books, they are hope and courage for those who feel that hope had deserted them. They are encouragement for people of all Races, Ages and Denominations! And all of this is wrapped up in a GREAT storyline!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"For the last few years, critics and fans have raved over the new movie trilogy of Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but more than half of those people have not picked up the novels that started it all.The first in the series is &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and intoduces us to the cast of characters that we have all grown to love.This book starts by giving us an in depth history of hobbits and their laid back ways of life and a small history of Middle Earth as well, getting us prepared for the journey not only ahead of the charachters, but ahead of us as well.For fans of the movie, you are likely not going to be disappointed. The movie follows this book well, but as always, this epic novel is much better than any flick. We get much more personal with the characters and get more in depth conversations and scenes.The book is fairly long with small fonts and lengthy chapters, but the go by fast, due to the wonderful way of Tolkien tells us this story.For all that have not read this book for school because they had to, or just for fun, you need to. This book is a masterpiece in literature and it is only the begining of a long journey."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It is impressive what such a little thing can do... create enemies, persecussions, wars, and change the lives and destinies of hobbits, dwarves, elves, men and more....The Fellowship of the Ring takes you along the history of this magic ring, from its creation to its latest owner, and in doing so explains what the Lord of the Rings is all about.Three rings for the Elven-Kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,Nine for the Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne,In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lieOne ring to rule them all, one ring to find them,One ring to bring the all, and in the darkness bind themIt also tells the beginning of a quest...that of the ring bearer, Frodo the hobbit, who got the ring from his uncle, Mr. Bilbo Baggins, and old, excentric hobbit who was known for being adventurous and loving to travel, something hobbits didn't like or appreciate at all. Along with this present Frodo got a very unexpected surprise... the chance for an adventure that would take him along the lands of Middle Earth, looking for a way to keep the magic ring away from Sauron, the Dark Lord or Mordor. Eight others join him in this adventure, including three hobbits, an elf, a dwarf, a ranger, a man and a wizard. No one knows where they are going or if they'll ever get back...I honestly believe this is an excellent book, the plot is amazing, the chararters and this fascinating fantasy world all come to life... friendship, forest, magic, mountains, everyday heroes, evil, rivers... just everything.Of course!, the book doesn't have a climax ending, for, it is just one third of a larger tale, and you will have to read the other two to know where it all ends.I loved this book, but I do believe it should be read by older kids, or by teenagers because of the many characters, and descriptions, and also because it is a bit long to keep young kids interested (I tried to read it, and gave up when I was 10). I would also recommend to read The Hobbit first, for apart from being an excellent book, it will help you understand how the ring came to the hands of Frodo."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is one of the greates books I have ever read. J.R.R. Tolkien sets all of the standards for fantasy writers; past, present, and furture. I think it is a great idea for a movie to be created.

I reccomend to everbody in the world reading &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; because it one of the few books that you can totally get into and like.

The descriptions of the world's and its people are endless. That's provably why they were left out of the movie. Some of the descriptions went on for a about 10-12 pages and could get a little long at times. But there we'll worth it. The songs too seem to go on for a few pages. There great songs though. Tolkien is a master when it comes to the written word. Most times when I picked up the book to read for a little while I would end up reading for hrs. The book is 503 pages long and by the middle I found myself lost in an amazing adventure.I highly recommend this book to all ages.A nice bonus would be a j.r.r.Tolkien dictionary but I haven't found one yet.The next book in the series is the 2 towers which I plan to start reading tonight."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring is a epic tale about honor, loyalty and hope. It is about nine companion that set of on an adventure to destroy the one ring and rid the land of the Dark Lord Sauron. The main character, a hobbit, is Frodo Baggins and he sets out with his friend Sam, and relatives Merry and Pippin. Along with them come two men, Aragorn and Boromir, one elf named Legolas, a dwarf named Gimli, and a wizard named Gandalf. They are determined to come to the aid of Middle-Earth, the setting of this book that is based on an medieval England long forgotten. This story is told in third-person which tells of how Frodo got the ring, how he sets of with the said companions to destroy the One Ring in the land in was forged, Mordor, the land inhabited by the Dark Lord and his servants.This book is an epic masterpiece beyond question. The way that Tolkien writes mixed with the history and culture of Middle-Earth draw you in and never let go. I loved how he created such a complex history and his love for this realm he created.Another reason i loved the book was that the writing was so moving and interesting that you want to keep reading. Here is and example:To the sea, to the sea! The white gulls are crying,The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.West, west away, the round sun is falling,Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling,The voices of my people that have gone before me?I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me;For our days are ending and our years failing.I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing.Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling,Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling,In Eressea, in Elvenhome that no man can discover,Where the leaves fall not: land of my people foreverThere is such originality and love in the books that is hard to comprehend, but easy to love. This is why i love this book because the words and sentences you will read in there will never be forgotten by you.Another reason is because Tolkien integrates themes of honor and loyalty that make you wish the book will never end. The way he writes makes you wish you could witness the honor and loyalty portrayed throughout this book. Here is a example:\\"Come, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!\\"This quote was said when Sam and Frodo were completely exhausted from the journey, they had not eaten or drank in a day but Sam carries his master, because he has not the strength, shows the loyal of unimaginable proportions. He follows his master to almost certain failure and perhaps death, but he never leaves him none the less.This is a amazing book and i rate it 5 stars because of the complicity and originality in this book that you will find no where else."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Frodo lives a normal life for a hobbit in the Shire with his guardian, Bilbo Baggins, But his life is changed when he learns from the Wizard that Bilbo's treasured ring (last seen in The Hobbit) which can make the wearer invisible is a tool of evil. Soon he is setting out on a long journey with his servant Sam, and two other hobbits to destroy the ring but will he survive? With evil black riders on horseback, natural disaster, and orcs around every corner Frodo may have more trouble than he bargained for. And even if he survives all this peril will he be able to resist the alluring power of the ring?I've known about this series for quite a while but haven't got to picking it up until I saw it on a list of books entitles &quot;Even better than Harry Potter.&quot; Being obsessed with Harry Potter, I decided that anything even close to it's greatness is a book worth reading. And I was not wrong. THe Fellowship of the rings is a unique novel unlike any I've ever read before. With a colorful cast of characters (my favorite being Aragorn), The Fellowship of the rings is quite an entertaining novel. I had very high expectations when I first picked it up, and though I was a bit disappointed I still found it to be quite a wonderful read. I am defiantly reading the next two books in the trilogy. I recommend it to any fans of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I've read so many bad things about the Lord of the Rings books that I really didn't think that I would like this book. Now that I've read it, I don't think that the word &quot;like&quot; would do the book justice. The Fellowship of the Rings is a true classic, and the book really deserves its popularity.This is the well-known story of Frodo. He has the unfortunate destiny of being the bearer of a ring that could give the dark forces of Middle Earth unbeatable power. Frodo, along with some friends is given the task of traveling into the middle of those dark forces to destory the ring.That is a really, really, really simplistic synopsis of the plot of the novel. Tolkien created an entire world within the pages of the book and the reader gets all of it. The creation is really amazing, and the writing itself is not bad. The characterizatioin are very good. The prose isn't archaic, and it flows nicely giving the reader each emotion that Tolkien meant for the reader to have. There is a lot of action. It is always exciting. I am only sad that I put off reading the book until I saw that a its movie was about to come out. I know that millions of readers have enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and millions more will surely read and be captivated by this in centuries to come."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the GREATEST book of all times(besides the rest of the Lord of the Ring trilogy and the Hobbit.)!!!

I mean, I have read Hobbit, that's the only of his books that has been translated in my language, but English books are unfortunately hardly available here. I could, of course, have them through Internet but there's a problem that my student's scholarship does not quite coincide with the normal Western prices. ( If somebody's interested, the scholarship for excellent marks is around 15 dollars a month - is it not ridiculous?). That's why I am writing this review hoping to find a friendly readerly heart. Is there anybody out there who has has got a spare copy of Tolkien' s works that he/she could share? It can be old and suffered, of course. I only want to read The Lord of the Rings desperately.

First, I must say that I enjoyed the story and it kept me interested. I will soon read the rest of Tolkien's epic. I liked the characters and how Tolkien made each one specically unique. Even within the journey, each character finds or learns something that helps his own life. The company changes and developes like Frodo's opinion and feelings toward the ring (and its destruction). My favorite characters were Sam, Frodo, and Strider. They were all responsible and loyal characters and I felt like I could trust them. Another wonderful thing was Tolkien's expressive language which he used to describe the setting. The woods and the mountains were pretty, yet scary when they needed to be. It was easy to see the darkness (of Mordor) and the happiness (of the olden days) through the chants and songs that were mixed into the story. They were fun to read but also helped me understand the basic plot. I also thought the plot was exciting; it kept me wondering what evil the company might run into. Another thing I looked for was how the company dealed with the evil chasing them. They faced their worst fear and horrible dangers. So it was interesting to see how they escaped such things, as the Orcs and the Black Riders."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the ring tells how Gandalf the Grey discovers that Frodo Baggins the hobbit has had the almost forgotten ring of Sauron - the one ring to rule them all, left to him by his relation Bilbo.

Unfortunately, I thought unabridged meant that it was actually the book....I didnt know that 'dramatized' meant that it was literally a dramatized VERSION of LOTR.My own fault for being uninformed, but the 'unabridged' advertisement didnt help. I was expecting a mere dramatization of the text...not an audio version of a sort of LOTR play...For purists like myself, this just wont do. If you are going to do something other than the actual book, you may as well watch the movies.For kids or non-purists, this is VERY well done.......however, be warned...if you listen to this before you challenge yourself to read the book, it could destroy your ability to appreciate the actual book, difficult as it is...to a greater extent than even seeing the movies without actually reading the book. If you know the basic plot of the book, all the twists and drama, before you read it, then you will probably never tackle the book even though it is unspeakably better than the films or any 'dramatized' version."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I was led to believe the CD was unabridged by reviews, even though the product description is not very clear. I also was hoping for a single reader, as opposed to full cast (just a personal preference). Once again reviews reassured me there. I ordered it and got a 3.5 hour fully casted telling of the story. I listened for about 2 minutes before I realized it wasn't an unabridged reading, checked the back of the box, and sure enough it said it was abridged.I hate giving a 1 star, because I know the book, and it should be a 5 star. It seems there's a mistake where multiple products are sharing the same review base though.If you're new to lord of the rings and aren't sure if it's worth experiencing, it most definitely is, but that seems like a given with it's popularity. Be wary of ordering the CD from this page though, because it may be the abridged version."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I began to read this book thinking that with all the praise I had heard it received it would be great, filled with action and adventure. However, the book is so detailed that it gets boring very fast. The extensive descriptions of the places that are being traveled through become work to read. The 360 something pages (I think) of this book could easily be condensed to a little over 250. Great plot and interesting at times but it ends up boring and tedious to read with all the details."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It was fairly good.

And one of the reviewers referred to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and said something about it being better than Dune. That's the last time I'm going to listen to a reviewer. This book has an extremely boring introduction that doesn't grip the readers. But motivated by that review, i kept reading, hoping the book will get interesting soon. It didn't. What I want in a book is a interesting characters, with real emotions that you can somewhat relate to. The personality is predetermined by the person's race and completely generic.

Tolkien is the best fantasy author ever to put a story down on paper. People who read fantasy and then call his work boring are obviously after a &quot;quick fix.&quot; In other words, they want light fantasy to kill a little time, they don't want an epic story to read. This is not light hearted fantasy. The Hobbit was, but this isn't. Tolkien basically defined the fantasy genre with these books. E.R. Eddison and one or two others are the only writers who had fantasy works before Tolkien (he was influenced to some degree by Eddison). I think the biggest problem for many of the people who don't like these books is that they are unable to identify with the main characters because they have no concept of self-sacrifice. The main characters in the book (Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gandalf) are willing to sacrifice life, pleasure, power and their own personal goals so that others might live free and persue their desires. I think its possible that a me-first attitude is widespread in the world today which makes it difficult for people to understand the point of view of the characters in this story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It's all here! This is the book that started it all! Jrr Tolkien was a brilliant professor of german philosophy and ancient languages. It took him over thirty years to write 'The Lord Of The Rings' based on his epic mythological poem &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, penned during WWI.In this classic epic, the Hobbit Frodo Baggins, relative of Bilbo Baggins who gets his own adventure in the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (which forms part of the back history to LOTR's) must travel from his home in the Shire (based on Oxfordshire where Tolkien lived) to the evil kingdom of Mordor to destroy the One Ring, a magical talisman created by Morgoth the Dark Lord. In the present Third Age, Morgoth's agent Sauron seeks the ring with the help of the corrupted wizard Saruman and his army of goblin-orcs. On his travels Frodo meets elves, dwarves, nature spirits, guardian-angels, fairies and heroes. His protector is Aragorn, disinherited heir to the throne of Gondor, destined to overthrow the mad pretender-king Denethor, who tries to burn his own city, like Nero. This books has all the whiz-bang special effects magic of the classic Grimms fairy tales, the trolls and unicorns you love to read about in Arthurian fantasy and the heraldic splendor of a medieval tapestry. The languages are unique to the book, invented by professor Tolkien as a game to play with his clever children.If you enjoyed Peter Jackson's profound and entertaining movie adventure you will enjoy the book it so faithfully evokes - The Lord Of The Rings by Jrr Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Obviously a creative story, but the movie is 10 times better than the book. This book moves very slow and more than half of the entire book is spent on explaining the mundane details of your surroundings. Everytime the characters in the book move from one place to another, the author has to stop the action and spend the next 3 or 4 pages telling you how many branches are on each tree and which types of leaves are on each branch. The other half of the book is filled with these long and grueling elf chants. This book lacks any real action and I wasn't able to read it for more than 15 minutes at a time without being bored to tears."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I saw the movie (all three actually) and I loved them. so i went to check it out of the library and... BOOM!!!! I was blown away. look out harry potter and percy jackson, Frodo and Sam are here now."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Though held to be a trilogy, this is opening volume of the six-part Lord of the Rings (each of the three LOTR novels has, as Tolkien counted it, two books inside them) and when I was younger it was my favorite in the series. Fellowship begins amid the pastoral utopia of the Shire, as the venerable Bilbo Baggins, hero of The Hobbit, prepares to celebrate a particular milestone in his life, and from there the pace changes as dark dangers begin to appear in this quiet backwater, as they have long-since done in other lands of Middle Earth. Soon Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's nephew, finds himself, along with his beloved servant Samwise and two hobbit friends, Merry and Pippin, traveling toward Rivendell, a great elvin city. After surviving the journey to Rivendell, meeting the mysterious ranger Strider, and taking part in a council where the representatives of the mightiest of Middle Earth's peoples gather, the quartet of hobbits join the Company of the Ring, a dwarf, an elf, a human warrior, the ranger Strider (now revealed as Aragorn, the heir to the Kingdom of Gondor) and the wizard Gandalf, and set out on a perilous mission to cast into the fires of Mt. Doom, the One Ring, tool of Sauron, the Lord of the Rings, foe of all that is good in Middle Earth, and would-be enslaver via war and tyranny of all that lives. This is the novel wherein we learn the fate of Balin from The Hobbit, where we briefly encounter Tolkien's most enigmatic and whimsical, yet perhaps most powerful of all beings, Tom Bombadil, and where we enter the dreary mines of Moria, legendary dwarven city carved deep under a mountain chain, and read of the battle of Gandalf the Grey and the demon of fire and shadow, the Balrog. Thrilling stuff indeed!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"\`Fellowship of the Ring', the first of the three volume novel, \`Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time. There is simply no way the whole story could be squeezed into three hours. Ralph Bakshi's attempt to do it was a total failure.With all of the truly demoniac scenes in the second and third volumes, not to mention Gandalf's heroic stand against the Balrog in the Mines of Moria, I really find the single scariest moment in the whole novel to be the one I read on a dark Saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing Frodo seated on a white horse in front of the Elven warrior Glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to Rivendell. It is no surprise that this scene is one of the most powerful in Jackson's movie. Jackson even improves on the scene by replacing the mighty warrior, Glorfindel with the very slender, delicate looking Arwen, who would seem to not have the snowball's chance in hell against the nine black riders.While almost all the scenes in \`The Two Towers' made it to the screen, important parts of both \`The Return of the King' and \`The Fellowship of the Ring' were understandably left behind when the film was done. Oddly, the single most interesting character of the volume, Tom Bombadil, was practically the only significant character left out of the movie. Bombadil is quite the \`deux ex machina', as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction, even by know-it-all Gandalf. Bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of Elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him, he will probably loose it and just as he was \`the first', he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain Sauron. In all my readings of Tolkien, Bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character, even more so than the wizards, as the wizards, the elves, and every other creature in Middle Earth (with the possible exception of the Ents) is subject to the evil of the ring. This suggests that all the peoples of Middle Earth except Bombadil and the Ents are immigrants from somewhere else. \`The Silmarillion' tells in great detail how the elves came to Middle Earth, and it is clear that the wizards and the men of Gondor and Arnor came from places beyond Middle Earth, but not Bombadil. What's more, Bombadil seems to have power over the ring, as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits' eyes. Bombadil and his soul mate Goldberry seem to be great archetypes for the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. In fact, of all the characters in \`Lord of the Rings', the contrast between Bombadil and Gandalf are two of the most interesting archetypes relevant to modern humans. I certainly have less trouble identifying with these two than with the diminutive, hairy-toed hobbits.While the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil Sauron, the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more \`human' scale, as it occurs in Boromir, Gollum, Faramir, Theoden, and Frodo Baggins. These struggles of conscience are masterfully depicted in the films. The most important instance in this film is the struggle of Boromir between his sworn allegiance to the quest of the fellowship versus his fealty to his father, Denethor, steward of Gondor.As great as the movies are, and they are masterful in how much of Tolkien's story they got onto film, the depth of history and linguistic richness Tolkien creates simply cannot be conveyed in three hours.

So I avoided it, preferring instead \\"realistic fiction\\" with \\"meaning.\\"When the first movie was released, my aunt asked me to please give them a try so she could see what someone else who had read the books thought of it.I am grateful to my aunt for encouraging me to do this. I was extremely impressed with the movie, but what truly made me love it was that it showed a glimmer of the magic of the book. But does it rival the book? Not in a million years.I'm ashamed of my initial fear that this fantasy book would not have \\"meaning.\\" The struggle to destroy the Ring, though fantasy, applies to the lives of any of us who have ever carried a burden. That is to say, to most of us.If you are afraid of the length and wordiness of the story, I still suggest you give the book a try: even if you find yourself skimming descriptive parts, you will still get something out of this book. Perhaps later you will want to reread it and see what else you can get out of it, but even if you do not, you will still have gotten something from it in one quick read.Also, to those of you who have read \\"The Hobbit\\" and did not enjoy it: I urge you to try the Lord of the Rings anyway. The difficulty I had with The Hobbit didn't continue through the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit seemed more like a delightful but light children's adventure, while the Lord of the Rings is much deeper. The two works have extremely different tones, so they might appeal to different audiences. The Lord of the Rings beautifully enthralling while also thought-provoking. Even with its darkness, it is, in the end, ultimately comforting."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" more than a couple of times in the past but was admittedly leary about the \\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\". Perhaps the size of the collection was intimidating...I am so glad I got over that!! I just recently finished part 1, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and am currently working on \\"The Two Towers.\\" The books are absolutely mind-boggling!! They start up right where \\"The Hobbit\\" leaves off and are nothing short of adventurous and other-worldly. Tolkein creates a world of elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and men that is fantastical in scope yet wholly believable. Tolkein knows how to pit evil against good in an epic and spectacular way.I would literally stay up nights until 2am with my little reading light, driving my husband crazy because I simply couldn't rest until I got to the end. I feel the same way about the second book! What's more is that I've read that the third book, \\"The Return of the King\\" is even better and I couldn't be more excited to get into it.If you are a lover of good books and have been avoiding \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" because of all of its current movie hype, I can assure you it would be a foolish thing to pass up. Also, if you really want to start off right, begin with \\"The Hobbit\\" (if you have lots of time on your hands I would suggest starting with \\"The Silmarillion\\" which is the start of it all).Tolkein was a world famous philologist and created his own \\"Elvish\\" language to create these books.

Tolkien outdoes himself with this first installment in the world famous trilogy, exceeding all limits with his creation of a new world, characters so deep you'll never be able to get yourself out of their heads after the first fifty pages, and a plot so complicated, and yet easy to understand for the reader, that the first time I read it, (when I was seven or eight), I knew that it was the best work of fantasy that I would ever read. I read it, read the other two of the trilogy, and read them all again, and again, and again, and I have read them at least once annually since. When you look at the trilogy all together, it looks like you'll never finish it, but the key to that is to read the first one, without thinking how long the others are. You'll love them, these priceless gems of fantasy from the mind of a genious, I garuntee it.This edition is an example of a faithful unaltered or abriged, true to the author edition that you can trust, and read over and over, until it falls apart. I recommend it.The plot centers around a ring, made in the distant past, which was created to give the dark lord Sauron the power to overrun middle earth with darkness and untold malice. He made the ring in the volcano in the middle of his dark kingdom, and that it the only place where it can be destroyed. But it was stolen from him. Follow the adventures of a Hobbit (a small sort of person, like a dwarf, but without the beard) to whom the ring has passed.

I had read the Hobbit and enjoyed it but never finally felt compelled to pick up J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring. The characters of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and Gandalf are more complex than I expected and I loved the slow build up as both dread and unbearable tension are increased with every step on their long journey. The novel has a quicker pace after the Council of Elrond and the previously established atmosphere is put to good use and delivers on all its promises.

At his birthday party he left the Shire and left every thing he owned to his heir Frodo Baggins; he even left the magic ring. Gandolf the wizard finds out that the ring is the evil ring-of-power that was made by the Dark Lord Sauron.

On their journey to destroy the ring they meet many evil dangers including one Gandolf the Grey can't beat.I recommend this book to people who like action and drama.

My taste has always been of the classic, 18th and 19th century literature (i.e. Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, Louisa May Alcott, Oscar Wilde and so on).I am proud to say that Tolkien has broadened my selection of stories from which I now choose to read.Tolkien has a way of bringing a scene alive like the greatest writers of all-time. While reading The Fellowship of the Ring I felt as though I were there with the Fellowship; fortunately I was not. Some may think he labors a scene with descriptions but I assure you he does not. Everything he writes is for a purpose at some point in the story. And I might add, the best stories are those that give the most background about characters and places. Nothing is worse than a flat character, except bad writing.To those who decide not to read this trilogy I say this: You are missing out on two things: first, one of the most fantastic stories told of all-time and second, on an exquisite piece of writing.Incidentally, if you do read this trilogy be sure not to miss The Hobbit and The Silmarillion. The former is what I'd call the \\"prologue\\" to the trilogy and the latter is considered the bible of Middle Earth.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"WOW! This book is just unbelievable! Took my breath away....A story that shows the virtues of friendship, love, sacrifice,....a real heartwarming story. What i really liked about this book was that the hero of this story was a small, measle character who does not know what he's in for, or how he's supposed to save the day, he relies on his friends...its very rare because nowadays &quot;heroes&quot; are muscular, handsome men who know absolutely, everything, right? Well, read this story &amp; you will be absolutely touched.Frodo, a small hobbit (humans that are generally 3'6&quot; &amp; have furry feet, read The hobbit for more), was chosen by fate to be aringbearer &amp; bring the one powerful &amp; dangerous ring that rules them all to Mordor, the only place it can really be destroyed. He faces danger &amp; obstacles every path on the road.Read this! believe me, it might take a while, but it will definitely be worth your while!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Hopefully the first film of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; will cause many viewers to read the original books. Open the books, start reading, and you'll find the real treasure.If you have seen the movie and are new to the books, be prepared for a few things to be different:1 - Tolkien has to construct his world (Middle Earth) with words. Sounds ridiculous and obvious, but Tolkien spends a LOT of time describing this world, these people, and their history. In fact, most readers new to the book will probably find more information than they wanted to know. Understand, however, that for this world to be believable, Tolkien had to dive in and create a believable world that you could sink your teeth into. There's a lot of description and it's all important. Don't get discouraged.2 - The action is not as frequent as it is in the film. Get used to that. The action comes, but Tolkien wisely leaves a lot of the detail here up to the reader's imagination. When it comes down to it, the book is really not about the action as much as it is about the characters and how they behave. You get a little of this in the film, you get a lot of it in the book. Savor it.3 - Read 'The Hobbit' first. Even if you saw the film, you need to read the &quot;introduction&quot; to the series. It's fun, not too long, and will help you understand the goings-on of Middle Earth.If you are about to undertake the journey of Middle Earth for the first time, I envy you. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is one of the great works not only of fantasy, but of all 20th Century literature. Be patient. Before you know it, you'll find yourself in the world Tolkien made and loved. I think you'll love it too."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is enjoyed by millions. It has a good plot, interesting characters and it's recently been made into a hit motion picture. This book has a wonderful middle and an excellent ending. However I felt the beginning dragged. There are many drawn out and boring parts. It took me a while to get into the story and I'm not a dummy. This book is a good read. Just don't give up on the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There are several words to describe 'The Fellowship Of The Rings' yet few seem good enough. It is a true classic of its genre and will be remembered in many years to come. I have to admit that I was only tempted to read this book when I had seen the movie (which is also superb) and after a few reservations I had become hooked. The story is basically about the Ring of Power, controlled only by the evil lord Sauron. It is carried by a hobbit named Frodo who can only destroy it in the cracks on Mount Doom. On his perilous journey he is accompanied by a fellowship, including fellow hobbits Sam, Pippin and Merry, the wizard Gandalf, ranger Aragorn, warrior Boromir, elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli.Firstly, the flow of the story is fantastic, although there are some areas where it tends to drag. However, not only are the key points of the novel mesmerising but they are also well written and will absorb even the most cynical reader. What is perhaps most admirable though is the background detail that has gone into the making of 'The Fellowship Of The Rings'. Not only are there various areas in a world entirely created by Tolkien, but different races have different lanugages, lore and culture which adds to the already superb characterisation. The frienships and rifts built up as the book progresses are also realistic and at times genuinely touching. Moreover it is a stunning work of fiction that deserves to be read by anyone with a passion for adventure, fantasy or mystery."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"All who has seen the movie, they must read the book. It is incredible and full of adventure. There is a lot more to the book. I wished they had added another scene in the movie that was in the book. There is part in which the Company encounters a group of Wargs (wolfs), and that would have made an interesting scene in the movie. Anyway, the movie is basically about 3 1/2 hours long, but why not add another 30 minutes to it- Hey, its Lord of the Rings for crying out loud, it could've been 4 hours or even 6 hours (with everything else from the book in it) for all I care. But anyway, the movie war GREAT! and they did a excellent job of editing it. I was born in 1978, and pretty much grew up in the entertainment world of fantasy (ex. the Smurfs, the Hobbit, Legend, the Laberynth, etc.).

There was never a monment when I was bored with the book. The only part that I didn't like was that it was a little hard to read. I loved how there were so many different places and characters that I could have never thought of on my own.

The characters come alive. It pulls you in. JRR Tolkien made the characters not human and yet have human feelings. My personal favorite character was Legolas. Mr Tolkien made him seem even more alive than in the movie.

Tolkien is the reason I'm not such a fan of fantasy (the other reasons being Squaresoft and other Video game companies, and a few bad authors). Tolkien was basically the inventor of all of today's popular cliches. A nobody who by chance gets a powerful object that must be delt with, an old pointy-hatted wizard, that dark force that wants to rule the world... despite all this, there really is almost no plot to speak of. Basically Frodo and company go from here to there and everywhere in between, with the events having almost no connection. Alot of characters were pointless too. What exactly was the purpose of Tom Bombadil, Rivendell, or Boromir? Ok, Boromir had SOME importance, but Rivendell ended up summing up what we all knew all along: that Frodo had to go to Mordor and destroy the ring (Which he does almost withut incident). I guess this trilogy is good if you crave adventure and exploration, because its certainly nothing if you want complex plots.On a side note, I rather liked the Silmarillion..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Let me see the flaws in this so-called &quot;masterpiece&quot;, that I should call THE LORD OF BOREDOM:1) WHy the hell all the characters must have at least two different names (in different languages)?2) The &quot;songs&quot; are a joke, boring, it only serves to destroy the narrative;3) endless repetitive descriptions of characters and environment, such as sunset, sunrise, &quot;the air was heavy and hot&quot;, &quot;the hobbits were tired and hungry&quot;, &quot;the fields were green&quot;, &quot;the sky was foggy&quot;, ... Uau, it's utterly boring!!!4) Heavy narrative. Tolkien should have handled his ideas for someone else to write. He's totally conservative, and you just can't sense the real urgency in the plot, as modern fantasy writers can do.5) Empty characters. The characters are lame and their dialogues worst still.6) Terribly drawn maps."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring: Book One by J.R.R. Tolkien is about three hobbits: Frodo, Pippin, and Sam, who take an adventure. Frodo has a ring that can turn him invisible, and the enemy wants that ring. The conflict in the book is good versus evil, where the good guys are hobbits, elves, and a wizard named Gandalf, and the bad guys are Black Riders. There are other bad guys in this series like goblins, Gollum, and trolls, but we do not encounter them in this book. The most interesting parts are when Black Riders find Frodo and want the ring, which happens several times in the book.You should not read this book unless you like explanations all the time and extremely slow pace. The best thing about the book is also the worst thing; Tolkien makes you think something will happen when Black Riders come into the picture, but most of the time nothing happens. This could be considered suspense, but it is also boring. Too often all that happens is the three hobbits travel, eat, and sleep. There was singing in this book, and the songs do not belong. The people who would enjoy this book are adults, not kids or teens. This book is similar to The Hobbit, another J.R.R. Tolkien book. The Hobbit was better than The Fellowship of the Ring: Book One because there was more action and less description."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The plot is some sort of Reluctant Everyman Hero Vs.

Leave it aside, go for the movie. Otherwise you will end up writing a review for the first time here.

Really.They are right when they say the journey was too detail and a tiring read. I would just want to add my point, this book sounds more like a history book of sorts (oh I heard from somewhere its suppose to be literature but I was too late) when the Council of Elrond take place. Generally the book has TOO MANY names of beings and places thrown to you very quickly without you ever recalling where they came about. Maybe I read it too fast to avoid the walking excercise in the book. Maybe I was not paying attention, ironically, its was supposed to be a book so great that I couldn't stop reading but then again I was too tired forcing myself. I am getting nowhere after 3/4 of the book. Henced I decide to drop it at page 330 and turn on pc to tell you this.I am not writing to criticise Tolkien.

After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed \\"Not another (...) elf!!??\\". Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is mindless, poorly written, and an utter bore."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I think this book is one of the most boring loads of... I have ever read. I am someone who tends to suffer a lot from insomnia, but all I have to do to beat it is just read ten pages from this book, and I am asleep like a baby. Although my opinion is definitely in the minority, I am far from alone either. I have read the ten most recent 1-star comments on The Fellowship of the Ring... The consensus is that the book is boring! J.R.R. Tolkein, like many other conservative academics, had a creative mind, but was much more of an analytical author than he was a storyteller. After seeing and loving the movie before reading the book, the book was a real disappointment. Most of the parts of the movie that I enjoyed were not even in the book to begin with! The scene where Merry and Pippin accidentally set off the dragon firework is not there. The scene where Bilbo and Gandalf are outdoing each other with smoke sculptures is not there. The gripping battle between Gandalf and Sauron was not there either! These were all things that would have picked up the pace of the novel tremendously if they had been there. They would have indicated real CHARACTERISATION as opposed to dry description and journalistic chronicle. The Harry Potter series may be bubblegum in comparison, but my God, at least it is readable! J. K. Rowling is ten times the storyteller that Tolkein is. If only you could combine Tolkein's creative ideas with Rowling's narrative flair, you would have one hell of a fantasy author."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"McCord of Asuncion, Paraguay says:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has you predicting from the start. By the title,you're probably asking yourself \\"Why is a ring so important?\\"J.R.R. Tolkien was a British man that wrote this series book. He also wrote The Hobbit and The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. It is a book mostly for adults, but a bright sixth grader can read it. Do not be surprised if you do not like the beginning. The beginning is slow, but the story gets better as it goes along.This book is the first book of a series of three. This book is adventure genre that takes place in middle earth. They tell of a very powerful ring forged by a dark lord. This ring is full of evil and very tempting. Anyone who puts the ring on turns invisible.A group of people set out to destroy this ring of evil. Some of these people were the elf, Legolas, the royal humans Boromir and Aragorn son of Arathorn, and the dwarf, Gimli. They encounter merciless orcs and fearsome ringwraiths on their journey. Can they go to Mount Doom and destroy the ring of evil without being killed? Find out.I did not really care for this book. Sometimes it was so boring I had to force myself to keep reading. I think that this man does not know how to make an exciting book. Some parts did not make sense also. To me, he seems to describe things too much. He also goes on and on and on. I found the movie to be a lot more interesting, exciting and make more sense. My teacher says that J.K.

Don't come to &quot;Fellowship&quot; expecting high adventure and fast-paced action - an introduction is what it is, in every sense of the term. Tolkien spends a great deal of time in &quot;Fellowship&quot; to recapitulate the history of the Ring in his prequel novel, &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; In large parts of this volume, Tolkien goes to great lengths to introduce his readers to the various types of people found in Middle-earth; dwarves, elves, hobbits, and men.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; begins with Bilbo Baggins, the hero of &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; now an elderly recluse, pondering a movement out of the Shire, sixty years after his adventure. To the dismay of his most immediate family, the Sackville-Bagginses, Bilbo has made one of his nephews, Frodo Baggins, the sole heir of his estate and fortunes. The day Frodo comes of age, his 33rd birthday, the same day as Bilbo's 111th birthday, Bilbo orchestrates an insanely massive party, and disappears. Frodo's primary legacy from Bilbo is the Ring - about 20 years later, Gandalf, a mysterious and revered wizard, appears to inform Frodo that trouble is brewing in lands outside of the secluded Shire, and that the Ring is the cause. Three of his friends in tow, Frodo leaves the Shire, his quest, to make a party of nine, and attempt to destroy the Ring. The action of the novel concerns the formation of the party, the Company, or Fellowship of the Ring.The long, detailed histories and songs of each group of people in Middle-earth featured throughout &quot;Fellowship&quot; can seem needlessly intricate - however, I think them to be the most valuable and beautiful parts of &quot;Fellowship&quot; as an introduction. The poetry is simply, but variously metered and rhymed - their most important function, it seems, is to indicate largely pre-writing, oral cultures in Middle-earth. They provide us with speech patterns, characterizations, the values of cultural diversity and pride, and a sense of kinship and tradition in the world of Middle-earth that Tolkien creates. In &quot;Fellowship,&quot; characterization is mainly of this sort, providing an overview of the major players in the quest and how they are each effected by the rise of Sauron, the Dark Lord, and his evil desires.The introductory volume to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; sets an excellent scene for the larger epic action to follow - we are exposed to a wealth of social and political issues that affect the diverse population of Middle-earth. The communal governance and barter economy of the Shire, the proud, but failing monarchies of the dwarves and fairies, and the collapsed monarchy of men present a complex web of social, economic, and military relationships between disparate peoples. It is absolutely fascinating to examine the ways in which relations between the various peoples grow, change, strengthen, fade, and reform during the novel, and especially within the Fellowship itself. For example, one of the most moving relationships in &quot;Fellowship&quot; and the epic as a whole is between Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf - two individuals from societies with a fraught history.This is quest-romance at its very best, and volumes 2 and 3 more than repay a close reading of &quot;Fellowship.&quot; There are many wonderful and captivating characters that populate the first volume - the cheerfully esoteric Tom Bombadil, the spectacularly magical Galadriel among them - who compensate for the first part's lack of intense action. I would reiterate one fact about &quot;Fellowship&quot; - it is the slowest moving part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; - the fact that it covers 11 months of time is but one indication of its sprawl and attention to detail. The last 50 years of continuous reprintings of the Ring saga prove that despite Tolkien's lack of real stylistic elegance at times, and the pace of the first volume, that &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is both enjoyable and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings trilogy was my favorite reading as a child, and so with the release of the movies I decided to reread the classics.The Fellowship of the Rings, although slow at times, is the timeless introduction to Frodo's ringbearing adventures. The story is truly wonderful and original, and I highly recommend this book to all!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What can one say about the beginning to this series that hasn't already been said? I shall try to throw in MY two cents anyway.I have long considered Fantasy to be my all-time favorite genre, but have found pitifully few fantasy books that for me seemed to 'click' with what I was looking for. I was introduced to 'The Sword of Shannara' and for years felt that IT was the Bar to be judged by--despite the nay-sayers who claimed that Brooks had borrowed shamelessly from Tolkien's works--but I refuted that over and over again, even though I had as yet never once read anything written BY Tolkien. Oh I had tried. I felt that the style was too weird for me, and somewhat childish when I gave it a go some 20 years ago. I never once even attempted to realize that Tolkien had created a world based in part on his own studies of history, and imagined a complex society filled with different races, and from scratch he weaves a story that combined historical speech patterns with his own fantasy world...in short, something entirely different, original AND totally entertaining.To say that Tolkien was a genius doesn't even begin to describe his character and imaginiative abilities. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' begins the Lord of the Rings by bringing us to the Shire of Middle Earth with Bilbo Baggins celebrating his Eleventy-First birthday. Shortly thereafter, he disappears (literally) leaving most of what he has to Frodo. Before long the One Ring becomes the central point of what he has left to the poor unknowing Frodo. Gandalf the Wizard informs him of the historical nature of the One Ring and of the impending danger that awaits every living creature of Middle Earth because Sauron wants it back and the Ring itself WANTS to be found. Frodo quite obviously does not want this charge, but accepts it anyway, and before you know it, he is set upon with Samwise Gamgee on a quest that he believes will be a rather short adventure--and it turns out to be more, a LOT more. From being chased by the Black Riders and Orcs to seeing sights he had never imagined and putting his life on the line more than he had ever thought possible, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' begins what is arguably the grandest Fantasy adventure ever written. One cannot fully appreciate the detail of this magificent story without reading it yourself. I imagine the release of the 1st movie in the Trilogy will spurn an interest in these books that hasn't been seen in several decades--or more. If history is any indication, it should (the release of Dune in the 80's alone sold an additional million copies).ANY person who enjoys Hard Fantasy owes it to themselves to see why The Lord of the Rings is so beloved and why it IS the Bar by which ALL Fantasy is judged. As much as I enjoyed 'The Sword of Shannara', it doesn't even begin to reach the originality that Tolkien created so long ago...books that hold up now as good as they did when first published in the early 50's. Once you have immersed yourself into this amazingly creative world, you will feel cheated unless you finish the tales that continue in 'The Two Towers' and 'Return of the King' (I recommend buying all 3 together, or getting the 3-in-1 volume so you won't have to agonize over what happens next when you finish the first part).Finally, I feel as though I cheated myself all these years by not only ignoring these books, but by claiming that they were pale in comparison to Terry Brooks' 'Shannara' (which I still like, by the way). Do NOT make MY mistake. Pick these up and if nothing else, see the movie which will compell you to read the story to see how well the movie measures up (which by the way, is surprisingly good in Myopinion). Read and enjoy. This truly IS Fantasy at its all-time best."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a masterfully written tale of fantasy written for people of intelligence by a master of languages. This is my all-time favorite book. I do not know how many times I have read it, but each time I am swept away by multi-dimensional characters battling as best they can against a powerful evil. Tolkien was a humble man who was glad to make corrections in his books as each edition was published and many true fans like to look for changes from one edition to the next. The attention to detail and vivid imagery are part of what makes this series of books the standard by which all of fantasy is measured."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I am 16 years-old and NOT a big fan of reading but this book sparked my intrest. I was staying up to 1 in the morning with a flashlight under the covers, just to see what would happen. And in class I place &quot;fellowship&quot;in my school book. (not a good idea if you have a big final coming up) If you read only one book in the new year, make to one of J.R.R. Tolkien's books, you WILL love it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"i've read many of the reviews on this series to some dismay. it seems to be understandable for people to not enjoy this story because of it's intricacy, but to call it poorly written literature is, in my opinion, unreasonable. I understand that many of the ideas being conveyed are somewhat dated, and as one review said, overly conservative, but one must keep in mind that JRR was born in 1892, so the author probably didn't have much of a choice as to weather his writing style was conservative or not. on another note, the story should be considered a great classic for all readers to at least make an attempt at. although it is a long story, there is not a word that i would remove. this book makes use of imagery in all its forms, cleverly written so as to be detailed while not seeming too wordy. An excellent story combined with memorable characters makes this a fantistic book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I read the Lord of the Rings series after hearing that it was really bad - usually when people say books are bad it's because they're to dumb to understand its importance. I absolutely loved the entire book - it kept me occupied for over a month - I read it three times over. It has action, it has plot, it has many, many themes, and it has this undefinable aura which makes it unforgettable - quite unlike Harry Potter, who wasted his time whining to Sirius about his stupid, superficial scar.

Lord of the Rings is a story set in a fake place called the middle earth, the middle earth is where bag-end is. Like Thomasville is in the United States. The actual Lord of the Rings is Sauron, the Dark Lord, who lost the One Ring that had most of his strength. He wants to get the ring back and make all the people in the middle earth slaves. In a very strange turn of events, the ring somehow ended up in the little hands of Frodo Baggins, who is a simple hobbit. Hobbits are little tiny people who are about half the size of normal people. They have big hairy feet and they are short and stout. Frodo is the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins. But somehow the fate of the entire middle earth rests in Frodo Baggins hands. With Gandalf, the powerful wizard as their leader, Frodo and three of his friends, Sam Gamgee, Pippin Took,and Merry Brandybuck set out to keep the ring from Saurons hands but destroying the ring by taking it to the cracks of doom, the only place that it can be destroyed. First the set out for Rivendell, a home of elves. on their way they are chased by nine ringwraths, but are helped but a man named Strider. They make it to Rivendell and with the help of elrond, an elf, Frodo accepts the challenge of taking the ring to the cracks of doom, in the the fiery of Orodruin, inside the realm of Mordor. They head south with all of the members of the Fellowship to take the ring. They meet a demon on the way, and Gandalf is no longer the leader of the group. then Frodo and one of his friends decide to head on to the Cracks of doom buy themselves. In the end they make it through many struggles and destroy the ONE ring and save all of the Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I know everyone says Tolkien started it all...blah blah balh...Everyone else is a rip off...blah blah blah.But I read Hobbit, then I forced myself to finish Fellowship, then got half way through the next book and gave up.I've got one word for this book...BORING! Too many songs...I found myself sifting through chapter when Tolkien decides he is going to spend 50 pages on a meal or a night of talking.I read these books following my reading of the Shannara series (Sword, Elfstones, Wishsong) and there is no comparison. Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions. I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does. The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force. Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me. I put the book down for several weeks at a time since I fell asleep just about every time I read it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I know this is going to rile the defenders of the novels, but the films were much better. I remember how the \\"purists\\" were all up in arms when Peter Jackson changed the plots around, involved characters in certain areas, completely deleated others, etc. Well, I have to say, Jackson did a better job in telling Tolkien's work than Tolkien did.Tolkien's problem I think is that he created such a complex fantasy world with so much detail that he spent his whole time telling us about every single minor character and the minute details of every scene and completely forgot to move the plot along.There were times when I was reading this series and I thought, \\"wait, wasn't that a part that was pretty big in the movie?\\" Such as the Ringwraith's attack on Weathertop or the battle of Helms Deep. These events were described with as much emotion and excitement as if Tolkien were describing his morning routine.And I ended up groaning when one of his characters would launch into a long speech about how he ended up somewhere or especially when one of the Hobbits would talk about the Shire. At one point in \\"The Two Towers,\\" Gandalf actually warns Theodan NOT to bring up such topics...I wonder if Tolkien himself even figured out he was spending too much time on these pointless back stories.Don't get me wrong, I love reading books that are rich in depth but this is a bit too deep.Then there are the songs and poems which are nice but...I stopped reading them after a while and went on with the story.The entire premise of the Lord of the Rings was supposed to be a conflict of good vs. evil and trying to stop evil from obtaining the one ring. Sadly, much of the book is devoted to telling us how these Elves ended up here and what happened at these ruins and who was there...again, all stuff that probably would have been better in a companion piece rather than clumsily put into the story like a concrete roadblock.The plot itself was also odd. Now I understand that Tolkien wanted to publish his work all in one giant book but was forced to divide it up. The man obviously doesn't know about climax and plot resolution and this is where Peter Jackson came in. The end of the first book just ends...Frodo dissappears and the rest of the fellowship are looking for him. The beginning of the second book starts with Aragorn finding a mortally wounded Boromir; we don't even get to read about the heroic stand of Boromir, just that he fought well but was overpowered. For the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, we get to learn more than we cared to know about the Shire and the journey to leave the Shire and the surrounding area is just painfully slow with little or no action at all...just a long history lesson about these woods or this hedge or that village....ughhIn The Two Towers, the first half of the book is devoted to Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas while the second half is solely devoted to Sam and Frodo.I don't know, Tolkien could have worked the plotline better concerning this and made it more enjoyable. Maybe he got lost in his own world as writers sometimes do and they forgot what the reader doesn't know.As for character development...there is none. The Aragorn you meet halfway through the first book is the same Aragorn that you see crowned as king at the end of the story. Whereas in the film, he is a conflicted man, unsure about his destiny and forced to decide. The characters in the book are one dimensional and you sometimes forget they are even there.I'll say it again, the films were much better or atleast the story was told better by Jackson than by Tolkien. Had Jackson been totally true to the story, we'd still be watching the movies I write this because every single back story would have to be told and the dozens of minor characters would have to be introduced and so on and so forth. In my mind, the movies are how Tolkien would have wanted his story told. His own books are the companion piece, to give more of a history and back story on the world that he created."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"...is another man's poison. Before I get flamed by rabid Tolkien fanatics, let me state that I've attempted to enjoy this book several times over the last 7 years or so. Each time, I've managed to get perhaps 1/3 of the way through before I finally give up. I mean, I enjoyed &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and, as devoted fantasy readers, it's our duty to worship L.O.T.R., right? Sorry, but this is one book of flowery prose that zaps me (and many readers, I'm betting) right into slumberland.

All I can say is that the movie is awesome and don't waste your time reading the books.P.S. I have to admit, the second book is better. However, I believe that is because of Frodo,Sam, and Gollum's scenes in the book. That is its only saving grace."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'm glad I sorted the reviews lowest first because I saw I wasn't the only one who did not enjoy this book.

This is the first fantasy story I can remember reading, way back in 1973 when I was in fifth grade, and even though I know now the story inside out, I never am tired of this book.For some reason, I find it more magical than books 2 and 3, probably because there is still a sense of innocence and youth about the main characters, and we still do not realize the full horrid power of Sauron. I enjoy the many songs and stories written, the more so because it is seldom done anymore because it would sound phony or contrived by other authors. To be short: This series built the fantsasy genre as we know it today. The majority of authors out there have,conciously or not, put aspects of this tale in their books.

The imagery and characters of this book surpass all others and the action, suspence and humor are like the books themselves, on a level of thier own. These are the fantasy books that all others wish they were, and they were written nearly fifty years ago in a time when &quot;fantasy&quot; was not a very accepted gener, for that matter The Hobbit was written in 1938! Anyone who says this book is sluggish and borish and that 100 pages that dealt with nothing but descriptions and references to things not even concerning the books needs to give up on conquring the -Extremly Tedious- art of thinking and go back to thier TV set were everything is painted out for them bit by bit.

There is so much sensory and depth involved, you can't help but be sucked into the story.

Even my brother (age 12) loves it (although he probably doesn't understand it fully).

I do agree that the very beginning of the book is a bit trivial, but it sets up the rest of the story incredibly well. Of course, the other way is the ultimate 5 star way, which i would give to the other two books. the second half of this book is absolutely stunning while the later part of the first half gets really intersting as well.

After sometime he finds out it is the ring that Sauron the evil character of the book wants. If Sauron gets the ring he can rule middle earth how ever he likes. So Frodo must take it to the one place it can be destoyed. But that place is in the center of Sauron's kingdom. So Frodo and a few friends set out on an epic journey to Sauron's kingdom.

Ever read the bible as a book that tells about adventures, dreams, goals and mystery? If not, do it, if so, read about the hobbit that accomplished Sysiphus's work. There are other novels, of course.

J.R.R. Tolkien, eminent translator and scholar, brings Middle-earth to life in The Fellowship of the Ring. A fellowship of nine companions sets out to destroy the One Ring: four naive hobbits, two valiant men, one dexterous elf, one steadfast dwarf, and the unassuming wizard Gandalf.The Fellowship of the Ring enthralls with enchanting moments like Bilbo's birthday party but chills the blood with its ghastly Black Riders. Written in the high style of ancient pre-history like Tolkien's prequel The Hobbit, once underway, Fellowship is a page-turner. Using third person limited narration, but often seen through the eyes of Ring-bearing hobbit Frodo, it recounts the first stage of the companions' journey. Tolkien's world is so real that I want to live there. The grandfather of all fantasy and science fiction, The Lord of the Rings is a must-read trilogy for all fans of those genres.

Tolkien's world and its history are painstakingly detailed. Characters and motivations are deep and complex. The descriptive writing is breathtaking.In the second and third books, the story lines divide and become more complicated. But in \\"Fellowship,\\" the plot moves forward in a powerfully continuous straight line. The only place where the action stalls is the chaper \\"The Council of Elrond\\" in which the reader is fed huge amounts of information and backstory very quickly. For those interested in the history of Tolkien's world, however, this chapter is a bonanza.The Lord of the Rings should be required reading in high school. Forget Shakespeare -- this is English literature at its absolute best."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Let me begin by saying that I adore Tolkein and love The Lord of the Rings. With that out of the way, I have to admit that of the three books, Fellowship is definitly the weakest. Because Tolkein viewed the trilogy as a single novel, book one is almost entirely exposition. The story doesn't really get moving until more than halfway through the book.Also, a lot of people have difficulty with Tolkein's language. This is one of my favourite parts of the book, but he is wordy and descriptive so it does take him a long ime to say anything. That said, reading his books is like reading epic poetry. His words flow the same way the language in a good version of The Oddessy or Beowulf does so it can be easy to get caught up in the flow of the language. I find that this helps me get through the books, as I get so immersed in the story that I have trouble coming out of it when I need to stop. Also, the flow of the words makes his lengthy description run past quickly.On a less technical note, Tolkein's characterization and plotting are magnificent. As slowly as Fellowship moves, you can feel the action building into something grand and vast. His characters are complex and vibrant, and they all have a well-developed range of actions and motivations. Even the pure, otherworldly characters have things that irritate them and make them snappish. This is traditional fantasy, so there is little depth to the evil characters, and a nearly inexhaustible supply of easily defeated minions, but it's not really noticable within the context of the story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien takes the world of Middle Earth that he developed and continues the tale of the ring. The ring first appears to us in 'The Hobbit'. The hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, keeps this special ring he found on his journey to help the dwarves. This book picks up the story decades after 'The Hobbit'.Bilbo has aged and in the course of celebrating his birthday leaves the Shire. To everyone's surprise Bilbo gives everything to his nephew Frodo, including the ring. Many years go by, and the wizard returns with a warning to take the ring and leave.Frodo and three friends begin the trip. Along the way the meet the Ranger who helps them get to Rivendell, home of the elves. At Rivendell the true identity of the ring is revealed and a course of action is decided upon. The ring must be destroyed.A band of nine people (men, elf, dwarf, wizard, and hobbits) form the Fellowship and begin the journey. This book sets the stage for the coming War of the Ring. We are introduced the members of the fellowship, gives us some background on Sauron, and the rings of power. We get a sense for the evil that the group is up against and the obstacles in their way. And soon realize that this journey is near impossible and may just be delaying the rise of Sauron.At times this book is hard to read. Tolkien goes into great detail regarding the history of Middle Earth and the characters involved in the story. This may hard for some readers to get through or keep track of. I, on the other hand, think these details add to the richness of the story. The story is wonderful and has much more detail than the recent movies.

Of course Tolkien's writing is horribly slow at times and overdescribed on others. This guy was a PROFESSOR, he worked his whole life in the field of Languages.

This book gave me many sleepless nights and had an end that made me itch to read the next book. It's no wonder why the LOR series has been a classic for many decades now."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Nobody has surpassed Lord of the Rings. Read it and you'll see.Tolkien spent decades creating the backdrop for the story, a tale that literally fills volumes and is also well worth reading (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales I &amp; II, Lost Tales (all volumes)). SF/fantasy writers today could learn something from this astounding amount of preparation. A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There's a plethora of reviews below mine (this is a classic after all) so I won't bother going over the story or taking up a lot of space with my comments. I will say this: I enjoyed this story a lot more now as an adult than I did back in grade school. I think this is because Tolkien focuses more on the characters' minds and their interpersonal (or interhobbit) relations than on simple swordfighting and stuff. The book concentrates on several human themes, most importantly being power and greed. In the beginning when Bilbo doesn't want to give up his Ring, we can understand why. We also understand how the Ring's evil power lead to the downfall of Gollumn. (The Ring kind of reminded me of the corrupting influence of hard drugs, drinking, gambling, and other social vices). The theme of despair is a big part of the story. When the hobbits reluctantly enter the Mines to try to cut through the mountain range you can feel their fear. The scene where they have to let one of their ponies go is a haunting one (&quot;Poor old Bill!&quot; is a line I'll remember) and you can really sympathize with these characters because they're not superhuman heros; they're everyday people (well, hobbits) in a tough situation. The ending is extremely powerful where Frodo decides he must take the corrupting Ring away from his compatriots and strike out on his own. When Sam catches up to him and heads off on this seemingly suicidal mission simply because he trusts his friend Frodo so much, it's a very moving scene.I'd like to comment that I read Stephen Donaldson's 1st &quot;Thomas Covenent&quot; trilogy (Lord Foul's Bane et al) and I liked them as much as I liked these books."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My girlfriend was reading Harry Potter, heh ... and she thought I should read it too.

Having read the Hobit in school (I reckon 8th grade or so - it was long ago) I was vaguely familiar with the plot. Criticisms I've heard I can sometimes concur with, it does get rather long winded with detail descriptions of meals that, if you took all reference to eating out of all six books (two in each part) could probably trim it down a few hundred pages. The other complaint is it often goes into nonsense poetry and prose in &quot;elven&quot; tongues, etc. Well, I don't read Elven so well and I find it difficult to even attempt reading such. These things aside the series is absolutely brilliant. Often just when you are sure you know what's coming next Tolkien will spring a suprise on you and twist and turn the events to the unexpected. It is one of the most remarkable fantasy books I have ever read and it is well worth taking the time to read. You must not simply buy Fellowship and not expect to commit to reading the other two parts: Two Towers and Return of the King. Fellowship does a great job of setting up the characters and you'll almost feel that the fellowship are all personal friends of yours by the time you make it to the second book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Literature for children, as opposed to children's books, is a work of serious fantasy where a world is created in imagination and then flowers from the author's craft. In both craft and imagination, no one rivals Tolkien. It isn't the story that captivates you, but how could it not, Sauron, perverter of beauty and good, unleashes the 9 Ring Wraiths to hunt down the Ring of Power. Who has the ring ? An innocent hobbit, Frodo, who has known nothing but comfort and love in the idyllic country of the Shire. Frodo inherits the ring from Uncle Bilbo who discovered the ring in the Mines of Moria while seeking a dragon's hoard. Frodo's introduction to the struggle between Good and Evil and his harrowing escapes from from the mounted Ring Wraiths is your introduction to the greatest work of fiction I have ever read. Tolkien's love of the mythology of Middle Earth which he spent a lifetime perfecting is inspiring and that is what makes it great.If you want a book that will last a lifetime, buy this one."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Most people coming to this review already have a good idea what the story is all about from either other readers or people who have seen the movies made from this three part story. This is not a trilogy the three-part story so you can buy the individual books but it might be prudent to buy all three at the same time or a combined volume.The reason I say buy the complete \\"Lord of the Rings\\" now is that you will just be picking up speed and getting everything straight in your mind and you will come to the end of this volume. Talk about a cliffhanger. This animal leaves you with several.Even though the adventure takes place six years after the adventures in Tolkien's \\"the Hobbit or There and Back Again\\", the writing style is also a little more in-depth.I am not going to paraphrase the story. J.R.R. Tolkien himself tells you what you need to know in the prolog.Many people have read things into this story thinking it was maybe an allegory of things like the bomb; but Tolkien says himself that this is not an allegory.Tolkien creates a rich world in which you the reader will feel you are part of the adventure.

What an amazing book. Mr. Tolkien is an amazing writer. The vividness of his world is utterly unbeleivable. When reading any of his works, I feel as if I am seeing and feeling exactly what the main character is seeing or feeling whether it be frightened or happy. The main character in this case is the hobbit, Frodo Baggins, who is the nephew of Bilbo Baggins, the lovable main character in the Hobbit. Frodo is heir to the ring of power and knows the terrible ringwraiths were searching for him to steal the ring which would enable the dark lord Sauron to destroy all that was good in the Middle-Earth. His journey is full of sights and adventures, both good and bad. I would like to journey to the Middle-Earth after reading this magnificent book.

It has everything you need: magic, might, swords, sorcery-but with one difference: Tolkien is able to make all these elements, put them all together and make it all seem real. While you read The Fellowship of the Ring, you feel as if Middlearth is a real place and that the characters are real too. I have never gotten so into a book series as Tolkien's Lord of The Ring. People sometimes say Fantasy is stupid or weird. I woudl agree for the most part (sorry). Then one day on a lark, I read The Hobbit and it changed my perspective. I came to realize that Fanstasy (as a genre) can be as respectable as mainstream literature. Tolien is a literaty genius.

So Frodo and three of his friends travel to Rivendell. From there they have to go to cool places like Caradhras, the Mines of Moria, Lothlorien, and, finally, the great river of Anduin.

Finding these books was like visiting with old friends and it's been pure pleasure to read these old tattered books. The pages have yellowed with age but somehow it seems very appropriate. The story is so well crafted that it has become timeless.I can only imagine what a movie version would be like if Lucas' Industrial Light &amp; Magic created the special effects. Unfortunately, given the time constraints and production costs of film, I don't think even a series of films could do justice to the books. No one would be completely happy with any adaptation.If anyone is considering reading this book for the first time, I highly recommend a comfortable place with good light and plently of patience. Your investment in time will truly be rewarded."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Compared to the rest of the Tolkien novels, this book might be Tolkien's weakest, but it has it's innocent appeal.

It is full of beauty,mystery,and terror. I really liked hobbits and elves a lot too. There is so many great characters that it is difficult to choose a favorite one,but I would probaly say I liked the hobbits,the elves,Gandalf,and Aragorn the best.Merry and Pippen are the most engaging hobbits but Frodo is the bravest and most serious. He would have to be my favorite character.Tolkien uses great imagination and description. There is not one dull chapter.Some chapters,like the ones in Lorien are very lovely while others,like in Moria and the barrow downs are terrifying.This is defiantly a great story and I recommend it along with The Hobbit and the other two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Is the best fantasy novel.

If you like fantasy books, you will be delighted with this book. With all its action, you will definitely be experiencing cliffhangers. It has a truckload of different creatures, some good and bad. I recommend you read The Hobbit first so you can get the idea of what went on before the story. Either way, this is a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Frodo Baggins the Hobbit hero of the Fellowship of the ring, is the main character in this fantasy book, Frodo Baggins is given a magical ring that turns the wearer invisible and slowly takes control of the wearer. The ring was lost after the war and was found by Gollum in a river. Gollum wore the ring far too much and became a hidous cave-dwelling monster, he calls the ring his &quot;birthday present&quot;. One day Bilbo Baggins who you can read about in The Hobbit( which in my opinion is much better than this book) came upon the ring and took it away. Bilbo sensing its evil power working on him, gives the ring to Frodo Baggins in the begining of The Fellowship. This book tells of Frodo and his companions begining their quest to destroy the One Ring of Power, forge by the Master of Mordor, the land of the shadows, they must bring it to cast the ring in the cracks of doom to destroy it. Tolkien goes into paragraph upon paragraph of detail. The first few hundred pages are very boring and some chapters have nothing of importance in the story at all, like the chapter The house of Tom Bamlibado or something, this tells of how Frodo stops his quest to rest in Tom's house and listen to Tom's pointless,long, and boring stories. There are two chapters in the book that are very fun to read. The only reason you don't stop reading even when you are dieing of boredom, is the promised and hinted excitment in future chapters. The battle with the evil wolves lasts only two pages and the rest is 20 pages of how Frodo gathers fire wood and walks( oh who cares).Too much detail, so what if their walking over mountains, it doesn't take 2 paragraphs to say they walked over a MOUNTAIN! VERY BORING BOOK! If you have got the patience to read this you can probaly get through it alive.I rank all the Lord of the Rings books I've read out of 10.1. The Hobbit 102. The Two Towers 83. The Return of the King(haven't read it but is has to be better than the fellowship)4.The FellowShip of the Ring 1.5"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Yes, this book is lush with descriptions and originality - originality, I'll make myself clear here, in its day.The world of Middle-earth is rich and fantastic - again, I must say, in its day. Tolkien have done a truly marvellous work. What, then, is my problem with this Father of Fantasy, you ask?Look at it this way, Tolkien created a new language, a world full of creatures that have become a model to the modern fantasy. But when it comes to characterization and persona? It drops down like a rock.Elves, by all and every mean, are all-knowing and all-wise; they are forces of good, they never make a mistake, they are immortal - practically, they're one step away from being divine. Orcs and other so-called evil villians, on the other hand, are evil, savage... etc. It's a world of black and white, and that's my point. There's no twist, no intrigue, no whatever that adds depth we readers wish to see from modern fantasy authors. Aragorn, for instance, is a rightful heir to the throne, a skilled Ranger, and so forth. But does he have any flaw in character? No. And everyone knows well how boring and unlikeable a perfect character is.The way he wrote it is out of date; it may remain popular and a favourite in others' minds. But not me."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There are some good and bad things to say about this book. The first of which is probably this. I think it's unfair that some people call this the greatest series of books ever written. Then again, in looking at some of the reviews, calling it total garbage is also unfair as well.In all, this is a good fantasy book. However, I must caution that if you are really into fantasy, this is not going to do it for you. Why? Well, really it has mostly to do with the fact that there is no one main character that can overcome everything. When the chips are down, so to speak, hope, luck, and a little ingenious intervention must be used by the &quot;good guys&quot; to escape trouble.This isn't to say the book does not have it's negatives, because clearly it does. But let's start with a positive and go from there. The first is that this is a very rich story. Of course, this is part of it's downfall too. There is a lot of history that only a Lord of the Rings scholar would be interested in or would be able to follow. The lore of the ring is one thing. But every character's history is handed down to the reader. Is it rich? Yes. Is it very hard to follow? Well, if you don't want to take notes, yes.Along these lines, one of the biggest complaints I see from people is that Tolkein should have handed this story to someone else to write, and I can see that perspective. There are a lot of flowery yet empty descriptions. But for me that wasn't too much of a turnoff. In mentally building a scene, I like to have it painted before me. Still, there were times when I was edgy to get the narrative moving. There were other times when I was downright bored by the lack of action.Bringing that thought around again, however, it leads me to proclaim that this narrative is more believable in that fashion. Classic fantasy books have balls to the wall action from cover to cover. This is not the case here. As such, this is more believable as a story that does really exist somewhere and Tolkein merely related that story to our world. The action is not overly sensational. Nothing is &quot;over&quot; anything. Of course, this is what makes people like it less.The ending of the book is dreadfully slowr. This is something that I take issue with. Someone else mentioned that there is no character development, and I think this is true. But I also think it's true that there doesn't need to be character development in what equates to a journey of a ring with a various number of escorts. The &quot;character developmet&quot; is essentially what you learn about the ring and the powers that exist to get it.One thing I particularly do not like is the excessive songs and poems. I think they add little to the story and only sevre to derail the reader who genuinely wants to see the story develop, not take another detour into history or a different tangent altogether. I wouldn't mind songs entirely, I don't think. But some are 3 pages long and read very dry.Ok, so those are my complaints, which started out as what was supposed to be a positive. Well, the positives are that the book is very enjoyable if you don't want a big strong lead character to destroy every foe in his wake. You likely will not sit down and get back up again when you're done. The book doesn't read that fluidly from cover to cover. Some things take digesting.I would recommend this book for just about anyone. Of course, you should read the Hobbit first, as it is the prequel to this series. The Hobbit is a bit more enjoyable than the first read but a tad younger in its target audience, I believe. This first part of the Lord of the Rings is a solid first step, but moves a bit more slowly and contains a fair amount of info not needed to really get at the unfolding narrative in front of you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I searched high and low for depth in this book. I looked in the dialogue between characters, naively thinking that sooner or later they had to betray something profound in their speech, something to intellectually justify this work's existence. I looked in the actions, the adventures, the songs - and I have concluded that Tolkien's epic, while engrossing and undoubtedly creative, lacks any real substance. When I read a piece of literature, I look for richness both in detail and in relevance to the human struggle. And though a central focus of this book and The Lord of the Rings in general is the ancient struggle between good and evil, this struggle is too often lost in Tolkien's obsessive detail. For instance, the second chapter of the first book and its significance is the reason I rated this book 3 of 5; it chronicles the struggle between good and evil, and for a moment drew me in, as though I was vested in Frodo's dire business. But soon after, the narrative of the book becomes overburdened with elf-chants and adventures that are compounded by Tolkien's linguistically savvy but stylistically flawed prose. The narrative maintained my interest, but barely. I prefer literature that makes me think; but Fellowship of the Ring does not make me think - everything I would possibly need to know about it is immediately obvious at a glance."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"&quot;One ring to rule them all and bind them in darkness.&quot; In ancient times these rings were crafted by 11 smiths, another ring was crafted by zauron to rule over all of these rings. This ring somehow finds its way into the hands of Bilbo Baggins (as read in the book The Hobbit), a small hobbit from hobbiton (being that all hobbits are small). In this book it starts out as Bilbo's one hundred and eleventh birthday. At the end of a huge party he summons his nephew Frodo to his hole (where he lives), he shows and tells Frodo the powers of the ring and his mission, to destroy it!The only way this ring can be destroyed is by taking it to the place it was crafted, the cracks of doom. Frodo forms a group to accompany him on his journey (these men are later known as the fellowship). They set out across Middle Earth to the cracks of doom. Along the way they meet many evil creatures and houses of friends to stop at. The book becomes very intense and exciting. Many surprising things happen along the way.This book is very entertaining and descriptively written. One thing I did not like was how it got kind of repetitious with the fellowship being attack them someone being kidnapped then being rescued then being attack etc...The book is also quite long and some how tiring to read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I think I'll be one of the few dissenting opinions here. The only real reason I read this was because, like so many other people, I had it drilled into my head what a &quot;classic&quot; it was. I managed to slog through the first book, after several aborted attempts, and there I stopped. I can kind of see where these people are coming from, who trumpet it as the all-time greatest thing ever. In one aspect, Tolkien was something of a genius--Middle Earth is an incredibly rich and detailed world. However, that doesn't make the books that take place there particularly good. The dialogue is less than sparkling, and the meticulous detail in which everything is described becomes really, really, tedious. The characters are incredibly two-dimensional--Tolkien's obviously more interested in showing us his world than in creating sympathetic protagonists. That's his choice, I suppose, but it really doesn't make for interesting reading. As far as characterization goes, there are two main types of characters: the pathetic little hobbit guys (Frodo, Merry, Sam, et al), and the powerful, cool, mysterious guys (Gandalf, Aragorn, Elrond, et al)--nothing too deep here. On a another note, I've noticed that there are really virtually no female characters--just Frodo's irritating relative, Goldberry, and a few elves, if memory serves. Gads, this is overrated, and the worst part is that it spawned so many even worse imitators--Terry Brooks, Tad Williams, and so on. If you want REAL classic fantasy, you should check out Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar series--it's superior in nearly every way."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I couldn't really get into this book. I'm such a big fan of the movies, and the beginning of this book is just too slow. There were a ton of interesting little facts I got from the book, but otherwise I don't think it's a necessary read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Before making comments about the whole 3-volume series, let me first talk about volume 1 (Fellowship of the Ring).While it starts off slow, the narrative and characters are interesting enough that it's not too bad getting slowly introduced to the Tolkien universe, Elves and Dwarves and Hobbits and the history of the Rings of Power.I was a bit bored by the childish poetry and singing, especially in the parts involving Tom Bombadil.The last two-thirds of the book build up suspense and speed, a good reward for plodding through the boring parts. The action sequence in the mines, ending with the fall for Gandalf, and the dilemma, betrayal and regret of Boromir, are both done very well.Now, about the whole series.Tolkien's &quot;Earth&quot; is formed out of a mixture of various elements of European myths and superstitions, transformed to form elaborate histories and characteristics of the various groups involved. There is an undercurrent of racist ideology, but if you ignore that, the whole effect is rather charming. There is a sense of doom and foreboding and danger, which is well-done, if a bit too drawn-out.I have to confess: I don't understand the extraordinary popularity enjoyed by this book throughout the U.S. and the West. It's a charming series, and the universe described is grand and all that, but does it really deserve the biblical status it seems to have gained?The racial subtext seems to be unnoticed by Tolkien fans. The whole series is a story of the good West &amp; North (elves, hobbits, western men) fighting the evil East and South (Sauron, orcs, eastern men). The Eastern men have &quot;oliphants&quot;, evoking the image of elephant armies from India. Tolkien describing orcs is suspiciously reminiscent of Europeans describing black Africans.Maybe the correct context can be found by thinking of the psyche of a British man (Tolkien) in the early twentieth century, also involved with racist South Africa. The European history of subjugating and raping Asia and Africa, seems to such a person a gallant tale of victory. And so it is reflected in the tale of elves, men, dwarves together defeating &quot;Sauron&quot; in the past.Now, in the early twentieth century, the Asians struggle for freedom. In the mind of the racist Brit, this is an evil challenge to Western hegemony. In the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, this is reflected as the new danger from Sauron gathering power in the East.If you disregard the racial undertones, the series is a fine piece of literary work.Does it deserve all the hype it gets? Maybe not.Is it worth reading? Yes, if you can spare the time, certainly. You start to understand many cultural references after you've worked through Lord of the Rings. Next time someone says, &quot;like Bilbo Baggins ...&quot;, or refers to some bearded guy as a Gandalf, you know what they mean."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I decided to read this book because it is a classic and everyone has read it.

It was really boring and slow moving. Watching the movie partly ruined it for me because the movie was so action packed. I highly advise you to read this after watching the movie so that you can read it with an open mind. Parts of it were okay, but near the end I got so sick of it.

This is one of the best books I have ever read. In this epic fantasy, the reader will experience breathtaking danger, overwhelming suspense, and beautifully created worlds.

Along the way he encounters many obstacles, sometimes almost killing frodo. The ring has much power, one power being when the bearer puts it on he will become invisible.

This first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy introduces the characters and how they came together and follows them until they are split up. This story keeps the reader in suspense as the party runs from the evil minions that chase them accross the terrain of Middle Earth. Not only does Tolkien tell a story, he weaves an intricate background of history, culture, and lore for his make-believe world. This sometimes causes the story to slow down as it breaks into song periodically. Of course, the reader may choose to skip the songs since the toon and rhythm is unknown. Overall, I rate this a 5 star story for Tolkiens brilliance in story-telling and attention to detail."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As a rule, I tend to avoid books that fall into the \\"fantasy\\" categoy, but I decided to pick up The Hobbit & the Rings Trilogy, to see what all the hubbub was about. Any set of books that has held up as long as the LOR must have some redeeming qualities, and I figured I should at least give them a chance. So far (after the Hobbit and Fellowship), I'm glad I did. What I found was an intricate tale of friendship, duty, and the inner strengths and failings of men, wrapped in an epic quest whose goal is no less than to save the world from evil.*And no, I haven't seen the movies yet, so I went into the books blindly.The writing is fantastic, every step taken is described in tremendous detail, as first the Hobbits leave their home and gain companions along the way. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the varying landscapes of Middle-Earth; from the mountains to the plains, Tolkien has a fantastic way of painting a picture. The struggles of the group and their wisdom and frustration are recounted in wonderful detail, as their pursuers attempt to close in on them.The plot-related minutae that fantasy fans love and most others hate is present in this book, and all but hardcore fantasy fans will find that the book bogs down a bit in the middle, where the reader is inundated with probably more detail than one really needs to enjoy the story. This is especially true during the Council of Elrond, where I was upset with Tolkien for not just getting on with the quest. The plot presented is wonderful in that the whole history of the ring and its quest are described in detail, but it gets a little slow at that point, and some may have to plow through that section.The final chapters of the book are wonderful, as the quest truly begins with the departure from Rivendell into the wild world beyond. The strengths and weaknesses of the individuals come to drive the plot to its ending and deliver a powerful message: that the seemingly weak can be the strongest among us when dire circumstances and great temptations arise, and the those who would be strong often hide great weaknesses. This lesson is slowly learned by the fellowship, and ultimately leads it to its fate.Finally, since I haven't read the next two books yet, I have to judge this book on its merits alone, and I must say it is a wonderful story, and it certainly leaves me craving the next installment."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"A Review by DillonThis is a fantasy book with many adventures. It is about the beginning of the War of the Ring. The story has 9 main characters. They are Elves, Men, Hobbits, Dwarves, and a Wizard. The book varies from the movie in a lot of ways. Most of the ways are that it introduces more characters and has more exciting events. \\"The Fellowship\\" is about a hobbit and a gang of people loyal to him, setting out to Mordor to destroy the ring of power. The story ends about a third of the way through and there are many adventures throughout the book.One of the main things that I liked about this book was the cool story. By reading the book, I could tell that the author put a lot of thought into it. Since this is the first book in a series of three, it was very well written. I also liked the exciting adventures and battles in it. There were many times when the battles in the book were very different from the ones in the movie. It is very exciting the way the author describes the events in the book and it is fun trying to imagine what he is talking about. The creating of characters was also very excellently done. Tolkien does a very good job of describing the different racesI think this was a very good book. I think that people who like fantasy books with lots of adventure and battles would enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Elves. Dwarves. Hobbits. These are just a few of the many amazing creatures in this fantasy story brought to life by J.R.R. Tolkien. The first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the best-written books I have ever read in my life. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins leaving his homeland of Hobbiton and leaving the dark, mysterious One Ring in the care of his nephew Frodo Baggins. Frodo is the main character throughout the trilogy. His friend and wizard, Gandolf the Grey, knows of the Ring and senses the danger behind it. Frodo is instructed to leave Hobbiton and take the Ring so it will be safe. He takes along his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin. The Hobbits encounter danger in their quest to find a way to keep the Ring safe from its evil maker, Sauron, who is hunting the ring in order to rule the world. They finally reach Rivendell, the home of the elves, where the leaders of the elves, dwarves, and humans along with Frodo and Bilbo had a counsel meeting to decide what must be done with the Ring. This is the point in the book where the plot begins to thicken tremendously. Saying more would only give the best parts of the book away. The style in which this book is written has a mix of Old English in it, but the book is not hard to understand. Tolkien describes his characters in such a way that one can actually feel like they know the character. Tolkien provides such a great depth in his explanations of history and landscape. Some people may get bored saying that he drags the story on and on. However, the way that he uses description in his novel only adds more beauty and life to his epic fantasy. I strongly recommend this novel to anyone who loves to read and has a vivid imagination. The Fellowship of the Ring takes a deep commitment to stick to it and one's full attention to fully enjoy this wonderful book. The Fellowship of the Ring offers fantasy, adventure, and friendship wrapped in one extraordinary novel. The best thing about reading The Fellowship of the Ring is knowing that there are still two more novels waiting to be read in the wonderful Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have this book and the rest of the series however i have only read this one!

Building upon the story that was told in 'The Hobbit', this story tells the tale of the discovery by Gandalf the Gray, that the magic ring found by Bilbo Baggins on his journeys, is none other than the ring of power, the One Ring, the master ring that was created by the Dark Lord, Sauron, himself.Together with several companions, three other Hobbits, an Elf, a Dwarf, Gandalf, and two men, Aragorn and Boromir, Frodo sets off on the quest of Mount Doom, the quest to destroy the One Ring forever. This story is wonderfully done, a true masterpiece in fantasy fiction. Tolkien expands upon the world that he has only touched upon in 'The Hobbit', and we find it a place inhabbited by creatures of various kinds, some are evil, others strive for good, and others do only what they think they must. Yet now, with Sauron, the Dark Lord, rising to power once again, and gathering his strength, they find that they must choose a dreadful course, a course into peril.RD Williams, author of 'The Lost Gate'"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The guy who created D&D says he didn't draw much inspiration from the Lord of the Rings trilogy of books, but that's a load of crap, man.

Writers of this time can take lessons Tolkien who was the master of it. He wrote about the past present and future of his Middle Earth, and left it for many generations to enjoy. This is a book you could read ten times and still not get everything out of it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingBy J.R.R. TolkienFrodo Baggins inherits a strange ring from his uncle Bilbo. It is a plain, gold ring with no visible markings on it. But it has special qualities. It can make you invisible. It lengthens your life if you have a long time. It was created by the evil wizard, Sauron of Morodor who used its power to command armies of Uruks and Goblins. He battled Elves, Dwarves and Men with his new power. Then he was defeated and the ring was lost. But a little creature called Sm&eacute;agol find it and keeps it for hundreds of years. The ring has a will of its own and Bilbo comes by it when he gets lost in a mountain full of Goblins. The ring leaves Sm&eacute;agol, now called Gollum, and Bilbo uses it on his journey for a dragon's treasure. Sauron comes to life again in the form of a large eye on top a great stone tower, but does not have his full powers back. The one thing he needs is the ring. Sauron sends his servants to find the ring and Frodo is pursued by Black Riders. Help comes from many different types of people as the quest to destroy the one ring begins. They form the Fellowship of the Ring. Led by Gandalf the Gray, the company consists of: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Hobbits of the Shire; Aragorn, a human Ranger that is the Heir to the Throne of Gondor; Boromir, human son of the Steward of Gondor; Elvin prince of Mirkwood, Legolas; and the dwarf Gimli, son of Gl&#972;in.The characters in this book are incredible, good and evil. Gandalf is a wizard in a gray cloak with a white staff. He has a sword and a pointed hat. He is old but he is a very able fighter, killing many orcs with his sword and magic. The Balrog is an evil creature. It is walking darkness and evil fire in a mass of bloodthirsty orcs screaming for enemies to battle. It has an immense, flaming sword and a lash of fire. The Elves are a graceful and skillful people. They are extremely good bowmen and are quick and deadly with their swords. They also have a wide variety of spells and enchantments to hurl at their enemies. Hobbits are small and lazy creatures that look like little humans, like to eat a lot, and do not like adventures. A few of them are out of the ordinary and like to do extraordinary things. Among these few strange Hobbits are: Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin.The characters would have no place without a plot to follow. The plot of the story is remarkable. The quest to destroy the Ruling Ring, which could be used to supplement a great wizard's powers so he could rule all of Middle-Earth, is completely original. It has been often copied, but never duplicated. There is a story within the story. And one the people are still alive as they are Elves and they live so long. He believed that this ring of power was lost forever, but not destroyed, like its unfortunate master. The story is a truly superior read.This book is interesting, has a very good storyline, and the characters are astonishing. It is one of my favorite books of all time.D.

That all changes when he discovers that possesses the ring of power that was forged in the cracks of doom. Now he, his companion, Samwise, and the wizard, Gandalf must take the ring and toss it back into Mount Doom to destroy it once and for all. Doing so will end the war between Sauron and the free people of Middle Earth. Along the way, they will gain the companionship of an elf, a dwarf, two men, and two more hobbits.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in a three book series. It is a follow-up to The Hobbit, the story about how Bilbo steals the ring from the creature, Gollum, who plays a small part in The Fellowship of the Ring also. The Fellowship of the Ring is my favorite in the series so far. I like how Tolkien made such a massive world for the books to take place in.It is an epic story of adventure, war, friendship, and greed. It gets extremely detailed and if you don't read carefully, you could get as lost as the characters in it. Sometimes the detail of the book almost makes you feel like you are taking part in the story.

The author skillfully mixes a concoction of effortless lyrics, wicked monsters, and intermittent magic in a dark and foreboding fantasy.As part of an epic tale, not only does \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" masterfully addresses the responsibilities of good versus evil but also examines companionship and loyalty within the confines of a tremendously treacherous task. Suspense grows as the importance of the Ring-bearer's objective is fully appreciated as the Ring's power incites an evil influence on those nearby.Regrettably a peculiar encounter involving Tom Bombadil, a vigorously charming and unique individual, needlessly diminishes the potency of the Ring. Many readers feel the entire episode concerning Tom and Lady Goldberry is unnecessary to the progress of the menacing plot other than a silly interruption.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The book is very intersting.

The story in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is tremendous, creative and truly profound. I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. Where was the supreme Tom Bombadill? Where was the powerful elf lord Glorfindel? There are also some unnecessary twists taken by Jackson and his crew that are simple and beautiful in the book.THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING wonderfully takes up where THE HOBBIT leaves off and addresses the sinister aspects of the great ring and the true Lord of the Rings, the diabolical Sauron.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE TWO TOWERS and then wrapping up with THE RETURN OF THE KING. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there.

Tolkien, the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, would have to be my favorite book in three ways. To begin with, there is a tremendous amount of action in this book. For example, Frodo, the main character, and all of his companions set out to destroy an evil ring so the evil Sauron won't get his nasty hands on it. If they don't destroy the ring, all of Middle Earth would be doomed. They must battle their way to Mount Doom to cast the ring into its flames. But, there are many enemies on their way like, Sauroman, orcs, and Ring Wraiths. Secondly, I like how Tolkien brings Middle Earth to life by describing it so deeply. For example, I like how he describes The Mines of Moria so well. Last but not least, I love the fantasy and magic in this book. For instance, Gandalf, a great wizard, has many spells and magical powers. If you do not like fantasy, you shouldn't read this book; but if you do this book is spectacular! In conclusion, if you are looking for a great book, get The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book written by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is the first book in an epic trilogy known as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It takes place in the third age of Middle-earth. The main characters are Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin who are hobbits. A hobbit is a creature smaller than dwarves and they are furry, but resemble humans. It is action-packed and suspenseful. I gave this book 5 stars because I really liked it and also it has a very deep-winding plot. The Character I like best in this story is Frodo. I like him because he is just like his uncle Bilbo(from The Hobbit). His uncle Bilbo had adventures just like he will have and you can only find out if you read it.

Although I have heavy curtains on my bedroom windows, I do not live in an isolated area and so have to deal with the noise of the \\"outside world\\" to some degree. I would periodically have a hard time getting to sleep or staying there, before I started getting these CD's. The other collection I have is the dramatization of the hobbit, which is also quite good, but much different overall, as it is only 4 discs long, and without much of Tolkien's flair, as descriptions are minimized in favor of dialogue.This product, however, I find completely rewarding. The guy who reads has a lovely voice, pronounces everything impeccably without hesitation, varies his tone just enough to distinguish between characters (but not dramatically enough to be distracting), and as it is completely unabridged, you don't miss a single word of Tolkien's masterpiece. And as for his singing, well, I don't imagine the characters in the books to be divas, if you catch my drift, so I find it quite realistic and not at all off-putting.I play a disc when I lie down to sleep, and usually listen to the same one several nights in a row until I am sure I heard the whole thing, as I find that I am asleep within 15 minutes. I have had this collection for about two months and I am on the 8th disc (of 20).

I've now read all three. Some reviewers have complained about the amount of detail in the books. Personally, after seeing the movies, I was full of questions: very curious about the history of the cultures of the inhabitants of Middle Earth, the landscapes and geopgraphy, and the lives of specific characters. The movies give you a taste of Tolkien's grand epic, but the books themselves suck you into Middle Earth. I was mesmerized and welcomed the painstaking detail. Tolkien didn't just create a landscape, races and languages. He created a universe that comes to life in the pages of the books.I attribute the epic's success to the intense emotion that it invokes. When reading, one genuinely feels the characters' hardships, fears the orchs, Saruman, the Urukai. The book is chilling and invokes terror at times.My copies of the books have detailed appendices and maps. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to refer to the maps of Middle Earth and track the fellowship on their quest. I highly ecommend using such maps when reading the books.In summary, if you long to know more after having seen the movies, you'll find yourself immersed in and hypnotized by the text. If, on the other hand, you're satisfied knowing what's given on the widescreen, you probably won't make it through the first book. The best case scenario would obviously be to experience the books first.

The movie cut out important characters such as Tom Bombadil and Lady Goldberry, characters I thought that were of a certain importance that they should have been included. The Old Forest and Bilbo play a much bigger part. Despite all this, I would not suggest this book to anyone who has not seen the Lord of the Rings movies.

Some time ago I decided to go to the original English text, thinking that if the original is bad, then it's simply not such a good book.Well, I got a lesson about the importance of a good transtlation. I have read the book from cover to cover, ceaselessly, and enjoyed it greatly.Tolkein's English is superb. You can see he's a linguistic, since his language is deep and reach. The characters are wonderfully built and the plot, although complicated and very detailed, is easy to read and fluent.After reading it in its original language I see the problem. This book is a challenge to every translator, because it is deeply rooted in the English tradition, both plotwise and in its language. It takes a skillful transtlator to pass all the different meanings Tolkein uses, and still have a readable result.So I do recommened anyone who considers to read this book in any other language other than English, to wait until you can handle with its not-too-difficult language. It'll be worth your while."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is so good, the minute I was done I needed the next one.

There was this other kid who did not know the plot. He said that frodo was killed on the 170th page, and gandalf was eaten by zombies. I know WTF. As for the rest of you I know this book is long and tedious. But hey guess what when you get to high school, I'm not speaking about zombie boy, or dislexia lad, you will read not only this sucker, but the iliad,the odessy, excuse, and all the real epic classics. In general this is a good warm up to those books. But if you want to keep on reading level 2 books like 'the little train that could' or 'curious george' hey it is 100% o.k with me. Exept the fact that all you all are screwed. Espesially the geniouses with the gramatical, and lectoral issues.-adieu"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I love this book! The reason I started reading it was that I heard that Led Zeppelin (my favorite band) got some of their lyrics from these books. Everytime I came across something that reminded me of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; or &quot;The Battle of Evermore,&quot; I couldn't put the book down! I reccomend this book to only avid readers who can stick it out till the end."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The story itself is so much better than what the movie provides. Definitely worth the read! just wish i has bought the trilogy for 15 dollars rather than this one for 8 and i know the other two will cost 8 as well"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"this book was ok but not great. the first 50 pages or so is just about the traditions of hobbits. it gets.dull."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Because of all the hype and the fact that there was a copy lying around, I picked up this book and read it.The imagery and details are amazing.Frodo, a hobbit, inherits a dark and magical ring from Bilbo (his older cousin who chooses him to be his heir). Bilbo retires from his home and Frodo is left to adventure...the journey to destroy the ring.The plotline is somewhat simple,but the world building and metaphors Tolkien used make up for that.What was frustrating was that I could only understand the story when I immersed myself in reading for long stretches at a time...because it is poetic and lavishly detailed.I found it dissapointing (with its' length) that there wasn't more of a subplot going on. Yes there was dialogue between the characters but it did not seem to build up their friendships or characters much.Overall, it wasn't that exciting. There were monster scenes with little details and dinner scenes that seemed too drawn out.It was fun to read about the fantasy items like a ring that can turn you invisible and a bowl that can show you the: past, present, or future(the mirror of Galadriel). But I do not think will read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Although the author did a great job bringing to life the world of the Middle-Earth, I felt that there were to many points of view. To me, the storyline jumped around too much between characters."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Ok, so I have to say that I enjoyed this book better than \\"The Hobbit\\" but it still was a very hard read for me. Somehow I have never read these books until now and starting them as an adult, I think I may get something very different from them than most people do who were introduced to the series at an earlier age. While I admire Tolkien's imagination, I still find some flaws with this book. I've also seen the movies before reading which could also serve to change my views on the book.We start in the Shire where Frodo Baggins has just inherited Bilbo Baggins (another hobbit we learn about in \\"The Hobbit\\")house, furniture, and most especially, a prized ring, after Bilbo has disappeared suddenly and plans to go off traveling again. For years Frodo doesn't worry about the ring and enjoys his time in the Shire just getting along alright. However, Gandalf the Grey wizard returns and gives him some history on this tiny little ring that is very surprising. It is the greatest ring on Middle-Earth and dangerous. It's previous owner Sauron wants it back for his own and has started to send out evil creatures to get it back for himself. If that happens, the world is doomed. Trying to keep it away from the minions, Frodo and some friends, take a journey to the Elven kingdom of Rivendale where they join part of a fellowship that is going to take the ring back to the one place it can be destroyed, but right at the enemy's gates in Mordor. Accompanying Frodo are a few hobbits, an elf, Gandalf, a dwarf, and a couple of humans. They have to pass through much danger and tribulations to try to get Frodo away on his quest as he becomes the Ring-Bearer.The characters in this novel are interesting, but to me, not enough time is spent on them. I would have loved to hear more about Hobbit's habits or the history of some of the other characters, but instead, the book spends more time detailing other things. Even the elves whom some may know about in the movie aren't described quite as well in the book. In fact, Arwen is barely in this book, which may disappoint some people. He did do a better job on Galadriel who actually did get a larger part in this book. Sam has always been my favorite character and I wish there was more of him in this book.The writing is extremely descriptive and this bogs down the reader at points in the novel. There are so many names of places and things that we don't even visit in the book that are described that it can serve to confuse a reader and make them wonder why it was even mentioned in the first place. The scenery is described over and over as well which makes for reading that once in awhile I just had to put down as it bored me. My biggest complaint would be all the songs and poems though. I found them distracting and there were so many, I have to confess that I started just skipping over them so I could get on with the story. I might have missed something in the history or backstory because of this, and I would have much rather just had it written normally. That being said there isn't a great deal of violence in this book and not many things offensive either.All in all I would probably give this book 3.5 stars. It has a great story but its hard wading to get through that story. But I'll move on to the next and see what The Two Towers has to offer.The Fellowship of the RingCopyright 1954458 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'm one of those people who saw the LOTR films before reading the novels. And now, I've just finished reading \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" last night, and I must say that I didn't really enjoy it as much as other people did. I mean no offense: I still think that LOTR is classic literature that should never be forgotten, but here's the thing . . .After I saw \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" on DVD (both the theatrical and the extended; I now own the Extended Edition), I went on to read different fantasy novels. I've read Robert Jordan's first ten books of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series, Robin Hobb's \\"The Farseer Trilogy,\\" Diana Pharaoh Francis's \\"Path\\" trilogy, Scott Lynch's \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" (I'll be reading his sequel soon), and so on. Through the years, I've noticed a fomulaic structure that are prevalent in some of these books: average guy/girl in small village goes on a quest, average guy is world's only hope, etc. Terry Brooks's first \\"Shannara\\" trilogy falls into that category very well. But anyway, while I still enjoyed these novels, I couldn't help but be a bit irritated that they included the same basic structure that's typical in the fantasy genre. And now that I've read \\"Fellowship,\\" I couldn't help but think of all the fantasy cliches in many other books. But I know that Tolkien's works were somewhat original back in the day, and that the cliches were formed to perfection throughout the later years.But that's not all. I found \\"Fellowship\\" to be a bit more light-hearted than the actual film, which is fine with me, but light-heartedness isn't for everybody. I grew up watching TV shows like \\"Millennium,\\" \\"Deadwood,\\" \\"24,\\" and \\"House\\". And you already know that there are lots and lots of adult situations in them. Well, I prefer these hard-hitting adult shows over those crappy half-naive half-melodramatic teenage shows like \\"One Tree Hill\\" or something like that. And you know what, I think all these adult shows have affected my reading of \\"Fellowship\\". I feel \\"Fellowship\\" wasn't intense enough to sustain my interest, but I guess it's just me.Now, I'll start with the CONS for this novel. \\"Fellowship\\" gets things going in the second half, but the first half is very slow and tedious. \\"A Long-Expected Party\\" and \\"The Shadow of the Past\\" were interesting enough (it's the history of the Ring that makes it all worthwhile), but then as I got to \\"Three is Company\\" it became a bit tedious. \\"A Shortcut to Mushrooms\\" and \\"A Conspiracy Unmasked\\" is when it started to slow down even more. Then, as I got to \\"In the House of Tom Bombadil\\", I couldn't help but be constantly irritated at its melodramatic overtones. Bombadil's a bit too much on the bright side. But then, the pace quickened up when I got to \\"At The Sign of the Prancing Pony\\" and \\"Strider\\". And some of the most intense sequences in LOTR are found in \\"A Knife in the Dark\\" and \\"Flight to the Ford\\"; this is when it becomes interesting again. As for the second half, \\"The Council of Elrond\\" was just downright hard to read through. Gandalf, Elrond, Men, Elves, and Dwarves just talking and talking and talking and talking. Though, lots of information on Saruman and the Ring are found here, it was just a very big hassle.But I have to say that the PROS are much better here. The concept of a hobbit going on this quest is highly unlikely, and that's why this book's so compelling. Tolkien broke the mold back in the 50's when he created Bilbo (for \\"the Hobbit\\") and Frodo Baggins. And having eight companions to follow the hobbit to Mount Doom makes it all the more exciting. Even though I don't find Hobbits very fascinating anymore, the thought of having one of them go on a journey to Mordor is still outstanding. And let's not forget the writing itself. Tolkien's imaginative narration soars above every page that's written here. It's all so rich in detail and amazing in imagery (Alan Lee's artwork really helps, too). And let's not forget the races. I know that orcs, elves, wizards, and dwarves are a cliche nowadays, but here Tolkien gives them something more. There's history, culture, social issues, and politics. Finally, the sequences in Moria and Lothlorien are brilliant in almost every way.I would have to say that television shows and other contemporary fantasy novels have affected my reading of \\"Fellowship\\". The epic content I admire, but the formulaic structure I should try to tolerate. And I think it's not just fantasy novels and TV shows: there's contemporary books like \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"The Ha-Ha\\" and \\"House of Sand and Fog\\".But anyway, I did enjoy the first part of LOTR, but not that much, sorry to say. I'm glad, however, that other people have enjoyed it much more. And I admire Tolkien for his creation of a beautiful imaginary world. Now on to \\"The Two Towers\\" . . .Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The BBC verison is superior in almost every way than this NPR version, but this does have a few things to recommend it. Tom Bomdadil sounds just as I imagined he would. Sam's voice is childish, but for the most part endearing because of that. I imagine this is how he sounded at nine when he first met Frodo and you can easily hear how much he loves his master as this version includes my favorite scene from Book IV as Sam watches Frodo sleep and the light that is shining from within and says to himself, \\"I love him\\" and the loving reunion in the tower. Both are interesting inclusions because Americans usually shy away from the showing of same-sex affection so this was welcome in showing that beautiful, pure bond of theirs. The scene with the Barrow-wights is very well done and quite terrifying. You can very easily understand why Frodo would have been scared enough to want to run away. The narrator's voice sometimes gets really caught up in the action, dramatically describing the fell beast of the Ring-wraiths or especially Sauron's realization that he is doomed as Frodo puts on the Ring. I almost felt sorry for the Dark Lord there for a minute as he frantically sends his Nazgul to stop that little one, but then I crowed in delight, \\"Too late! Too late!\\" Unfortunately, the narrator is the only one that is enthused in this, except for Sam. Frodo is quite lackluster. Don't try to take the Ring away from him, but otherwise you have no idea that his soul is being torn apart. When he claims the Ring/is claimed by the Ring is done well though."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I would just like to say I resent the Harry Potter books being called Tolkeinesque because they're completely different. My three favorite book series are all fantasy- The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Prydain Chronicles. The Lord of the rings is an amazing saga of good and evil. Harry Potter is a great lighthearted and witty mystery series set in a 'modern' wizard school. The Prydain Chronicles (the best books ever written) use wisdom, ideals, attitudes, and witty dialogue while at the same time completely but perfectly believably changing the main character from reckless boy to wise man as he discovers the truth about himself and being a hero. No one is the same as the others. Never, ever, say that Harry Potter is Tolkeinesque again!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Beginning where the Hobbit left off, The Fellowship of the Ring begins the Lord of the Rings adventure by having the true nature of Gollum's ring revealed.

It is a story about a company of travelers trying to distroy evil, and bring peace to all creatures that still live in Middle Earth. Frodo Baggins, Bilbos adopted nephew, inherets all of Bilbo's belongings when Bilbo suddenly dissapeares again. Frodo is a hobbit that isn't content with the way his life is. There is something missing, and Frodo feels that an adventure would fill that eymptiness in his life. Well that adventure comes when Gandalf, the wizard, shows up and tells him that the ring that he inhereted from Bilbo, is wanted by Saruman, an evil wizard. The only way to keep Saruman from having it, and anyonelse from using it, is to destroy it. However to destroy it they need to take it to Orodruin, the fire mountain. This mountain is the only place where it is hot enough to melt the ring. Frodo starts his journey with three other hobbits, Sam, Pippen, and Merry. They run into many dangerous situations in the first few weeks. They are only few of many. While on the road they run into a man named Aragorn, or Strider. He is a ramger who has traveled that way many times. He helps them get to Riverdale where Gandalf is waiting for them. However before they reach Riverdale, they run into troublr with the Black Riders and it almost leads to a fatal accident. Frodo and his group fight the Black Riders many times before the reach Riverdale, but they all make it to Riverdale. There they are joined on the journey by Gandalf,Boromir( a strong man ), Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf. From there the adventure becomes even more dangerous. They realize this when they are lead into dander and one of the company is lost in the darkness of the Abyss. However the company still moves on towars there goal, facing one danger after the next. I enjoyed the book and I would recomend it to anyone who likes adventure, and a book that keeps you turning the page."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was great because of all the action and adventure. It was also neat how Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf had perils all throughtout the book. This was cool because it is almost like in real life when someone is lost in the woods, you almost have the same problems, except for the goblins and trolls. The only bad parts in the book is how they always go to different places. Half of the places are not even on the map that comes with the book. They should have more labeled, so you know where they are going. But the book gives an excellent ending and makes you read the next book in the series, THE TWO TOWERS."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is a great book full of suspense,action,thrills, and alot of words I don't understand...

If you enjoy adventure and danger in a imaginative mind then you would definetly enjoy this book. I only rated it as three stars because it began, for me, a little slow and then it picked up. Once it picked up I found myself more tempeted to keep reading deep into the hours of the night. Then it would go back to being slow. After I got finished with the book I was happy I read it. I would often times put myself in the place of one of the characters. I agree with an aquentence of mine who says, &quot;It's beleivable.&quot; I think the most interesting character is Sam, Frodo accomplis. I enjoyed the book, but I am not sure if I would want to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book left me speechless! Tolkien not only used awe-inspiring discriptions and a glorious plotline, but made the magnifcant world of Middle-earth and all its inhabitants come to life. With the magic and mystery I think this is the epic trilogy of all time, never to be surpassed by anyone in the fantasy genre! A true masterpiece, without a doubt!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"For most of the book I greatly enjoyed it. There were times it made me feel like a kid again. Tolkien's characters are all well developed. ontop of that middle earth is very well mapped out. My problem with the book is it's more of one giant book broken down in to three parts. After reading the fellowship there is no resolution. the last 100 pages are fairly uneventful. The beginning of the two towers should have been the ending the fellowship. There could than have been a cliif-hanger ending. When the movie comes out the films visuals will no doubt be it's strong suit,but the ending is weak and will have trouble bringing back people to buy tickets."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings...there are precious few in the English-speaking world who have not heard of it spoken in some context of grandeuer, of respect, of hype. To summarise, it DELIVERS. The Fellowship of the Rings may be long and complex, but is the epitome of all that is simple literature. JRR Tolkein uses his remarkable poetic and philological talents to guide us through an entirely distinct universe, and in the fashion of Classical, Norse and Irish legend and mythology envigorates the mind with each twist and turn in the basic struggle against good and evil. With the literary skill of a master seanacha&iacute;, he relates the tales of a new quasi-mythology...this book isn't fantasy, to an open-minded reader it is a new level of reality; we may learn as much from the thematic structure of the Lord of the Rings than we do from the innards of a history book. No other novel has delved as deeply into the mind of the author, and none have manifested these ideas as well to the reader. The Fellowship may seem boring to the short attention-span casual reader, but with a little perseverance the rewards are amazing. An leabhair milaois...The book of the millennium."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is the opening chapter of the epic &quot;Lord of the Rings Trilogy&quot;, the best series of books (I believe) ever written. This book sets the foundation more solidly than &quot;The Hobbit&quot; does and begins to unveil Tolkein's modern myth. This book is only rivaled by the other books in the Trilogy and by &quot;The Silmarilion&quot; which was also written by Tolikein."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What's to say, tolkien's a very good author in his own way. You don't feel his character's though, you don't care about them much. 500 pages seems really really long in this books. You know how in some books you hardly noticed that you've read 100 pages. Not so here, I swear I looked at the page numbers all of the time and got nowhere. I read the first 200 pages (which were really boring) then got to the interesting part. Unfortunatly the report on it was due the next day so all day I spent reading it page by page until it was finished. Moria was good Rivendell and Elf Land were dragged out quite alot. I give it three because it's very high quality writing. Structurally sound. I just failed to pick it up and soar...if you get my meaning. Don't get me wrong though, the hobbit and the rest of the trilogy are really good."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There is no comparison. No other fantasy saga has anywhere near the level of depth and feeling. And that's all anyone can say.You must, I assure you, read this before you die. It is, I say without irony, another world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings is the only book you can read over and over again. You can either take it from the beginning, or simply jump to the chapters and scenes that you enjoy the most. It is a book that at its ending it leaves you with a somewhat bitter mood, with the desire to follow those who depart to the West, to learn even more about stories of Middle Earth. Indeed when it is finished you wish you could just forget all about it and read it again as for the first time. Certainly those who have felt what I have for this book can understand what I am talking about. For everybody else, I hope you may be able to read any book which will cause you such feelings."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is a wonderful, intreging, enthralling adventure story. The characters are well rounded and three dimensional - a rare occurence in works of fiction. The prose wafts along agreeably, absorbing the reader into the incredible world of Middle Earth. The first time I read this book I was so enchanted by the whole aura of the setting that for weeks I lived in Middle Earth alone. Now, I read it not for the story - which I know inside out - but for the feeling of home I get when reading it. The warmth and detail of Tolkien's writting is uplifting. A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"everyone told me that this first book was in fact a bit boring but that the other two parts were much more enthusiastic. i don't see why because i'm just reading the 2nd part now. 1st part is as great as the 2nd one(as far as i've read of the 2nd part).i just loved it and felt myself living in that world too. i could even cry when i thought that Gandalf was dead forever."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is Great.But not the best of the three.I'm half-way through The Two Towers and I can say it is better then the Lord of the Rings.I think what makes it not as good is it's not as action packed as The Two Towers and it has one LONG chapter called The Counil of Elrond.true this chapter gives you all sorts of information.But it's too long and nothing happens.However this book is worthy of it's fame."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have read the trilogy five or six times and I can honestly say it is the best series of books I have ever read. One wonders why a full length film version has never been attempted. For those attempting it for the first time I would recommend skiping the intro and going straight to Chapter 1. Once you have read the first chapter you will be hooked and then is a good time to backtrack to learn a little more of 'Hobbit Lore. I truely envy you your first reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I don't like formal writing, but I made an exception here. I finished it in several hours and immediately began the search for The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The other two were worth the wait, though I got slightly confused at several points."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Before the well reknowned movies came to being the Lord Of The Rings books were there. The first movie was one of the best movies of all time in an epic trilogy, however it does no justice for the book.

I recommend this book to all Lord of The Rings fans and all people who like any sort of adventure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This fantasy is a great book. It's a prefect fit if you want to read about an adventurer. The Lord of the Rings, the series, are my favorite books! It's about a hobbit (who is a human, but smaller then normal). He has this ring that is evil and owned by a magical being who has a army of orcs that are mined from the earth. The hobbit's name is Fredo and he must go to Mount Doom. Mount Doom is a mountain that has such flaming fire that it is the only thing that can destroy the ring. Unfortunately, it is right next to the being, Sauron. Will Fredo make it to Mount Doom and drop the ring in the fire or will Orcs and other creatures get him and eat his flesh alive?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is the first book in a trilogy of books by J.R.R. Tolkien, titled the Lord of the Rings. The Fellowship of the Ring is about the forming of the fellowship and the beginning of the quest.The book starts out in a land called middle-earth. In middle-earth, many different creatures live. There is a place in middle-earth, called the Shire. most of the hobbits live in the shire. Frodo, after finding out the truth to his inherited ring, has to begin a journey to a place called Rivendell. Along the way, Frodo and his managiere face many strange foes and meet many new friends. Upon entering Rivendell, an elf by the name of Elrond forms the Fellowship of the Ring. Elrond chooses 9 beings to go on the quest, some Frodo knew and some he didn't. The Fellowship faced many hardships along the way and even lost some of their members.This book was an overall good book. The only things that I didn't like is how there are some really slow parts, for example there would sometimes be 15-25 page long stretches were the book only talks about how the Fellowship is walking. Then there was too many poems and songs. There were also some really interesting added bits to the book. Tolkien gave a history to the peoples of middle-earth and also created several languages."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"FOTR is really wordy and much too long. Could have been half as long and twice as good if Tolkien had removed all of the really unecessary description, histories, songs (esp. the songs, really pointless), etc. I found it very difficult to stay with this book. After reading the Hobbit, this book is just too slow."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I don't read many books but for some reason this caught my eye. Hearing about the upcomming movie I decided to read the book it came from. Reading more into the book I'm accaully looking forward to what the movie has to offer this fall. It takes a long time for the book to accaully take off but it gets better. The story of a guy still living on his 111th birthday is differant and he still lives on longer. By holding something magical, he has the power to live on longer. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that it takes forever to get going, but they have to make the background before they travel and they take a long time. In the most part after they made the background in the novel I couldn't get my hands off the book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In despite of my great respect for Mr. Tolkien's personality and the fabulous fantasy universe he has created, I can't give any good credits to this book. It's very leisurely and hard to follow. It's difficult to tell what it really is that's wrong with the book. When I think about it rationally, the story should be extremely interesting. When I start to read it, it just bores me to death. No offense.This book is for dedicated fans only. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, read The Hobbit first."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"* I would really like to give this book 2.5 stars, but since that's not an option, I thought rounding up was more fair than rounding down.So after my third attempt to slog my way with Frodo and Company on their seemingly endless journey over every hill and through every forest in Middle Earth, I finally made it! Yea me!!!! As other reviews here have stated, I found the story to c-r-e-e-p by and my eyes had started to glaze over after the 110th description of a hollow or hill or tree or ravine or cliff - you get the idea. I also found parts of it to be filled with, for lack of a better word, WTF- erry. Tom Bombadil anyone? I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent and well-read person and I had no idea what anybody was talking about during that whole section.What really made this book a chore for me to read, though, was the total lack of warmth or humor. Yes, I know it's a dark, serious epic, but come on! Harry Potter (yes, I also know that the two series have been compared, analyzed, evaluated, blah, blah, blah to death) also has a dark undertone but Rowling still managed to add a little sparkle to her characters and story. I cared what happened to them. While reading Fellowship, on the other hand, I was kind of hoping Sauron would get the ring and kill them all - end this somehow! I can't take seriously characters who take themselves so seriously. Half of the speeches given in the council scene reminded me of the Holy Hand Grenade scene in Monty Python - excpet that was supposed to be funny! \\"And lo, we beheld the day on which PooPooRoRo, father of BlahBlah, son of STabMePlease crossed into the Plain of TerribleTerror and crossed the River of WordVomit...\\" That whole scene was so academic and pompous that I almost couldn't read it. Couldn't Aragorn have said, \\"Ok - here's the deal guys. I'm really supposed to be the king, but I kind of have an attitude problem and I'm a loner (besides that means a really hot, brooding actor will play me in the film) so I've spent the past few years wandering around, but now things are serious and we have to get it together and save Middle Earth.\\" Was it really necessary to detail the family history (including school records and traffic tickets) of everyone on the Council?However - having completely slammed this book - the writing is beautiful and the story (as far as I could tease it out of all of the other stuff) really is fantastic. Kudos to Tolkien for creating a total universe of his own that is obviously vastly influential to both the literary and cultural world. I mean, I read a 400 page book that I really didn't enjoy because I felt like I could barely consider myself literate if I hadn't read it! And I'm going to read the other two - which I've been given to understand are more entertaining. It is obvious that this world was real to Tolkien and I can appreciate that.But if I have to work as hard to read The Two Towers, I'm going to chuck it and turn on Monty Python..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I love fantasy and I love long books that are continued in a series. That being said... I read all of the books in The Lord of the Rings. The first few pages were okay.. but I quickly grew to realize that while there were some interesting concepts put into play for this book and the others in the trilogy.. however, it was far too long.I read this right before the movies came out thinking that I'd be wowed.. The movies were fantastic.. but I really wish I hadn't forced myself to read the trilogy. It was an unnecessary evil."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The ring has once again found a new owner after spending many years in the hands of Bilbo it was thrust upon Frodo whose task is now to carry the ring out of the Shire and keep it out of the hands of the enemy, Sauron. The planning of Bilbo's 110th birthday was going as planned and only person that knew of Bilbo's planned vacation from the Shire was Frodo. At the party there were many fireworks, compliments of Gandalf the wizard, and other activities, and at the feast Bilbo disappeared after giving a speech and was not seen in the Shire again. Frodo discovered the ring and Gandalf told him to never use it even if the situation was dire. Gandalf left to do research and didn't return for many years but when he did he told Frodo that he would have to leave the Shire because it was no longer safe for him or the ring for ring wraiths were trying to find it. Frodo then sold Bag End (the place where he and Bilbo lived) and bought a small hole in Crickethollow to try to cover u the fact that he was leaving. Frodo started out on his journey to Crickethollow with Sam Gamgee and Perigrin Took (known as Pippin) and they were met by a group of elves and Frodo was named elf-friend. They decided to spend only a few hours and then the group of travelers, now including Merry Brandybuck, left at dawn. They decided to take a road through the Old Forest to find a way to Rivendell where they got into trouble but were saved by Tom Bombendil who gave them a good nights rest and then led them out of the forest, and then he told them to go to the Prancing Pony Inn to spend the night. At the inn they met a man named Strider who was a Ranger from the North and he helped lead them to Rivendell. After a few days they were caught by ring wraiths and they stabbed Frodo in the shoulder. The groups of travelers proceeded on but were chased again by the wraiths, but this timed an Elvin lord appeared and the wraiths were crushed under raging waters that had risen. They made it to Rivendell and Frodo was cured and reunited with Gandalf and Bilbo. After Frodo came to, they had a council to decide who would go on the quest with Frodo. At the first council it was decided that Sam would accompany Frodo on his quest, but on the second meeting it was decided that Aragorn, Legolas, Boromer, Gandalf Pippin, Merry, Sam, and Frodo was form the fellowship, and were tasked with the job of destroying the ring. They traveled for a long time with little problem but they hit bad weather and were forced to travel through the mines of Moria where they met a terrible beast and Gandalf met his fate. Then the company traveled on but entered the land of Caras Galadhon where the stayed for a while and decided that it was solely his purpose to destroy the ring. Then Frodo fled and Sam followed as they headed for Mordor, but the orcs caught up with the others and Merry and Pippin were captured and Baromer was killed. This was one of the best books I have ever read because it kept me engaged through the whole adventure.This was one of my favorite books because of how far the hobbits had to go just by themselves, even though they are not much taller than about three feet. First when they had to leave Bag End and travel through the forest instead of on the road with the lack riders on their tale all the way. Then in the Old Forest they were confronted by evil trees that were rotten at the core but they were eventually saved after days of horrible walking conditions by Tom Bombendil and Goldberry. Then after that they had to travel to the inn of The Prancing Pony all by themselves and stay secret to most people throughout their time in Bree.I loved this book greatly because of how he fights the desire to disappear t any moment. In the beginning when the black rider starts to chase Frodo through the grass and Frodo had the urge to slip the ring on his finger but he did not and they were saved by a group of elves. Then when they were in Barrow-Wights Frodo wanted to escape the place by disappearing but the urge to save his friends was stronger and he instead called upon Tom. Then while on the road with Strider, Frodo also had many thoughts about disappearing.I also really liked this book because of the variety of characters throughout the story. First there are the hobbits from the Shire who are brave, kind, and thoughtful, but they are small and not the smartest people. The elves such as Elrond and Legolas are very tall and wise and know many things about the world. Then are the men and dwarves who are Gimili (the dwarf) who is short of temper and sometimes rash in his decisions, then there is Baromer who secretly and desperately wants the ring for Gondor to revive its glory. Then there is Aragorn who is a decendent of Isildor and is also wise and strong and will protect Frodo always at any cost.I liked this book because of characters like the heroic Aragorn and Frodo; also because of how Frodo fought against the will of the ring, and because of how the hobbits manage on their own. Frodo fought against the ring many times against the black riders and evil people of the land. It was also amazing that the hobbits made it all the way to Bree after being chased all the time by the black riders. This was one of my favorite books and I will the treasure the experience that I had while reading it.R.

I've heard a lot of people complain that the movies didnt' follow the books closely enough and that they could have been much better if they had done so. However, after reading this first book of the trilogy, I can honestly say that I personally enjoyed the movie more than the book.. I found it to be more exciting and awe-inspiring. It may just be that I saw the movie before I read the book (a sin, I know) and my first impression was just so great that I'll never forget it and it would be very dificult to out-do, but there are just some parts of the story in which I think were improved upon in the movie.While both the book and the movie are undoubtably two of the best pieces of art in their genres, they should be considered to be two distinct works. The movie included a few things that the book didn't and ommited a few things that the book dwelt on. While some people think that the movie should have been identical to the book as much as possible, I am glad that the director felt some degree of artistic freedom and was able to make some adjustments that he felt would make for a better movie (and which I agree with).. The book wasn't written as a movie and some of the story just wouldn't have been as good in a movie. Anyway, maybe its just by bias because of my having watched the movie before reading the book, but I thought the movie really outdid itself and was able to improve on the story.I still think that this is a wonderful book and realize that Tolkien is the Godfather of all that is Fantasy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The one that started it all! Join Bilbo Baggins as his wish for adventure binds all of Hobbylta to a quest to save Middle Earth. Tolkien created a world all his own that invites the reader to stay just a bit longer.

In fact, I almost abandoned it a few times before I was over the 300th page. The story is very slow going, though the fact that the details sort of put up to it, though I still have no idea of why the 50 pages of mentioning about hobbit's names and family which has almost nothing to do with the plot. I can name a few books that balance the story very well, so that it keeps excite you up and down through out the story and not bored you to death(ie. foreverwar, hyperion, hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy).There are also many poems(songs in the story) through out the novel, which make no sense to me and seem to have to do nothing with the plot. Maybe because I simply don't understand poems, but that's just my opinion, no one is good in everything. Sometimes after half of the book(around 350th page), though, the story really picks up, and you start to feel as a part of the journey.The end cuts off as if you're only went through 1/4 of the story, which gives me hope(also make me feel stupid that I went through 500 pages for this) that the other two books would be good since the beginning as less background has to be told. In general, the plot is very good. However, I don't really like the idea of a big gap between good and evil, though that's not the case for the main character(if you know the story around Warhammer 40k, you would know what I mean.....everything has an evil-side in it). On the course of adventure, the main character would either meet good people OR bad people.......Anyways, it's a great book if you can pass through 300 pages of snail-moving story. For me, the fact that 1/3 of it is pretty good, I will give it a 3 stars though I've heard a lot of good things about this trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a good book(just not great) and I'm looking forward for the other two(and hope that they won't put me to sleep as the first)."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I love the first part of this book-Frodo is a relatable nobody. The scenes are super-cute, like the constant stream of postmen going up and down, and the party, and best of all, the 'shop' at Bag End. But then, what could have been really cute and funny dissolves into an endless timetable of horseback rides, taverns, and quests. It begins to look like a Indiana Jones pairs up with Tintin and the Thompsons to find Excalibur and the Holy Grail in one go, but on the way they run into Professor Calculus' pendulum, Morgan le Fay, the Black Pearl, and to top it off, the bad guy, Saucepan, I mean Sauron, becomes an evil Voldemort and they have to destroy his umbrella. Maybe it's a good book. I just have to find a way to push myself through."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is about the journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends, Pippin, Merry, Sam (all hobbits as is frodo),Legolas (an elf), Gimli (a dwarf), Aragorn and Boromir (men), and the wizard Gandalf. I did not find this book particularly intruiging, though I am glad I read it because I will hear references to it throughout my life, I'm sure. In short there was to much talking and sitting around a campfire, eating lavish meals in lavish halls and whatnot. I would still reccomend it because, if you think about the plot and everything involved it is and excellent insight on life. About the power of friends and how the misuse of power may lead to corrupt."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When you spend too much time in the Shire you become a short fat hobbit. That is what this book did in the beginning by taking up too much time for the adventure to start. It does get better once they have finally started the real adventure of taking the ring to it's destruction. Now that we are through the book we only get a small showing of how good a Tolkien book can be. Overall it is a good book and everyone has to read it. I think this will be one of the rare books that are portrayed better as a movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is the first part of a trilogy chronicling the journey of one hobbit named Frodo and his friends. Frodo is the nephew of Bilbo, and has lived a fairly quiet life with his uncle in a hobbit-hole in a small village. Bilbo is famous in the village because once years ago he went away on a long journey and returned rich. No one is quite sure exactly what happened. And no one except those who were on the journey with him knows about the magical ring he brought back with him, that can make him invisible.Bilbo has decided that he wishes to leave his village and get away. So he throws a huge party and at the end of it he simply disappears. He leaves Frodo as his heir and leaves him everything, including the magic ring.Years later Frodo is visited by the wizard Gandalf, who was the one who sent Bilbo on his journey so long ago. Gandalf has news that the ring Frodo has inherited is very dangerous--it was forged by an evil wizard a long time ago, and it has incredible power. Frodo must take it to be destroyed where it was forged, and he must do it immediately. Bad things are beginning to waken all over the place, and Frodo must not let this ring get into the wrong hands. Thus his journey starts. This book tells the story of the first part of Frodo's journey to destroy the ring.This book has a bit more character development than \\"The Hobbit,\\" but it is still hard to get a grip on exactly what the characters are like. It was difficult for me to accept that things in this story were so urgent, yet Frodo and his companions spent long stretches of time not moving. It seems that the dark riders would have been upon them if they waited like they did in this story. Overall, there just wan't much action and not enough reasons to care about the characters."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Many people gush over the LOTR series like they have nothing more to do. Curious, I went to find the first book, being the FOTR, to see what all the hype was about. Now, don't get me wrong. LOTR is good, but not as good as most people actually say it is. Sure, Tolkien created a interesting world full of unusual people. But must he go over every little detail? Sometimes he just keeps describing something for so long, my head starts to hurt and I keep losing my place or reading the same sentence over and over again. His dialogue is bland and there is really no emotion to it. The characters are just as bland as the dialogue. There is no or little character development in this book, despite its size. Characters should be 3D. Not that all of Tolkien's characters are flat. Actually, Bilbo is more 3D than Frodo. The other characters--Well I won't even start. The list is too long. I just fell asleep reading this book. Believe me, I tried really hard to read this book. But I just can't. I admire Tolkien for being able to create a world where fantasy rules, but the writer must be able to control his world freely and realisticly so that we can read it and enjoy it. It is sad to know that LOTR fans point their fingers accusingly to someone who writes something similiar to LOTR, but the book that person wrote is actually better than Tolkien's work himself."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"(...) I've got one word for this book...BORING! Too many songs...I found myself sifting through chapter when Tolkien decides he is going to spend 50 pages on a meal or a night of talking.I read these books following my reading of the Shannara series (Sword, Elfstones, Wishsong) and there is no comparison. Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions. I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does. The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force. Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me.

It just seems to prattle on and on about one thing over and over again. Have you ever read a book and just became so bored with it you kept on reading but weren't paying attention to what you were reading? I had to keep going back to read over pages that I had just read over (and no I don't have ADD or ADHD).And why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because, HOLY CRAP, this is the most detailed book I have ever read, seen, or heard of. Just the fact that anyone could come up with this highly detailed (boring, repetitive, confusing) story is something that deserves 2 stars.I know I'm going to get a whole bunch of angry LotR fans ambush me with a bombardment of 'not helpful' votes, but oh well...Recomended books:Harry Potter seriesDa Vinci CodeAngels and DemonsThe Adventures of Tom SawyerThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinnThe Adventures of Sherlock HolmesThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book, and the others that precede and follow it, are perhaps the greatest work of fiction I have ever read. Tolkien's incredible imagination, and the creation of several languages, contribute to the incredibly realistic world created here.

However understandable this may be, some &quot;critics&quot; eagerness to say that so-and-so is imitating Tolkein, or so-and-so isn't as good as Tolkein, they are losing sight of the fact that they aren't Tolkein. True most fantasy authors have read Tolkein and probably put a little of his style in their works, but the point to their novels is to entertain. For those of you who keep forgetting this, you should either stop reading fantasy or open your mind a little and get a life. It's getting annoying and for anyone reading these reviews, who isn't a fan of fantasy yet, he or she may get the wrong idea as to the point of fantasy books, and never get introduced to what fantasy has to offer. It's not based around Tolkien, regardless of how good his books are, or how he pushed fantasy into the mainstream. The point of fantasy is the same as in any other genre, to entertain.For people out there who are looking for entertainment and not something to bitch about, Tolkein is a great introduction to fantasy.

The reader is then introduced to a ring, once in the clutches of the cunning Dark Lord, who wishes to conquer creatures living throughout the land. Yet, in order to do so, he must have in his posession the empowering ring that rules all. The only problem is, this ring is obtained by the hobbit-folk (Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo).

Believe me, I have tried it. So I read it a second time, after reading The Hobbit. It was good, I liked the characters and it was well written and a great story, but it seemed difficult to read because of so many references to things that had little to do with the rest of the story, especially the chapters that took place in Rivendell. My advice to anyone who wants to read Lord of the Rings is this: first, read The Hobbit. Go ahead and read this book, then The Two Towers and The Return of the King (you will probably like those two better). Then, read this book again after completing the trilogy. It will make much more sense the second time around, and you appreciate this book so much more. This really is a great series, and after exhausting myself with reading yet another Wheel of Time book (Robert Jordan fans can relate) I found myself re-reading the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy, which I found to be a pleasant change of pace.

Lately it has been given even more praise, due to its appearances in the movie theatre. Personally, I thought \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" to be no more than a decent read. Tolkien focuses much on character development rather than progression of the plot, which sometimes caused me to put the book down and go clip my toenails, because doing this simple task was more entertaining than reading this book. I have to give Tolkien credit in the level of thought and detail he put into the world of Middle Earth. He gave the reader vivid images of the characters' surrounding (sometimes a little too vivid.)

TolkienReviewed by: W. HorngPer.6This story talks about Frodo, a hobbit, who get hold of the Ring of Power and he had to destroy it in the mouth of Mt. Doom. At the beginning he was just a regular hobbit when his uncle Bilbo's old friend, Gandalf, came to celebrate Bilbo's 110th birthday! Gandalf found out that Bilbo has a magic ring but doesn't know that it was the Ring of Power. When he found out, he gave the ring to Frodo and told him to leave the Shire and go to the Prancing Pony to meet him. That's when Frodo and his friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry met Aragorn, a warrior who's suppose to be the king of Gondor. Together, Aragorn, Frodo, and his friends went to Rivendell, where the elves live. After they arrived at Rivendell, many people were gathered around to discuss how to destroy the Ring. Frodo volunteered with Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Boromir,and Frodo's friends. So the nine companions set out to Mt. Doom. Will they destroy the Ring of Power???I like this book because it's so intense and amazing that you don't want to stop reading, especially when they were battling with the orcs or Urak hais. The sad thing was that the fellowship broke very soon after Gandalf fell down from the bridge of Khazad-dum with the Balrog that he was fighting with. The last words he said was to Frodo, \\" Run, you fool!\\" That part almost made me cry. It must felt really bad to watch as an old friend fall to his doom.The part that I don't like about the book is Sauramon betraying the good and joining forces with Sauron, the Lord of the Rings who can destroy all of what is good in Middle-earth. Gadalf was shocked when he heard Sauramon said,\\" Let's join with sauron, it's a much wiser choice.\\" Gandalf refused to join with Sauron so Sauramon held him as capitive, luckily, he escaped. Gandalf left Sauramon with these words, \\" There is only one Lord of the Rings and he will not share his power.\\"My favorite part was when Frodo thought he got stabbed by the cave troll and was about to die, but he was wearing mythril, an armor light as a feather and as hard as dragon's scale, so he survived. I also like frodo's sword, Sting. I like it because each time when orcs are near, the sword glows, the brighter the closer the orcs are. If I have those things, then I wouldn't be afraid of battling anyone(Well, maybe except Demons and Balrogs)."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent book just as his others. There are three books in the whole story that are very elaborate. Every character fits perfectly in the story like Tolkien knew about the history that no one else had. In the Fellowship, It explains a lot about each character's story and why they were chosen to go on this amazing quest. I liked Tolkien's detail to the environment in the story. You can almost see in your head where the characters are. I would though, have liked to see what the characters were talking about on some of the long journeys, or more of how the characters reacted to each other."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I believe that this story is J.R.R.

Frodo sets off in this adventure, and soon runs into trouble.This book keeps you wondering about the evil forces and thier powers, since they are very hard to see at first. The book displays many common problems we have today. It shows how idiotic some discrimination is. The dwarf wasn't allowed to walk through the woods of the elves without wearing a blindfold. The elves were enemies with the dwarfs, because they believed in diffrent things, just as some people hurt others because of religion or race, which is very wrong. The story also shows that one person can make a difference. Frodo made the journey to his first destination injured, but he did his job. And he was just a small halfling against the forces of evil. There are more relations, and I could go on, but I think you understand. English teachers can have a fun time thinking of projects to do off of this book.This book is a medival fantacy style book. This book is for people with around an 8th grade reading level, yet to fully understand the books English, it would help to be a better reader.

Gandalf, a wise wizard and close friend of Frodo, advises him to never wear the ring and to keep it hidden, safe, and secret. Gandalf tells Frodo that an ancient and evil lord named Sauron forged the ring to rule the other magic rings possessed by dwarves, men, and elves. In resistance to this ring, men and elves battled the forces of Sauron, eventually defeating him. The ring was then believed to be lost. Thousands of years later Bilbo found the ring and passed it on to Frodo, however Sauron had reawakened and was seeking it. To prevent Sauron from obtaining the ring Frodo had to journey to Mordor, the forging place of the ring, to destroy it.The book The Fellowship of the Ring goes on to tell the extraordinary tale of Frodo and his eight companions as they journey to Mordor to destroy the ring. However, the Fellowship doesn't survive the journey into Mordor, and Frodo, with his best friend Sam, must finish the task alone.The book and the movie The Fellowship of the Ring differ from each other. For example, in the book the Fellowship did not fight a cave troll in Moria, but just see one. When the Company reaches Lothlorien it takes them several days of hiking through the forest before they reach the elf city of Lorien and speak with Lady Galadriel. The movie also doesn't show most of the places that Frodo visited during his quest, such as Tom Bombadil's house and the Barrow Downs.The Fellowship of the Ring is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who likes an exiting and suspenseful read. The Two Towers and The Return of the King are sequels to The Fellowship of the Ring and are equally exiting. The Hobbit is the enchanting prelude to the Lord of the Rings books and explains how Bilbo found the ring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book was one of the best books I ever read. I recommend it for everyone."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"~If you were a Tolkien fan before the movie came out, I think rereading the series is worthwhile. If you have never read the series, but liked the movie, you will love reading these books. I read the The Fellowship of the Ring before it came out last year, and I just finished reading it again. I was surprised by how much I had forgotten and by how much I replaced what Tolkien wrote with what the movie showed. The movie is good, but it is different from the novel. Tolkien's style and~~ descriptive prose make the novel worth reading. As I said the movie added to the novel in some cases, but it left much more out. Adventures with Tom Bombadil and the journey to Rivendell are shortened dramatically or left out of the movie.This novel opens my imagination. That is why I love Tolkien's work. It is easy to read and allows your mind to waunder. I can feel myself in the journey. Hiking cross country with Aragorn and the hobbits, cutting through the forest and swamps with~~ Sam, Frodo, and Pippen. I am there. The animals, the Shire both have special places in my imagination. The nights before entering Moria. The wolves, the beast of the lake, the onslaught of orcs in moria, although I have read it before, I can still feel the fear and hope the company feels. Tolkien's greatest gift to me, was the inspiration he has given my imagination.~"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Ths book is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. J.R.R. Tolkien, is a colorful writer. His character development is extrordinary, and the action-packed plot kept me from putting the book down.

I am reading The Return Of The King currently."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"My favorite books are the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien. I enjoy these books for many reasons. First, he includes a lot of detail about scenery. An example of this is when Tolkien writes:\\" Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine.\\" Another example is this: \\"Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low.\\" Next, Tolkien also has a very interesting concept. The One Ring, a ring that, in the wrong hands could make all of Middle Earth slaves to the Dark Lord Sauron, has a mind of its own. It can abandon its bearer at will. Also, there are many obstacles besetting the characters. One is the Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who are determined to find the Ring. Another is the journey itself. The characters travel through many dangerous areas such as the Mines of Moria. There, the creatures living there attack them. Finally, I like the interesting songs and names. One example is the Elvish name Gilthoniel Elbereth. Another is the \\"Walking Song\\" which goes as follows:\\"The Road goes ever on and onDowd from the door where it began.Now far ahead the Road has gone,And I must follow if I can,Pursuing it with weary feet,Until it joins some larger way,Where many paths and errands meet.And whither then? I cannot say.\\"These are some of the many reasons I like J.RR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Definitely a wonderful book.

People that are really connected to nature, trees that can think and speak ... and everything in this world has a very well defined history: the beginnings, the myths, legends, kings ... everything told in words that reflect the author's sensations about his own dream.

This book has been read by many people since it appeared in print, and Tolkien himself received lots of letters filled with opinions, critics, and whatsoever. This story is a huge one, and there are people who dislike big stories. The first part of this book is concerned with providing a background to the saga and to make a link with The Hobbit, the previous book in chronology. This way, things seem to be slow and there's almost no action. For those who have read The Hobbit, a very nice and dynamic book, the first part of The Fellowship of the Ring may (but not probably) be boring. In fact, it's almost necessary to read The Hobbit before thinking of reading The Lord of The Rings; otherwise, much of the fun in this book will be lost.However, in the second part (Book II), action comes back, and now we have the characters dealing with a never-ending series of adventures, puzzles, dangers ...

Thus begins the adventure of 4 daring hobbits, an elven archer, a wise wizard, a feisty dwarf and a powerful soon-to-be king.While it is a very good book, if you do not like fighting, gore, or extremely intense cliffhangers, do not read this book.

This is an actual reading of the entire book, not a dramatization or an abridged version.I think the reading is very good. The reader has a very good voice and he varies it to represent the voices of the different characters.The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is that there are some cases where the reader voices the characters differently than I would imagine. This might not be a problem if I had never read the book before, but since I have, I have an idea of what I think the characters sound like, and what I think their emotions are in particular scenes. In some cases, the way the reader voices the characters doesn't match what I already had in mind.I'm sure that any reading by another person would never match how I imagine all of the scenes, so I would probably feel this way with any reading or dramatization.

But I loved it (although I hated the actual reading part. Now I have read it sixteen more times, and I can safely say I know where everyone is coming from.

The second book WITHIN the first novel is amazing. This is where Tolkien starts his action. At first I struggled through the first book, but now I breeze through, knowing there is great stuff ahead.

The Lord of the Rings, of all the books I've read, is my unquestionable favorite. No other book is so rich and detailed with the history and peoples of its world and no other book tells a tale of such magnitude and beauty. So many people today have such short attention spans and require such consistant melodrama that it's no wonder the beauty and detail of Tolkein's masterpiece ends up wasted. I've read The Lord of the Rings many times and know the story and its conclusion well but I don't read them for the story anymore, I read them to return to Middle Earth.For anyone who has yet to read these books, I envy you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Don't let anybody tell you differently - The Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest works of caring that modern fantasy writers cannot match.Those readers with short attention spans are not fiction in the 20th century, fantasy or not. It is rich and beautiful, crafted with a skill and likely to enjoy the amazing depth with which Tolkien shapes his world, nor are they likely to be able to tolerate a book that does not rely solely on battles to advance the plot. Those who adore epic adventure, huge stories, rich histories, and interesting places to vistit will *love* this book.'The Fellowship of the Ring' starts things off wonderfully, telling the tale of the ring, and giving the reader a feeling of how vast and evil the story behind the ring is. Frodo and his companion must endure a series of adventures and encounters, trying to make their way out of the Shire. The first half of the book is very much reminicent of The Hobbit, and picks up with the same spirit.The second half of the novel gathers together the party who will make the journey that is the center of the series, and features one of the most famous and beloved parts of the series - Moria. Fantastic!Recomended for all readers, young and old. The only ones likely to dislike this are readers spoiled by the cookie cutter style of todays modern fantasy writers."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The only drawback to reading this series is that it spoiled me so that every other book I've read since the 7th grade has been a disappointment (which is kind of sad considering that I'm now 28). It's true that it's a great story and that Tolkien creates a world that is totally immersive and believable (even down to the history and structure of the imaginary foreign languages). More importantly though, he has a deep-rooted sense of ethics that he has woven into the story that strikes a harmonic chord in the soul of the reader - for example, that wisdom is often more powerful than strength, that hunger for power or money is bad, that sometimes the harder path is the best, that displaying one's power (or wealth) is bad, and that sometimes it's better to not use power even if you have it. (Consider Aragorn, an heir to the throne who wears muddy boots and lurks in the shadows). From a literary point of view, these concepts are similar to the teachings of Jesus, which are obviously very powerful. Tolkien's anti-materialistic view of the world may be what moves readers so much and what pushes the series beyond being just technically great (which it is) to being almost a religous experience. The only things I found disappointing were the loose ends that weren't tied up at the end and the hints of the decline of Middle Earth towards being a world like our own."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The young hobbit Frodo Baggins has been chosen to go on a daring quest.A few words from the encourager. I have always enjoyed a good fantasy tale, and a heroic quest. It all started when I saw the animated cartoon based on the best selling book The Hobbit.

I have just finnished volume one The Fellowship of the ring, and I will be reading volume two The two towers very soon.The Fellowship of the Ring is focused on the young hobbit Frodo, and the evil one ring.If you do not know a Hobbit is a being slightly shorter than a dwarf, they have leathery and hairy feet, and often curly hair.Frodo, along with his eight companions Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn, Boromir, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas, must send the ring into the fire it was created.The one rinc can help the evil sorcerer Souron destroy all good in middle earth.Can Frodo, and his companions put the ring into the fires of Mount Doom? Read the book, and find out.I sugest you read The Hobbit before you read The Lord of the Rings , because it will help you understand the story line of the conclusion.The only thing I don't like about this book, is it started to bore me for a while, but my interest returned. Never give up if it bores you, because your interest will return!If you like a daring quest, heroic adventures, and a good story line The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings are the books for you.I will end this with a quote from the book.In elven &quot;Ash nazg durbatuluk, ash nazg gimbitul, ash nazg thrakatuluk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul!&quot;In English &quot;One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I first read his books when I was in 4th grade and every two years or so I return. I cannot think of another book in print (other than the Bible) that people return to again and again throughout their lives. Tolkien made you feel his tale. His mastery of language allowed us to experience vividly the grandeur of Middle Earth. The languages, cultures and histories of its peoples are rich and real as any from ours. The elvish and dwarven tongues are not just nonsensical sounds slapped together but actual languages that he laboured to produce. The poetry and the songs added a weave to the tapestry of cultures that demanded to be believed. The characters that he breathed life into were real in every sense. Their thoughts acts and motivations were not simply one dimensional: Good men were bad, the brilliant made errors, some people were lucky, others not so, the herioc last stand didn't always save the day, war is very ugly and glory is fleeting, travelling on foot is very hard especially over mountains and through wastelands, eating a good meal, drinking good beer and smoking a pipe is a nice way to spend an evening. Anyone who has ever been in the military would appreciate the proper place given to the joy of a simple bath, rest and food after leagues of cross country travelling. I do not despise those who cannot wade through the reality in this fantasy. It is on a level that some may find daunting. I agree with the fellow described it as art, high art. Not everyone will get it, not everyone can &quot;get&quot; it. I must in closing, take a parting shot at those who would place Robert Jordan near him let alone over him (I blame America's education system). If it wasn't for Tolkien, Jordan would have had to rip off someone with talent closer to his own, assuring you of a tale even more dreadful than the one he spun. You won't see reviews about people not being able to comprehend his work, because it is already dumbed down for the masses. There is a reason whyTolkien's work is so beloved, because it is simply that good and that unique. The man himself is an interesting study and worthy of some time.

He's brilliant in using just as few words as necessary to describe the beings, the landscapes and the events taking place around Frodo, Gandalf and the other members of the fellowship of the ring. His dialogues are charming, pointed and so rich of both hints crucial to the plot and references to events that took place centuries ago on middle-earth. You close your eyes and you relive both the adventures of the main protagonists as well as dramas that once unfolded in the long and intricate history of middle-earth.LotR is never boring. The story flows thru the subsequent chapter like a jolly mountain brook, now and then running thru wild currents, as the companions encounter new and dangerous obstacles. But with each chapter, the creek becomes wider and in the end, it becomes a wild river, when the fellowship breaks apart at the waterfalls of Rauros. Of course two scenes stand apart from the rest. The dwarven mines of Moria are just fantastic, and whenever I reached Balin's gravestone I had goose bumps while reading. &quot;We're cut off. We can't get out ... they're coming!&quot; So few simple words, yet so much drama in that specific situation. And of course Galadriel's mirror. When Frodo offers the one ring to the elven mistress, and she resists the temptation to use the ring to preserve everything that's left of her previous life, to save Lothlorien, and instead decides to stay herself and rather whither away in beauty than become a queen of darkness and despair, the reader gets a glance at the love that Tolkien sensed for this world and his work.So, whenever you're in need of a good read and of some enchantement to lighten your mood, take LotR from your dusty book shelves and jump back into the lands of Middle-Earth, and follow the cute band of Hobbits on their adventures far away from the Shire."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is for sure the best book ever written.If you are young, prepare yourself to live a grown-up adventure.

I'm sorry, but I don't know how else to say it. I know some people here have said that he performed it on stage before recording it, but I find that hard to believe. Did anyone pay to see him? He reads as if he had never seen the books before and had put no time into familiarizing himself with the material. He never puts the emphasis where it belongs and his sentence melody is so off that a lot of the time you have to concentrate to even be able to follow what he is saying.

I sometimes stopped in parts I didn't understand, but afterwards, I moved on. I got to a point where I couldn't keep myself in the chair of the excitement and I started to jump while reading. In the prologue, I got to the point where my head almost drooped after reading the first page because it was so boring, but that's only on the prologue. I reconsidered abandoning the book three times, but my \\"book mates\\" told me not to. Something interesting about this book is that from the most interesting parts to the most boring parts, and that makes me sort of upset. This book is similar to \\"The Chronicles of Prydain\\" by Lloyd Alexander because there are different races besides humans, like dwarves, elves, and wizards. I think that the book is very colorful because its magical writing can cheer you up, just like colors do. Also because its enriched with the good use of vocabulary.I would recommend this book to male teenagers and adults because it doesn't talk about things that girls regularly do or enjoy, like fighting, for example.

It's so much better than reading a hard copy, and this is one amazing book that can be read over and over again without getting tired of it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Though receiving mixed reviews, there is little doubt that \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" stands as starting a new era for fantasy literature. Prior to its publication (July 24, 1954), fantasy adventures were aimed at young readers, including Tolkien's previous work - \\"The Hobbit\\" which was published nearly 17 years prior. While \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\" still centers on the adventures of the child-like Hobbits, the material is much darker and more serious than its predecessor. Tolkien also showed that one can deal with serious themes (machine vs. nature) in fantasy writing.Tolkien preferred the name \\"The War of the Ring\\" to the eventual title of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and he wanted it published in a single volume as part of a two-volume set which would have also contained \\"The Silmarillion\\", but Tolkien did not have much influence at that time, and so the Publisher dictated that the single work would be divided into three books, the first of which is \\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\\". Each of the three volumes is then divided into two books, though this volume also contains a prologue entitled \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" which summarizes the events in \\"The Hobbit\\" as well as provides background material about what type of beings Hobbits are.The first book is titled \\"The Ring Sets Out\\" and covers the events of Bilbo Baggins leaving the Shire after his birthday, the transfer of the ring from Bilbo to his nephew, Frodo Baggins, and the adventures of Frodo, Samwise Gamgee (Sam), Merriadoc Brandybuck (Merry), and Peregrin Took (Pippin) as they escape from the shire and travel to Rivendale. In addition, the reader is introduced to Gandalf, Strider/Aragorn, Fredegar Bolger (Fatty), Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, and Glorfindel. The reader is also introduced to the Nazgl, who and pursuing the ring. The events in this book take place over numerous years, though once the hobbits leave the shire it is a shorter period of time.The second book is titled \\"The Ring Goes South\\", though it has also been called \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" and covers the time at Rivendale. There we learn about Saruman turning on Gandalf and imprisoning him at Orthanc, and we meet the other members of the fellowship, Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli. In addition there is Gl&oacute;in (Gimli's father whom the reader would have met in the Hobbit), and Galdor. The book then covers their travels, from the failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains at Caradhras through their travel through Moria, to the forest of Lothl&oacute;rien where they meet Celeborn and Galadriel. The book ends with the breaking of the fellowship at Amon Hen. Frodo and Sam have left the others, and an Orc attack is causing confusion with the remaining members.As much as I enjoyed the movies which were based on these books, they are simply do not capture significant pieces of the story. Wonderful characters are lost, as are nuances and events which are simply cut out. Some things are changed in the movies, perhaps to make them easier to follow, so while I can certainly understand why one might enjoy the films, I would suggest that you do not deprive yourself of the opportunity to enjoy the books and the original story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Tolkien was a professor of some sort, and it shows. When I was a lad, we had to read some dreary British novel, in high school, Silas Marner, or something like that. They stretched reading it out to a very boring entire school term. It was torture, and I like to read. I slogged through this book joyfully in high school, on my own time. Why don't they have books like this in high school? There is of course far more detail than there is in the movie. This is a book assembled by a craftsman, a Kahuna- an expert- in Hawaiian terms. One can enjoy the book at a few pages per day. He has great, archetypal characters. This book set the standard. The only complaint I might make, and that is small, is that it is long- many people don't want to read something quite this long- however that is not a problem for me, I like it just as it is. This is a classic. It is even better listening to it read aloud."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I love the fact that it was available for kindle download! It makes it do much easier to carry around!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"To some people, the whole idea of this series is repetitive and boring. The hero has a horrible burden he has to destroy. There's a bunch of names you can't pronounce. Maybe so. But, for the record, this has to be one of the most awesome pieces of literature given to man.A hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins has his life take an unexpected turn when he inherits a ring from his uncle Bilbo. His friend Gandalf the wizard informs him that it is the One Ring, creation of the Dark Lord Sauron, and Sauron wants it back. If he reclaims it, he will have all the power he needs to destroy Middle Earth. The ring must be destroyed. And a fellowship of many brave friends assembles to do just that.Tolkien is a master writer. Just to give a sense of it, I used to hate poetry. Then I read Lord of the Rings. And now I love it. I took away so many lessons from this series: friendship, suffering, self-sacrifice, nobility, and yes, love as well. After all, the fellowship truly love one another, as brothers and as friends. Even now, watching the movie at the part titled \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" makes me cry. Sometimes just reading the book makes me cry.If you want to read something beautifully written, with good morals, and just pure epicness, this is the series to read. I hope everyone who reads it loves it as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"One ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.

And that is definitely a good thing, because this trilogy not only spurred the fantasy genre into a respectable position, but also provided the template for virtually every elf, dwarf, lost king, and medieval fantasy world since. It's also a wicked good read.We open some sixty years after the events of \\"The Hobbit\\" -- Bilbo Baggins is older, not much wiser, substantially wealthier, and quite eccentric (one not-so-affectionate nickname is \\"Mad Baggins\\"). He has also adopted his bright young cousin Frodo, who was orphaned at a young age and had led a rather fractured life since then. On his 111th birthday, Bilbo suddenly vanishes, leaving behind all his possessions to Frodo -- including the golden ring that allows its wearer to become invisible.Seventeen years later, Gandalf the wizard shows up again on Frodo's doorstep, and informs the young hobbit that his ring is in fact the One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron. It inevitably corrupts those who have it, and most of Sauron's power is invested in it. Trying to deflect danger from the Shire, Frodo leaves with his best friend Sam and his loyal cousins Merry and Pippin. But Frodo has only the slightest idea of the hideous and dangerous journey ahead of him, that will take him across Middle-Earth to the evil land of Mordor.Many fantasy cliches were spawned from this book (although they weren't cliches when Tolkien used them). Orcs, elves, dwarves, halflings, sprawling medieval kingdoms, dethroned kings, gray-bearded wizards and evil Dark Lords. But no one will feel that these are stale; on the contrary, they feel fresh and unused, because that is what they were when the book was first penned.Narrative-wise, this book begins on much the same note as \\"The Hobbit\\": it's lighter and more cheerful, since it opens in the Shire. But darker undertones begin to crop up in the very first chapter, when Bilbo begins clutching at the Ring and speaking in a Gollum-like manner. The pace is pretty slow and gradual until the hobbits reach Bree, at which point it becomes darker, faster and harsher in tone and pace. The matter in it also becomes more mature, particularly in the chilling scenes after Frodo is stabbed by a Nazgul.One of the things that Tolkien did exceptionally well is atmosphere. With a minimum of words, he conveys the menace of the Black Riders, the beauty of the Elves, the decay of the ancient kingdom of Moria, the mystery of such characters as Aragorn. In some areas, he deliberately didn't elaborate on the such things as the Balrog, leaving the visualization up to the readers.Another strong point is a sense of epic proportions. Too often a fantasy writer TRIES to write an epic, at the expense of individual character development. Tolkien managed to balance both of them, by focusing on the individuals in the center of epic struggles.Frodo himself is the quintessential \\"little guy\\" hero, one of the last people whom you'd expect to be on a mission to save the world. He's prone to moods of either cheerfulness or sadness, a little immature and bored at the beginning, but incredibly brave and stout-hearted when the pressure is put on him. He has no astounding destiny or special powers to help him. He's simply an ordinary person.We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. And Frodo is surrounded by a well-rounded cast of characters, including his loyal gardener Sam and his charmingly sneaky cousins, as well as a rich fellowship of ethereal Elves, mysterious men and doughty dwarves.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The fellowship to start of with is a great book at times a little boring or over descriptive.

Tolkien. The story takes place in a mysterious land by the name of Middle Earth, a land inhabited by captivating creatures such as elves, dwarves, orcs, ents and wizards, but strangest of all is the race of the hobbits. Hobbits are very docile creatures that inhabit a territory known as the Shire and tend not to stray from home, but in this story one particular hobbit known as Frodo Baggins embarks on an epic quest.To begin with a little background information will have to be given on the situation that middle-earth finds itself in. First of all an evil tyrant called Sauron has just returned and many details portend war to come. A while back Sauron had created a series of rings of power, one of which he channeled all his power into, causing it to gain control of all the others. Many years ago when Sauron was first defeated this ring was lost, and now that he has risen again it is of utmost importance to destroy the ring before it comes into the hands of the dark tyrant. Interestingly enough a very wise wizard (he is almost like a prophet at times) named Gandalf has just informed our hobbit friend, Frodo, that the ring given to him by his recently vanished uncle is the ring of power that Sauron seeks.Once Frodo is made aware of the fact that he possesses this ring of power Gandalf advises him and another hobbit loyal to Frodo, Sam, to leave the Shire immediately and travel to the House of Elrond (Elrond is a very wise elf and in his house others whom the rings business regards are present), which is quite a way off. When Sam and Frodo set off another pair of hobbits called Merry and Pippin accompany them. As the hobbits begin their journey they realize that mysterious riders that are dressed in black are following them. Later they check into an inn and meet a ranger called Aragorn, who tells them that these black riders are called Ring wraiths and have been sent by Sauron to recover the ring of power. Aragorn chooses to accompany the hobbits for security reasons, but despite this Frodo still sustains a serious injury about three-fourths of the way to the House of Elrond. Once the travelers arrive at the house of Elrond Frodo is healed and Gandalf catches up to the group. Once Frodo his regains health, discussions begin on what should be done with the ring. In the end it is decided that the ring should be destroyed and a fellowship is formed, one in which Frodo is the ring bearer. The members of this fellowship are: Gandalf, the wizard; Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin; Legolas, the elf; Boromir, the dwarf; Gimli, the dwarf; Aragorn, the ranger. Immediately after a plan of action is delineated the Fellowship proceeds to leave the house of Elrond with both the Mountain of doom (a volcano who's fire is capable of destroying the ring) and Gondor(the fortress which the dwarves need to protect).The fellowship travels for many leagues and eventually is forced to proceed by entering a dangerous underground realm called Moria. In Moria they are almost immediately pursued by goblins. These Goblins force the fellowship to travel swiftly to the exit of Moria. Once they get near the exit they need to cross a bridge but a Balrog (mythical creature of immense power) appears and blocks their way. Gandalf knows that the Balrog will be there doom so he sacrifices himself and takes the Balrog with him, allowing the Fellowship to successfully escape. Once Gandalf is gone the Fellowship decides to Proceed and eventually comes to the crossroads between Gondor and the Mountain of Doom. Here the fellowship is forced to make a decision on how to divide them, but they decide that before anything is said the ring bearer should voice his decision. Frodo then asks to be left alone for a while so that he can think, so he distances himself from the rest of his companions. While Frodo is alone Boromir comes and questions him about the ring, reaching a pint where he attacks him in order to take it away. In order to avoid any further effects of the ring on the fellowship Frodo decides to leave to the mountain of Doom on his own, but Sam forces Frodo to let him accompany him and together they escape. Finally Boromir dies trying to protect Merry and pippin from orcs, but despite his efforts the two hobbits are abducted.Now that you know the story I think it is apparent that this book is very interesting, but despite the whole book being captivating there are a few scenes, which stand out. In my opinion there is one that is especially intricate and engrossing, when Boromir attacks Frodo. In this part of the book we are able to witness the first of many negative effects that the ring of power is causing. The ring has corrupted Boromir's formerly noble mind to the point that his lust for it leads him to turn on his own companion. At one point in this scene, in reference to Boromir, the author says, \\"His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire in his eyes.\\" (pg.415) As you can see by this quote the ring was able to seize control of Boromir and twist his mind, thus creating the illusion in Boromir's mind that it was absolutely necessary for him to take control of the ring. This newfound power of manipulating minds that the ring has plays a vital role throughout the rest of the trilogy.Interestingly enough this novel is actually related to history. Many of the events and characters in the Lord of the rings trilogy (especially in the book I read, The Fellowship of the Ring) parallel various aspects of Christian history. To begin with Gandalf is a clear representation of Jesus Christ. This is evident when Gandalf dies to save his people, just as Jesus Christ did. This similarity between characters is even more evident when later in the series Gandalf resurrects. Another vary evident inclusion of Christianity in the novel is the ring of power representing the devils temptations. The ring is constantly tempting others to use it or acquire it, as can be observed when Boromir succumbs to its subtle infiltrations of his mind. Throughout the whole story Frodo himself is forced to fight off urges of wearing the ring and using its power. As you can see J.R.R. Tolkein includes many Christian ideas in this novel.This novel is a captivating tale that leaves the reader hungry for more. I especially like the way in which the author develops the power of the ring. In conclusion enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for some good fiction. If the reader likes the first novel I recommend to go ahead and read the whole trilogy and the other books associated with it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"We all know the storyline.

The newer novels are 'The Chronicles Of Thomas Covenant' by Stephan Donaldson and 'The Book of the Old Sun' novels of Gene Wolfe. (The Shadow Of The Torturer, The Claw Of The Conciliator, The Sword of The Lictor and The Citadel of The Autarch). The older novels are the Gormenghast trilogy of Mervyn Peake and of course J.R.R.Tolkein's 'The Lord Of The Rings' of which 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' is the first book. All of the books I have quoted have one thing in common and that is an astonishing depth of characterization and the invocation of a sense of a whole, new, fully consistent and fully realized place. These novels draw you in, you believe the places are real, you believe in their independent existence 'out there' somewhere. Once you read any of these books, the characters are with you forever. Thomas Covenant and Linden Avery, Titus, Flay and Steerpike, Severian and Dorcas and of course Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pipin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, Arwen, Faramir, Boromir, King Theoden, Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron, Gollum, Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, Galadriel, Eomer, Eowyn etc etc. I can read these novels now just for the chill I get at certain passages.... &quot;And they hewed Hama's body before the gates of the Hornburg after he was dead&quot; as King Theoden says to Saruman.

It has it all, love, war, magic, sorrow, pain and truth. It has such a depth of story telling that even on the second or third read through, you will find more significance than the last. And the poetry, just read it aloud, read the songs. Many fantasy writers (and straight fiction writers as well) have tried the pen of the poet in thier prose, and failed, Tolkien did not .Tolkien wrote something subtle and beautiful in these books.

He's simply an ordinary person, an everyman... or should I say \\"everyhobbit.\\"We also have Gandalf, who is fleshed out from the pleasantly crabby wizard of \\"Hobbit\\" -- we see more of his hidden sides and powers here. Sam, though not yet fully into the selfless role he plays in books two and three, aptly demonstrates his loyalty and love for Frodo, as well as displaying his progression from a shy young hobbit to someone bolder and more decisive. Merry and Pippin aren't quite into their full roles either, but they are excellent: Merry is mature beyond his years, and Pippin is (and I say this with all affection) a goodhearted flake. Elf and Dwarf fans will find their enjoyment in Legolas and Gimli, who initially grate on each other, but show the beginnings of a loyal friendship.Tolkien wasn't the first fantasy writer, but he can rightly be described as the first noted fantasy writer, and he remains top of the heap today. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is a must-read -- and then go watch the movies again."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I loved these books from the moment I read them because I believe that they are great fantasy books. I understand that the characters don't have flaws and you can't relate to them, but I think these books are still wonderful. Every fantasy book that I have ever read, which is a lot, I haven't ever really been able to relate to. That is what a fantasy book is about, it's not about emotions most of the time. I agree also that it gets boring at times, but I think most books do that. I found it so amazing that Tolkien had made up his own laguages and put so much effort into this outstanding world of fantasy. I have never read another fantasy book where you can tell how much effort has gone into it. I would not recommend seeing the movies first because you get so much more out of the books than you do the movies. If you see the movie first then you will not understand the books as much."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I liked this book very much. The story starts out in a cozy little place called the Shire. There lived Bilbo Baggins, an extremely wealthy hobbit who was quite well known for his adventures. He acquired his wealth from an adventure in which he fought trolls, goblins, giant spiders and even a mighty dragon.He planned a huge party for his 111th birthday. During his speech, he makes an unexpected surprise in which he slips on a magic ring and disappears. While invisible, he headed back to Bag End, his house, to say farewell to Gandalf, an old wizard and friend. Bilbo left everything to Frodo, even his ring, however with an odd sense of reluctance. He then left on a permanent and secret vacation.Gandalf soon discovered the cause of Bilbo's reluctance to leave the ring behind for Frodo. It was created by Sauron, an evil sorcerer with one goal, to conquer all of Middle Earth. He seeks the Ring and it wishes to be found by him. Should he get it, all of Middle Earth would lie within Sauron's grasp. As long as it remains hidden, there is a risk he shall find it. It also can only be destroyed in the heart of his empire where it was created, deep within the fires of Mount Doom.Frodo and his gardener, Sam Gamgee, set out on a journey to Rivendale with the Ring to decide what should be done with it. It is a long and perilous journey. Sauron's spies are everywhere. To make matters worse, they are pursued by hideous Black Riders, armored zombies-like creatures on horses whose only mission is to get the Ring - at all costs! All hope for Middle Earth lies in two hobbits. Will Frodo and Sam successfully make their journey to Rivendale, or will Sauron prevail?I liked this book quite a bit. It has such a realistic plot line you could believe that it really happened. The idea with the Ring of Power, Sauron, hobbits, dwarves, elves and goblins was incredibly creative. J.R.R. Tolkien must have had quite an imagination to make this story and I look forward to reading his other books as well.I also loved how much detail he gave the characters. They seem so real and you can really see the book from Frodo's point of view even though it's not in first person. In most parts, such as the mines of Moria, the book was riveting. However, in other parts, such as the forest of Lothlorien or the House of Tom Bombadil, it loses its grip.I would recommend this book to people 12 and up. The only factor to that is it's just so complicated. Even I found it hard to understand every now and then. It's a great story anyway and I loved it. I give J.R.R. Tolkien's: Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring: 4 Stars"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is so good! The first 100 pages were a challenge but then it then it really got exciting. I saw the movie and thought is was overated. I hesitaded to read the book but I thought I would give it a try and I fell in love with it!!!!!!!!! Definetly a must read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"It would be incorrect to simply place this novel in the category of fantasy/action. Here, Tolkien attempts to create the first, truly English piece of mythology, and he succeeds brilliantly with unmatchable skills in world-building. Many find the first 100-200 pages slow and tedious, yet these pages testify to Tolkien's relentless imagination and the wholeness of his world. This is a piece of true literature, and should not be read with impatience and sloppiness."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book, although a little slow at the start, has tons of action, and suspense. The book is made great because it has just the right combination of action, suspense, betrayal, and loyalty. It keeps you turning pages from the point when the hobbits are pursued by black riders, and sheltered by elves, with danger at every turn, all in the \\"peaceful\\" Shire.This book begins with the passing of the ring from Bilbo to his heir, Frodo. Gandalf eventually figures out it is the One Ring of Sauron, and Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin leave the shire. Through many perils they reach the Prancing Pony Inn, and meet Strider (aka Aragorn, son of Arathorn). From here, the story becomes truly exciting, with a fight with the black riders, and a flight to Rivendell. From here a company of nine sets out, including the four hobbits, Gimli, a dwarf, Legolas, an elf, Strider, Gandalf the Grey, and Boromir, a man of Gondor."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The Lord of the Rings is a well written, complex, yet understandable, deep and thoughtful, yet easily connected to, work of fantasy. The Fellowship of the ring is the first part. Within its numerous pages, you will find all the questions, and some of the answers (of the questions) posed to you over the course of your life. The story follows the quest of Frodo Baggins, who has been entrusted with the ring of power, which he must destroy, for if the enemy regains it, the world of good will come to an end. With only a few companions, he sets out to complete an impossible, quest, will little hope of either success, of survival. the only thing that keeps him going is his love for his people, and the knowledge that the world's fate is in his hands. The moral issues, questions of greed, and wants, and fortune which arise, are some of the deepest you will find in fantasy stories. A master of both his languages and the one in which he writes, Tolkien masters emotions, fate, a world picture, and characters which do not even need to be explained for the reader to be able to relate to them. There is a magic in the work of good writers which allows one to get totally indulged in the characters, their problems, and their emotions. Tolkien is a master of that magic.I the year 2001, NewLine Cinema released to the public a cinematic take-off on the Lord of the Rings. According to the producers it was a movie which was intended to stay as \\"Faithful to the book\\" as possible. It was a movie which should have never been made. Although it is a masterpiece of a film, with excellent actors, and phenomenal landscape and music, it lost most, if not ALL of the magic inherent of the book series. A true reader of literature, and moreso a faithful reader of tolkien, will not hold this film in high regards. There is no \\"Lord of the Rings: The Movie\\". This movie has no authority over the true story. Watching the movie before reading the book leaves one with little appretiation for an excellent work of art. DO NOT DO SO. If you can help it, do not watch any cinematic version at all, but instead revel in the magic, and power of the epic trilogy. Tolkien didn't write an action/adventure film, nor was he targeting the mainstream media of the early 21st century (during which, consequently, he was/is not alive.) He was, as all writers are, (speaking from experience)writing to express ideas, and feelings, and true issues. This book will take you to a world you have never been before, and give you views on life you never had. This book is not just entertainment, this book is a way of life. Please read it, and it's two sequels. And don't even think of the movie."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I would strongly recommend this book to any reader that likes fantasy. This book has amazing character development, as well as many action scenes. It has several parts that are boring, and have no excitement. However this is for character development and is needed for the plot. The many scenes that are exciting balance the book perfectly. This is a great read for any reader that enjoys reading, but not light reading."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I loved the book called \\"Lord of the rings\\", because their is a lot of action and fighting, and not a whole lot of ROMANCE like other books. I also like the old style of military like archers and swordsman, and that is another reason why i love this book! It is also kind of spooky, and I love horror films.The best part of the book is when they started to climb the mountain and that one wizard started pusing rocks on them, and they started to fight with the enemy's. That was probably the best action scene in the book.I think conflict and characters are the most important. conflict is the most important one because that is what the whole book is about. You need to have characters otherwise who will be in the story?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Unfortunately, I have not read the books and don't have time to. I have just recently started listening to audio books on my long commute. This unabridged version has to be the next best thing to actually reading it. The reader has a good range in his voice to distinguish different characters and it never sounds dry or dull. The story really draws you in and seems so real that you want more. I wanted to listen to this before I see the movie, which I'm going to do this weekend because I'm almost finished. There is no doubt that I will be buying the next audio book next week so I can continue the story. This is very entertaining all the way through the 20 hours of listening and I recommend it without reservation."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"After nearly ten years of people telling me I *had* to read the Lord of the Rings trilogy I broke down and finally did so. Having read The Hobbit in high school I thought I knew what to expect from Tolkien's trilogy. I was very wrong. The world he creates here is richer and more fully realised than the Middle-earth of The Hobbit. This, unlike The Hobbit, is a story on an epic scale and Tolkien never lets you forget that.As the first novel in the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, obviously, must set the stage for the next two novels. That means a lot of back story and that many characters and themes need to be introduced. It also means that it doesn't wrap things up in a neat little bow when you reach the last page. This bothers people for some reason.Some other reviewers here have said that Fellowship is boring. While I would agree that there are slow spots in Fellowship, I would never call it boring. The bits of the story you learn from Gandalf's meeting with Frodo in the Shire or the Council of Elrond are important much later and Tolkien needs to bring them in when he does. Even the journey to Rivendell (what I thought to be a rather slow bit) introduces a good many characters. The pay-off for the dull parts come in the sections dealing with the Mines of Moria and the journey down the river from Lorien. Tolkien is a master storyteller and he does not waste a single word.If you've enjoy reading works on an epic scale (The Odyssey, Beowulf) then you'll enjoy Tolkien's world."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Tolkien's &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy literally created the genre of heroic fantasy, spawning works as diverse as those written by Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel Delany, Terry Brooks, and of course, even J. K. Rowling's &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. You can also hear echoes of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; in both the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, and especially, &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (Indeed J. Michael Straczynski, the creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; has often acknowledged his debt to Tolkien.). Yet it stands head and shoulders above them all as an epic tale of friendship, devotion, and faith as a motley crew of heroes valiantly try to stop the evil Sauron from conquering all of Middle-earth. In &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;, Frodo Baggins undertakes a perilous journey as the Ring bearer, the keeper of Sauron's one ring of power, without which the dark lord can not hope to conquer all of Middle-earth. Frodo is joined in his quest by such noble figures as the Human ranger Strider (later revealed as Aragorn, the last surviving descendant of a legendary lineage of kings), the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, the wizard Gandalf, Frodo's kinsmen Merry and Pippin, and his ever faithful friend Samwise Gamgee.Much to my amazement, Peter Jackson's filmed adaptation of &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; remains remarkably quite faithful to the text, though compressing some details for dramatic license, and omitting the important character of Tom Bombadil. Indeed, the film ends at the very opening of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the next installment of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;, with the fellowship dispersed and with Boromir, another of the humans, dead. If you haven't read Tolkein's epic before, you're in for a veritable literary feast after seeing Jackson's elegant adaptation (One of the finest filmed adaptations of a literary work I've seen in a long, long time.). However, I'd recommend reading this splendid work first before viewing Jackson's cinematic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien took forever to write this book, but I think both he and I would have been saved a lot of time if he just cut down his lenghthy descriptions and stuck to the plot. The ridiculous songs, included to add an ancient, mysterious tone to the book, really don't contribute to the book's success, nor do the historical ramblings or repetitive descriptions of the characters' surroundings.Yes, yes, I know some nut who's so caught up in fantasy that he dresses like a hobbit himself will no doubt criticize my review, stating that the descriptions and songs and countless pages of dribble make the story SO REAL and it's the alternate reality that makes this story a masterpiece. But for those of us still living on planet earth, it's just a bit too much to have to deal with the long-winded, unnecessary parts of this book.BUT, the plot is excellent, and that's what kept me reading. Although not as exciting as The Hobbit (a superior book in my opinion), the great storyline and exciting turn of events were enough for me to call this book a good one. I will read the other books in the trilogy, now knowing what to expect.I do recommend this book, but just realize what you're in for. If you have the patience, it's worth your time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"OK-first I've got to confess that I avoided &quot;Ring&quot; geeks in high school-they were way too passionate (zealots?). Over the years, I've resisted and when I finally read and loved &quot;The Hobbit&quot; I decided to read &quot;Fellowship&quot; a year ago. Since then I put it down twice, getting bogged down in the lengthy history of Middle Earth that precedes the actual story. Once I decided to skip it altogether, things built speed rapidly and I ended up really enjoying the book.Since many will consider reading this based on seeing the film, I'll add that I saw the movie and was blown away by how well the filmmakers told the story, leaving out the parts that are nice but superfluous, and keeping the core intact. That said, the book makes more clear the monumental task of gathering opposing forces against a common enemy and shows why the choices characters make (the elf-queen, for instance) are not as simple as they appear in the film.I also realized how thoroughly George Lucas &quot;borrowed&quot; from &quot;Rings&quot; in the first 3 Star Wars movies..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I debated whether or not to write a review for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I mean, there really isn't a whole lot more that I can say that hasn't been said already. However, I decided to go ahead and add another two cents worth.THE LORD OF THE RINGS is my favorite novel of all time. It's a shame that all the books weren't printed together as one when they were first published; one has to discuss each part of the series separately. Anyway, Tolkien's novel (of which this is the first part) is the granddaddy of all fantasy and science fiction. Before Tolkien came along, there really wasn't much in the realm of fantasy fiction or even science fiction. It took a master of language to write an extended sequel to a children's story he once wrote to enliven the genre. For the fact alone, Tolkien's work will remain as a classic and endure for ages to come.Yet, there is more to it than that. Tolkien's masterpiece is more than something that started a new genre. It is a great story, one of the best, culminated from many great stories of the past (Shakespeare, Norse mythology, Chaucer, etc.) and imbedded in the morals of Tolkien's Christian faith. It is a story that all men long to live. It is a tale about life. It's about friendship. It's a story about death, redemption, and salvation; a tale of good triumphing over evil. Combining all those elements (and so many others) into one story is a great feat. So, here's to Tolkien and THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Long may it endure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I see many reviewers giving low ratings and was disappointed. For one, it shows how little people care for details and setting these days. The main reason the details are there in the first place is because it is a different world with a different history. The characters were fine the way they were, unless you wanted another 200 pages of &quot;tedious&quot; reading.I think there are people who should stick with MTV and the WWF for entertainment and there are others who can handle something more involving. If you are the latter and love fantasy epics then you probably have already read this trilogy, if not then I recommend getting The Hobbit first and then the non-film versions of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Well, I decided to read this book once more before going to see the movie. It would have only been twice, but I still needed to refresh my memory badly. Was I ever glad that I did! This story is so full of adventure, danger, and mystery it's not even funny. Each page opens up into a new world with things never even imagined by this reader. Reading about the dark lord Sauron sent chills down my spine because this is one of the most evil characters ever created. I can't believe some people say the characters are one dimensional! Every single character has their own distinct personality, and by the end I had grown to love them all.Unfortunately I wound up in the climax during finals week. I couldn't get any studying done because I couldn't put this amazing book down! If you pick up this book and find the first 100 pages or so slow, keep reading...it really starts to pick up. Read this...60 years later it can still thrill, amaze, delight, and even sometimes, cause a laugh. In case you don't know, the story is about a fellowship of hobbits, humans, and other creatures who must take the one ring to be destroyed in the one place where it can be destroyed: In the middle of evil Sauron's vast land. If Sauron got ahold of it, he would be able to rule all of middle earth with it...and make everyone his slave...this ring is the most powerful of all rings. I recommend reading before seeing the movie, but if you don't, by all means, read it anyway when the movie's over. Then, pick up the next two!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"If you don't like this book, then you just don't get it. Tolkien has created a world unlike any ever seen in literature before. The story is amazing and has everything: good vs. evil, rousing adventure, magic, friendship, loyalty, an unlikely hero and the most amazing characters ever created by a fantasy writer. If you haven't read this book, where have you been? This is where J.K. Rowling, Brian Jacques, Susan Cooper and Philip Pullman all got their inspiration. If you have ever loved a fantasy book, fantasy movie, or just love a great story, then you need to read this book. Tolkien started it all."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Now, I will start by saying that J.R.R. Tolkien is incredible, and Middle Earth is truly a masterpiece. However, he may have been better off just building the world and letting someone else ghost-write the actual books.The problem is that there isn't a single aspect of Middle Earth that he *doesn't* mention in this book. Since there's no way to just sort of work the details in, there are large amounts of *explaining* by the narrator. Consequently, the book looks more like a documentary than a novel. Tolkien would have been better off leaving out details, if there was no good way to include them without having to actually spend a full chapter describing the Shire.So, if you can put up with the *extraordinarily* slow pace, you may enjoy this book. I would say, though, that this is one of those extremely rare cases where the movie is better."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The book I read is named The Fellowship of the Ring from The Lord of the Rings series. The author of the book is J.R.R. Tolkien. The book is the sequel of The Hobbit. The books setting starts of in a town called Hobbition were Bilbo Baggins (the main character in The Hobbit) was shortly having his 111th birthday party. Suddenly one of Bilbo's old friends Gandalf (who is a wizard) came to visit him and talk to him about Bilbo's magic ring that be had found during one of his adventures in the past. Gandalf wanted that ring destroyed and had an argument over it. Bilbo ended up giving the ring to his nephew Frodo and then he disappeared. He left notes to all of relatives including Frodo. Gandalf told Frodo what be wanted to do with the ring (destroy it) and be accepted the mission. He was given help by three other Hobbits named Sam, Pippin, and Merry. Merry went ahead of the others at first.The Company set of on there journey to destroy the ring. The first enemy they came across was the Black Riders. The Black Riders are men on horseback who carry swords with them and cause terror to people. They escaped the Riders and came to where an old farmer's land that has killer dogs. The farmer picked them up and they met up with Merry. They went through a forest and a swamp and came to a land that is called Bree-land. They met a spy named Strider who was sent by Gandalf to met up with the company and lead them through the rest of the adventure. They continued their adventure with a new leader but they were all a little uneasy about Strider. They had another attack from the Black Riders and Frodo was almost turned into one. (Black Riders take a magic knife and stab their victims in the heart and their victims turn into Riders.) The company found out that the Riders want the magic ring. An Elf leader named Elrond met them and they went to the house of Elrond (Elrond's house.) When the company got there Gandalf, Bilbo, and lots of other people were there. There was a long meeting and it was voted that they continued the journey. Gandalf, Glimi (an Elf that joined Bilbo in his journey), and Legolas (an elf representing Elves.) So they continued on the journey. They went through the forest in the dark and were attacked by giant crows and the men were injured. They kept on going and were cornered by wolves and then Gandalf caught them on fire by magic and they escaped. The company moved on and they met (unexpectedly) lots ofOrcs and a few trolls. Gandalf was captured but the rest escaped with a few scratches. They came to a land named Lothlorien. They were given three boats to travel with on their adventure. They traveled on the Great River to get rid of the ring. They went on the shore and were going to get rid of the ring but Frodo and Sam took a boat and they wanted to go destroy The Lord of the Rings (the original keeper of both the magical rings who is evil.) To find out what happens in the rest of the series you have to read part two and three that are named The Two Towers and The Return of the King. I recommend this book to people who like fantasy and magic stories. The Fellowship of The Ring is a good book.By,Lance Hueston"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"First, a disclaimer to those of you who would attack me personally because I didn't like the book: I AM a very intelligent, bright person (straight As in college kind of bright.) I do not believe that (as some have said before in response to unfavorable reviews) any lack of intelligence on my part led to me disliking this particular book.Second, I have not seen the movie. It has been my goal for years now to read the Fellowship of the Ring. I have attempted it at least four times in the last five years, and I finally finished it this evening. The last book I read before this took less than 24 hours to read, and I have been stuggling for two months to read this. In the meantime, I read about 20 other books. I was bored.I understand the concept of world-building. And Tolkien has done a magnificent job of that, I agree. But I also think that world-building is just about the only thing that has gone on here. I was startled by the lack of depth of character. I wanted desperately to care about Frodo, and only in the last ten pages did we really understand that Frodo really has come to grips with his task. Before this moment, Frodo is purely reactionary. He sets off on a journey because he is told to, he eats when he's hungry, sleeps when he's tired. For the majority of the book, he makes no conscious decisions, he only REACTS. Of all of the characters, I felt that Sam was the only one who was remotely accessible. He was the only character whose motivations are clear and interesting. I agree that his loyalty is moving.The journey narrative is so very popular, but describing just about every day &quot;they awoke early that morning&quot; makes me just as tired as the poor pony they drag with them. I am a fan of sci-fi, fantasy and plain old great literature, and damnit, I just wanted something to HAPPEN. I wanted to believe that Tolkien cares what happens to them. I intend to read the next book, because if I don't this is a HUGE letdown. The plot didn't sweep me up at all. If I never read the Two Towers, I'll be just fine. You know it's a great book when you can't breathe until you have the sequel in your hands.This reminds me of Star Wars: Episode 1. This was a narrative so hung up on introducing all the major points, that it in itself doesn't go anywhere. It's the trilogy dilemma! Any author who plans three books from the get go better have a lot of action planned for the first one! But this has no purpose other that to set things up for book two! When Ep. 1 came out, I got so sick of hearing, &quot;Well, they'll explain that in the next movie.&quot; Then why am I investing my time in something so wholly unsatisfying? Why don't I just wait for the next one?I'm also interested to know how many women enjoyed these books. I'm 24, and every man my age gets such a look of joy on his face at the mention of Frodo. I've never spoken to a girl who liked it that much. I wonder why that is? I personally would have enjoyed even a touch of the feminine in this book- I'm not talking romance. I may be a girl, but I normally hate romantic subplots. I just personally lose touch when the female presence is so absent. I think it's a hard book to identify with if you're female. I could be wrong.I just expected so much more in what is considered the greatest fantasy ever written. Maybe that's why I didn't like it- everyone says how great it is, puts it on such a pedestal, that it will never be as great as you all say it is- there's no way it could be. Here's hoping that something interesting happens in the next chapter."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This, being the first part of a trilogy, was long in itself. Four hundred and ten pages, and the pages contain about twice as much as a normal page. The writing is also very, very descriptive and imagery takes the center stage, so many readers (child and adult alike) will struggle with this book. Many will even put it down and deem it unreadable, much like I did the first two time I began it. This book is only for very patient readers. That being said, it's a classic.Pour a cup of tea. Heck, sit it on a tea cozy. Turn off your phone, and absorb the writing. Visualize the mountains, rivers, all of the scenery. Feel what is happening, don't just read it. True, there is a lot of back story that could have been taken out, but it wasn't. So deal, and read it--most of it, if not all, is interesting. The story itself is marvelous, and has shaped the entire genre of fantasy into what it is today. Without Tolkien, all of this \\"world-making\\" going on would have never seen the light of day, so pay homage where homage is due. Not only is this work legendary, it is also very entertaining.The tone grows increasingly dark as the novel progresses, but not awkwardly so. It seems fitting that as the valiant fellowship gets closer and closer to Mordor, the lair of the evil Sauron, that the subject matter should get heavier and the mood should darken. Speaking of the fellowship, Tolkien describes them in such a way that we get closer to all nine members. We get inside their brains and feel how they feel, and especially see what they see.I look forward to \\"The Two Towers\\" and, especially, some more dialogue from Mr. Gollum himself.10/10 Classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book is good for anybody who has the patience to sit down to read a fantasy book, a long one.

It was a great pleasure to return to Middle-Earth to make this epic journey again. Tolkein's attention to detail, in particular to the development of the history and backstory, pay huge dividends in making this story believable. You can't help but be drawn into this quest to save the world. Tolkein's characters are complex and even his heros don't always get along. The story is full of surprises, some of them pleasant, others, not so much. The thing that surprised me the most, upon re-reading, was the time span of this story, with large gaps in time glossed over in the telling. If anything, this helps reinforce the epic nature of this saga."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bid them. These were the words inscribed on the one ring in the black language of Mordor, the one ring that was forged by the dark lord Sauron; the ring of power is all Sauron needs to cover all of Middle Earth in eternal darkness. All that prevents Sauron from spreading his dark dominion is Frodo and his companions. Frodo was chosen to be the ring bearer and to carry the ring to the one place where it could be destroyed-Mount Doom, the very heart of Sauron's kingdom.This is the setting of the great trilogy of the Lord of the Rings written by J.R.R. Tolkien-the man who is widely acknowledged by many as the father of modern day fantasy. The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, begins on Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday. Bilbo, weary of his life in the Shire, desires to have adventures like he's had before. Before Bilbo's departure he leaves his possessions to his nephew Frodo Baggins but he is reluctant to part with his precious ring. Bilbo finally parts with the ring after the wizard Gandalf the Grey convinces him to. Several years pass and Gandalf returns to Frodo in the Shire and reveals the truth about the ring. This is when Frodo's great journey began. When Frodo eventually reaches Rivendale a counsel is called and The Fellowship is formed. Its members include Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimly, Boromir, and Gandalf. The hobbits had many powerful people to aid them but these powerful people weren't the true heroes in the story.The \\"great heroes\\" in this novel are people who are arguably least suitable for the job. The hero wasn't Aragorn, son of Arathorn, the heir to the throne of Gondor, nor was it the great wizard Gandalf the Grey, the great heroes were Hobbits. Hobbits aren't known for their greatness; they are content with their life in the Shire and care very little about the outside world. Yet, hobbits were the ones who had the fate of Middle Earth placed in their hands. Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin (Pippin) Took, and Meriodic (Merry) Brandybuck were the greatest heroes. They are by no means powerful. They don't wield magic or swords with great skill; they are just ordinary people, but their ordinary qualities are what make them great.Although Tolkien's characters are very interesting I think they could've been developed in greater detail. Much of Tolkien's rich descriptions were focused on the appearance of the landscape or the history which was involved. Very rarely, if ever, does Tolkien describe the thoughts of his characters; Tolkien writes in an omnipresent viewpoint-the reader sees the events but they don't see into the character's psychology or reasoning. The reader doesn't get to know the character on a personal level through interpreting their feelings, the motivations of a character must be interpreted through dialogue or their actions.Boromir's desire to use the ring to defeat Sauron shows how he is greedy and impulsive. He has the same traits that the Nazgul, the undead servants of Sauron, had while they were human. They desired power so they were easily deceived and corrupted.Other information can be inferred though a character's dialogue. It is evident that Gandalf has great power but the magnitude of his power is never completely apparent. A glimpse of Gandalf's true power is shown at the bridge of Khazad-dum. While the fellowship journeyed through the dark mines of Moria they encounter a Balrog-a demon of the underworld. Once they reach the bridge Gandalf confronts this demon directly and makes a definite statement, \\"You shall not pass.\\" No fear is evident in Gandalf and it was obvious that he is facing a creature of immense power, a creature powerful enough to cause hordes of orcs and goblins to flee like cowards. In spite of this Gandalf confidently stated, \\"Dark fire shall not avail you here...\\" This was a further display of his lack of fear. Gandalf's confidience gives us a glimpse of his true power. People are usually afraid of things that are greater than them; Gandalf's confidence implies that he knows that his power is on the same level if not higher than the Balrog's. It was only because Gandalf dropped his guard that the Balrog was able to pull him down as he fell.After losing Gandalf the fellowship was forced to continue on. Even after losing his great friend and mentor Frodo and the other hobbits still continued this journey while carrying his heavy burden. Through their actions Tolkien demonstrates the bond of friendship that existed between the hobbits. This is what made the hobbits great; in spite of adversity their friendship stayed true and they stayed by each other's side. Through Frodo's journey he was never truly alone; Sam had vowed to stay by his side. To me, one of the most interesting aspects of the hobbits is where their strength lied, in their friendship.Tolkien's interesting characters and intriguing story combined to make an excellent novel. My only complaint is that I wish he would've wrote about some of the other characters like Gandalf and Aragorn in greater detail but that wasn't something that Tolkien wanted to focus on. The main focus of his novel was the hobbits and the extraordinary accomplishments that came from these very ordinary people. Even though I wished that Tolkien would have given more exposure to some of his other characters, I agree that Lord of the Rings definitely deserves to be known as a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Having seen the movie adaptation twice, and looking forward with great eagerness to the next installment, I decided it was time to re-read the novel. I used to read it twice a year, religiously, starting from when I was in grade school---third or fourth grade, I think---and even now I pick it up at least a three or four times every decade. I can still write my name in Elf-runes...I was (and am) fascinated by Tolkien's world-building, so desperately imitated by so many neophyte fantasy writers. This world-building is a good portion of the attraction of the book, for me. It feels so complete. As a kid, I wanted so much to believe that it was true (not, at that point, being able or willing to differentiate between the truth of art-making and the truth of history). It resonates at a very deep level for me, all those Jungian archetypes and half-remembered myths. At a time when I was becoming aware (and frightened) of my own adolescent mortality, I wanted desperately to believe in the immortality of the Elves...And every time I go back to it, I am surprised all over again at how grand the story-telling is---I tend to remember the writing as beautiful but lugubrious, but Tolkien actually evokes places and personalities swiftly and skillfully.I read a lot of schlock in the early 70's which featured large ad-copy: &quot;Not since Tolkien has an author blah blah, blah...&quot; but there are very few who work satisfied me as his did (and still does). Ursula K. LeGuin. Octavia Butler, Sheri Tepper, Orson Scott Card. Sharon Shinn. Ray Bradbury when he's not overdosing on lyricism. But Tolkien is the Master, the one to go back to. I'm not as fond of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, but I can gladly recommend Smith of Wootten Major and Farmer Giles of Ham---both terrific little books with deep resonance."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"The reason that I read this book is so that I could have some background knowledge to help me understand the book's movie, once it comes out this winter. The book certainly fulfills that purpose, and is a very good book as well, but there are some problems with Tolkien's writing that made it harder to read than it should be.I'm sure that, with all the positive reviews (...), you're already aware of all the better parts of the story, so before I say those opinions for myself, let me say what's not so great about it: pacing problems. The first hundred pages of the book are used solely to provide the backstory, when this could probably have been done in 50 pages. And although the action sequences in the Mines of Moria are appropriately fast-paced, this was done at the expense of one of these scenes making immediate sense- very unfortunate, seeing as this particular scene is practically the climax of the book. And I really wish that the last chapter had just been left out; it feels more like a poorly-worded attempt at starting the next book than an ending. But note that I'm only noting three problems with the book. Those were the only problems that I could identify, and that's saying something about the quality of the rest of the book. Great characters, a consistent world, and generally lots of innovation make me glad I read this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I was just checking this site out for the first time, and I have to leave this comment, those who said this novel is boring should learn the virtue of patience and understanding. The first portion of the book many claim to be boring, in fact it is just slow and is imperative to developing the deep rich story to unfold, much like Stephen King does in his novels(whadda you know he's the most reknowned author of Horror in the world!)so they are quite obviously a key component to the story, while in many novels I read I was left to guess about a character or there were just flat characters. This book will go down in history along with it's other companions. The number of publications Tolkien's many works have recieved is proof of the quality of his work which has set the standard for fantasy writing, which remains unparalleled to this day. Few authors compare to Tolkien, but these in my opinion come closest. Terry Brooks, David Eddings and the duo(Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman). There are many other authors which you already know who write forgettable novels. Tolkien's works are unforgettable and I haven't read this trilogy for 5 or 6 years, when I was in 6th or 7th grade and I only read it once, and I can recall that I did not want it to end, for several days afterward I would just lay flabbergasted on my bed after school and in the morning and dream about the vivid characters and places which Tolkien had unfolded me, I can still remember the entire story after not having turned a page since the years I read it. I have read many other fantasy books and most I found to be the same predictable formula which quickly becomes boring. Sticking through with the remainder of this series you will discover for yourself how Tolkien stands apart."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Tolkein has created a world of hobbits, elves, dwarfs and wizards that's so real you feel you're reading a history book. Unfortunately, I wanted to read the rollicking good tale that Tolkein buried with plodding details of topography, weather, and history instead. The pacing is so off that several chapters are given to a character that has nothing to do with the plot, while a pivotal scene involving Galdalf is told as a puny, bland page or two flashback. Luckily, the movie excavated the story and showed us what this book could have been if Tolkein was as skilled at storytelling as he was at world inventing."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I wanted to love this book, but it just didn't happen. I liked it up until about 2/3 of the way through. Tolkien has a keen imagination and a talent for making the reader want to believe in his creations. But there's also an undramatic over-reliance on exposition in his writing that needlessly bogs down the story, ultimately putting a wedge between the characters and reader (at least this one).I wasn't wild about &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but still wanted to give the world of Middle Earth another try. I thought &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was a pretty good little adventure-quest story spoiled by a not so great ending.I had a similar experience with &quot;Fellowship&quot;. For the first couple hundred pages, Tolkien had me. &quot;Fellowship&quot; wasn't the best book I'd ever read, but I was certainly immersed in the world, and was enjoying turning the pages.You'll have to excuse me for going to the Titanic for a fitting metaphor, but that's the only thing I can think of at the moment. I felt like the book hit its iceberg at the Meeting of Elron, about 2/3 of the way through.The fun-if-slow-going story comes to a screeching halt as Tolkien goes into mind-numbing hyper-exposition mode for close to 30 pages. The story continues on after that, but falteringly--the fatal damage has already been done. The book just gets heavier and heavier after that, until it just can't stay afloat.There are some great passages and concepts in &quot;Fellowship&quot; (I especially liked the psychological insitefulness Tolkien displays in having the ring possess its possessor). But there is a distance in the way that Tolkien writes his characters that just kept me from becoming fully engaged."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Tolkien's book is undoubtedly the pinnacle of the fantasy genre.Peter Jackson's films are a masterful and enthralling adaptation.Rob Inlglis's unabridged narration is a worthy and thoroughly enjoyable audio experience.But this 'dramatization' is so horrendously awful that I couldn't even get through the first CD!The Hobbits sound like demented Chipmunks... Merry is voiced by a woman... Frodo is American... the narrator sounds like an Irish DJ... The list of atrocities goes on.I would love to cast this production back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. As it is, I'll just say this: DON'T BUY IT!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is absolutely the best book ever. I think that J.R.R. Tolkien is a very talented author. How he thinks up these things I have no clue, but he just does. If you are interseted in a great novel, you should read this book. This is a good \\"summer reading\\" story that you should really consider. Not only are the maps and things drawn well, but the story is beautifully written. The descriptions are very wonderful, and tell so much about the environment around you that you feel like you're there. The story is great, the characters are greatly-imagined, and everything is amazing about this book. I think that if you're a reader looking for a good book, then this is a best-choice that should be read."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I read this book because everybody told me that the movie was excellent, I didn't saw the movie because I like to read the book instead of the movie, but this book was completely disappointing to me, is a hard book to read and all the story (when you can find it) is really boring."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I am not a real fan of fantasy literature and this is a book that has sat on my shelf for years. One of those \\"I should read this but will get to it one day\\" books. When I knew the movie was coming out, I picked up and read ... and read ... and read. I now understand why Tolkien is considered a master of the English language. He has a unique nack of creating this world and bringing you in to it like you were there. I would put Tolkien down as one of my favorite authors now along with Dostovesky and Jane Austen. In a way that Dostevesky takes a reader into the psyche of his characters and Miss Austen into the manners of her day, Tolkien takes the reader into a world that you don't want to leave."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have to admit hesitating when person after person told me to read The Lord of the Rings. Finally, I bought the book and just read it, and there are few books as written as well as this.I had to, however, not give it the 5 stars it surely deserves because it can be a tough read. It's an old book, so the prose is &quot;dated.&quot; It can also be very historical at times, delving into pasts far from the present, and never to be spoken of again.But THAT'S what makes this such an engrossing tale...the histories. Everything from Bilbo's songs to the story of Strider's sword add to each beings personality and give them a life that few modern writers can achieve.And the images Tolkien can conjure span many generations and are as individual as the person reading it. He gives enough information of the Shire and Rivendale and Bree and everywhere else to form an idea, but not so much so that he corners you into seeing what the next person sees. The many interpretations of Frodo himself are testement to this.If you want something to read in two days, grab a Brooks novel, if you want something you can read again and again and get something new from it each time, I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the best book in the trilogy. It is more detailed then an autobiography. If you do not own this book i advise you to buy it. it has been rated the best book ever and i agree.(...) Loads of supporting characters:Aragorn or Strider, Faramir, Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc, Peregin, Boromir, Bilbo, Gandalf, Eomyr, and Galadriel. One problem is Aragorn or Strider should have had a bigger role. Bilbo has a big role even though he is not in it alot that is very respectable. I like that the ring did not exclude Bilbo in its power.The mission is very clear and precise but how to get it done is shady and i like that. I like how they set up the dark lord and his minions(orcs). The book set it up so i could not avoid the second book(the two towers). This is a 10 star work.This is the best book Tolkien has ever written.This a classic masterpiece and I will not dissagree. I know I am young and you will think i dont know what i am talking about but i do and i would like you to read this. This book would be suitable for ages 10 and up. This would be a book any kid would like to see under the tree on Christmas.The book has loads of facts: four Family trees, the rune alphabet, and an Index split into sections for easy info. there is not enough words to explain this instant masterpiece. You will never want to put this book down."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I just finished reading, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; (FOTR) a few days ago. It was my second time and I think it is my favorite part of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR). Some of my favorite incidents happen here from, &quot;An Unexpected Party,&quot; where many a Hobbit gather for Bilbo's farewell party to, &quot;At the Sign of The Prancing Pony,&quot; a visit to a busy inn in the Hobbit town of Bree. Also, the chapters, \\"Many Meetings,\\" and, \\"The Council of Elrond,\\" are rare times of joy and rest where many different races meet for the Council of Elrond. Then, of course, there are the climatic chapters, \\"A Journey in the Dark,\\" and, \\"The Bridge of Kazad-dum.\\" and, \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\"What I like about the novel is this is where one learns the background of the tale; where did the Ring come from, what does it do and where has it been all these centuries? Tolkien creates a feeling that FOTR stands in a long tradition; the world of the novel is already thousands of years old by the time we visit it. After one finishes the entirety of the Lord of the Rings, \\"The Silmarillion,\\" provides the creation myth and the ancient history of the Elves and the other races of Middle-Earth; Tolkien worked on it his whole life.There is also a great feeling of ambience; from the way Tolkien describes geography to the description of buildings and the physical description of characters. On a deeper level, one has the feeling that the current age is about to set and another age is about to rise. The mysterious, powerful, joyous Elves of old are about to fade away and leave Middle-Earth (where Tolkien set his story) forever and Men will takeover and so begin the Fourth Age.The story is suspenseful, as the small company of Hobbits sets out from their sheltered homeland called the Shire to far off Rivendell, just west of the Misty Mountains. All along the way, they are followed by the Black Riders who seek to recover the Ring from Frodo (the Hobbit who carries it) and return it to its evil Master. At times, Frodo is tempted to use the power of the Ring even though he knows that it is evil. At Bree, the company meets with Strider; who wears&quot;[a] travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a good that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits.&quot;They all journey to Rivendell, where the many tales of old are told and the Council of Elrond is called to decide the fate of the Ring. The decision is made and a Fellowship made to guide Frodo; Merry, Sam, Pippin (his original Hobbit companions), Legolas (an Elf of Mirkwood), Gimli (a Dwarf of the Lonely Mountain), Boromir (Man of Gondor), Strider, and Gandalf the Grey (a wizard) set out with Frodo. They set out to cross the Misty Mountains, but defeated by snow and weather, decide to turn back and enter the Mountain. The Mountain used to be a grand palace of Dwarves and is sung of in their songs.I can only encourage you to read this book before the movie comes out. While the movie does look quite good, novel-film conversion is never perfect and the book is better than the film nearly every time, so read the book first. I set a goal to re-read the entire epic before the films arrive."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I agree that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so I will not say that I disagree with so-and-so's review on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it, it is very endearing. And I am looking forward to the movie, it really does look amazing!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's novel titled, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; is the first book of the, &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; trilogy. The trilogy picks up where Tolkien's novel, &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; left off. Tolkein has a great imagination that is evident in his writing. He creates the fictional land called Middle Earth. The land is filled with dwarves, elves, humans, and hobbits. Hobbits are hairy creatures about half the size of humans. Hobbits enjoy simple lives but are capable of great feats and courage if they are pushed to it. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; tells the story of some extraordinary hobbits.Frodo is hobbit that lives in Hobbiton. Gandalf, an important and powerful wizard, gives Frodo the responsibility of caring for a special ring. The ring makes the wearer invisible, but it seems to have an evil affect on people. After many years, Gandalf discovers the true power of the ring. Gandalf tells Frodo that the ring is called the, &quot;One Ring.&quot; The ring was created long ago and holds much power. Gandalf has also learned of an evil force trying to retrieve the ring. Sauron, the Dark Lord, is searching for the ring. If Sauron reaches the ring, he will control the Middle Earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that the the ring must be destroyed, and it can only be destroyed at the Mountain of Fire. Frodo decides to make the lengthy journey along with three other hobbit friends to destroy the ring.Along the journey, the hobbits come across many different people and dangers. Middle Earth is filled with many different types of creatures. Some are good, and some are evil. It is clear that Tolkien spent much time thinking about the land called Middle Earth. The characters are well developed and are easy to relate with. It is interesting to read about all the cities, creatures, and people in Middle Land. I am a slow reader, and I usually get aggrivated with books over 400 pages. However, I really enjoyed this book, and I plan to finish the trilogy when I get the time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Hobbits are funny little fat people with hair on their feet. They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves. They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance. These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo. Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.Frodo exits his homeland pursued by Furies: Nine undead kings mounted upon great black stallions. These Dark Riders have supernatural power and homicidal intent: they will find and destroy Frodo and restore the ring to its &quot;rightful&quot; owner, Sauron the Dark Lord.Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers: Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.The company meets exotic friends, confronts implacable foes, and surmounts daunting obstacles to move Frodo closer to accomplishing his important mission. This first volume of the trilogy ends with the quest seemingly in shambles, but remember there are two more volumes to come.Many have imitated, but none have equaled Tolkien's fairy tale for adults. I wish, however, that he'd left out most of those songs and poems. The best poems were merely mediocre, while the worst were awful. Early on I started skipping the poetry whenever I came to it. It didn't detract at all from my ability to follow the story."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I first read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Science class when I was twelve years old. Perhaps this explains why I do not like science (or its evil twin sister...math) and why I have never stopped reading. Recently, I have started rereading the trilogy. It is amazing how much seems new to me after all these years.The beginning of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings,&quot; is an enticing feast to begin with. It picks up years after the ending of Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; The story begins with the coming again of Gandalf to, and the departure of Bilbo from the Shire. It then moves forward into telling about Bilbo's nephew Frodo and the magic ring Bilbo leaves him.As events are set in motion, Frodo flees his peaceful home in the Shire. He and a fellowship of others are commissioned with destroying the magical ring...which they are informed is the most powerful tool of evil ever created...the One Ring. The great problem they face is trying to figure out how they will march straight into the heart of the enemy's power to the only place it can be destroyed.I am amazed at the eloquent power of Tolkien's writing. As a child, I was only concerned by the action of the plot (and there is plenty of action and suspense here). Now that I am a little bit older, I am blown away by the depth of these books. Tolkien's creation--the world of Middle Earth is a masterpiece. These stories are filled with poetry and legends from the past ages of middle earth. This depth makes the tale of the Ring breathe with life and wonder.The characters are even more fascinating than the journeys they go on. Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn are my favorites so far; although I really like the developing friendship between Gimli and Legolas.I can't wait to read the rest of the stories. I highly recommend &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'll be the first to admit that the pace of the novel meanders a bit, and the action is spread far between the chapters, but regardless I found myself completely at the mercy of Tolkien's magic.

There you'll be introduced to Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who finds the ring that is the catalyst for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also the great wizard Gandalf who figures prominently in &quot;...Fellowship.&quot; It's seems so obvious now that modern masters of the fantasy genre such as Robert Jordan got so much of their inspiration from Tolkein. The edition I read also included a map so it was easy to chart the journey of Frodo Baggins, nephew of Bilbo as he headed towards his dark destination. The story is simple, at the heart being the struggle to destroy a ring forged by a powerful evil that in the hands of it's maker would spell doom for everyone.I know some people felt it slow moving, and I don't totally disagree, but I loved it all the same. Can't wait to read the next two, and see the movie this December."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"If you like adventure and excitment then you will love The Fellowship of The Ring.

Frodo is going to Mt.Doom,the center of Sauron's dark castle, to destroy the ring. Sauron is an evil wizard who wants the ring for himself.

He learns soon after that Sauron, the Dark Lord, is in pursuit of the One Ring and thus Frodo must destroy it to save Middle Earth. The story itself is written well with intense diction and imagery that creates a living-breathing world. Each chapter is jammed with interesting information and action that keeps you turning page after page. This is an extremely brief overview of the book and if you have seen the movie and even remotely enjoyed the viewing I highly recommend this book because it is even more massive in scope."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Out of all the books I have read, The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien, the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, would have to be my favorite book in three ways. To begin with, there is a tremendous amount of action in this book. For example, Frodo, the main character, and all of his companions set out to destroy an evil ring so the evil Sauron won't get his nasty hands on it. If they don't destroy the ring, all of Middle Earth would be doomed. They must battle their way to Mount Doom to cast the ring into its flames. But, there are many enemies on their way like, Sauroman, orcs, and Ring Wraiths. Secondly, I like how Tolkien brings Middle Earth to life by describing it so deeply. For example, I like how he describes The Mines of Moria so well. Last but not least, I love the fantasy and magic in this book. For instance, Gandalf, a great wizard, has many spells and magical powers. If you do not like fantasy, you shouldn't read this book; but if you do this book is spectacular! In conclusion, if you are looking for a great book, get The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I really wanted to give this book 5 stars but after I thought about it I realized that it wouldn't be right. This book is inspirational and it's beautifully dramatic. However, there are some things wrong with it. For instance, I think it had way too much unneccesary descriptions that made it hard to follow the actual story. Whenever I got to a long and boring description, I put the book down for a week and then made myself struggle through it. Maybe if I were a little older it would've been easier to read. Also, I think the characters were quite unrealistic and unlikable. And there were no important female chatacters either. The action is good though, and I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I think that The Fellowship of the Ring is an exciting book about a hobbit called Frodo Baggins who inherits a ring with power off his uncle Bilbo Baggins.

Neil Gaiman rocks my world... so i tried to read Fellowship of the Rings. Whereas, i will say that the language is beautiful, and the characters are charming, and the plot interesting... it can be considered long-winded. This book is fun, but don't expect it to be light reading to whiz through. They spend 80 pages walking down the same road - it's almost as though the book is written in real time. I wanted to say, &quot;Frodo... Are we there yet?&quot;I do recommend this book... it is wonderful... but only if you have the time and patience to get through it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This review is more about the CD than the contents of the book. To learn about what the Lord of the Rings is about, please look elsewhere.I have owned the books for many years, I own a dramatization of the books on CD called &quot;The Lord of the Rings (Mind's Eye Version)&quot; and now I bought this version. I was doubtful at first if I should spend the money to basically buy something I already owned twice - I didn't regret it for one second.Rob Inglis (the narrator), a recognized Shakespeare actor, is doing an outstanding job on these 16 CDs (and there are 30 more for the next two books), each with more than 1 hour of playtime and divided into tracks of approx. 3 minutes each. His reading style, using distinctly different voices for each character without any additional sound effects or music, draws you very deeply into Tolkiens world. I enjoy listening to this undramatized version a lot more than the dramatized version I own. If you liked the book, you will love this version on CD."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I just read The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring in preparation for seeing the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing style was good, believable and yet easy to read. I would highly recommend reading The Hobbit first because there are too many references in Fellowship that won't make sense unless you do.For those considering reading the book before seeing the movie - I would recommend this. The movie was great and fairly accurate but left out many interesting details. Also, in rare form, the movie does add some to the book as it is more dramatic and slightly embellished in some places.For those who have read the book but not seen the movie - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There's irony in the aspersions cast against The Fellowship of the Ring. The criticisms most often raised- that its pace founders, that its heroes and villains are vapid, that its prose is effete- simply take a fractured view on the book's greatest merits.Such criticism is symptomatic of our age: Tolkien's pacing incenses readers reared on cartoon adventures, on entertainment calculated to induce adrenaline rushes each instant; Tolkien dares to paint characters unequivocally good or evil, anathema to a society that wonders whether the World Trade Center should still stand; nor does Tolkien condescend to the reader- he renders his epic through epic language. To a culture whose conception of male relationships is a duo of sitcom characters slinging insults and competing for females, the Fellowship's comradeship and nobility, even the genuine love among its members, is a jarring anachronism, but a welcome one.If this review smacks of falsehood, I'll concede that logical gaps should be expected in an argument for a book that I decided was the best ever written while in the first grade. I read Lord of the Rings again recently, though, and my admiration for the book soared. Its author insists that he meant for the tale to stand on its own merits, that it offered no commentary on World War II or on religion, and it does so commendably. It does more, however- it suggests on every page the transience of existence, that all things, beautiful and plain, strong and feeble, must give way to the new.Tolkien's Middle Earth, styled with abundant implications for our own world, nonetheless exists self-sufficiently. No book can boast of a factitious reality so unflinchingly realized. Every song, every sunset, every smoke-ring completes Tolkien's envisaged world, and brilliantly intensifies the conflict. Through profuse detail, we learn exactly what odds face the Fellowship, and what lies at stake. Each step on the journey, then, and each battle acquires gravity unattainable to a tale less completely realized. The opening chapters and subsequent exposition are not impediments to the conflict ahead- they, rather, are integral to it.The Fellowship of the Ring and its companion volumes could imbue all humanity with pride in their nobility. We instead seethe against its idealism. Lord of the Rings becomes, curiously, an exclusionary book. It has nothing to say to post-modernists who find perverse vindication in depictions of people as frail as they. It offers nothing to self-hating intellects who equate &quot;human&quot; with &quot;impotent,&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot; with &quot;delusion.&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings expertly lends us a view of life as one ought to live it."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"As LOTR regularly wins polls as the twentieth century's favorite work of fiction, it is now rather difficult to say anything new about it, except that professors of English who appear on highbrow chat shows to review literature rather reprehensibly still prefer 'realists' of the Thomas Hardy and George Eliot ilk. Chronologically (in Middlearth time and in order of publishing), 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the first book of the great Lord of the Rings trilogy and follows 'The Hobbit'. Of course The Hobbit itself is largely aimed at children, although the themes mature as the story matures, whereas LOTR is four-squarely adult. However, it should be realised that Hobbit is essentially, as Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis put it, 'merely a fragment torn from the author's huge myth'. The inchoate romance of the whole of Middlearth and its inhabitants came into being over a very long period, and formed a superlatively coherent whole well before he thought of publishing.As an heroic romance, the book was launched into a post-war Britain that largely expected fiction to be a 'slice of reality', as in the Hardy/Eliot tradition. We had turned our back on books of this type. So far as romances of imagined worlds, real heroes, real villains, and epic themes went the science fiction sub-culture of dime novels and cheap comics was the brightest spot on the literary horizon! All the greater the shock then, when this luxuriously and profligately original masterwork, a veritable new Odyssey, re-established the genre at a stroke.The story starts quietly, and even a little childishly, in the Shire of the hobbits, who are quite English and very much the sort of creation that an Englishman of the Midlands would create, although they are not an allegory of the English (I speak as a Midlander). Events rapidly gather pace and the serious and high nature of the quest becomes apparent, the great master-ring created by Sauron being in the seemingly accidental possession of one Frodo Baggins, hobbit-at-large. The Ring is too terrible a weapon to be mastered for good and used against Sauron, yet the Lord of the Rings is utterly set on claiming it back. Therefore, hard though the thought is, the weapon that is the Ring must be destroyed. A trusty band, a fellowship, of adventurers must be assembled to carry out the quest. There are many subtleties in this book, and the characters are not all they seem. The heroes of the fellowship have mixed motives, Boromir especially. The climax of the Fellowship of the Ring largely revolves around the chaos caused by the Boromir's inner dilemma and his unwise actions. Even Gollum the sneak is not yet entirely bad and has the occasional good impulse. As if the Black Riders and hordes of orcs were not bad enough the story breaks off with a classical cliff-hanger, as the quest must go on even though the fellowship be riven by argument and conflict. As the plots and sub-plots multiply so does the tension. A must read?, to be sure. More than once, certainly. But not before the next two installments..."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In this sequel to The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins's favorite nephew Frodo inherits his uncle's magic ring when Bilbo leaves to go off on his last adventure. Years later, Bilbo and Frodo's friend Gandalf, a powerful and wise wizard, comes along to tell him the tragic, horrifying story of the ring. He tells Frodo that many ages ago, the Dark Lord Sauron forged the One Ringto rule over 19 other magic rings used for good that were still in existence. The ring has slipped from hand to hand throughout the years before it came to Gollum, who Bilbo took it from. Sauron had recently started madly searching for his ring so that he could use it to rule all of Middle-Earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that he and his friends must set out and take the ring to Mount Doom, the volcano in which it was created, and throw it in to unmake it for good. I would strongly recommend The Fellowship of the Ring to anyone willing to take the time to read it and has previously read The Hobbit. It does get dull in some places, but soon speeds up. The story is enthralling and thouroughly enjoyable. Tolkien has a wonderful way of using the English language to pull the reader in. You should definately at least give this book a try."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Fellowship of the Ring, always possessed an interest in the English language and began writing The Lord of the Rings trilogy in 1939. The story falls under the fantasy and adventure genre. The epic is set in the land of Middle Earth where Men, Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits dwell. The once weakened Dark Lord Sauron has regained much of his power and is searching for his Ring, which is the focal point of his power. Now, Frodo Baggins, a cousin of the renowned Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, has acquired the Ring of power. The first half of The Fellowship of the Ring details Frodo's flight to the Elven City of Rivendell, where the fate of the Ring will be decided. Tolkien uses an intricate setting, a unique style and strong characterization to bring this adventure to life.Perhaps the most important device Tolkien uses in his writing is setting. The first half of The Fellowship of the Ring is set in the imaginary country of Middle Earth and focuses on the Ring's journey to Rivendell. The environment plays an important role in The Fellowship of the Ring, and Tolkien spared no expense in creating a setting that could be clearly understood and visualized. To do this, Tolkien employed the use of personification. Frodo's travels through the Old Forest are a fine example of Tolkien's personification. \\"But after a while the air became hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them.\\" (123). Tolkien uses personification of the environment so well that the environment almost becomes a character in the story. The lifelike descriptions aid in making this story so real. Tolkien's style in this novel is noticeably different from other novels.One characteristic of his style is Tolkien's use of songs that are found throughout, and play an important role in his writing. Using songs, Tolkien is able to express feelings and relieve tension in suspenseful situations. The songs are also used to give the reader glimpses of the history of Middle Earth. For example, Strider sings a song of the old days to the Hobbits on their journey to Rivendell. \\"\`I will tell you the tale of Tinuviel,' said Strider, \`in brief-for it is a long tale of which the end is not known and there are none now, except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old.'\\"(203). This allows Tolkien to depict his imagined world without slowing the pace of the book. The reader gains knowledge of the world of Middle Earth that gives them a stronger connection with the story. Songs also server the purpose of giving readers insight into the characters of The Fellowship of the Ring.Tolkien develops Frodo from a young carefree hobbit to a hobbit encumbered with the burden of bearing the Ring of Power. As Frodo journeys towards Rivendell, he encounters challenges with other characters. These conflicts make the story suspenseful and create stronger bonds with his companions.Once Frodo reaches Rivendell, he will go towards Mordor on a quest to destroy the Ring. Tolkien's adventure does not bore and it only gets more exciting. The end is a cliffhanger and urges one to jump immediately to the next installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I am tingling in anticipation to read what happens in The Two Towers (the second volume). I recommend this novel to any that seek a change in their life and want to escape to a wonderful world of mystery, honor, and adventure."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"\\"Three Rings for the Elven-Kings under the SkySeven for the Dwarf-Lord in their halls of stone,Nine for the Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord, upon his dark throne,in the land of Mordor where shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themin the land of Mordor where shadows lie.\\"And that is the summary of the tale of Sauron, Lord of the Rings, who sought to rule the Land of Middle Earth until his defeat.

Tolkein, the task of taking the Ruling Ring to the pits of Mount Doom in the treacherous lands of Mordor and the fate of Middle Earth is placed in the hands of the brave hobbit, Frodo. This burden is also held by the Fellowship of the Ring. The Fellowship consists of the cunning and fearless ranger, Aragon, the skilled elven marksman, Legolas, the stout dwarf, Gimli, the wise wizard, Gandalf, the headstrong heir of Gondor, Boromir, and the three friends Pippin, Merry, and Samwise. All of them agree to helping the young hobbit accomplish the task. They are beset by many setbacks. They find that Gandalf&#65533;s friend, Saruman, is now in alliance with the forces of Sauron. After fleeing from Saruman&#65533;s forces in their encounter in the Mines of Moria,Gandalf sacrifices himself to the demon, the Balrog. They continue their journey disheartened by the loss of their dear friend. The Fellowship is attacked by an army of orcs, the twisted servants of Saruman. Boromir, like his human ancestors before him, is seduced by the power of the ring and tries to seize the ring from Frodo. Realizing his faults he decides to face the Orcs in a last act of redemption. He tries to allow the others to get away. By blowing the Horn of Gondor he gets the attention of all the orcs in the area. He dies a heroic death fighting the Orcs. Still, his efforts fail and the hobbits Merry and Pippin are taken captive by the Orcs. Legolas, Aragon, and Gimli head for Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, in hopes of overtaking the Orcs. Frodo and Samwise head for Mordor to continue their quest.I think that the Fellowship of the Rings is a well written novel and I think that it is a must read. In this novel, Tolkein illustrates an adventure of magic and thrills enough to keep you satisfied till the end. The way that he describes the world of Middle Earth and its inhabitants is truly amazing. It gives you a visual of what is happening in that specific part of the story.

So, confession number one out of the way, I saw the movie before reading the book. Confession number two. I read \\"The Hobbit\\" by Tolkien earlier in the year, but I never finished it. Somehow, the book and writer failed to maintain my interest, but I am sure I will return shortly and complete that journey. There are so many different takes and perspectives on this book I thought it beneficial to this review to convey my background to reading this novel. Okay, onto the book itself. One of the traits of Tolkien I have had to battle with, is his flowery writing, in particular his tendency to burst into song (or at least his characters do) on a very regular basis. While obviously somewhat relevant to the development of the story and a key part of Hobbit culture, I found the plethora of poetic singing rather tedious at times. Nonetheless, I have read through most verse, except maybe the longest pieces at 2am in the morning. Certainly this style of writing will appeal to some and not others, but be forewarned. It is the mythical worlds that Tolkien has created that really elevate this book to lofty heights, and overshadows any (flowery) flaws the book MAY have in some reader's eyes. What Tolkien has brought to life is a sumptuous and complex mythical world that really has no comparison. The depth and detail to which he has gone into, begs the question, 'had Tolkien an all seeing private window into another dimension?' The many lands, races, languages and creatures are just glorious in all their pageantry and it is all laid out for us in a way which makes us feel that it was always so, and will always be. The unique storyline is complimented by Tolkien's ability to bring to life emotions such as fear, sadness, terror, and joy along with qualities such as loyalty, bravery, perseverance, doggedness and humility. The book is literally dripping with all these ingredients. I personally did not find this book an easy read, it demands attention and a degree of concentration, but the rewards are great. A masterpiece, truly deserving of classic status."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"\\"Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is a great book.

This ring was forged long ago by a very dark and powerful lord, who lost the ring and will stop at nothing to once again claim its great power and rule all of Middle Earth.I really enjoyed this book partly because Tolkien uses such vivid and lifelike detail to describe the settings and the characters. It was hard to get used to the strange names and the places, but after the first couple chapters you knew exactly what he was referring too. Then it was so easy to put yourself in the same places and feel as though you were part of the story. I especially liked the way he describes the elves and Rivendale. When he describes the Dark Riders, you can almost smell the cold, stale air coming from the nostrils of the evil horses.Also his characters were very interesting and intriguing especially Frodo because everything revolves around him and the decisions he must make. I feel as though he could have focused some more on Gandalf because he is the one who convinced Frodo to take on this task.Overall, this is one of the greatest books I have ever read, I could not put it down.

I'm glad I didn't wait another second. Tolkien's first brainchild is timeless, a flawless blend of rousing adventure, memorable (and often quirky) characters, hypnotic fantasy, good vs. evil, and social commentary. If you are willing enough to read the lenghtly introduction, don't be fooled by Tolkien's explanation that this is just a book for your basic reading pleasure. It can be read on so many thematic levels it's unbelievable. There is a chapter in the book that was cut from the movie. The chapter &quot;In The House of Tom Bombadil&quot; provides a pause in the increasing tension of the novel (the hobbits have had a close encounter with death from a terrible enemy) and introduces us to Tom Bombadil and his lovely wife. In the book, the pause works, but it was best left out of the movie, where the pace was much quicker. That brings me to another point of the book: the pace. Tolkien did not write this to satisfy children. This is fantasy for those with very long attention spans. He goes into long, at times tedious, detail of what the Fellowship had for breakfast, if one of them ate more than the other, etc. And the romance between Aragorn and Arwen is not present in the book as it is in the movie.

In J.R.R Tolkien's epic novel The Fellowship of the Ring, readers are propelled into the breathtaking fantasy world of Middle Earth and introduced to young Frodo Baggins of The Shire. Throughout this spellbinding epic, readers accompany Frodo on his rugged road of hardships and dilemmas leading up to the destruction of the ring of power and the liberation of Middle Earth.Frodo Baggins was just a typical Hobbit who coexisted peacefully and quietly in his secluded environment in the Shire. He was a normal citizen who was very naive with regard to the many happenings of Middle Earth. However, Frodo's serene life was short-lived, for he soon discovered that the all mighty ring of power was in his household. This book is about how Frodo most leave behind his beloved home and set out to destroy the ring of power once and for all. Along his quest, he faces many arduous circumstances and he sometimes longs for his familiar home. Often, IR.R Tolkien makes the readers really ponder whether Frodo has enough willpower to continue his quest and if he will ever truly overcome affliction. The author does an outstanding job creating this believable yet surreal world and making you really get interested in the characters and events. In my opinion, he is one of the most innovative authors of all time.Perhaps even more alluring than the predominant storyline are the strong underling themes and messages that permeate the book. Even though this book is a fantasy, it has some extremely important messages that are universally significant. For instance, one of the most dominant themes of this book (and the whole trilogy) is the concept of small people being strong enough to overcome great adversity. At some instances, you can really see that Frodo is a brave person and that he has enough determination to overcome the malice and hatred of the enemy. Another central theme is the notion that fate intervenes with an individual's life. For instance, when the ring of power fell into the hands of Frodo, was it really misfortune or was he meant to be the destroyer of the ring and savior of Middle Earth? I found myself pondering such questions over and over again in my mind and definitely think that this added great intrigue to an already outstanding book.All in all, you can see that I enjoyed exploring Middle Earth and experiencing the many thrilling events described in this amazing piece of literature. I think that this is an essential read for anybody who is interested in fantasy stories and I strongly recommend it to everyone who has the stamina to persevere through some of the more complicated and confusing parts. This is my favorite book that I have read thus far and I believe that J.R.R Tolkien is one of the most creative and gifted authors of American literature."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This book,in my opinion, is the very definition of a great fantasy novel. This book is so masterfully written. The story was original and had the feeling of a true epic adventure. J.R.R. Tolkien writes in a way that makes u love the charectors and the surroundings in this book. I have read this book numerous times and have recomended it to many people. The only problem I found with this book was that it ended to quickly. Overall I dont think I will ever find a series of books as good as The Lord Of The Rings. This book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them...I know a lot of people that think kids today are hopeless. Sometimes I agree with them. I am 12 years old, and I am currently reading The Two Towers. I have the whole set, starting from The Hobbit, all the way through Return of the King. I think all the books (so far) are awesome. I've always hoped to find something like Lord of the Rings. When I read it, I get totally absorbed into the world of Middle-Earth. Sometimes people will be screaming my name into my ear and I won't hear them. I've been introducing it to my friends (most of whom have read The Hobbit already). Some of my friends on the internet, all either 11, 12, or 13, introduced it to me. I think it's great when you can relate to someone years older than you who has read the same books. For anyone who has ever wanted an escape from the real world into someplace totally new, young or old, I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What a masterpiece of thought!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have read the Trilogy about 35 times and every time it is just as good and meaningful. Nothing else has touched my life like the writings of Tolkien. I hope when I pass on someday, my heaven shall be Middle Earth. Thank you Johnathan Ronald Reule Tolkien!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I have to say that I believed Robert Jordan to be the lord of Fantasy. Well I repent for I have seen the light. Tolkien is not only the lord of Fantasy but he is a GOD! I have to say that I have never had this much fun and joy reading a book in all my life. This book is also deep and very rich. The world Tolkien creates is so real and his characters are so intricate that I have to slap myself for ever thinking of Robert Jordan as the King. In Jordan's books you get the same richness of his world but not like Tolkiens. It's weird. It's like Tolkien has some special skill that becomes apart of his words. Oh yeah, and Jordan waits up to 4 years to bring out his next book. While this is insulting to the fans and shows how smug Jordan can be I can't help but appreciate the sincerity of Tolkien. This books is pure Magic!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"With very vivd characters, each with their own distint personality and drive, this is an excellent tale. A tale of fantasy that makes the reader completely absorbed, with its effective scene and setting. All in all, definitely a worthy tale."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the first volume of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; which is followed by The Two Towers and The Return of the King (its mighty climax). This distinguished piece of art is filled will marvels and strange terrors. It is brilliant in telling as it is broad in its scope. It is far more than fantasy to us who have come into possession of the Great Ring of Power and have turned back one assault of the Shadow only to see it as Gandalf warned, &quot;take another shape and grow again.&quot; I have not read any fiction that has pleased me as much as this book during my lifetime."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I had just finished this book 2 months ago, and I must say this is the only book which has even come close to touching my heart. The Middle-Earth setting is truly remarkable, and believable. It also has enough detail to fill your mind to the point when you something have to stop and think about the surroundings. This is a great book, from a great author and should not be passed up."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"There is not much to say about it because it speaks for itself. The great fantasy everyone dreams of. The characters were absolutly wonderful. The whole book was just great!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Well, I saw all the reader reviews, all the 10 grades, but I still couldn't resist giving my own special 10. As you can see by all the reviews this is a marking book that everyone should read at least once. It's the basis for almost all fantasy books, games, storys,. It's a fantastic world that was created by Tolkien from virtually nothing to forming entirely new languages ... This doesn't mean you need to be a Dungeon and Dragon freak to love this book. This is the kind of book that I recomend to anyone without any fear of receiving any kind of negative feedback. You absolutely MUST read this book. You won't regret it, believe me or anyone else who's read it!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"When I read this book I felt unbearable anxiety. I want to escape from this world to the Middle Earth. This feelin is tearing my heart in pieces. I have read &quot;The Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; for many times and every time when I finished reading I had such a feeling that I suddenly find myself in the common world and I will never get back to the Middle Earth. The Middle Earth is my motherland. I go crazy when I think that I have to spent all my life here. P.S. Excuse me for faults. I know that my english is not very good."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. it has a real history behind it and gives the reader a sense of fear, happiness, or intimidation throughout. Tolkien has achieved a masterpeice. By really creating a history to the book it is a satisfying,exciting,deep read"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I am not one who usually buys books-on-tape (or CD as in this case) but I have long wanted to obtain the Lord of the Rings so as to hear this incredible story over and over. After having read it several times, my book is in tatters and so I searched for an unabridged audio recording. Many of those that I have seen claim to be &quot;unabridged&quot; but the fact is that they are not complete! They give parts of the books in full but leave out many sections or chapters. This set by Rob Inglis is COMPLETE!!! It is very well read with no drastic voicing of characters. Characters are easily distinguished and thoroughly enjoyable. This set is not full of sound effects and music, so if you are looking for that this is not for you. However, I personally prefer the fact that this is not an over-production and is rather quite focussed on what I wanted in the first place, the characters and the story. Inglis does a marvelous job and I am very happy with this set. Again, not to harp on it but, this is a &quot;complete&quot; package well worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is truly a wonderful story , But I was unsure of getting the cd over the audio tapes. I noticed that the tapes had the Unabridged version and the Cd version did not say if it was or not on all parts, so i took a chance and got the Cd version of each book. Thankfully the Cd version Is also Unabridged. So for those of you out there like me who might have been confused between the tapes and the Cd now you know they are the same."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"In my review of Rob Inglis' reading of The Hobbit, I said it seemed to take me a little while to get into his vocalizations, even though I'm a big fan of audio books (especially those read by a British voice).The Fellowship of the Ring, however, I fell in love with immediately. Rob Inglis' style is perfect for this book. He does the voices well and the story is far richer and more engrossing than that of The Hobbit. (Even though The Hobbit is delightful and unique in its own right.)There really isn't much I can say about these Lord of the Rings audio books that hasn't already been said. This CD edition of The Fellowship of the Ring read by Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis is perfect for you if:1. You love The Lord of the Rings2. You're intrigued by all the pre-movie hype and you'd like to discover what Tolkien's book is really all about3. You have a lot of drive time on your hands and you'd like to fill it with something entertaining and intelligent4. You can't stand listening to insipid Top 40 or Talk Radio programs5. You love listening to the British dialect6. You just want to have a good time hearing one of the greatest novels ever written read to you by a professionally trained actor who makes each character come to life.The sound quality on these CDs is, as it was on The Hobbit, superb. The recording level is perfect. The pace of the reading is just right. I'm about halfway through right now and I'm looking forward to every minute of it.This edition is a very good value for the price."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Now, this is probably going to be an unpopular review because people will see the three stars and think, &quot;What, is he out of his mind? The Lord of the Rings is one of the best books ever written&quot;. And it is. But this is not a review of the book, it is a review of Rob Inglis' READING of the book. And the editorial raves not withstanding, I am sorry to say that this is not a reader that EVERYONE will like. Before I get lynched, here's why I think so.I have listened to HUNDREDS of audio books. All unabridged. Inglis falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. He has a deep voice -- this would not normally be an issue were he reading a historical work. But Inglis is one of those readers who does &quot;voices&quot;. NOw some people are genius at this. For example, the incomparable Frederick Davidson. But for Inglis, the deep voice is a liability when he tries to pitch it high to do an elf voice or, good heavens, a woman's voice. The result is very annoying.Also, fans of the Trilogy will know that it is filled with song. Inglis' rendering of the songs was grating (at times almost embarassing) -- and got my fast forward finger working over-time. He is over-matched by this, particularly when it comes to Galadriel or Legolas.Next there is the manner, or tone, in which Inglis has chosen to pitch his reading. He has adopted a wistful, elegiac, far away manner -- it is almost pretentious, I have to say. And it becomes tedious because he almost never varies it. He is, as the saying goes, &quot;a bit one paced&quot;. Now, some people will like his voice and manner, I do not deny this -- because it does, as one of the editorial reviews says, emphasize the fairy tale aspect of the Trilogy.But to me is drains some of the manliness and power from some of the dialogue. Aragorn, to me the quintessential man of action and mystery, a true hero, comes across as a man obessesed with what has been lost; a man trapped in the past. Which he clearly isn't.Some examples. Aragorn and Boromir are virtually indistinguishable. The Hobbits (apart from Frodo), Sam in particular, are rendered in a country bumpkin voice that is out of all keeping with what I see as the inherent dignity of the Hobbits. It also serves to underscore Sam as the servant of Frodo, rather than his friend. Legolas ends up with a reedy, strained voice, because Inglis can not get into the higher register. I was left thinking, &quot;who ever made the rule that Elves had little high voices?&quot;HAVING SAID ALL THAT, this is the ONLY unabridged version. And as such, falls into the &quot;must have&quot; category. For all of the foregoing quibbles, Inglis' reading is serviceable and entertaining. Buy it -- you will enjoy it -- but do not expect the definitive reading -- that awaits us! Which is an ocassion for celebration I suppose. Because surely it will come."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"Writing yet another review of &quot;The Fellowship&quot; is a bit like adding icing to a thousand layer cake. No matter how well written, it is highly unlikely that I could add anything new to the richly deserved kudos that Tolkien's efforts have received in the decades since they first appeared. I have read and re-read these works countless times since I first encountered them when I was in high school, which was back sometime around the invention of fire.I'm not going to even attempt to describe the contents of the volumes other than to state that it is the tale of a great journey and an even greater quest to free the world of a great horror. It shows how there is no such thing as the least or the greatest, and that all have terribly important tasks to do. Tolkien's tale combines fantasy within an ethical and moral framework to create a story that has value for every age group.Over the years, my perception of the books has changed considerably. MY first few readings where in childlike (or hippy-like) wonder, and then, over the years, I have become more conscious of the works as literary efforts and some of the wonder has worn off. But even so one cannot but be amazed by the amount of scholarship and effort that went into making &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; an epic which deeply touches almost everyone who comes into contact with it. On the negative side, though, I found in my latest re-reading that the language seemed a bit more overblown and stilted than I remembered. Unfortunately, that one piece of the gloss had worn off a bit.Recently, looking for some tapes to listen to during a long trip, I came upon this set, narrated by Rob Inglis. It was very nicely priced and just the right length. I decided to discover what it felt like to hear &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; instead of read it. It turned out to be a felicitous decision. The occasional over-formality of the written text seems to vanish when it is read. The tale takes on an entirely different flow, and I found myself much amazed by all the adventures and trials that the four hobbits faced. In a way, the spoken Ring is a completely different work.Rob Inglis does a remarkable job of reading. He manages to produce enough different voices to keep the many speakers separate from each other. I think the reading would have benefited from having additional readers, but Inglis does a fine job nonetheless. Except, unfortunately, when he sings. As much as I enjoyed hearing the many songs of Tolkien for the first time, Rob Inglis is not a singer. He can carry a tune alright, but there is something just a bit unmusical about it. Not enough to detract from the total effect, but enough to cause a wince now and then. Even so, this was a surprisingly enjoyable experience. Recommended to all who seek a different experience of a wonderful old tale."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said in the many, many other reviews? This book is absolutely fabulous. It's full of all the stuff a terriffic novel needs. The characters are complex and intriguing, the plot is fascinating and draws you in so you can hardly put it down. The history given for the world in which the books take place is so extremely detailed and believable, you start to wonder if Middle Earth exsists. Which brings me to another point- the setting is absolutely wonderful, I'd give anything to go to Middle Earth and explore.Sure, it slows down in some spots (the infamous Council of Elrond chapter... ^_-), but for a story to work the plot must slow down in some parts for the author to explain things and put further events in the proper context. BTW, even if you haven't read The Hobbit, I think you'll follow this book along just fine. Bilbo's account (There and Back Again) is told in summary in the prologue.After you read this book, I think you'll want to get one of those &quot;Not all who wander are lost&quot; bumper stickers for your car, too! ^_^"},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"This is the way The Lord of the Rings was meant to be experienced. At it's heart the Rings Trilogy is Epic, and as such lends itself beautifuly to the spoken word. Inglis (the reader) is a master of all of the key aspects of this form. His voices of characters are fantastic and the music he composed for all of the songs presented are enchanting. I can't recomend these tapes enough. The experience is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I started reading Tolkien 7 years ago, and of course I didn't appreciate his works like I do now.Many seem to believe we should read the book because it was made as a movie, and publishers are milking this classic (LOTR stood the test of time, because it is an attractive story and it attacks social issues that can be identified by mankind for all time. I should add that it stereotypes, but only because of the time in which it was written.)for all it is worth and publishing a dozen different editions. Everyone has seem to forgotten that Tolkien never wanted 'The Lord Of The Rings' separated, not even as three novels. Now, it is being sold as a box set! In separate books! I don't think he would be pleased.Tolkien is a genius. His imagination gave us a separate universe, but not one beyond belief. Read the book because it is worth your time. But don't expect everything to go as you expect. The language is not complicated, save the prose. There are certain glitches - sometimes the people act out of character. You'll LOVE them, though. You will criticize this book, because you should with every work you read. But trust the legions of fans out there, and experience it. Don't shun it when you haven't read it, and by reading it I mean to the end. It's insulting to everyone when you give a comment on something you don't fully understand because you don't have the patience to. That's bias.And I would just like to add that Alan Lee is a wonderful illustrator, and made Tolkien's works that much more entertaining. I own the hard cover edition binding 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' in its entirety. I really recommend that edition to add to your library.As for the movie, Jackson held true to the story, his movie is one of the best I've seen. Great cast as well. I'm very happy that fans like me won't feel cheated and sorry to one of our favourite authors for having his mark in history smudged by Hollywood."},{"Title":"The Fellowship of the Rings","review":"I'm really tired of the Fellowship getting a bad rap, even by Tolkien enthusiasts. &quot;Too slow and not enough action&quot;, I've heard, &quot;the weakest book in the trilogy&quot;. Huh? What about the pursuit of the hobbits by the Nazgul, the Flight to the Ford, the tentacled monster at the gates to Moria and the battle at the bridge with an army of orcs and the Balrog? That's NOT action?!? And the so-called &quot;slow parts&quot; happen to be the most magical moments in the history of English literature. The pastoral beauty of Hobbiton, the House of Tom Bombadil, Lothlorien...people are actually COMPLAINING about these!?!?
