A fine effort."},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"For the most part, this book is split into 2 sections: actions that take place in 1985, and those in 1995. The first section is full of action and was fun to read, but the rest of the story did not compare. The plot and main character definitely had potential, but in all, this is not an impressive story. Another thing to take into consideration is the price of the book. True, Amazon does a great job of keeping prices low, but the margins are wide and there are line breaks on almost every page. If you must read this, try your local library"},{"Title":"DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","review":"Jack Higgins' alter ego Sean Dillon explodes into action!

He's had a glorious run as the master of the genre. I just read Drink With the Devil-liked it the way you like to visit with an old friend. But there was nothing really new or novel about it.

More surprisingly, they are good reading. De Gaulle writes in a formal, but clear and elegant style. The period covered is from the fall of France, through De Gaulle's flight to England and formation of the Free French, to the liberation and a bit of the postwar period. Obviously, this is not objective history. The chief interest of the book is that De Gaulle's personality and opinions colors every page. The reader may indeed be irritated, or he may be amused, by the author's undisguised self-regard, but in any case there are compensations. There is revealing detail on events such as the fall of France and the invasion of North Africa. With great candor and sharp perception De Gaulle assesses his own and others' strategies. There are good pen-portraits of Churchill and many other contemporaries. And there is the fascination of viewing great events through the prism of a commanding mind.."},{"Title":"The Complete War Memoirs of Charles de Gaulle","review":"This book is outstanding for its literary, even poetic, power. De Gaulle thinks of France as a person fated for tragedy and greatness. His biggest problem is achieving recognition as the political representative of France after France has signed an armistice with the Germans: Churchill tells him that although he claims to represent France, neither England or the US will recognize him as such; De Gaulle steadily replies that it is sufficient for him if the French people recognize him. This is the story of a man standing against the entire world for the sake of an ideal. Reminded me of Nelson Mandela!"},{"Title":"The Complete War Memoirs of Charles de Gaulle","review":"An essential book and one of the best autobiographies ever. Unlike Churchill and others, de Gaulle researched and wrote his momoirs all by himself, without any \\"contributors\\" and shadow writers. He writes clearly, the style is formal and elegant. A joy to read, which is wonderfully surprising and refreshing considering the stuffy nature of most such undertakings. To truly understand the man, one has to read this. His motives, his love for France, the belief in France's destiny. The world has still a lot to learn from him."},{"Title":"The Complete War Memoirs of Charles de Gaulle","review":"Charles de Gaulle is perphaps one of the most enigmatic figures of World War II. Misunderstood by both the British and Americans during post WWII period, he ended up greatly disliked in both countries. De Gaulle's memoirs, however, are an important source to more throughly understand the second world war. He tells the story of a France in a virtual state of civil war after the collaspe of France and the establishment of the Petain regime at Vichy. This civil war was fought in the outer reaches of the French Empire- Dakar, Lebanon, Syria, Chad, Indochina, etc. It tells a depressing story of how most of the French remained loyal to Vichy. De Gaulle recounts how in 1940 he made a speech before 2,000 French soliders stranded in England. H He pleaded with them to join his Free French army. He was only able to convince 200 to join. He recounts how the Vichy French army fought with greater vigor against fellow Frenchmen and the British then they did against the Nazis. He writes the history of how a people deeply depressed by war and defeatism slowly raises itself for the struggle against Germany. Without doubt, De Gaulle's perserverence provided France with some cover of honour to assuage its sense of national shame and guilt. De Gaulle takes us through the Empire, his challenges in remaining relevant to the British and the overt hostility of the Americans who remained loyal to Petain until 1943. The translation is good. The inclusion of maps of the Empire would have been useful. As with other memoirs, such as those of Mussolini, Admiral Horthy, Churchill, etc. this is a must read for the student of the 1940s. One note is that strategically, De Gaulle, like Churchill, was an imperial optimist. Both were convinced that once the war with Germany became a world war, time and the vast resources (both in men and material) available in their respective Empires would provide Great Britain and France with decided advantages against the Axis. As history was to demonstrate, both men's optimism were proven correct."},{"Title":"The Complete War Memoirs of Charles de Gaulle","review":"I purchased this complete version after having read more about de Gaulle in William Shirer's \\"The Collapse of the Third Republic\\" (Simon & Schuster 1969) and Milton Viorst's \\"Hostile Allies - FDR and De Gaulle\\" (McMillan & Company 1965) and also \\"Is Paris Burning?\\" by Collins/LaPierre, Simon & Schuster 1965.What an amazing life and effort! France's \\"Don Quixote\\". Never gave up in his \\"quest\\" of liberating France and restoring her grandeur. Literary quality everyone compares to Winston Churchill's memoirs. Sure, a little egotistical, but what honesty and no resulting dictatorship.It is a little confusing when he alternately refers to himself in the 1st person AND in the 3rd person throughout the book; I have never seen that style. Can anyone educate me?I wished the book had more than 3 little maps (easier to locate oneself) and more photos than the cover page (maybe the individual 3 book version has). Also I did not see any sources or acknowledgements (but maybe THAT is de Gaulle!)----- My Favorite Exchange -----Churchill (to de Gaulle): \\"You claim to be France! You are not France!

It certainly starts out that way. But the writing is intriguing and the characters begin to show a surprising depth. The emerging rights of women are delicately addressed together with the civil wrongs of the era. The characters surprise us from time to time, the goodness of Queenie, the shallowness of Edna and Bob, the gentleness and persistence of Josh. And Mama with her talking without moving her lips, is a high-spirited throw back to the prim and proper and occasionally clueless era. The reader is left hanging at the end, in particular the whereabouts of Jeremiah and Keats - we can only hope? In the meantime, I am headed for the library to find more by this author. This would make a wonderful audio book (with some of the music, too?)."},{"Title":"Place Called Sweet Shrub, A","review":"&quot;Sweet Shrub&quot; was such a surprise.

Taking over the family hardware store and caring for family has taken her mind off her sister's betrayal and the man she had planned to marry, perhaps too well. Lucy feels that she may be too comfortable, and that life in Bonham may not hold much for her. When Josh Arnold visits Lucy on his way to Sweet Shrub, Arkansas(where he is to read law) he makes it clear in no uncertain terms that he is still interested in Lucy, and that he won't take no for an answer. Lucy discovery that her heart is once again willing to trust combined with Josh's insistance and the impending visit of Lucy's sister and former fiancee, propells Lucy to accept his proposal. Together they move to Sweet Shrub. Just as she had faced change and adversity when she left home to teach, Lucy is faced with a whole new life to claim. She is faced by the prejudices and fears of the townfolk, and must turn to Josh and an inner strength she did not realize she had to survive. This is the second in three books, and is told in a very different way than the first. The author is very skillful in including the events of the early 1900's, impending world war, friction between races and small town dynamics to weave a wonderful story of life in Texas."},{"Title":"Place Called Sweet Shrub, A","review":"This is one of those not bad, but not really good books.After meeting that most horrible of fates for a woman, being jilted by her fiance, Lucy Richards ( whom I thought was supposed to be strong) abandons her teaching career in west Texas and flees back to her hometown of Bonham, where she hopes to scare up an alternate husband.Once back home, Lucy frets incessantly about being \\"an old maid\\" and contemplates marriage to any one of three admirers, none of whom she loves. But Prince Charming, in the form of Josh Arnold, a west Texas friend, rides to the rescue.Lucy agrees to marry Josh, seemingly more out of a desire to marry somebody, anybody, than from genuine affection for Josh.Oddly enough, the rather unlikely couple enjoys a blissful marriage with lots of sex ( described in more detail than some readers may want).The unrelenting bliss ( but not the sex) lets up a little when the couple relocates to Arkansas, where the whites are bigoted and the blacks \\"uppity\\".The fates of some of the characters is left dangling, to be sort of resolved in the final book of the trilogy.This book makes for light, pleasant summer reading, but don't expect much depth."},{"Title":"Place Called Sweet Shrub, A","review":"I read the first book in the trilogy and picked up A Place Called Sweet Shrub just because the author had killed off so many characters in the first and left much unanswered that I naively thought resolution would come in the sequel. I was wrong. Lucinda had so much going for her in the West Texas hardened by encounters with Christobel and Mrs. Sully that I thought her character would continue to grow. Instead, the book was a grandiose setup for the time displaced rehash of a race riot. The ribald humor was misplaced and characters are killed off haphazardly. I knew not to expect plot resolution, but some motivation would have been appreciated."},{"Title":"The Graves: Srebrenica And Vukovar","review":"Stover and Peress, through searing words and photographs, have created a record of the two greatest war crimes in the conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia. The sack of the eastern Croatian town of Vukovar in 1991 by Serb forces, and the subsequent mass murder of over 200 patients and staff from the local hospital is still a powerful and pivotal event, not only because of the sheer magnitude of the atrocity, but also because it was the first. Vukovar came before the siege of Sarajevo, the rape and torture camps in Prijedor and Foca and elsewhere, before the destruction of Mostar bridge, and the massacre at Srebrenica. Vukovar set the standard for the atrocities that were to come, and eight years after its destruction, the town is still a hollowed-out ruin with weeds poking through shattered buildings and one-fourth of its prewar population clinging precariously to subsistence in a destroyed economy. The siege and fall of Bosnia's Srebrenica in 1995, engineered by indicted war criminal Ratko Mladic has been amply documented elsewhere, but this book is not a military history or the reconstruction of the crime. Rather it is about the search for the missing and the identification of bodies pulled from mass graves. The authors follow the forensic specialists, the anthropologists and physicians who have created a sad but necessary specialty in this field. The exhumations are part of the search for the truth, not only for the half-grieving, half-hopeful survivors who cling to rumors about their loved ones, but for all people of compassion who hope that finding some finality, and perhaps some justice, at the bottom of these graves will serve both the living and the dead. The exhumations and identifications are carried out according to strict forensic standards so the results can be used as evidence at the Hague war crimes tribunal. If we are to forge any positive legacy from these atrocities, it may lie in allowing the children of both the victims and the executioners to lead normal lives, free from fear and revenge and poisonous hatred. Memories are long in this region, and vengeance can take decades. The woman who runs an orphanage for young Srebrenica survivors observes, \\"What is important now is the message the international community sends to these boys and what they then tell their own children. If you say to a child, \`Look, that man there killed your father, and now he lives in your house.' What kind of message is that going to send? But if you say, \`That man killed your father and that is why he is in prison.' The message is very different. So, for now, there might not be a lot of hatred or revenge, but if we don't find a way to punish those responsible for these crimes, it will surely be something we can count on in the future.\\" To date, neither Mladic nor the \\"Vukovar Three\\" are in the tribunal's custody. For the children's sake, we can do better."},{"Title":"The Graves: Srebrenica And Vukovar","review":"Having seen first hand the atrocities carried out in the former Yugoslavia, I was surprised by the stark reality of the superb photographs in this book. Black and white images always seem much more effective than colour. The text does not confuse the reader who knows little about the work of PHR but gives an idea of how immense the scale of the identification programme is. The book tells it like it was, and still is, for not only those people who lost friends and family, but for those people involved in the grave work. Forensic Archeologists, Anthropologists, Pathologists, Technicians and SOCOs' from all over the world give their time and energy to help identify bodies and bring the perpetrators to trial. This book puts across, in words and pictures, the real horrors of what happened in the former Yugoslavia. It is a most effective way of telling the world what did go on,and how it is still affecting, and will continue to affect peoples lives for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Graves: Srebrenica And Vukovar","review":"This is an amazing book, detailing evidence collection by the ICTY war crimes tribunal at two mass grave sites - Srebrenica, a predominantly Muslim town in eastern Bosnia; and Vukovar, a mixed Serb-Croat town in eastern Croatia (contrary to the view of the previous reviewer, Vukovar is neither Muslim nor Bosnian). The photos are phenomenal. After a wrenching reading, one comes away with a few scattered thoughts. Namely: 'never again, and 'thank god there is an international tribunal to carry out prosecutions for these events when domestic courts are unwilling to do so'.There have now been two ICTY indictees arrested for Srebrenica, the trial is ongoing as of this writing. None of the 'Vukovar Three', reportedly hiding out in Belgrade have been arrested yet.Justice is far too slow. But at least with the ICTY, there is some chance for a bit of justice after all."},{"Title":"The Graves: Srebrenica And Vukovar","review":"The war crimes comitted in Bosnia should be more at the forefront of today's headlines. The photographs by Gilles Peress are absolutely magnificent. They capture the love, life and death of a group of people as I haven't seen since photographs of the holocaust in Germany. Each picture tells a story, and though it could have said much as a pictorial the text only enhances the things we don't see. Eric Stover has brought to life the group of people working for Physicians for Human Rights and lets each reader know them and what the organization is about. This is not only a historical document, but a testament to the good and bad in humankind."},{"Title":"The Graves: Srebrenica And Vukovar","review":"I was involved in some of the forensic investigations which took place in the former Yugoslavia and are described in the book. If there is a way to bring this human misery, sadness and sorrow closer by reading a book, Eric Stover and Gilles Perez have managed to do it. I will be teaching a class at University. This book will be instrumental in explaining why it is so important that issues such as the genocides of our world have to be documented and investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice."},{"Title":"The Graves: Srebrenica And Vukovar","review":"This is a hard book to rate, for any number of reasons. For one thing, it's not nicely rounded; it doesn't tell a complete story, but provides a blistering snapshot of a small slice of history and an investigation still in process. For another, its photos and text don't work closely together, but provide approximately parallel looks into the same awful tale. Hardest of all is the stunning vividness of the photography by Gilles Peress, and the nagging suspicion that we share some small portion of blame for this.Simply put, _The Graves_ is a collection of photographs of dead bodies and skeletons, the anonymous mass graves from which they were exhumed, the remnants of their clothing and contents of their pockets, the relatives that survived them; and a text that describes the painstaking and horrifying process of trying to identify them and divine how they came to die.Srebenica and Vukovar are two towns in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, where in July of 1995, hundreds of Muslim men -- unarmed, defenseless, and bound -- were apparently shot by soldiers of the Serbian army under Ratko Mladic and then bulldozed under mounds of earth.Five years later, most of those responsible still roam freely in the former Yugoslavia, though the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague steadily sifts evidence and issues warrants for their arrest. This book depicts some of the effort to establish evidence of their guilt ... and is itself damning evidence.The photos by Peress, all black and white, are horridly beautiful in their mute, pinpoint clarity. They record a creepy new form of archaeology, where shiny white teeth peek out of the dirt, leg bones remain encased in socks and athletic shoes, entire bodies rise out of the near past, shorn of flesh but still comfortably clothed. They could be ancient remains, and one struggles to comprehend that they were alive, page after page of them, not very long ago.Stover's text gives some historical context for these graphic images, records the testimony of surviving witnesses, and offers brief portraits of the men and women -- forensic pathologists, archaeologists, x-ray technicians -- who sift through this grisly treasure. Peress also photographs them at work, relaxing with a guitar, and the waiting, anxious families with their charity canned goods and stuffed toys.This is a stark, stolid book, one that serves as a necessary reminder that what happens on the other side of the planet matters, and that no matter how much relative attention we give them, some things are worse than being sent back to Cuba to live with one's father. Much worse."},{"Title":"God Owns My Business","review":"Although it was written a couple of years ago, it is just as inspiring for current business owners as years ago.

Too often, as business and ministry leaders, we tend to focus on our own personal agendas. This book shares the heart of a man who sincerely desires to place God first in every arena of his life. Mr. Tam's life is not broken into such divisions as business, personal and religious. His life illustrates a true integration of every aspect of being coming together under the Lordship of Christ. This book should be read by anyone who desires to live out the will of God in their life."},{"Title":"God Owns My Business","review":"This book is an eye opener - not only for the self employed, but for all of us. Stanley Tam guides us through his process of Christian growth; in doing so he reveals God's own perspective on our stewardship-over material as well as spiritual things. After reading and contemplating it, I fear very few of us could claim to truly &quot;walk in Jesus steps&quot;!"},{"Title":"God Owns My Business","review":"I first became aware of Dr. Stanley Tam when we received one of the flyer from his (God's)company. On the front of the flyer was a testimony about an attorney who for some years had been searching for God. Dr. Tam was able to tell him how he could find God.I was so impressed that he would have a testimony on the front page of his advertisment that I sat down and wrote him a letter telling him how much I appreciated this. We live in a day and age when so many Christians are so afraid to let anyone know of their belief in God; so afraid they will offend someone; so afraid it will diversly affect their business. Here was a man who wanted everyone to know of his faith!! How refreshing.At the time I wrote him, I was also collecting stories for a book I was putting together. This book would have stories about what God is doing in peoples lives today. I asked his permission to use the story I had seen in my book.He was gracious enough to respond. He sent me a copy of his book and gave me permission to use any part of it that I chose to.Yes, he sent me an autographed book free of charge. I do not consider this being a lunatic. I consider this being a very generous man who as a part of his ministry gives away his books.The book has so many stories about how God hears and answers prayers. If anyone is dissatisfied with their life and is not sure what to do about it, I would strongly recommend they read Dr. Tam's book.And, yes, I follow in his footsteps, too. I, too, have given many of my books away and will continue to do so!Jeanetta Pollard author of \\"Mrs. Claus Shares Stories From the Heart.\\""},{"Title":"God Owns My Business","review":"I feel sorry for the first reviewer. I will admit that I have not read the book, (I had to give stars to write this) but I have met Mr. Tam and heard him speak. I was inspired by him and I wish I had his courage. He is not a lunatic. He has proven that a person can be a Christian and be successful in business. His speech was riveting and I would expect the same from the book."},{"Title":"God Owns My Business","review":"I would recommend this book highly to those who are business owners and Christians. Mr. Tam sets forth a good example of one called, and if one heeds that call, what they can do as a servant of Christ, and as a businessman or woman. He deals with those issues common to business owners, faith, inspiration from God, stewardship to name a few. I am finishing reading a book on Anthony Rossi, and to this point, I would recommend this book over Rossi's life. Both served God, but I believe this would be more of an inspiration, and you would gather more wisdom from it. Personal opinion...."},{"Title":"God Owns My Business","review":"Any Christian wanting to go into business for him/herself should read this book first.

It is a priceless treasure, and you don't need to be interested in starting your own business to love this book, either.Stanley Tam understands EXACTLY the relationship we are to have with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and his story is incredibly well told. This book is an enjoyable read, and is excellent for anyone, but it is especially wonderful for explaining what true Christianity to someone who has not experienced it or has been burned by a bad Church experience.

Smith's argument is that these new biological powers have implications that are far too important to be left to the scientists, the biotechnology companies, and the tame ethicists who work for them -- they pose dangers to our very idea of human equality and human rights. The book closes with sensible recommendations for things society should oppose, and things it should support, to advance medical progress without losing our sense of humanity. A very timely must-read."},{"Title":"Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World: Library Edition","review":"In 1932 Aldous Huxley wrote his prophetic and chilling novel, Brave New World. In it he mapped out a future in which science, instead of being a great help to mankind, becomes the undoing of human nature and personhood.Seventy years on one has to ask where we now stand. Smith thinks the picture does not look good. While we can all be grateful for advances in science and technology which have extended life, healed diseases, and made us all much more comfortable, there is also a dark side to this progress. It is this negative side, and its potential, that this volume addresses.Smith looks at many of the recent and controversial issues in biotechnology, chief among them, genetic engineering, human cloning and stem cell research. He does a good job of explaining where we are with these developments, and the various possible shortcomings they may raise.But of real value in this book is the author's concern to not just focus on the biotechnologies alone, but to look at the bigger picture. Where are these developments taking us as human beings? How are these new advances impacting on our understanding of humanity and human worth? Are moral and ethical concerns being swept under the carpet as we race ahead with scientific breakthroughs?Smith reminds us that it is all too easy for prudence and ethical interests to be sidelined in the chase for fame and fortune. Careful, objective science can easily be compromised and marginalised when so much is at stake.Smith notes that we now see the rise of a new scientific-industrial complex, every bit as worrying as past alliances with the private sector. Both academia and the scientific community are becoming increasingly cozy with the profit-making community. While that may not be bad in itself, an unduly cozy relationship may well mean trouble ahead.Thus the reality of Big Biotech is now a genuine concern as much as is Big Oil or Big Tobacco. As but one indication, in the past quarter century $100 billion has been poured into the biotech sector. As a result biotechnology companies today are largely research and fund-raising machines. And the old adage of \`those who pay the piper call the tune' is very much a real concern.And the money trail flows in all directions. Not only does Big Business drive much of the biotech agenda, but the latter in turn spends billions each year in public relations and political campaigns. The industry has many staff working full-time as paid-lobbyists and PR wizards, actively seeking to influence not only public opinion but the flow of tax-dollars.Of course many of these biotech companies have ethical advisors who are meant to act as a safeguard against any untoward influences. The real fear is that this is just a case of ethics for sale. Many of these bioethicists are simply putting the company spin on things. Few are genuinely objective, neutral and independent. Most are in the pay of their masters and will happily do their masters' bidding. After all, if the main concern is to get a good return on investment to stockholders, what company will hire an ethicist to work against that concern?Smith documents numerous cases of such questionable ethical advice, and how financial concerns very clearly determine much of the direction of the biotech industry.Another major concern highlighted in this book is the transformation of objective science into scientism. Scientism is the idea that science alone, unclouded by any moral and other input, can decide what is best for us. Science is seen as saviour and the sole source of truth. The humility and objectivity needed for good science are jettisoned for an ideology that eschews other considerations.This of course is a real concern, since much of the new bioscience is dealing with issues that have profound consequences for humanity and society. With so much at stake, other influences need to be brought to bear. Philosophical, theological and ethical input is crucially needed, but is often rejected altogether. Science begins to be seen as an end in itself, instead of a means to an end.Thus science itself is becoming tainted in this process, and any concerns about how humanity may suffer as a result are seldom discussed. But Smith certainly raises the issues. He knows that the political and financial pressures brought to bear on the biosciences are having a very real negative effect.One clear negative effect is the return of eugenics. This can especially be seen in the rise of Transhumanism. This philosophy states that any means available could and should be used to enhance individuals and their progeny. A very well funded and organised Transhumanist movement is quite clear about its goals: the transformation of human evolution by means of bioengineering and other emerging techniques. The aim is to create a \\"posthuman\\" species, free of the defects and limitations of mere humanity.But the pursuit of human perfection always comes at a price. We should have learned our lessons years ago. But we are ignoring those lessons and repeating those mistakes. All the warnings of Huxley and others are falling on deaf ears.Thus this book serves as a wake-up call. There are tremendous goods and benefits to come from the new technologies, and Smith is quick to point those out, but there are very real fears as well.The future is very much in our hands, and Smith reminds us that it is not enough to have science alone or the marketplace alone determine how we proceed. The advances of science and technology need to be counterbalanced by advances in ethical and social reflection. And this volume very nicely serves that purpose."},{"Title":"Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World: Library Edition","review":"Wesley Smith is a leading voice in the public debate surrounding the hottest issues in bioethics and biotechnology. His latest book, \\"Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World,\\" is essential reading for those who wish to better understand many of these important issues and what is at stake.Smith makes abundantly clear the ethical dangers involved with embryonic stem cell research (ESC) and human cloning. The creation of human life in laboratories purely for the purpose of destroying it and harvesting it as raw material is a frightening prospect. And Smith makes a strong case for the banning of human cloning.All the while, he is careful to draw a distinction between research involving ESCs and research involving adult stem cells (ASC). The latter procedure is NOT controversial and to this point has proven the most promising in terms of positive medical breakthroughs. In fact, Smith goes on at length in describing all the many wonderful benefits that we can expect and should actively seek through biotechnology.Biotechnology is very exciting and quite promising. Government funding for biotech is entirely appropriate and should continue. Private R&D; should likewise be promoted. But, like in any industry, there must be at least SOME ethical guidelines that should be adhered to if we value the equality of all human beings. When the genetic makeup of humanity is itself altered--like through the creation of clones or human-beast chimaeras--the equality of all human beings is eroded.What Smith warns against is scientific research completely unhinged from ANY sort of ethical bounds or considerations. He speaks out against a new eugenics that would allow human life to be treated as a resource for harvesting, as if it were a scene right out of \\"The Matrix.\\"Smith also provides insight behind the radical ideology driving many cloning advocates (scientism, elitism, transhumanism, etc.) Very important is Smith's discussion of the PR campaign waged by Big Biotech, which seeks large infusions of cash from governments by making lofty promises about the sorts of immediate medical breakthroughs that can come from cloning and ESC research. Such promises play upon those who find themselves or their loved ones in desperate situations, offering imminent miracle cures, when serious medical progress remains years or decades away.This book is very readable, highly engaging, and strongly recommended!(This reviewer works for the Discovery Institute, which the author has an affiliation with. Yet, I had zero input or involvement on the book and these views are my own.)"},{"Title":"Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World: Library Edition","review":"I found this book to be extremely informative and learned quite a bit from reading it. Prior to reading this my exposure to the issues inherent in some of the biotechnological initiatives discussed here was what is presented/argued about in the mainstream media. Mr. Smith has done an admirable job in describing the details associated with cloning and stem cell research , embryonic as well as adult. His arguments regarding the scientific and ethical dilmma that these potentially powerful technologies represent are thought provoking and logically presented. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation out there regarding these issues on both sides of the argument. This book lays out the conservative viewpoint in scientific terminology and I beleve that Mr. Smith has made a valuable contibution to the debate that our society is engaged in on which direction to take with these technologies."},{"Title":"Consumer's Guide to a Brave New World: Library Edition","review":"This book is fantastic! Anyone who is interested in the stem cell research debate from a secular point of view. There is no mention of God or religion or the bible. Just clear, rational thinking about the debate.

He was a journalist, a regular contributor to the Manchester Guardian and New York World at the time, and fleshed out some of his articles to compile the book. Were it just a look at cases of murder, it would probably have faded into well-deserved obscurity now (like Bolitho's previous book, Studies in Murder, has). But Murder for Profit is something different, and something that should be recognized-to my knowledge, it is the first book ever written which consciously attempts to profile the serial killer. As profiling of serial killers is held in high regard these days, it would seem to me that however inaccurate and colored Bolitho's conclusions, that he put people on the road should be enough to immortalize his name in the annals of crime literature forever.Bolitho looks at the Burke and Hare murders (would-be grave robbers who decided murder was easier than digging), J. B. Troppmann (who killed for no other reason, Bolitho would have us believe, than that he found a victim from the same town he grew up in), G. J. Smith (the Brides in the Bath Murderer), Desire Landru (The Ladykiller), and Fritz Haarmann (the Werewolf of Hanover). The cases are presented in varying formats, which can get annoying at times (Landru's murders, for example, receive not an inch of the book), but does keep the interest better than a case-study template covering five serial killers would. Bolitho focuses more on the upbringings and lives of the murderers before they committed their crimes, for the most part, in an attempt to determine what forces shape the serial killer. Some of what he finds would fit today's profile (enmity towards their fathers, for example), while some would be laughed at (all were dealers in secondhand goods, in various ways).But whether a book is important is, in the general scheme of things, not going to impress the casual reader all that much; the question to be asked is how's it read? And Murder for Profit reads very well for a book from the pre-television (read: back when people still had attention spans greater than those of a gerbil on crack) days. Bolitho hooks the interest, spends a good, but not inordinate, amount of time on each case, and saves his own conclusions for the section where he talks extensively about the serial killer profile. (Oddly, this is not at the end-it is at the beginning of the section on Haarmann.)One wonders what Bolitho would write today, had he not died an untimely death, about our own serial killers. Lord knows he'd do a better job than most who write about them at present. This is a fascinating read, well worth taking the time to track down. ***"},{"Title":"How to Talk to Your Cat","review":"I didn't find this book to be very creative or interesting. There seemed to be a lot of filler and little substance. I had expected something more entertaining."},{"Title":"How to Talk to Your Cat","review":"I bought this title along with several others in earnest, seeking to better my relationship with my cat, & then honestly could not wait to finish the book...There was a small handful of nuggets of helpful information, mostly concerning a cats' body language & basic needs, that was useful. The most important concept I came away with is the advice to speak to your cat intelligently, & to treat him as a sentient being who bears personhood & with respect. I agree with the author that this is crucial. Even if your cat does not fully pick up on all of your complex human vocabulary, as Ms. Moyes elaborately fantasizes that hers do - your cat *will* pick up on your intent, the tone of your feelings towards him, & the spirit in which you speak to him. Her method of developing a call signal to find a lost cat is also of practical value. If you come away with these points, you've got the basics.That said...This author's narcissistic \\"snitty british\\" arrogant writing tone propelled by almost purely emotional reasoning drove me up a wall........ The author struck me as overly self-involved & almost completely lost in her own personal fantasies about what is going on with her cats to the point of living in a dream world, made for one. After page 20 this slowly became nauseating, & a stifling urge to scream settled in & stayed.In this book, the author haughtily purports herself to be everyone's Conscience concerning their pet. She makes striking statements that anyone who would ever opt to declaw a cat - or to solely house them indoors - is better off not having one at all. Apparently, this individual would rather see stray animals piled up dead on the floors of kill shelters, than to be adopted to live by apartment pet regulations concerning declawing, or kept safely indoors. My thought was, \\"How dare you...\\" The author needs to reach beyond a myopic, single-minded love of Siamese cats & an upper class lifestyle to develop some concept of how many hundreds of thousands of cats are left unclaimed & unadopted to die in shelters every single day, claws intact. This is reality.But then...she imagines that in spite of the plethora of feline breeds & mixes available, every person would *only* want to keep a Siamese cat, if they only knew their nature, as a matter of course. After reading her descriptions of her cats' behavior, I've never been more glad to have a DSH in my care. However, if you do keep a Siamese - get the book. It may help you realize you're not alone in your Siamese's unique antics. Most of the information here pertains only to them & does not generalize out well at all to other breeds. I could not relate at least 60% of the content to my own cat's personality, habits, feelings, & behavior. Or any other cat I've known, for that matter. Or, if you are interested in a purely anecdotal personal \\"case study\\" account of one person's experience of Siamese behavior - you may find this book's giddy ramblings entertaining. Be prepared to wade through mounds of ego & narrow subjectivity to get to the informational content you seek.However - if you are looking for a truly resourceful book on how to communicate with your cat...look elsewhere. Don't let one woman's endless egocentric carrying on bend your mind concerning your cat. Some far better suggestions for books on this topic would be:* \\"The Language of Animals: 7 Steps To Communicating With Animals\\" by Carol Gurney* \\"CatSpeak\\" by Bash Dibra, reknowned animal trainer* \\"The Cat Whisperer\\" by Claire Bessant* \\"Animal Talk\\" by Penelope Smith* \\"277 Secrets Your Cat Wants You To Know: A Catalog of Unusual & Interesting Information\\" by Paulette Cooper & Paul Noble* \\"Cat Owner's Manual\\" by Dr. Bruce Fogle - written by a Veterinarian, this is the single most helpful cat book I've found yet.There are SO MANY better titles out there on the topic of human/feline communication with helpful, useful information surpassing this stifling narration.To be perfectly honest... And I can't believe I'm saying this... I finished the book thinking, \\"I am so grateful I am not Ms. Moyes' cat.....\\" And screamed into a pillow."},{"Title":"How to Talk to Your Cat","review":"This book is a jewel.

When I first picked the book up, I flipped to the middle, which happened to be the &quot;good&quot; part, so I gave it a try. The beginning contained some &quot;historical&quot; information, which I found sketchy considering the author had no credentials or references. The argument that this woman gave for how cats became domesticated wasn't convincing. Regardless, there was a decent section in the middle about picking a cat (if you got past her feelings about purebreds), communicating with your cat, and what the different &quot;miaows&quot; and body language mean that I found interesting and useful. Otherwise, the book is filled with stories of her Siamese cats and their world travels, unlikely circumstances involving the one cat being lost for 2 weeks, and many, many opinions. The author seemed haughty most of the time and was very opinionated. Overall, I'd guess this author had money and thought it would be fun to write a book about her cats."},{"Title":"How to Talk to Your Cat","review":"I enjoyed the author's down to earth style of explaining the importance of respecting your cat as a true family member.

The first Holisitc Detective Agency book was much better in regards to cover to cover wit. Long Dark Tea-time just lost all of its steam once it came to the three-quarters point.

The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is not, in my opinion, as good as the first, but it did make me laugh out loud and you really have to appreciate how all those seemingly inconsequential things really did tie in very nicely at the end.

I love all Adams' works for different reasons - They're all ridiculous and wonderfully wacky, but the Dirk Gently books are a bit calmer and seem rather more thoughtful and less facetious than Hitchhiker's Guide.Odin as an old man whose biggest character trait is pickiness about the state of his sheets, Thor as a thunder-hammer toting tough guy, these are just two of the marvelous cast of mythological creatures who inhabit this gem of a book.

This story mixes his unique--and side stitching--humor with a plot that brings both a modern world and a world of myth to life. This follow up to Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is more than worth the price paid and will keep you howling with laughter no matter how many times you read it. Quite simply: it's brilliant, well-written, funny and farcical. Not many authors can interject their personal opinions of the world into their work and get away with it like Douglas can.

She recovers, but something leads her to Woodhouse, a hospital for very unusual patients, including a one-eyed old man whose name is Mr. Odwin, has a tiny demonic-looking assistant named Toe Rag, and a certain temperamental son with a hammer named Mjolnir.So where does Dirk Gently come in this? In his usual &quot;fundamental interconnectedness in all things&quot; way, of course. He wakes up hours after he was supposed to meet his client, who's terrified of a green-eyed giant with a scythe. He arrives at the client's house, only to find the police there, his client's head rotating in the middle of a 33 and 1/3 single &quot;Hot Potato&quot; record that keeps skipping. He goes through a series of misfortunes and incidents, including breaking his nose and being attacked by an eagle.The premise, and it may require a few re-readings to fully get what's going on, is interesting enough, but not as the ones he explored in his Hitchhiker novels and the previous Dirk Gently novel. They seem to be a series of disconnected ideas that don't click together. Dirk Gently's quirky, eccentric character works as long there's a more straight-laced foil to respond to his ramblings. Here, there is no Richard MacDuff to help out.Consider those who respond to him. Sally Mills, the nurse whose coffee he steals, isn't too put out by his personality. Kate Schechter, on the other hand, gives him a flea in his ear after he tail-ends her car, but she's more independent-minded than MacDuff, and there's only one segment in the book where she interracts with him.Some ideas that could be funny or further elaborated include an I Ching calculator, which can add up to 4, but any answer above it equals &quot;a suffusion of yellow.&quot; One that works is his theory of finding his way after being lost in traffic, and that's to follow a car that seems to know where it's going, the premise being that somehow, he'll end up where he needs to be.As for his writing, Adams' description of Gently's fridge, which hasn't been opened for three months, is something: &quot;the fridge no longer merely stood there in the corner of the kitchen, it actually lurked.&quot; And the fridge war between he and his housekeeper is a beaut in writing. There are actually some good writing moments, but other than that...People interested in Adams should, as the chorus to &quot;Hot Potato&quot; goes, &quot;don't pick it up, pick it up, pick it up&quot; and maybe only after they've read Dirk Gently. Getting into it does require a high degree of patience, so only for the most diehard fans. Overall a bit disappointing, like his other work Mostly Harmless."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"If a book is defined as merely a bound set of pages with words upon them, then this garbage could be considered a book. By any other definition, this is merely a rectangle. A worthless, pointless, patently unfunny, string of sentences that have little to do with story telling and nothing to do with entertainment.Two whole pages on which bath salts to use? Long descriptions on how the light skitters across a room? Ten pages about how horrible Dirk's refrigerator is? Most pages are filled with pointless words about some random item that has no purpose toward the almost non-existent storyline.Calling the characters two dimensional would be a stretch. They have no dimensions. They don't even resemble human beings. A pizza obsessed New Yorker? A teenager who punches anyone who turns off the TV? A horribly bad PI with no money and no client who falls into a series of random events that happen to be connected then solves it by practically tripping over the conclusion? That's not a plot, it's nonsense.It shocks me that there are any, let alone mostly, 4&5 star ratings for this book. If you're over the age of 14 and have an IQ larger than your shoe size, you should stay far away from this rectangle and go read a book."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Dirk had.Dirk knew Lupton Road. &quot;Suicide?&quot; said Dirk.&quot; thought Dirk.

The book is NOT about Dirk Gently's holistic detective agency. At any rate, it oughtn't be. Strange things happen but no holistic explanation is to be found. Try Dirk Gently's Ad Hoc Detective Agency instead.(PS: \\"The Meaning of Lif,\\" another original work, is also worth acquiring.)(2) Adams should start thinking up new titles that aren't pinched from the two hitch-hiker books mentioned above. Honestly! He might as well have a sticker on the cover saying, \\"No New Ideas\\".The second star is awarded because Adams is still funny (although he was much funnier in the previous book), certainly more so than his immitator, Terry Pratchett. It's just that I've never seen him be funny in the service of so little."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD names or track names, nor will any CD player that can show CD names or track names.2.

Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I'd ever encountered. I didn't laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings.

Time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another HHG novel."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I am very disappointed with my purchase.

Duff, duff, duff."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This book was a bit of a disappointment. Good by most standards, but below Adams' median.The second (and final) book in the Dirk Gently series, it has little to do with the first book except the Dirk character himself. The storyline, however, remains larger-than-life:\\"So far he had taken no real interest in the strange incident at the airport, but now it demanded his attention. The explosion was now officially designated an \`Act of God.' But, thought Dirk, what god? And why?\\"As always, Adams includes zany humor (see the I Ching calculator, which computes anything above 4 as \\"A Suffusion of Yellow\\"). Still, particularly in his later writings like this one, Adams begins subtly layering social commentary into his work. This gives the piece depth, but perhaps due partly to the fact that I disagree with his notions of God, it ruins much of the fun.This book was also a bit darker than most of his works (with a severed head revolving on a record player and an older woman threatening suicide).It gave me a few chuckles, but no real laugh-out-loud moments--especially as the book progressed. It was enjoyable, but I'd read Adams' other works over this one"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"OK.I read it three times. In a row. Back to back. Each time I looked forward to picking it up. I learned a little more each time about what the heck is going on in the story.However.This book is not nearly as good as all of his others which I have reread so many times I could not even estimate how many. They are hilarious. Tea Time is good for a chuckle here and there but that is about it. I suppose those who have a bit more upstairs than I may find all the social commentary or what ever makes up for the lack of silliness and humor. In my case it did not.Glad I bought it. Glad I read it twice. Not really worth the third read. Wish it was as great as all the others. As some one once said the lack may lie with me and not the book.A great loss that there will be no more.

But I have to say, I did not find it quite as laugh-out-loud funny as its prequel, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. I am almost finished with it (less than 50 pages to go and those will go quick), but it is VERY ODD! Still, it has many of the same classic Adams' techniques and it still quite funny."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I'm sure that the fact that it took me over a month to read is part of the problem, but the title seemed more related to my experience of reading the book than the content of the storyline. I mean, I don't think I laughed once through the last half of the book. The ideas just weren't clicking, and even his characters were depressed. I don't think DNA enjoyed writing this one. Or, at least, the last half. The first half was great. I laughed until I cried, that sort of thing. He was so creative and amazingly funny, and I really want to try to practice personifications like he could do. But the last half I didn't like so much."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Receives four stars instead of five only because of abrupt ending. Like all of Adams, is funny, poignant and enjoyable. Life is short, and this book is a good way to get more of it."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This is the 2nd Dirk Gently novel and like the first it is good fun , with Adams trademark sense of humour. An explosion at Heathrow is called by the press an Act of God, and it turns out to be more than tabloid hyberbole, as Dirk Gently soon discovers.The feel of the novel is reminiscient of Thorne Smith's 'The Night Life of the Gods'. But although Adam's style is always enjoyable, the novel seems a little thin; all wit and little substance. Given Adams notorious bouts with writer's block maybe his publishers were unwilling to wait for it to be properly polished."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Dirk Gently is back! Hooray! I enjoyed Tea-time almost as much as the Holistic Detective Agency but for one thing: It was very, very confusing. The first half of the book is creepy, funny, and really great. Adams is nearly at his best here. But the second half is more confusing. Now that I think about it, many things are left undone as well, unless I missed something, which I most likely did. Ah well. Read it anyway, just read it carefully and you should enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Personally I could not put this book down,if it wasn't for the fact that I had class I would have sat in my dorm and not stopped reading it until I was done.I wish that there was a way to describe the plot of this book that would do it justice, but the simple fact is that there isn't. I tried to explain it to a friend but got the same confused look as I did when I tried to explain the Hitchhiker's Guide. Aside from the inexplicable nature of this book there is true genius in the characters and the holistic nature of everything in it. And as always Adams provides the reader with a plethora of quotes that you can use to impress your friends, or worry them as to your mental stability or lack there of."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Douglas Adams, in my opinion, is really funny. He writes jokes that you have to be pretty smart to get, but not a genius. British jokes. But jokes, nonetheless. He writes strange, off-the-wall, science fiction humor.

The Dirk Gently series is overlooked, due to the success of the Hitchhiker's trilogies. However, this particular entry in the series, is as good as the last 3 Hitchhiker's books combined. For starters, it is so strange that you will understand it differently each time you read it. The story actually makes more sense than the first Dirk Gently novel but, do not ask me for a summary. You will think I've gone rather mad and the chance you can understand this book without reading it, is nonexistent. All the same, check it out."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Adams once again brings his whimsical writing style to an absurd series of events, making for a hilarious ride. I heard someone say once that Adams works are usually classified as \\"young adult\\", but any age can enjoy his books. Also he mentions alcohol quite a lot for young adult books. Aside from some alcohol references (I'm sure his other books mention alcohol more than this one), the book is very family friendly (no gratuitous sex/violence). If you enjoyed the Hitchhiker's Trilogy than you'll love this book. It is the sequel to \\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\\" so you'll be more familiar with Gently's character if you read that book first, but it's not imperative."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Don't worry, you won't understand the title even after reading the book. Or maybe you will. Not really the point, though.

But this is my absolute favorite of his. I bought it in hardcover when it was first published, and was lucky enough to have it signed by him. It remains one of my favorite books to this day. (Yes, this review is highly subjective and probably not all that helpful, and I apologize for that.)There will never be another quite like Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"When Dirk Gentlys' Holistic Detective Agency was first published back in 1987 I was hugely disappointed after thoroughly enjoying the Hitchhikers Guide series. Like many, I absolutely fell in love with Douglas Adams magnificent sci-fi/humor series and Gently just seemed so bland in comparison. Having reread the book a year or so ago I have learned to appreciate its subtle humor and wry wit but it still pales when held next to the five part trilogy. I've owned The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul since not long after it was first published but I can't honestly say whether I ever read it until now. Personally I enjoyed it more than the previous book and it's a shame that the series wasn't continued but I suspect it was a result of the lukewarm reaction it was getting from the public even as it sold well. Dirk Gently was likely a victim of Adams own towering achievement as Hitchhiker fans did exactly what I did which was compare the two series with Gently coming in a distant second. Besides the underrated \`Mostly Harmless' Tea Time is the last solo effort novel from Douglas Adams which in my humble opinion is one of the great tragedies of literature.Douglas Adams certainly isn't the first to write a detective story but his may be the first one with a detective so clumsy, doughy and often irritating. What sets Dirk apart is his belief in the interconnectedness of all things hence the \`Holistic' Detective Agency. Dirk takes Occam's razor and turns it on its head assuming that the most impossible scenario is the most plausible. Normally this would be a recipe for disaster but in Douglas Adams crazy world assuming the impossible is Dirk's ace in the hole. In this case the impossibility that the large Norseman carrying a hammer that happened to be at the epicenter of a freakish explosion in an airport just might be the God of Thunder, Thor.I have no idea why Douglas Adams quit writing solo books but it may be because he was working in the very large shadow of his own previous success. \`So Long and Thanks For All the Fish' was a literary disaster and \`Mostly Harmless' was poorly received although in my opinion much better than people give it credit for. Dirk Gently would have had to have been a homerun to really be embraced and the two books simply are not. They are merely very good. The other problem was that the act of writing itself seemed to cause Adams considerable angst and sometimes it felt like he ended a book just to stop his anguish. Unfortunately this book has that feel to it.As stated above the weakest part of the book is the ending which was often Douglas Adams Achilles heal. In the Long Dark Tea Time he sets up quite a few intriguing plot threads but when they are all tied together at the end it seems just a bit too contrived as if he couldn't come up with a good ending and so he went with the best he could given the publishing deadlines. The ending is better than the previous Gentry entry but that's not saying a lot since the ending of the first book was an incoherent mess. In terms of quality I would put the Long Dark Tea Time well ahead of So Long and Thank For All the Fish, ahead of the Holistic Detective Agency but weaker than the other four Hitchhiker books. For me the big payoff in a novel in the ending and no matter how well written the rest of the book is a messy ending means the readers last impression is less than positive. This is one of the books I recommend with a caveat that you keep your expectations in check. It's certainly possible that you might find the ending to be brilliantly creative. What's wonderful about Douglas Adams is that even when his writing isn't his best he still keeps it light and entertaining with the possible exception of Thanks for all the Fish and *ahem* the ending of Mostly Harmless."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This book is fun to read if you enjoy Adams's writing style and wit. The characters are enjoyable and the concept is clever. I have read this book several times for pleasure. But, I have to admit that the ending is lame. I will not spoil it I just want to warn fans not to expect a great ending - just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Douglas Adams was hilarious, and I love every book he has ever done. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series is better, so buy that first, but buy this immediately afterwords."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I usually start my reviews with a brief summary, but in this case it's rather difficult since Douglas Adam's books tend to defy any attempts to summarize them. However, here goes: Dirk Gently (last seen inDirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency) has been commissioned by a client to protect him from a huge green-eyed monster with a scythe. More interested in the money than in Mr Anstey's will to survive, Dirk arrives late for their appointment and discovers his client's house crawling with police-officers. Mr Anstey himself is sitting in front of a stereo-system, with his head revolving around on a record turn-table. The guilt kicks in, and Dirk decides to do for Mr Anstey in death what he couldn't do for him in life, and investigate the goings-on.Meanwhile, Kate Schechter is receiving strong signals from the universe that she shouldn't be traveling to Norway, all of which accumulate in the check-in desk at the airport blowing up. It is labeled by the papers as \\"an Act of God,\\" but unbeknownst to the journalists who wrote such a headline...that *exactly* what it is. To be more specific, it's the act of Thor, God of Thunder, who just wants to go home. When the paths of Dirk and Kate converge, the two of them swap stories - stories that by this stage involve secret contracts, electronic I Ching devices, a transmogrified eagle, best-selling books that aren't any good, creepy nursing homes, clean linen, a shifty lawyer, and an old refrigerator that nobody opens. Only Dirk's ideology that everything in the universe is in somewhat interconnected with everything else (you've probably all heard of the old \\"Butterfly Effect\\" theory by now) can possibly make heads or tails of all this.It's dense and complex read, but also very, very funny (how often do you find *that* combination?) Right from the start, when Adams points out that airports are designed to be both ugly and confusing: (\\"some attain a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort,\\") the book has plenty to poke fun at, from the recesses of the human mind, to the bad smell of hospitals, to one-sided telephone conversations along these lines: \\"Sometimes unusually intelligent and sensitive children can sometimes appear to be stupid. But, Mrs Benson, stupid children can sometimes appear to be stupid as well.\\"There are also intriguing glimpses into the human psyche, such as Kate's musings that \\"people who needed to bully you were the easiest to push around,\\" or the fact that Dirk knows he can get away with stealing a woman's coffee because \\"she would simply not be able to believe that this had happened.\\" And I loved this, when Dirk runs into a cyclist, who: \\"cursed and swore at him form a moral high ground that cyclists alone seem able to inhabit.\\" Ha! How does he KNOW?! Okay, I'd better stop quoting chucks of the book at you...I hardly ever do that in my reviews, but there are so many gems to choose from!Basically, the plot is based around the doings of the god Odin and his wayward and bad-tempered son Thor. Though you don't need to be particularly versed in Norse mythology to know what's going on, the names and places may resonant with you more strongly if you have a vague knowledge of it (and I'll take the opportunity of this aside to throw in a recommendation for Diana Wynne Jones'Eight Days of Luke, which also speculates on the contemporary lives of Norse gods). There is a sense of poignancy to the proceedings when we learn that the gods were created by humanity's desire for them to exist - but now that no-one believes in them, their immortal lives stretch onwards in near-destitution.As others have mentioned, the ending is quite opaque and as you read the cryptic plot, a lot of deciphering needs to be done. Nothing is spelt out and it takes a bit of time (and possibly a re-read) in order to understand exactly what's happened and why. Some aspects are made clear by the end of the book, some are gradually realized after you ponder them for a bit, and others I'm still scratching my head over. Although I don't think that Adams should have pandered to the lowest common denominator, I also think that just a *little* more explanation would have gone a long way.But as it stands, everything in this book means something. So read carefully."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Yes, that's right. I also enjoyed this book. Once again, I didn't know what was going on at the beginning, but a bit into the book it all started to make sense. A lot of great funny moments in this one. I enjoyed every hour of reading I put into it (I'm a slow reader, but that just means I get to enjoy it longer :P). I'll definitely reread this one later on."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"When Dirk Gently, not-so-master-detective, is on the case, who know what can happen? The story opens with an explosion in an airport. This introduces the female lead character and basis of the story. While moving through the story you learn that the old Norse Gods were actually real, but as their human believers dwindled, their powers became less and less. As a large scam between the most powerfull god, a human lawer, and an advitiser rocks the world of the gods, Dirk Gently must smooth everything out, or else the balence between the God's world and the human world will tip, and the angry Gods will run amuck!While this story is supremely written, a couple parts need to be reread a couple times so you can follow the story line. Adam's familiar humor and observations are just a prevalent, and just as funny as always. If you like this twisted story line as a break from all the other predictable Fantasies, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"THE LONG, DARK TEA TIME is a surprisingly different detective novel in which the hero, Dirk Gently, suffers from a number of humorous personality quirks. Dirk refuses to open his refrigerator, follows cars that seem to know when they're going when he's lost, and prefers to consider impossible scenarios over highly improbable ones. He also has a penchant for taking things that aren't his... although no matter how badly things seem to be going for him, he always seems to manage to end up in the right place at the right time. And perhaps this is the greatest lesson that Dirk Gently has to share.I laughed out loud so often while reading LONG DARK TEA TIME that I cried, and found myself reading and re-reading passages to savor them again and again. Douglas Adams is truly a master story teller, even when dealing with a plot that ping-pongs back and forth between two main character who are coping with extremely unusual (and dare I say impossible) situations. Keeping track of the plot was challenging at times, but well worth the effort.I highly recommend this book, and now plan to make sure I read everything Adams has written!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I have read all the volumes of THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE. In fact, I've read all of DNA's books including his nonfiction such as THE DEEPER MEANING OF LIFF and LAST CHANCE TO SEE. Of all the books, THE LONG DARK TEA-TIME OF THE SOUL is by far my favorite. I must add, there is no piece of fiction that I have read as many times as THE LONG DARK TEA-TIME OF THE SOUL.Why would a person read this novel more that once? First, it is hilarious! The dialogs and interaction among the characters are well honed. This description of airports on the first couple of pages will induce everyone to continue reading. Second, the story and the underlying theoretical principles that guide the novel are quite complex. Thus, a person can read this novel ten times and still undercover an unanticipated wrinkle that sheds new light on the plot and subplots. Third, from an academic perspective, Dirk Gently employs an \\"ecological system model\\" as the centerpiece of his investigative tools. Gently's worldview represents an extreme form of a theory that student's commonly learn in college. Teaching the theoretical principles of the ecological system model is a stuffy and arduous enterprise. However, using Dirk Gently as an example opens the door for understanding among many college students. Back in 1991, I emailed DNA about how I was using his novel in class. He replied and was pleased with my efforts.I love this book and feel sad that I will not have the pleasure reading more of DNA's work."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"The adventures of Dirk Gently (Svlad Jelly)continues in this second and most unfortunatly last (not including the partially written Salmon of Doubt)book of the series. This book is filled with typical humor of Douglas Adams, from Gods giving up thier power for nice clean sheets, to an advertising agency bent on ruling the world. (Don't forget Thor counting all the rocks...) This is a must read for any DNA fan. What I like best about this book (and indeed most of DNA's books) is how the minutae come together at the end, as Dirk would put it &quot;the fundemental interconnectedness of all things&quot; really plays a part here."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This is humor as only Mr. Adams would do it- good thing, because his brand of laughs is the best sort. It's not of the same tone of the Hitchhiker's series, but IMHO, I was a bit relieved at the what I found here, which was more sophisticated wit. Still, Adams hasn't lost his ability to make the most mundane things amusing (pizza...penguins...refrigerators) and all of the characters are, of course, delightfully quirky. They also seem to be intelligent and not left to the hands of Fate quite so much as Arthur and his gang. My point- read this, whether you're a new Adams fan or an age-old one. You won't be disappointed. You may even be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Then please take yourself to a doctor-as you have lost your sense of humor! This book is amazingly funny-I found myself laughing out loud in several places-and getting funny looks in the process, but I didn't care. This book is fantastic, and I believe that it is Douglas Adam's best ever."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul is a mostly enjoyable book in Douglas Adams typical style, but it is uncharacteristically soul-less. The book begins, as books are wont to do, by introducing us to a cast of seemingly unconnected characters living seemingly unconnected lives filled with seemingly unconnected events. As the book progresses, these characters, their aforementioned lives, and the aforementioned events come together in strange and mostly interesting ways. The story moves along well enough until near the end. As I read, I eventually reached a point where there were very few pages left to read, and there was still a great deal of explaining left to do. At this point I suspected that the book would end with either; A) A less than adequate explanation for the plot points, or; B) A great deal of explanation jammed into the remaining few pages. Sadly, it turned out to be both. I would like to be able to recommend this work based on the first 7/8ths of the book. But, the final 1/8th of the book goes a long way toward overwhelming the preceeding pages with a hurried, splotchy, and unsatisfying climax. I rarely feel that any book could benefit from actually being longer, but that is indeed the case with Adams' TLDTTOTS. It seems as if the author reached a certain point in the writing process, then lost interest in the project, and wrapped it up as quickly as possible, throwing quality to the wind. If you like Douglas Adams other works, you will probably like this one. If you're not an Adams fan, the ending will leave you feeling decaffinated."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I must admit that I have not read the precusor to the Dirk Gently series, but do not feel that this put me at a loss in reading this novel. Douglas Adams has developed an entire world within a world that makes little sense but is smashing fun (if a little confusing to read). \\"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\\" is a fast-paced mystery filled with humor, satire, and the kitchen refrigerator.A mysterious accident occurs at Heathrow Airport in which a check-in desk and its attendent disappear in a ball of flame. Without any other reason, the occurence is written off as an act of God. But the question remains as to which god would do such a thing. It is up to Dirk Gently, holistic detective, to try to uncover the mystery that spans two worlds and gods among mortals. If only he can figure out what that has to do with his recently decapitated client as he embarks on the most miserable day of his life.\\"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\\" can be initially confusing since Adams skips between two characters' narrations and the storyline is far-fetched, to say the least. But the story all comes together in the end, perhaps a little too quickly and summarily, to solve the mystery and ensure that the immortals are in their right place and not messing in the affairs of humans. The plot is wickedly brillant; a refreshing escape from the mundane."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Why would the Norse God Thor be hanging around Terminal Two of Heathrow Airport trying to catch the 15.37 to Oslo? That is exactly the question Dirk Gently, a special kind of detective who uses his spiritual insight for his investigations, needs to get answered as fast as possible. Somehow the exploding Heathrow Airport ticket counter seems to be connected to Dirk's latest -and late- client, found only this morning with his head quite independently revolving atop the hit record \\"Hot Potato\\". It is time to get his holistic view on the world in practice, because the hostile attentions of a stray eagle and the murderous dirty refrigerator make the life of our intergalactic sleuth less attractive than he is used to.When reviewing any book written by Douglas Adams, you are immediately forced -by some unseen intergalactic force- to compare it to the Hitchhiker's Guide series. No need in trying to resist this urge, so here it goes: The Gently books are probably not as hilarious as the Hitchhikers Guide series, yet they are still very funny. Voila!Now that that has been cleared, it is time to formulate some useful comments. Be warned! When you decide to read The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul know that you will have to immediately reread it once you turn the last page. The storyline is so complex and mind bogglingly absurd that you will conclude more than once that Douglas must have been completely stoned while writing this novel. But don't panic! In the end everything comes together in an apotheosis of pure grandeur. The denouement is so perplexing that you can only continue by rereading the complete novel.The jokes and gags are not the strongest point of the book, but the absurd situations and the entertaining storyline compensates this easily.Since The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is the sequel to Dirk Gently and the Holistic Detective Agency, I guess it is recommendable to start with the first novel, although I did not do this and still had some great fun."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I see so many reviews here about how this can't compare to HHGTTG or how the DGHDA books are just too confusing. They just don't seem to understand the sublime humor, complexity, and beauty wrought in these books. Its not the anything-for-laughs absurdity of the HHGTTG series; It tries to acheive a higher plane in humor. This book, spared the somewhat sluggish intro of its previous, works so well. The journey will bewilder you, but hang in and it'll start making sense. A masterpiece! Please, DNA, don't listen to all the whiners wishing for another quick-and-easy book in the HHGTTG series; That horse is long dead, so quit beating it. Continue on producing better books; Don't be dissuaded by the naysayers who can't let go of the past..."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I'm confused. I ordered an audio book. I already have this book in my DNAdams collection. Different cover though so it's OK. Waiting for cassettes."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of The Soul is the second novel in the Dirk Gently series and, for me, it is even less memorable. Adams' ridiculousness is stronger here than in any of his other books (excluding The Salmon of Doubt of course) and I found it to be a bit annoying. Still, you can't help but enjoy the nonsense plot and intelligent writing style. Douglas Adams fans who liked the first Dirk Gently novel should enjoy this as well, but, for me, reading Adams is like watching a movie that is so set on getting laughs that they force in jokes and hilarious plot twists so much that it almost wears out your sense of humor after a while."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"The Douglas Adams I remember from the first Dirk Gently novel is not present in this one. The storyline feels thrown together, the ending is forced, and the ability of the text to hold an audience is poor. Though there were a few bright spots, this book was a large disappointment. However, the Hitchhikers Guide five book trilogy and the first Dirk Gently novels are wonderful. Don't read this, it just disappoints. At best, it's a B-."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"His best ever. Thor is amazingly depicted running through the planet earth in a most charming and wildly whimsical manner. Dirk Gently was introduced to me in this book and is my favorite fiction character in over 20 years of reading fiction. Simply Brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This book is simply hilarious. This novel brings about the return of Svald, infamously known as Dirk, Gently, who must contend with a coca-cola machine, a client's head found revolving on a record, and an angry thunder god. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"A long dark tea-time of the soul. Only the title makes you aware of Adam's genious way of writing. The dark time of our souls... It is written with a British humor which I love, being &aacute;boring Swede'. Sometimes it really confuses me and I have to read a few parts twice, but it is generally a great novel with a silly sense of humor. He geniously connects to his other books, i.e. by having a sofa from \`The hitchhiker's...\` (I think) appear. There are lots of encounters with Gods, especially Thor and Oden (Odin in Eng.) If you liked 'The Hitch-hiker's...'you will love this as well as 'Dirk Gently's Holistic Agency\`."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Sixty-four out of the 66 reviews currently up talk about THE BOOK. The product listed is THE AUDIO CD of the book. I ordered the CD set for Christmas, and it was good - up until the final, 6th CD. There, one section repeats over and over, over all 18 tracks. It's the part of Chapter 26 where Thor and Kate meet Tsuliwaensis. Each track is not identical, but the part of the book that is read, is. Needless to say, you never get to the thrilling conclusion of the book.Amazon quickly replaced the CD set (thank you!), but the replacement set has THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM. (I apologize for appearing to shout here.) Has anyone reviewing this product actually listened to the CD from beginning to end? Are they all this way, or have I gotten two clinkers in a row?Thank you."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"this is yet another wonderous zany journey from DouglasAdams. If you've ever wondered what humans do with all the brain matter they don't seem to use, what happens to gods when people stop believing in them, or whether it's possible to get pizza delivered in London, this book is for you. Same series as \\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\\", but I read this one first and the plot didn't suffer. Absolutely incredible."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Received book wrapped in plastic. No problems. Girlfriend loved it as a gift."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Of all the Adams books...and I have read the lot several times over, this one is THE BEST!!! I never get tired of re-reading this one. About the only thing I hate about Douglas Adams is that he had to go and die on us! 'So long Doug . . . rip mate and thanks!'"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This, I believe, is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I think this may indeed rival Hitchhikers Guide. The style of humor is definitely different, so if you're expecting the same kind of thing, then you may be a bit let down. However, the more earthbound (or Asgard-bound) humor pulls you in. After a while, Adams goes on to throw the characters into some very strange situations, and the result is almost always hilarious (sometimes in a sick kinda way).Plus, if you read the book, then the heading to my review will make sense."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I came away from this book with the feeling that it was a bit of a comedown after the first Dirk Gently book. It didn't quite deliver the same laugh-out-loud hilarity and intelligent, complex plot as the first one.Having said that, though, you still can't go very wrong by buying this book. I love all of Douglas Adams' works (yes, even the oft-maligned &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;), so for me a four-star review just means that it wasn't quite as enjoyable as many of his other books. But it's still a good read, no question about it."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This novel marked the beginning of Douglas Adam's career as a Serious Writer - but I mean that in a good way. Unfortunately, it was also the end of his career - at least of books that he personally approved.This is the story of the Norse gods among us, one trying to cope with the ambitious mediocrity of the modern world while the other seems to be the cause of it.Read this if only because your lit profs have probably never heard of it, but wouldn't like it if they had."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Douglas Adams has done it again. In this sequal to Dirk Gently, are goos old detective is out to solve another baffling case. Adams takes every thing in this book and makes it make sense in the end. One of his best. As humorus as Dirk Gently but with it's own twists. Adams is one of the BEST writers in the world and and can make anything a good read. What are you doing sitting here reading what I have to say. ORDER THIS BOOK. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Much can be said of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, most of it rather meaningless. After all, how many detective stories have a very dirty refrigerator as the key to the mystery and a detective with an 8th sense? The world of the gods has been drastically altered, and the realm of humanity has been adversely affected. Only one man can save both. Dirk Gently, super-sleuth. As is typical of Douglas Adams's genius, a series of seemingly meaningless and unrelated events turn out to be tremendously important...to the story anyway. Dirk has to relate all of these events to find out what is wrong, and an eagle following him down a street has a goodly amount of anger towards him, causing even more problems. Other...interesting (for lack of a better word) situations confront Dirk while on his quest, including car accidents, a man who had his head cut off and placed on a record player, and navigating a massive party thrown by the gods themselves. The situations, and the dialogue, keep the reader interested, as you end up asking yourself, &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; Of course, they are also extremely funny. A rather interesting example, when Dirk is talking to Kate, a person nearly killed when the check-in desk at Heathrow Airport explodes, follows. Kate: &quot;Well, this name here is Dennis Hutch, isn't it? See?&quot; Dirk: &quot;Oh, yes. Yes I do. Er, should I know that name?&quot; Kate: &quot;Well, it depends if you're alive or not, I suppose. He's the head of the Aries Rising Record Group. Less famous than the Pope, I grant you, but--you know of the Pope, I take it?&quot; Dirk: &quot;Yes, yes. White haired chap.&quot; Kate: &quot;That's him. He seems to be the only person of note this envelope hasn't been addressed to at some time. Here's Stan Dubcek, the head of Dubcek, Danton, Heidegger, Draycott. I know they handle the ARRGH! account.&quot; Dirk: &quot;The--?&quot; Kate: &quot;ARRGH! Aries Rising Record Group Holdings. Getting that account made the agency's fortunes.&quot; The entire book is full of these crazy, yet meaningful conversations. Put together, they make for a very good mystery, and a humorous one at that (yes, the conversation about the dirty refrigerator does have meaning, the first one with his secretary). Perhaps the greatest achievement of this book is the skill at which Douglas Adams creates situations that show how stupid humans can be, and how callous we are. Although there is not nearly as much of this as in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (also very funny) series, the ideas make you think, the universal trademark of a great book. They can be hard to identify, but they are there, if one looks hard enough. The above is why I like this book. It has real meaning, and it is very entertaining to read, something that can not be said of many books. I can honestly say that there is nothing that I dont like about this book. I would recommend it to anyone, especially to those who have a sense of humor that has been dulled by the daily routine of life. They will benefit most."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"While I agree with the consensus that the story is, indeed, humorous, convoluted, completely interconnected, and ultimately a confusing but inspired delight, there are plenty of reviews to that effect, so I shall narrow my focus to the specific format in which I purchased it, which is the Abridged Audio CD edition, read by the author, on which there are many fewer comments.There are a few minor complaints about this edition. The six CDs packaged in a box of the size that, a decade ago, was used for double CDs, is novel, but the spindles hold the CDs to the tray so tightly that, removing them, one feels as if something's about to snap. The dynamic range is so great that, with any background noise at all (such as may be expected if listening in the car), the loud parts must be quite loud in order for the quiet parts to be heard. Though the cover boasts digital mastering, some high-end digital artifacts can be heard, the background squiggly sounds that one might hear in an audio stream at low dialup speeds. And, as in the case of the &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; audiobook, each disc contains only a single track of around 70 minutes. That last may pose a problem for listeners whose players return to the beginning of the track when stopped (luckily for me, my car player resumes where it left off); otherwise, these are, as I've said, minor issues.On the positive side, it is a great pleasure to hear Adams' voice reading his own work. He may have been a careful and crafty writer, but he also wrote in style often closer to speech than to literate prose. There are a few bits of wordplay that work better when seen on the page; but, on the other hand, his multiple-appositive sentences are much easier to sort out when one can actually hear where the emphasis was intended.I am not, generally, a fan of audiobooks -- not an opponent, either, but I do prefer the speed and lack of distraction of sitting down to read print. However, when there's time to listen, such as on the road trip for which I bought it, this particular book (and the book to which it is a sequel) is at least as enjoyable when read aloud by this particular reader as when I previously read the paperback. The sum of my experience -- which weighs the unimpressive format against the delight of Adams' performance, and, of course, of the story itself -- is well-represented by a solid four stars."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Humans only use about 10% of their brain power. Ever wonder what the other 90% is used for? Douglas Adams answers this and other random facts of life in this novel. Norse gods vs. lawyers, an opening sentence about the futility of airports, harmless explosions and green monsters hiding behind a molecule are all a part of this, one of Adams better novels.The only detractions from this novel are the occasionally confusing plot and the end which does not quite satisfy in the manner that the beginning did. Overall this novel will make you laugh, which is all you would expect, or want, of Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Whatever you do, do not read this book in public; you could get taken away by two men in white coats who did not realize the fit you are having is just uncontollable laughter."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This is the first book by Douglas Adams that I've read and it won't be the last. The book starts out with a big explosion, which brings us to the main characters Kate, Dirk, Thor, and Odin. Kate was brought into the story by the explosion because almost seconds before she was trying to help Thor buy a ticket to Oslo. Thor is the son of Odin who acts like a child. Dirk is a private detective working on a case that deals with the gods. The book was hilariously funny, the deranged eagle, the street light thing, and Thor being glued to the floor were some of the more amusing things. Adams is a great author, who has a great vocabulary and an imaginative mind, but he writes kind of confusing so you have to read it more than once to get every detail."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"The story opens with an explosion at Heathrow Airport. This introduces the female main character Kate Schechter trying to find the Norwegian man she met there just before the explosion. At the same time, Dirk Gently gets involved in that case. He, as a private detective, firstly wants to find out what has happened to his ex-secretary Janice Smith. Soon, while the plot is unfolding, the Norse gods become the main theme because their power has decreased in modern society. So, one of the gods makes a contract with two human beings in order to be able to enjoy human comfort although he loses his immortal soul. As Dirk Gently believes in the &quot;fundamental interconnectedness of all things&quot;, it all makes sense in the end.Douglas Adams does not hand you the answer on a silver platter, though, so that some parts have to be reread.The single events of the storyline are unpredictable, which makes the book so exciting, and the reader is guided by Kate and Dirk.With great skill the author changes the levels of language where necessary and uses his English sense of humour. In the end, Dirk and Kate have improved their knowledge about the workings of the universe. What I liked best while reading were the various lines of action."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"It pains me to write it, but this book was bad. I thoroughly enjoy most of Douglas Adams' work especially the Hitchhiker's series. Unfortunately, he missed the mark with this book. I personally believe Adams wanted this book to be very funny, ala, the Hitchhiker books (others disagree), since it was: strike one. The storyline was quite complex, which would be fine, but I'm not 100% certain this is what Adams was trying to do: strike two. Finally, Dirk Gentry just is not equal to Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect (Hitchhiker's main characters) in terms of full, colorful characters, the final strike. Maybe it was my high expectations after reading the Hitchhiker series, which I found incredibly entertaining at 14, 24 and 34 years of age (for different reasons)."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Douglas Adams is amazingly whimsical. If the Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy didn't convince you of that, the Dirk Gently novels will. Gently is a detective, but no Sherlock Holmes. No, rather than ruling out the impossible to leave only the improbable, Gently prefers to believe the impossible, because it makes so much more sense than the improbable. He solves his case through ingenuity, luck, and a belief in the interconnectedness of all things.A highlight for me is Dirk's method of finding directions. He just follows someone who looks like they know where they are going. This, he says, doesn't always get him to where he wanted to go, but almost always gets him to where he needs to be. If only we all had such faith!This book is the second of two about the private eye. I don't want to give away too much of the story, as it is definitely a mystery, but it covers some of the same ground as American Gods in a much less sinister manner. Everything has a reason and a rhyme in this book, even if at first encounter, an event makes no sense, neither to the characters nor the reader. While the ending is a bit abrupt for my taste, if you like whimsy, you'll get an ample helping with this book."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I love Douglas Adams's books. I reread them regularly and I'm sorry he isn't around to write more of them. This isn't his best, the plot is aimless, as if he started with a good idea and then didn't know where to go. It ends suddenly, as if the author gave up or couldn't figure a way out.I still love all Douglas Adams's works, just don't read this one as often as the others."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This was the first book I read by Douglas Adams, after hearing about his famous Hitchhiker's Guide and only being able to find this one at my local library. The story onfolds as Heathrow Airport explodes just adding to our protagonist Kate Schechter's ridiculously bad luck. She then goes on a search trying to find the tall burly Norwegian man she just met before the explosion. Meanwhile, Dirk Gently; our private investigator begins to investigate the case of the exploding airport. The story keeps unfolding until we are immersed by the Norse Gods whose power and notoriety has diminished in the modern world. This book kept me interested through out the whole story. It also got me hooked on Adams's other novels."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This book definitely proved not to be a disappointment as a sequel. This book maintained the same sarcastic humor and odd coincidences that seem to fit in an extremely insane way. It dealt a lot more with gods and science fiction type stuff, so if the first book proves too sci-fi for you, don't even bother with the second. This book has definitely convinced me to paruse for more books by Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Summary:Unlike Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, this book focuses much more on Dirk Gently and his 'detective' efforts. Dirk is hired by Geoff Anstey to do 'something' relating to Mr. Anstey's contract selling his soul to a demon from another dimension. When Dirk remembers that he is supposed to be helping Geoff Anstey and heads towards his home he ends up finding Mr. Anstey's head separated from his body. As are all things in Dirk Gently's world, this job is interconnected with the bolt of lightening that destroyed a service desk at Heathrow airport a few days before. As it turns out, a disgruntled potential passenger who turns out to be the Norse god Thor was so upset by the mistreatment he was receiving that he called a bolt of lightning from the sky to destroy the service desk (a very literal 'act of god'). Though Thor was frustrated by the airline employee, Kate Schechter, an American journalist, actually tried to help him out leading to him wanting her help later on. Well, Kate and Dirk are sucked into a an adventure revolving around the selling of the Norse gods power by their king, Odin, to an advertising executive and a lawyer that happen to live next door to Geoff Anstey. Everything is interconnected in Douglas Adams novels.My Comments:The book is hilarious (though not quite as funny as the Hitchiker's Guide). I liked the fact that the focus was on Dirk Gently and we were even more exposed to his bizarre antics. Also, though it is never actually specified, it is hard to distinguish whether or not this book takes place before or after the first book in the series (I believe it takes place before). The only thing I felt was left unresolved, though Adams's resolutions are typically one to two pages and sometimes leaving you wanting, was what happened to Geoff Anstey's son who was spellbound and remarkably violent in his TV watching. Perhaps it was just meant to be funny, but it seemed like it should have more of a role in the book. Other than that small distraction, the book actually tends to stay mostly on track (other than Kate's trip to the mental hospital and the characters she meets there).As is the case with most of Adams's work, if you like it, you like it. And, I would submit, this could actually be a good introductory book for someone that would like to become familiar with Adams's work. Great book; lots of fun."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago and all my friends who were technical writers liked it.

Whereas the Hitchhiker ultimately disappointed in the last book, Dirk seems to improve and increase. Why Douglas has neglected him since then I wish I knew! There is an odd disjointed beauty in the overall structure, details such as the mental ward Dirk visits, the mystery of Harold Bell, the truck driver followed by a lovesick rain cloud stick in the mind. I found the tape version cleared up some of the more British details (the eagle with RAF marks on its wings, for example) without distracting from the whole. The only writer who seems to whet my appetite for more Adams isthe Japanese Haruki Murakami, who may have drunk from the same spring as Adams. But its not the same! Will Dirk ever solve the mystery of what happened to Fenchurch, from Hitchhikers?

Very close premise, except with Greek Gods."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Audio can be a wonderful way to experience the Douglas Adams aura. This sequel is much better than its precursor. Dirk Gently is funny and bizarre, yet oh so seriously English. Funny."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"A reader of this book could easily get lost in Douglas Adams' unrelenting British dry humor and overlook the touching tragedy in his brilliant tale about immortal gods who have been cast aside, ignored and all but forgotten by their vapid subjects. His characters spend their time stumbling down a bouncing high-wire, teetering between silliness and profundity. Just when they seem in danger of plummeting off one side or the other, the author pulls them back and sends them down another plot twist that at first seems absurd and then seems absurd that it's all beginning to make sense. Adams has an ability to at once convey both the complexity and the insanity of the post-quantum physics world. This is a book which will help us understand why Einstein always had that bizarre, far-away look in his eyes. Einstein had caught a glimpse of the true nature of the universe -- and so will the reader of this extraordinary story"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"When Dirk Gently, not-so-master-detective, is on the case, who know what can happen? The story opens with an explosion in an airport. This introduces the female lead character and basis of the story. While moving through the story you learn that the old Norse Gods were actually real, but as their human believers dwindled, their powers became less and less. As a large scam between the most powerfull god, a human lawer, and an advitiser rocks the world of the gods, Dirk Gently must smooth everything out, or else the balence between the God's world and the human world will tip, and the angry Gods will run amuck!While this story is supremely written, a couple parts need to be reread a couple times so you can follow the story line. Adam's familiar humor and observations are just a prevalent, and just as funny as always. If you like this twisted story line as a break from all the other predictable Fantasies, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I did not enjoy this one as much as &quot;Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency&quot;. I do have to say that Douglas Adams is an incredible writer and I have enjoyed all of his books. His has a wonderful sense of humor and is very intelligent, and it shows through in his Dirk Gently series. Like the first book, the story starts out with several story lines developing and slowly coming together for a climactic ending. It's up to Dirk Gently to solve the mystery of his late clients death and the mysterious explosion in London's Heathrow Airport that was deemed an &quot;act of God&quot;. I was left feeling rather dissatisfied by the ending. I didn't understand why some things happened that did, and was left feeling confused and unfulfilled. However, I do not think that this is because of the book itself, but rather that perhaps I didn't devote the attention to this book that it deserves and requires. It has a very intricate plot and was very thought provoking. I will be re-reading this book to better my understanding of it, and I would love to see more of Dirk Gently in the future."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Although the HitchHiker's series was good, this novel truly surpasses all of Adams' other works. &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot; is far more suttle than most of his other books, and it contains some truly classic moments. I especially enjoyed the bit about the eagle. This is BY FAR THE FUNNIEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. If you don't have it, get it."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I love Douglas Adams, and I love to hear his recordings of his books.I like The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul well enough to have worn out my audio tapes.I bought the CD version, but disk 6 is a messed up recording.

If I had to summarize the plot of this book in three sentences, I would say that...It's a really funny sequel to Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. This continues Dirk's adventures with new characters both from our world and Norse mythology. It's like mythology/mystery/comedy.2.) The main themes in this book include...Some themes in this book related to Kate are alienation and her search for perfection because she keeps moving and doesn't really have a home.3.) These themes relate/don't relate to my life because...I don't think these really relate to my life because I have only moved once and I was one year old. I don't really feel alienated.4.)The main character of the story could be described as...eccentric...because...his actions are sometimes baffling and he does not act like most people.5.) I would describe the author's writing style as...humorous. One quote from the book that illustrates this is...\\"It can hardly be a coincidence that no language on Earth has ever produced the expression 'As pretty as an airport.'\\"6.) My favorite scene was where...Dirk was talking to Sally Mills...because..the things he was saying were absurd and she was acting as if they were having a normal conversation.7.)

This book is ok, but it isn't his best work. It still has that distinct Adams feel, but it just isn't quite the same. It is definitely a different way of looking at the world. Still overall a great book. You can't go wrong with Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I love this book, would give it a 5, but it is a book club edition and NOT a first edition."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This book, unless London Pizza of the time, was delivered warmish, brand new and in a cardboard box directly to my home where I may turn page by page while lounging on the couch.

It arrived way ahead of schedule and in time for Christmas gift giving."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Absolutely hilarious. Douglas Adams was a genius of the absurd - how I miss his wonderful mind. If your sense of humor is even a little bit twisted you should love this."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I know that I read \\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\\", but that was a long time ago, and while I remember that I enjoyed it, I don't remember any details about the story. So, in a sense, I was getting to meet this character again for the first time. Dirk Gently is not your ordinary private detective. For one thing, he believes that things that can't possibly happen are far more likely to actually happen than those that are merely improbable. And the events that occur around him seem to corroborate that position. The story here, such as it is, involves the dual mysteries of a mysterious beheading (attributed to suicide by the local police!) and an explosion at an airline ticket counter, which is labeled an \\"act of God\\", which it indeed was. As Dirk stumbles blindly, hoping that he'll stagger his way into solving these mysteries, he finds himself drawn into a divine conflict between the old Norse gods, who find themselves irrelevant in a world that no longer believes in them.This book seems to serve mostly as a vehicle for some slapstick humor and absurdly comical scenes, but really fails to provide a compelling narrative. The conclusion feels a bit forced and some elements of the story seem to just be tacked on as a whim, without really adding anything to the story. The result is a moderately entertaining light read, but not nearly as satisfying at the \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", which provided some deeply biting satire to leaven the story."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"In this book we follow Dirk Gently on another crazy adventure. This is the second book in the series, the first beingDirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. I'd recommend to read the books in the correct order (I think the character introduction of Dirk Gently is better in the first book). Also, the story here seems to me to be a bit more complex than the first one.If it's your first book from this author, don't take this one. Then the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is the one you want (witch is also a series consisting of 5 books). If, after reading that, you've become a fan, then the Dirk Gently-series is definitely for you!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Beautifully written.Many surprises and twists will keep the pages turning.\\"Father said you should stick to the ground\\".Good line.Strong secondary characters."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This book, and its predecessor &quot;Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, are heavily under-rated due to the major success of the Hitch Hiker &quot;trilogy&quot; by Douglas Adams. But in a way, they're the better ones. Especially this one.I won't bother telling the story, because frankly I cannot. Now, I've been reading this book in about monthly intervals for years, but I still find something new each time, and I still have trouble keeping track of the story. Don't let that keep you, though. Yes, it *is* mildly confusing, but it all works out after a couple of times of reading, and it's great fun from first time, page one. Besides, it's worth the effort: there's many a topic for an evening of thinking in there.But that's not what you buy it for.Then there's the business of the Norse Gods walking the Earth, just like your average John Smith. Sort of. Thor naturally makes more of a nuisance of himself, but anyway, the notion of everything that the human race ever chose to believe in being true, and staying true long after we've ceased to need it to be true as well, is an astonishingly moving one. &quot;Immortals was what you wanted, and immortals was what you got&quot;, complains one of them bitterly. And rightly so. What would you do if you were an immortal, omnipotent being whom no-one believes in anymore? Chances are, you'd sell your immortal soul to appear in a soft-drink commercial. Once you accept the fantasy part of it, it all snaps in place with logical precision, and even going to Asgard becomes an accepted way to spend the evening.But that's also not what you buy it for.The most outstandingly entertaining thing about the book is, of course, the humour, which is more like what you buy it for. Douglas Adams is an expert for making a pun in a couple of words and leave you laughing longer, and louder, than many other humourists could in an entire page. The incredible lightness of it all is only apparent if you ever tried to write humourous stuff yourself, and thus know how hard that is. No wonder that there are so precious few books from this author. And no wonder that many try to emulate him, and fail.Still, this isn't entirely comedy, and that's a good thing, too. Yes, the Hitch Hiker books give a couple of insights into Life, the Universe and Everything as well -- but the Gently books give more of it, and more practically applicable examples of it, even to those of you who know where their towels are.One of my favourite examples is the way that one of the (mortal) key characters, Kate Schechter, explains how her name is spelled: &quot;Two E's, two C's, two H's, and also a T, an R and an S. Provided they're all there, the bank won't be fuzzy about the order they come in -- they never seem to know themselves.&quot; Okay, it's funny, but there's more to it than that: it's the kind of humour you can only really understand with a name like hers -- or mine --, which makes me wonder how someone with an instantly spellable name like Douglas Adams, of all people, found out about it.All in all, this is everything you could want: Hugely entertaining, but in an intelligent way, and not boring however many times you take to it. A must-have-read!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Most people seem to prefer the more obvious slapstick of the early Hitchhiker's books, but I've found myself enjoying Adams more and more as he's matured. Many of the situations in this book are outrageous and silly, and there are plenty of the one-liners that are Adams' trademark (&quot;It can hardly be a coincidence that no language on earth has ever produced the expression 'As pretty as an airport,'&quot; the book begins) but there are very few passages intended solely for the purpose of eliciting a laugh. Everything's integral to the story, and it all makes sense in the end, although Adams doesn't hand you the answer on a silver platter. This novel is part social commentary, part Rubik's Cube (how DO those piecses fit together, anyway?), and part humor. It took me several re-readings to get the bit about the concentric circles on the eagle's wings, but it was worth it. If you enjoy exercising your mind through the contemplation of the absurd, you'll enjoy reading -- and re-reading -- &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul.&quot"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"A check-in counter at London's Heathrow Airport spontaneously explodes in a ball of flame, and is ruled by the authorities as &quot;an act of God.&quot; As it turns out, the explosion was an act of *a* god---Thor, the God Of Thunder, trying to catch a plane to Oslo, Norway. But why would an almighty god be trying to catch a plane flight in the first place? Enter holistic detective Dirk Gently to solve the mystery....The second and, sadly, final &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; book written by the late, great Douglas Adams, &quot;The Long Dark Tea Time Of The Soul&quot; is a hysterically funny book, and a major improvement over the decent but unspectacular first book, &quot;Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,&quot; which certainly had it's funny moments, but was too long (and long-winded) and confusing. This time around, Adams' writing is a LOT sharper &amp; funnier, and he keeps the book excellently paced. And the character of Dirk Gently really grows here---he's much more concise and focused, and he doesn't ramble on and on about his philosophical views &amp; methods of detective work as he did in the first book. &quot;Long Dark Tea Time&quot; contains many outrageously funny scenes---Dirk's dilemma with his old refridgerator, and his surprising encounter with a young boy watching TV are both particularly memorable---and great characters, too, not only Dirk Gently but also the spunky American girl Kate Schechter, Thor the hot-headed God Of Thunder, and the vile creature named Toe Rag. The story is clever, moves along nicely, and, if I haven't made it clear enough, is very, very funny.I'm saddened that Douglas Adams never got around to writing a third &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; book, as I would've loved to have read further adventures of this most oddball of detectives. But at least Adams wrote a pair of them, and &quot;The Long Dark Tea Time Of The Soul&quot; is a fabulously hilarious book that can proudly sit right alongside Adams' very best &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; books, in particular volumes 1, 2 and 4. &quot;The Long Dark Tea Time Of The Soul&quot; is classic Douglas Adams all the way."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Kate Schechter should have taken the signs the universe was trying to give her. That's what she tells herself as she shows up at the airport for a trip to Norway in spite of all the warnings. Still, she is unprepared for the check in desk to be blown through the roof just after she misses her flight.Meanwhile, Dirk Gently has hit a low. He has almost no money and no clients. Except the one he's forgotten about who promptly gets himself killed. Now Dirk feels responsible for not taking this guy's claims serious and wants to track down the green eyed monster. As if that weren't enough, he and his cleaning lady are having a war over who will open his fridge first, an out of order soda machine keeps appearing and disappearing, and he's being stalked by an eagle. What these seemingly unrelated events have to do with each other provides plenty of wacky entertainment.I am still only mildly familiar with the books of Douglas Adams, and I simply must correct that. This fantasy novel was wonderfully strange and entertaining. The opening bits about the airport and Kate's trip had me laughing out loud. The laughs slowed down over the course of the book, but they were still plentiful. Maybe it's my normal reading of mysteries, but my only real complaint was an ending that was really more confusing then enlightening of what had gone on before.Actually, I listened to the audio version of this book, read by the author. These can be hit or miss, depending on the author. Douglas Adams did an exceptional job of reading, throwing just the right tones and inflections in for the best effect. About the only complaint on this part was that the scene changes were so sudden and abrupt that it could confuse you for a few seconds even when you're paying attention.Whether you get your hands on the audio version of stick with the traditional print version, this is a wonderful title sure to entertain. I must move more of his books higher up my to be read pile."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"This is a great book by Douglas Adam's - a work of certifiable genius. My one star review is not for the book itself - which is excellent - but for the poor release of this CD set. Read on for an explanation...Beware when ordering this 6-CD edition by New Millenium Audio. There is a problem with CD 6 - something went wrong with the mastering process and some of the passages are repeated 2 or 3 times (the bit where Thor & Kate meet the old lady in a shack) - which means that you end up missing the last couple of chapters of the original book!This is a terrible mistake by the publisher and ruins the ending, because the whole of it is missing thanks to an error which should have been spotted.I have 2 copies of this set, and they both have the same mastering problem, which leads me to assume that it is not an isolated case.Buyer beware!Hopefully, a new version will appear eventually which sorts this out."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I just wanted to add (to all of the other reviews) that, while the Dirk Gently books may not be as hilarious as the Hitchhiker's book (and at times verge toward drama), I would say they are much more interesting.

Fascinating."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"I truly enjoyed reading Douglas Adams' \\"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul.\\" That is, right until I finished it. Up to that point, I had been prepared to give it at least a 4 star rating. But, the ending just fizzles. Perhaps it does more than fizzle. It just disappears. Instead of an ending that would tie everything up nicely and cleverly like everything else in the book, Adams ends the book at the last minute by, basically, throwing up his hands and quitting. All he needed was a couple more pages where he could have dumped the \\"Hot Potato\\" into the lap of the responsible parties and all would have been well. Instead, he just... stops. The ending reminds me of how badly he destroyed the Hitchhiker series with the miserableMostly Harmless. I'm so angry with the ending that I'd like to rate the book at 1 star. But, rationally, I really enjoyed 99.9% of the book. So, I'm splitting the difference and rating it at an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD or track names. Nor will any CD player that can show track names.2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD."},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"Like it's predecessor, &quot;Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot; demands a second reading. It's complex, often confusing, but never less than amusing. Both books display Douglas Adams' verbal wit, which will remind most of his ever-popular &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; books, but are more concerned with their labyrinthine and well-structured plots. And both books offer an ending that may not make sense if the reader hasn't been paying close (and I mean CLOSE) attention. The main difference between the two is that while the ending of the former was obscure *and* painstakingly logical, the ending here feels contrived and illogical. Like a good mystery novel, the reader should have been able to see it coming given the clues presented. In &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; this was true; it necessitated some research to fathom, but with enough effort the reader could make sense of things. Here, not so much.That's not to say that &quot;Tea-Time&quot; is a pointless endeavor. It is, after all, a Douglas Adams novel. And now that the man is gone, we should cherish everything he's ever written. In their own ways they're all gems. This gem, however, has less of a sheen.Once again, Dirk Gently is asked to save the world. Or rather, he's asked to not screw it up so much. He's a detective who believes in the interconnectedness of everything. This point is only sporadically touched on here, but is relayed at great length in the previous book. Pity, because Adams has constructed a narrative whose tentacles dip into a myriad of different subjects and storylines, all for the most part unrelated. But he does draw them all together, seemingly against their will, in the end. The drawback, then, is that the book becomes less a cohesive novel than a collection of eclectic ideas. I'd have loved to see how Adams further involved the electric I Ching calculator (a favourite tool of the Electric Monk maybe?) in the story. But alas it comes and goes all too quickly. The same can be said for The Great Zaganza, a horoscope writer who puts private joke messages to Dirk directly in each day's newspaper. Or Elena, the wayward maid, who's locked in a battle of wills with Dirk to see who will open his refrigerator first (Why? I'll never tell). These are all wonderful ideas, pregnant enough for a whole chapter (or a whole book) in Adams' hands, but nearly wasted here. Thankfully, there are enough of them to make a mild mosaic of mystery on which the narrative balances.The book shares one of its main themes with Terry Pratchett's &quot;Small Gods&quot;. This is not the first time I've favourably compared Adams to Pratchett, and vice versa. I suspect if you like the wicked wit and playful literary structures of one, than you'll adore the other just as much. Adams relies less on puns than Pratchett, and more on cultural mythology, but they were equally adept at deconstructing popular images to their own ends.Before treading here I recommend a bit of research first. Read the first &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; book. Since Adams doesn't repeat his introduction and explanation of the main character, those unfamiliar with him will find Dirk's methods baffling. They are explained fully, just not here. Also, it might be a good idea to brush up on your Norse mythology before entering. No need to go too deep, just a trip to Valhalla will do. And finally, remember this: pay attention to everything. Nothing is accidental here. Everything matters. Everything is connected. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul","review":"A fortune teller too accurate for his own good, a refridgerator full of loathing, a god with an identity crisis and a dead record company executive... There's no doubt this book has it all! And this audio version even has the voice of the master author himself.Douglas Adams was a brilliant author who upon his death not only left us with a brilliant body of work, but a body of work he'd read into audio form. As a BBC veteran, Douglas' reading style adds to the listening experience since you're not only listening to a brilliant oration, but an oration with all the author-intended pauses and inflections. This audiobook is one such example of Douglas Adam's read-by-author brilliance.Considering that in addition to the radio play versions, for some reason the Hitchhiker's audiobooks are being re-released read by a different narrator, I'd snatch up this read-by-author CD version while I still can. At least that's what I did!SPECIAL NOTE: IT'S UNABRIDGED!!! If you're like me, you did a view of the box cover and heart sank when it said \\"Abridged.\\" Fortunately, that is not the case! So you get the full unabridged glory of this Douglas Adams masterpiece.SPECIAL NOTE II: I too just ran into the problems with the last CD. Having listened to the audiobook on cassette years ago. it never occured to me that such a mistake could be made.

But somehow, this little book sums it all up in a nutshell. In other words, a quick, easy read! After all, who has the time these days to read a 500 page tome or listen to tapes for 30+ days on how to think positively? Not only that, the author has presented the valuable lessons of a rewarding life in a most delightful way. The parable begins with a little turtle who stumbles one day and ends up on his shell facing life upside down. Although, in his eyes his fate appears to be doomed, he soon learns to see things from another perspective at this new angle. He see things he never saw before -- treetops, clouds, butterflies, mountains, etc. During the time he is in this uncomfortable situation, however, he gains an abundance of knowledge and insight about what is most important in life. Situations he took for granted and accepted as truth in the past are now seen in a new and more positive light. I LOVED the story and highly recommend it for young and old alike. No need to buy tons of self help books any longer ---this one says it all. I bought a copy for my 25 year old son for Christmas and plan to buy more as gifts for family and friends this year."},{"Title":"Lessons of the Turtle","review":"This was one wonderful book.

However, he also has the distinction of being the first famous UFO \\"debunker\\", and he used his contacts within the US government and scientific community to discourage any attempt to treat the UFO phenomenon seriously. In Menzel's view, UFOs were \\"pseudoscientific nonsense\\" and a \\"space-age myth\\". In 1953 he wrote the first-ever UFO \\"debunking\\" book, \\"Flying Saucers\\", in which he attempted to provide prosaic explanations for every major UFO sighting since 1947.In his second UFO Book, \\"The World of Flying Saucers\\", Menzel offers new explanations for UFO sightings covered in his 1953 book, and he also covers most of the UFO incidents of the fifties and early sixties. Recent research by UFO historians has revealed that Menzel was actually strangely obsessed with \\"flying saucers\\", and also obsessed with humiliating or even threatening anyone who held a different view of UFOs from his own. James Moseley, who has skeptically covered the UFO phenomenon since the fifties, writes in his memoirs that he received playful, detailed drawings from Menzel of \\"Martians\\" and UFO \\"crewmen\\" cavorting with naked alien girls! Edward Ruppelt, a USAF Captain who supervised the Air Force's famed \\"Project Blue Book\\" investigation into the UFO mystery in the early fifties, wrote that in a 1952 meeting Menzel claimed to have \\"all the answers\\" regarding the UFO mystery, but when several scientists openly challenged Menzel's conclusions that all UFOs were hoaxes, mirages, or temperature inversions, Menzel at first \\"hedged his answers\\" and finally \\"blew his stack\\" and stormed out of the room. In 1949 Menzel had his own UFO sighting, which he reported to the Air Force. In his three UFO books, however, Menzel claimed to have \\"solved\\" the sighting as a \\"reflection of the Moon off of haze\\". However, UFO historian Jerome Clark has argued that Menzel actually changed the facts of his own sighting in order to \\"explain\\" it, and that the details of the sighting he gave in his original AF report don't match his descriptions of the incident listed in his books years later.In \\"The World Of Flying Saucers\\" Menzel does create the \\"blueprint\\" which would be followed by nearly all UFO debunkers, from the 1960's to the present day. Menzel describes the UFO phenomenon as a \\"myth of the space age\\" - much as witches and fairies were the \\"myths\\" of earlier historical eras. According to Menzel, all UFO reports are explainable as hoaxes, mirages, weather balloons, or some other \\"conventional\\" phenomena. What is particularly striking about this book is that Menzel approaches every UFO case not with the objective eye and open mind of a true scientist, but with the utterly close-minded assumption that, since UFOs can't possibly exist, any prosaic explanation, no matter how far-fetched, is better than admitting that a case is \\"unsolved\\" or \\"unexplained\\". A few examples will illustrate the main thrust of Menzel's debunking approach: in his examination of the Nash-Fortenberry case of 1952, in which two Pan American Airline pilots spotted six strange objects flying in formation over Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, Menzel at first claimed the pilots had seen \\"city lights reflecting off haze, clouds, or humidity\\". When weather records clearly showed that there was no haze, clouds, or other inversion-causing weather, an undaunted Menzel claimed that the two pilots had actually been fooled by fireflies trapped between the panes of glass in their cockpit! When Dr. James McDonald, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Arizona and a prominent Menzel critic, pointed out the absurdity of such a claim, Menzel responded by calling McDonald a \\"pseudoscientist\\" and a \\"crank\\" - without ever specifically responding to McDonald's criticisms of his explanation.In \\"The World of Flying Saucers\\", Menzel offers several completely different explanations for the Kenneth Arnold UFO case. Arnold, a successful businessman and private pilot, spotted nine \\"flying disks\\" in Washington State in 1947, and the headlines resulting from his story led to the first great wave of UFO sightings in America. Menzel claims that Arnold either saw a \\"mirage\\" or an unusual cloud formation - yet both of these explanations fly in the face of Arnold's testimony. (In his other two books Menzel offers three additional explanations for Arnold's sighting). Menzel refused to do any field research when investigating UFO cases, and he also refused to personally interview the UFO eyewitnesses. Instead, his solutions came almost entirely from sitting in his home or office and examining the testimony and transcripts of UFO sightings, which possibly accounts for the fact that his \\"explanations\\" for UFO cases often run contrary to the testimony of the witnesses and other researchers. Bottom line: Menzel's \\"The World Of Flying Saucers\\" is worth reading for the simple fact that Menzel is still regarded as the \\"godfather\\" of all UFO debunkers. If you read this book you will find that virtually all other UFO debunking books, such as those of Philip Klass, Robert Sheaffer, and Curtis Peebles, have simply copied Menzel's debunking approach. However, if you wish to read a truly scientific and objective approach to the UFO phenomenon, then you'd be well-advised to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Alzheimer's For Dummies","review":"I am the author of this book. I lost my beloved mother and my aunt and another relative to Alzheimer's, so in addition to being an experienced medical writer, I have had heart-wrenching personal experience with this devastating disease.I argued about the title when I was asked to write this book, but eventually the folks at Wiley convinced me that since the Dummies brand is so ubiquitous that people would understand and not take offense. And yet you have taken offense without reading a single word of the book, or knowing anything about the year of research and interviewing I put in to make the book the very best it could be and the easiest to understand.During the writing of this book, I also had to confront all my own buried sorrows and heartbreak about my mother's illness and death, so the entire process was fairly torturous. Yet, I persevered because I believed in the book and hoped it could serve to spread the message about the importance of early intervention and appropriate use of medication for people with AD.The Alzheimer's Association is absolutely wonderful and they do an incredible job; we are blessed with a terrific branch staffed with warm and caring people here in Houston.

Not great literature, but a pleasant read. I can say unequivocally that it exceeded my expectations. If books don't catch my interest in the first 40 pages or so I usually put them aside. This had me within the first five pages. Ms. Grimes has an uncanny ability to set a scene, characters, and capture the oddities and eccentricities of small English village life. The characters are painted broadly, but not too far. Aunt Agatha is the star of the \\"humorous\\" side of the book - I absolutely loved her character. Inspector Jury (this was his first appearance in one of her novels) is a very likable character - you do find yourself wanting more of him in following books. The mystery and murder plot was fine, but not exceptional - but that doesn't really matter. Your joy comes more from the dialogue and characters than plot. As I said, a very pleasant and enjoyable read on a cold winter night with a fire going.

I was quite pleased when I came across this book, helpfully labelled &quot;The First Richard Jury Novel!&quot;, and decided to turn over two new leaves: starting a new series and beginning at the beginning for a change.I found the first couple chapters a bit of tough sledding. Grimes, an American author intent on establishing the setting and tone of an &quot;English Mystery&quot; lays on the Anglicized idioms a bit thick. By about a third of the way through, though, either she laid off or I started to roll with it because I was fully into the story at that point.If you've read her later books, you can probably eliminate quite a few of the suspects on the grounds that they show up later with no mention of being homicidal maniacs. As a first-time-reader I spent a lot of time guessing whodunit (or, rather, hoping someone hadn't done it - &quot;Oh, don't let it be him&quot; and &quot;Oh, don't let it be her&quot;). The ending relies on the knowledge of a bit of English geographic trivia (well, I suppose it's not trivial to the people who live there), but there are a few other clues that savvy sleuths can use to get the job done just as well.While Richard Jury isn't a Poirot, Wimsey, or Dalgliesh (at least not in his first outing), he still is a first-rate literary creation. If you're looking to start a new series of detective fiction, this is a good place to begin.

I'm very glad I did! The Man with a Load of Mischief is a clever, funny little detective novel. It moves at a brisk pace and is packed with interesting clues and red herrings. Most of the characters in the novel are interesting and well sketched. My only complaint is with the character Lady Ardry. I know that she was written to be the most infuriating, annoying character in the story, but I found her to be SO incredibly abrasive that I hated (HATED!) having to read any scenes that involved her. She drove me absolutely batty with her vindictiveness. I remember her being featured fairly prominently in \\"The Case Has Altered\\" as well, so I may have to take her presence into consideration the next time I am thinking of reading a Richard Jury novel."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"My wife has been a fan of the Richard Jury mysteries for some time so I finally decided to give them a try, and this is the first in the series. Chief Inspector Jury, a homicide specialist at Scotland Yard who should have been a Superintendent by now but doesn't want to be relegated to a desk job, is a first-rate detective and something of a loner. He's called to a village in Northamptonshire to deal with two murders committed a week apart, each in a different pub. The mystery itself is pretty well done -- the author doesn't give anything away and the \\"whodunit,\\" when it finally arrives, is perfectly believable -- but Grimes's m&eacute;tier is creating interesting, fully realized characters. There's Jury himself, there's Melrose Plant, a very intelligent ex-earl who lives in the village and who involves himself in the investigation, there's Plant's Aunt Agatha, who's lucky no one has strangled her before this, and there's the hypochondriac Sgt. Wiggins, who sometimes shows a surprising side. Those are the series regulars, or will be. The various suspects -- and there's a lot of them -- are also well thought out and Grimes has a nice ear for the ironic turn of phrase. On top of all that, she slips in some fascinating bits about the history of various public house names, one of which supplies the title of each book in the series. My only complaint is that the author has a sloppy grasp of chronology: Jury is supposed to be about forty years old in the present day (1981), so he was born about 1941 -- but he also is described as having been seven years old when his mother was killed in the last year of the Blitz, which is also 1941."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"Apparently, all the Richard Jury mystery series are being reissued in uniform paperbound editions which will give steady readers a chance to get books earlier in the series that they do not have and newcomers the chance to start at the beginning. To the latter, I can join with the reviewers singing \\"For she's a jolly good fellow\\". Martha Grimes is among the best writing English mysteries today (she is American). She is to be distinguished from other mistresses of the genre by writing relatively short books, unburdened by elaborate psychological depth analysis, with relatively simple plots, and characters who are decent or evil, quirky but recognizable. For this reason, they just fit the bill for someone like me who is usually looking for a mystery to remove me from all too problematic reality.A note of caution She also writes substantial \\"straight\\" novels which, though good reading, are not escapist in intention."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"Luckily for me, this was my first Martha Grimes book so i was introduced to the characters from the very begining.This author has great character development and while the murder and the murder investigation is very well written it plays second fiddle to the lifes of the people in Long Pudd, Scotland yard, and Jury's Appartment building.Throughout the series you will find that Jury has the worst luck with women. Either they are dying, dying to kill themselves, or about to be jailed when they finally hook up with him.Melrose Plant is handsome, titled and rich and is a perfect Robin to Jury's Batman.Betwixt the two you know they will solve the case, it may be after another 5 or 10 people are dead, but they will get the one.One thing about Martha Grimes' Mysteries is she never gives you all the answers.

I much prefer the characters in Elizabeth Peters series of Amelia Peabody mysteries about Egypt, or the Rumpole series by John Mortimer."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"In her Richard Jury/Melrose Plant series of mysteries, Martha Grimes has developed an ensemble cast who play the same role, but with different levels of involvement from book to book. As one works his way through these mystery novels, all the members of the ensemble take on lives of their own. Another reviewer has stated that, in later novels, this being the first in the series, they become stereotypes. It is my opinion that they merely stay in character. This is not to say however that they don't show growth and appropriate change with time and circumstance. They do.One should know that the name of this book, THE MAN WITH A LOAD OF MISCHIEF, is the name of an English pub where part of the action takes place. This approach is taken in all of the novels in this series. (18 to date covering over 20 years of writing)Although any one of these novels can be read in any order, this one gives more character background than any of the others. (I read it after having already read 16 others and it didn't hurt my comprehension of the others a bit.) Each novel has an interesting and entertaining plot. That said, what really distinguishes Ms Grimes' writing is the humor and local color she evokes through the antics, interrelationships, and subplots involving the various members of her cast of characters. There are over a dozen of them and each is fully realized with personalities, weaknesses and strengths, likes and dislikes, and friends and enemies.The plot here involves the murder of strangers visiting the English town of Long Piddleton. In order to solve the mystery of the murders, it is first necessary to determine whether the murders were the random work of some madman, or if they were somehow related in a way that is not apparent. That is the gist of the plot.The ensemble consists of 12 to 18 characters whose importance tends to vary from novel to novel. In this, and most of the others, Detective Chief Inspector Richard Jury of New Scotland Yard, his assistant, the hypochondriacal Sergeant Wiggins, and his newfound friend in Long Piddleton, Melrose Plant, the former Lord Ardry are the key participants (Melrose is the former Lord Ardry because he didn't want the title of Earl and so renounced it.)There are a great number of players at the next tier and each is important in his own right. Some provide a real touch of humor, and others contribute to the main plot, but all combine to make this book what it is.I must digress here and give a short description of Melrose Plant's Aunt Agatha - Lady Ardry - Lady because she happened to marry Melrose's titled uncle. She is an American and is enamored of the concept of being titled. Picture, if you will, a rather rotund late middle-aged woman who wears a cape, pushing open a door with no regard as to who or what might be on the other side, wielding a silver cane, like a sword, shoving aside anyone who happens to be between her and her destination. As often as not, her destination is a tray of cakes, tarts, and other sweets which she demands as her due at her nephew's home. After eating them all, she complains because there are no more, and on her way out pilfers Melrose's late mother's diamond ring, or a precious jade carving, or some other valuable item. Later she will wear the jewelry or display the stolen object in front of Melrose with no sense of shame. How Melrose handles this with humor and a shrug of his shoulders is an example of Ms. Grimes tongue in cheek manner.Another character we come to know and love is Cyril The Cat who loves to torment Jury's Superior (in rank only) and always outwits him.There are more, lots more.So if one likes mystery with a liberal sprinkling of humor THE MAN WITH A LOAD OF MISCHIEF might be just what the doctor ordered."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"I've read most of the Richard Jury novels, and it was a real treat to read the first in the series where all the characters are introduced. A number of the characters who later become a bit frozen in their stereotype behaviour are very real in this book-- I think particularly of Vivian and Trueblood-- and it's worth reading if you're a fan just for those points alone.When a series of grisly murders shocks the town of Long Piddleton, Richard Jury of Scotland Yard is sent to investigate. It becomes clear all-too-soon that these were not the acts of a stranger and the small town is in the grip of suspicion and fear as the death toll continues to rise.A satisfying whodunnit that keeps the pages turning."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"The first Inspector Richard Jury and Melrose Plant mystery deals with dark secrets that haunt the village of Long Piddleton, where a series of murders have takenplace. More over, this is where you get to meet all the lovable characters of Grimesdelightful British Mystery series, all named after Brit pubs. Jury is super investigator, but he must deal with the political side of his job, which he doesn't handle in the same deft fashion as he does solving cases. You also meet Melrose Plant, a mutli-titled Peer of the Realm, who has recently given up his titles, a spot on detective himself, though amateur. His dotty, social-climbing American Aunt Agatha Ardry, determined to be British by osmosis - leaching off her dear, long suffering nephew while eating all the faerycakes.

The well plotted, if somewhat overly complex story is a good read, but the real fun is in meeting Melrose Plant, Superintendent Racer (sans cat), Marshall Trueblood, Vivian and Little Pid for the first time. There is an added bonus in that one of the characters is an expert on the history of the strange and exotic names of English country inns. As the afficianado knows, Ms. Grimes has used these names to good effect as titles for the books in her Jury series"},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"I am a Richard Jury fan to the core. I normally like to begin a series by reading the first book written. However, Man with a Load of Mischief was the second book I read by Martha Grimes. Here we are introduced to the main characters that appear throughout the Richard Jury series. Ms. Grimes does a wonderful job of giving her characters life and color. They seem almost real from the wealthy and charming former earl, Melrose Plant to his irritating aunt-by-marriage Agatha. Here we get a glimpse of Marshall Trueblood who owns the antique store and revals in dressing loudly, smoking colored cigarettes and teasing Agatha. Here Jury meets these characters and more for the first time and forms a lasting friendship with Melrose. Here we get the first glimpse into Jury's life where relationships with women are rarely successful for long periods of time. Martha Grimes cleverly mixes murder with humor to produce a very entertaining novel. A true literary success."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"I have read maybe 10 or 12 of Grime's Jury/Plant mysteries in no particular order, and I loved every single one of them. However, I was quite surprised this year that I have been able to reread 2 of them so far (&quot;The Old Silent&quot; and &quot;Man With a Load of Mischief&quot;) and enjoy them as much as the first time! The humor and her perfect timing are as fresh the 2nd time around, and I had honestly forgotten many of her subtle clues.For anyone new to Grimes, she is an absolutely masterful mystery writer. What sets her apart is her focus on a pair of sharp, witty, handsome and ultimately vulnerable 40 year old bachelors, Jury and Plant. Jury and Plant are so endearing in their development - as opposed to a Poroit or Holmes - that you wish you actually knew them or people like them. In fact, you feel like you do know them. Their surrounding cast of characters - Lady Ardry, Vivian, Trueblood, Scroggs, Withersby, Wiggins, Fiona, Mrs. Wasserman, Racer - all heighten your appreciation of the main characters.In this particular book, the first in the series, you get to see Grimes set the stage with all these characters. How does Jury (an inspector with the New Scotland Yard) ever hook up with Plant (a part-time professor who gave up his titles years ago)? Why is Trueblood in Long Pidd? What is Plant and Vivian's history? How do you pronounce Ruthven? What is the deal with the names of pubs in England (a central theme for Grimes)?The basic plotline in this book is that 2 men - strangers to the small village of Long Pidd - have been strangled and left to be discovered in very odd ways. The reason for their murders is so obscure that Scotland Yard gets brought in to help out. After Jury arrives on the scene, however, the murders don't stop. What is the connection between these random people? Will the entire population of the small town be killed off before the murderer is found? Will Jury and Plant become good friends? All these questions are answered as Grimes also masterfully laces her humorous storyline with clues and names that point to solution of these mysterious murders."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"This is a very engaging book. It was lots of fun to be introduced to Long Piddleton and to its assortment of eccentric characters. The plot itself is fairly complex, although not completely difficult to figure out, and it ends with what appears to be an action sequence in the life of the Richard Jury books--in a church, no less!It is interesting to be introduced to Vivian, the femme fatale of Richard Jury, Melrose Plant, etc., in this book. I am not sure that I ocmpletely see the attraction, but that seems to be one of the interesting truths about relationships that comes out in Martha Grimes' books--relationships and attractions have a strength and life of their own."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"It's the first in a series so if you like murder mystery series books it's best to start at the beginning. The characters are a bit sparse though and only two are a tad more fleshed out than the others, Melrose Plant and Richard Jury himself. You'll learn a bit of English pub naming conventions which is an interesting bit of information. The plot is not very plausible but it is mysterious. All the little threads mostly come together at the end but it is a tortuous route."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"This is the first of the Inspector Jury mysteries. My own debut with the series was one of the most recent books, Winds of Change. I enjoyed that greatly, but I found the large cast of characters a bit of a strain on the memory, so I next chose the first of all, expecting to be introduced to the main characters in a systematic way. To some extent I have been, but Ms Grimes doesn't really do systematic introductions. Jury, Melrose Plant and the others ease their way on to the scene rather than make any highlighted entrance. However with another volume in the series behind me I was better attuned to what to expect, and I coped better with the extensive character-list this time.One thing that helped was that so many people in this story are murdered that there are fewer to keep tabs on as the book progresses. Indeed unless I'm mistaken the author herself loses count of exactly how many. Another intriguing feature is that the story has actually two heroes, Jury himself and the elegant aristocratic dilettante Melrose Plant, formerly Viscount this and Baron that before he resigned his titles out of boredom. Otherwise the style is a rather brilliant pastiche of the traditional English whodunit, as practised most famously by Agatha Christie. American spelling is used (vise, gray, fiber, checkbook) but otherwise it would be hard to tell that the author was not another English Rose herself, except for an oddly nonchalant attitude to geography that I had also noticed in Winds of Change - she appears to think that Northamptonshire, which is in the south Midlands, is somewhere in northern England. Like Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle she has a penchant for bachelors as making the best detectives, although there is one solitary reference, never elaborated, to some one called Maggie who haunts Jury's memory, and I have to hope that this was someone who had formed part of his personal life and not the prime minister at the time of the book's creation.The book is light reading, but there are one or two good phrases and more than one or two striking perceptions that suggest to me that Grimes has depths to her that may be more apparent in her other kinds of fiction. The story-line is a genuine page-turner, I found, and the final denouement is an excellent specimen of the over-the-top genre, more familiar these days from detective series on television than from Christie and her generation. The atmosphere evokes the picture-postcard kind of English village, still without ethnic minorities or cut-price housing developments, that Christie's Miss Marple would have recognised, and the place-names are at least a brave attempt at English nomenclature. As far as the dialogue goes, Grimes seems to me to have a very good ear indeed, to the extent that even Plant's American whodunit-writing aunt talks in the general English manner, despite her difficulties with some people's names.This is a more straightforward detective story than the much more recent Winds of Change. The narrative is all focused on the plot-line without diverging into the deeper recesses of Jury's or anyone else's personality and deeper thoughts, although there are a few displays of erudition just to give a distinctive feel to it all. I'd say that a genuine distinctiveness is what I like best about Martha Grimes, so far as I have got to know her by this stage, and it appears likely that she values this quality herself, to judge from the scorn heaped on the derivative efforts of one author in the course of the story. Her large following do not need me to tell them what to look for or what to admire, but for newcomers like myself I would say start at the beginning - with this book. Apart from anything else, I found myself admiring the adeptness with which this American writer has captured a particularly English type of style without affectation or artificiality. If you like this sort of thing, you should find this a fine example of the sort of thing you like."},{"Title":"The Man With a Load of Mischief (The Best Mysteries of All Time)","review":"This is the first Martha Grimes novel. It features Richard Jury and Melrose Plant and the pub: The Man With a Load of Mischief. The book is wonderful. Martha Grimes has a rather unique style of writing, which is all the more improbable since she is an American specializing in the British Mystery Genre.Her Jury/Plant series, with books all named after British Pubs, makes for excellent reading. Although all of her books are excellent, she first introduced us to the town of Long Piddleton in this novel.We are introduced to the denizens of this town after a murder occurs at a local pub. Jury, along with his dutiful sidekick, Sgt. Wiggins, responds to the town and the investigation begins.The mystery is excellent and the novel stands on its own. The fact that this is the start of a spectacular series, makes this a must read. This is one of a very few books that I can re-read again and again.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The pathfinder (The modern readers' series)","review":"For lovers of adventure, pioneer tales, westerns and Cooper's own \\"leatherstocking\\" stories, this one's not bad. Not up to the pacing, depth or vision demonstrated by Cooper in \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", this book nevertheless continues the adventures of the wilderness scout Natty Bumppo (\\"Hawkeye\\" in \\"Mohicans\\" and \\"Pathfinder\\" here). Still the prototype of that strong, silent and simple man of virtue (who finds a higher moral calling in the wilderness among his beloved Indians and far from the zones of civilization whom we met in \\"Mohicans\\"), Natty now seems somewhat older (though not much time appears to have elapsed) and longing, at last, for what he has always eschewed: a place and family of his own. Brought to a lakeside fort (Lake Ontario) at the urging of an old friend who is in charge of running the day to day soldiering at the fort and who desires to play matchmaker between his daughter and Pathfinder, Natty soon finds himself in the midst of intrigue and betrayal on the lake. It is still the time of the French and Indian Wars and the action involves naval activity on the lake and in the Thousand Islands. But Natty soon finds he has competition for the hand of his old friend's daughter in the person of a young naval officer who promptly falls under suspicion because of his French origins. In the end, Pathfinder must get to the bottom of the betrayal while making the noble choice with regard to the fair maiden and his rival for her hand. The action involves a swift \\"sea\\" chase over Ontario and a denoument among the Thousand Islands as Pathfinder and his faithful companion, Chingachgook, seek to protect the small military force in their charge from a French attack which is aided by unknown turncoats in their midst. It's a good story but less powerful, and a good deal more wooden, than \\"Mohicans\\". Natty, himself, seems a might too talkative for the strong silent type he is alleged to be (didn't seem as problematic in the earlier \\"Mohicans\\" as it does here), but there are some good moments including an opening scene where the great forested country is vividly depicted, a fine shooting match at the fort (reminiscent of Scott's knightly tourneys), an exciting chase across the face of the lake and a fine wrap-up when Pathfinder struggles to save the outgunned outpost in his charge. Still this one read better when I was much younger than it does today.Stuart W.

I do not regret my decision. I was unaware when I began reading this book in the Leatherstocking series that it was not the first book in the series. A reader who has not read other books in the series can feel confident that they won't feel lost if they start reading this book. The book portrays very detailed images of the forests, lakes, rivers, and people of the French and Indian War time period during the 18th century. The character development and plot are very well done. The book also gives a glimpse of the harsh realities of war during this time period. The writing style of the book is also fascinating and reminds me, at times, of epic poetry. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The pathfinder (The modern readers' series)","review":"In this, the third Leatherstocking tale chronologically (after Deerslayer and Last of the Mohicans), James Fenimore Cooper takes us, once again, to his vision of pure, unadultered, nature. Once again he weaves a tale around his ideas of morality, race, and religion. This time around Leatherstocking (known here as Pathfinder) is the pursuer of love, whereas before (in Deerslayer) he was the pursued.These three books are the only ones that I have read to this point, and it is true that both this and the Deerslayer are more of romances than the Last of the Mohicans, which is an adventure.Alot of people give the other books in the series flack because they are expecting the same as what they read in Last of the Mohicans. However, if you begin reading the book without those preconcived notions leading to disappointment, I think you will find that the other books are equally entertainingAll three are great books and I highly recommend them all."},{"Title":"The pathfinder (The modern readers' series)","review":"Chronologically speaking, this is the sequal to Last of the Mohicans, though not written in that order. Pathfinder returns us to the Seven Years War in colonial times. A great book, Pathfinder is probably Cooper's most romantic book in its depictions of upstate New York, the most modern of his writing capabilities, and the most active in its depiction of war. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The pathfinder (The modern readers' series)","review":"In the fourth installment of the Leatherstocking Tales, Cooper introduces a nautical theme upon the surface and along the shores of Lake Ontario. The Pathfinder is ultimately a love story tinged with the conspiracy of treason, though it takes no extra-sensory perception to uncover the traitor long before he is exposed in the book. Cap, a grizzled saltwater veteran, accompanies his niece to visit her father stationed at the British outpost of Fort Oswego, NY. Once there, the two become embroiled in the confrontation between England, France, and their Native American allies for control of the lake. Cap is dismissive of landlubbers and \\"freshwater ponds\\", such as he describes Ontario, setting the stage for his mind to be turned by the derring-do of inland waterman, Jasper Western. Indeed, Cap is so outspoken in his contempt for the ways of his new found associates, that he becomes somewhat of an annoyance to the reader. Cooper chose to give the character little in the way of redeeming qualities nearly spoiling the pleasure one takes in Cap's ultimate and grudging respect for the wilderness and the men who master it. Such a thoroughly boorish character simply creates no emotional connection. But, Cap isn't guilty of treason. You'll spot the traitor shortly after he appears.The Pathfinder is formulaic, utterly predictable, and, at times, almost childlike in substance, but throughout, as in all other Leatherstocking Tales, radiates the simple goodness, manly deportment, and rustic charm of Nathaniel Bumppo. Indeed, Bumppo as a character is so masterfully wrought that Cooper could place him in a melon patch for the duration of a book and still manage to eke out a classic. Having previously read The Pioneers, The Last of the Mohicans, and The Prairie, I find The Pathfinder the weaker of the four, but fourth in favor in this wonderful series of stories isn't any black mark. Indeed, it qualifies The Pathfinder as yet another loveable yarn from the pen of James Fenimore Cooper. 4+ stars."},{"Title":"The pathfinder (The modern readers' series)","review":"The third book (chronologically) in the Leatherstocking series was, like 'The Deerslayer,' written late in Cooper's career. Timewise, 'The Pathfinder' appears to take place only a few years after 'The Last of the Mohicans,' although Cooper's overt chronology doesn't quite add up.Although 'The Pathfinder' has a promising premise, Cooper's plotting is seriously off-track. After rescuing this novel's 'heroine' (Mabel) from the Mingos, Chingachgook vanishes and Natty is stuck playing a rather awkward suitor to Mabel. In fact, one can hardly call 'The Pathfinder' a frontier adventure at all. It verges on a romance novel, which instantly makes it much less interesting than the other Leatherstocking Tales.The book is also hurt by slow pacing. Cooper always takes his sweet 'ole time spinning a yarn, but 'The Pathfinder' is a painfully slow read. Not much happens, and what does happen is pretty irrelevant to the plot. For example, the long sequence where the 'Scud' sails around Lake Ontario contributes nothing to the story. Even worse, I always knew exactly where the story was going dozens of pages before Cooper got there. One hundred pages could easily have been chopped from this book without losing a thing.Even when the action finally picks up late in the book, Natty and Chingachgook do next to nothing. Instead, the heroism is handled by the underdrawn character of Jasper Western. It doesn't help that Cooper sets up the final battle by having Mabel's father leave her alone in a fort with an unscupulous suitor and practically no soldiers for protections. It's so unbelieveable that the rest of the novel seems forced.Least palatable is Cooper's unfortunate weakness for melodrama. Sometimes his plots are strong enough to render this only an annoying flaw, but the plot of 'The Patherfinder' is too thin to manage this. Cooper really lays on some dreadful schlock.As a result, 'The Pathfinder' is without question the weakest of the Leatherstocking Tales, and is definitely NOT the place to start. In fact, I'm hard pressed to come up with anything the novel contributes to the series. As a result, it should be read last (if at all) unless you are determined to read all five books."},{"Title":"The pathfinder (The modern readers' series)","review":"James Fennimore Cooper's five books known as \\"The Leatherstocking Tales\\" ( the Pathfinder is the third in the series) are some of the most exciting books I've ever read.

Butwhat Cooper does in his tale, The Pathfinder, is give a brilliantimage of the first rude settlements in North America, referring tothe story as our legend. If he did invent, it was in termsof what he actually had learned during a visit to a region of thecountry.The underlying motive of his novel, from beginning to end,was to move and capture the reader by what he once identifiedas a &quot;stoicism which (Pathfinder) imbibed from long associationwith the Indians.&quot; This is a naturally compact dependent clausefor a concept of philosophical submission, and Cooper's observationof its existence cunningly changed many times in the unfoldmentof his story,- mostly in the direction that wouldawaken those who were practised in the ways of the world.At the heart of the observation, nevertheless, the interpreter canmonotonously perceive the play of three observable realities:position; time; and the quantities, such as energy and growth,that are attributed to them.The first of the plotting instruments, conspicuously a solitarysign with Cooper and his characters is the bearing of position.Once place, environment, is known, the sergeant tells another character,'it will be something gained to learn our position.' Unlessyou have it, the place will be too dark to reveal the color ofnature's pristine appearance. Like the woodsman's, the reader'spatience is a virtue as he changes position.

I also felt I was re-reading sections from her husband's book in her book; his words were just changed around a bit. There was nothing new nor were any original ideas presented in the book.She makes reference on why God loves to answer such a prayer as the Jabez prayer. Does that mean that God does not answer other kinds of prayers, and only chooses \\"prayers such as . . .?\\" I think not. She talks of women being very fearful and giving up on miracles in their lives. Well, thoughts have energy and if one constantly thinks fearful thoughts, then fear shows up in our lives. If one does not believe in miracles happening, then they won't. Ernest Holmes, in his ministry, stated, \\"Change your thoughts, change your life.\\" Jesus was able to do what he did, not only because of his faith, but also because of the power of his thoughts. Faith is a huge concept.The feeling I get after reading this book is that if one says this prayer then the miracles unfold. If one doesn't believe, or is skeptical, or has negative thoughts, their lives will not change. The author also talks about supporting one's husband. How about the husband supporting his wife's career? It works both ways and spousal support is not just \\"one\\" way. Have I stepped back into the 50's here? Satan is also mentioned in her book, which, in my review of the Prayer of Jabez, is getting old. We have free will, which God has given us. Our choices need to be held accountable by the person who made them and not blamed on someone else.She also makes reference that we have to realize that Jesus died for payment our sins and once we accept that we are saved. I think not. God's Spirit is with us always and if one does or does not accept the above statement, it does not mean that God will not bless us. We are God's expression on earth. We are already whole and complete and we are loved always. I am really tired of reading \\"Christian\\" books where the guilt it constantly laid on. This book also does not talk about a forgiving and loving God, which is very disappointing.She also talks ad nauseum on fear, on women's fears. Sure we all have fears, but again we either give into them or change them. It makes me wonder that as a minister's wife, she is so filled with fear, where is her supportative husband? Does she feel that insecure? Has her husband not helped to boost her self-confidence or has she been put down and made to feel insecure. Makes one wonder.This book was just as bad as the original, if not worse. Another disappointment."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Women audio curriculum CD - 4-part: Breaking Through to the Blessed Life (Audio CD Series)","review":"I found this book to be insightful, though not quite as good as Secrets of the Vine (written by her husband, Bruce). Darlene Wilkinson gives the Prayer of Jabez a slightly different spin, putting her perspective on it. But beware of several items: 1) this is written from her perspective, so don't presume that all she says will apply or even make sense from yours; and 2) asking for God to enlarge your territory doesn't necessarily mean make you rich. I noticed a few other reviewers of Bruce Wilkinson's book thought that it meant make me rich. I took it to mean, make me more effective for Your kingdom, Lord, by taking me out of my comfort zone (my territory). Just as King Solomon prayed for wisdom and God, because He was pleased with his request, made him the richest king of all time, so with Jabez. The very same day I began my 30 day trial (I am still in it, by the way), God granted my wish by opening a position at my church for me to minister through serving. The Lord has truly blessed me through this prayer. It is 100% effective if you keep your eyes open and don't expect physical riches. For me, the riches I am seeking are those to be found in my eternal home.

This part of his story is broken into two parts, the first part of the book begins when he bails out of his P-40 over what is now Vietnam and talks about his three years as a prisoner of the Japanese, his subsequent escape and return to the U.S. This part was written by Lew Bishop.The second part goes back to his earlier life both in the United States and his activities in China. Remember that this was before the U.S. actually entered the war. The Flying Tigers, technically called the American Volunteer Group (AVG), were American military pilots who left the American military with the promise that they could return with senority continuing through their Chinese service. They were sort of mercenaries, sort of part of the Chinese Air Force, and sort of a covert action of the United States.While this part of the book is not unlike others on the Flying Tigers, it is very well done and has numerous side panels that provide very informative insight into points like Roosevelt's role in the establishment of the AVG, the theories of Gen. Chennault and the way he was treated by the military establishment (the military does not treat original thinkers very well, and even worse when they are proven correct).Finally the third part of the book goes into life after Lew Bishop returned to the U.S. This is a story of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder before we even knew what it was. Mr. Bishop was never really able to put his life back into order. The effect on his life and that of his daughter (who wrote the rest of this book) is described tenderly and with insight.Really not until after Mr. Bishop's death did his daughter begin the 'journey of discovery' (raising three boys of her own took a lot of her time) that led to this book. I, for one, am glad that she made the journey and that she has shared it with us."},{"Title":"Escape From Hell","review":"I have read most of the books and articles written by those who were in Burma and China with the American Volunteer Group just before and at the beginning World War II, and those who were not. This book is easily among the best of both genres. \\"Escape from Hell\\" includes both an account written by 3rd Squadron, Hell's Angles, Vice-Squadron Leader, Lewis Bishop, and by his daughter, Shiela Bishop Irwin. Lewis Bishop describes in the first three chapters of the book bailing out of his plane on May 17, 1942 while leading a mission over railroad installations at Lao Kay in French Indochina (now Viet Nam) and his next three years as a POW. He wrote the manuscript in 1945 and 1946. Shiela accompanies this narrative with additional information in text boxes and footnotes.The next three chapters are written by Shiela about her father's formative years and his experiences with the AVG up to the time of becoming a POW. These well researched chapters, as well as the ones that follow, are also enhanced with informative text boxes and footnotes. While I doubt Shiela considers herself a scholar, this is certainly a scholarly book. It includes a brief history and background of the AVG Flying Tigers, many photographs and reproductions of documents, a bibliography, appendices, and an index.Chapters 7 through 9 discuss the life of Lewis Bishop after he returned to the United States. Drawing on research done on POWs in wars over the last 60 years, Shiela both sheds light on the life of her father and her own experience of him as a father and as a human being who had gone through experiences most of us can only faintly imagine. In the final chapter Shiela provides a personal account of her relationship with her father and how writing the book was process of discovery for her.I recommend this very readable book to anyone who has an interest in the AVG, POWs, the China-India-Burma Theater, World War II, or the exploration of the relationship between a father and his daughter."},{"Title":"Escape From Hell","review":"This is a great story and a very readable book.

This is the story of a country doctor (Schilling) told from a number of angles. Most of it is set prior to WW II. The land is central to this book; indeed, I feel this book is a fair example of new-wave naturalism.

There's nothing wrong with that, it sells books, just don't expect many of the arguments to hold water."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"There are many fine reviews about this book. I recommend reading several to get a balanced opinion. Having recently read this book, I have a few more observations to add:Author Kevin Phillips, described as a former Republican strategist (for Nixon, of all political luminaries!), offers another poorly researched tome that predicts America is destined for collapse because of three primary factors: growing political influence of evangelical groups, dependence on dwindling supplies of foreign oil, and ballooning debt. Most laughably, he compares the modern United States to the Roman Empire (has Phillips ever really studied ancient history, because his understanding of the Roman Empire appears as if it were taken from a textbook written in the 19th century?), which collapsed many centuries ago (from what, an overdependence on foreign oil?). Phillips also asserts that the invasion of Iraq is a direct result of the confluence of misguided U.S. energy policy and the presence of a Christian right president in White House, who simply must have apocalyptic visions of the Second Coming, and wants to annex the Holy Land before J.C. shows up again.Pretty heady stuff, but unfortunately, Phillips is incapable of maintaining a consistent argument and narrative throughout this turgid braindrop of a book, which is filled with endless digressions and factoids that hardly support his arguments. Phillips provides history by laundry list, as if he did a Google search on a topic, then listed every citation that appeared in the search result--perhaps hoping that such a mechanistic combination of facts can produce a convincing narrative or argument. For example, he demonstrates his limits in understanding the procurement of energy throughout history, as if oil is the only energy source that has ever existed or will ever exist. To support his point that oil is important, he explains that the word \\"oil\\" can be traced back to the Greek \\"elaia,\\" which became \\"oleum\\" in Latin, then \\"oile\\" in Old French and medieval Anglo-French. He goes on to explain that the Bible (imagine, a left-wing fear mongerer quoting the Bible!), especially the book of Genesis, has references to asphalt, tar, and naphtha....And so this laundry list of facts continues, with nary a copy editor in sight.Meanwhile, Phillips is an unapologetic, narrowminded Bush basher, popping up like a ghost of Republican presidencies past every time a journalist or documentary filmmaker needs a talking head to spew bile about the Bush family (Phillips even has a prominent part in the documentary, \\"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,\\" in which he says the connection between Enron and the Bush Administration was unprecedented in its mixing business with politics....say what?). He says Bush's connections to the oil industry are screwing up the United States, while conveniently ignoring the fact that Bush used his state of the union address to say America is hopelessly \\"addicted to oil.\\""},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"From Mediacracy to American Dynasty, Kevin Phillips has continued to address large socio-political issues of the day. American Theocracy is no different.Phillips represents the sect of conservatism that loathes Bush, his leadership style, his background--basically, his complete embodiment. \\"Sour grapes\\" may also be driving such writing as has appeared in the last 2 books Phillips has produced, as the current conservatives controlling the country exclude the traditional conservatives that refuse to shut up and go by the new rules. Does that mean that his points are any less valid?..of course not.For some, this will be an eye-opener, for others it will provide reinforced arguments in support of circumstances that have already been identified.Either way---enjoy."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"By using a narrow view of historical religious expansionism, Phillips almost acts as an apologist for the religious right. It would be better if it had been written from a non-biased political view point."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Whenever the Bush said the word God liberals freaked and said that the GOP was turning the country into a theocracy. But now that Obama is President God is back, and he is using God to sell his programs in the name of social justice. Obama refers to God and Jesus more than Bush did. Obama has declared that we can have the kingdom of God here on earth. But if the GOP said something like that it would have echoed from hear to tibet, when Obama says stuff like that they are suspiciously silent."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I found the book to simply be a bunch of rehashed Leftist Fear and Loathing regarding the Moral Majority (which doesn't even exist anymore) left over from the Reagan Administration. Whenever people like the Author need a strawman to knock down or an object to ridicule out they trot Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson who are looked at as buffoons even by members of the so called religious right.Most of the book seems lifted directly from the web pages of Left Wing Blogs. There is not a single new idea about Bush nor the religious right as far as I can see that hasn't already appeared on \\"The Daily Show\\".Phillips would have done better had he concentrated on the New Energy Crisis and how a temporary glut of oil in the 90's lead politicians in both parties to relax energy savings standards that had been in place since the 70's on the false assumption that Happy Days are Here Again Forever."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Phillips has missed the point. His writing is lame and full of national-TV-like political correctness. This subject needs the sharp edge of truthfullness and the blunt hammer of fact.Phillips should have said: It is not the religious right that is dragging America under water, but the influence of religion - Christian, Jewish and Muslim alike - on all levels of our life from the media, via justice to politics."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"First of all, I have read the book. I try (paraphrasing another reviewer) to \\"keep tabs\\" on books that single out conservative Christians and attempt to smear them in the public square. It is interesting to me that the fans of this book take Phillips' arguments much further than Phillips actually does.It seems that anyone who doesn't love this book is a \\"radical, right wing, illiterate, rabid, toxic, hateful, narrow-minded, lying, ambitious, proselytizing, power-mad zealot\\" with tendencies that are scarily reminiscent of Hitler, Hussein, and the Islamist terrorist militants.My goodness, how the voices of \\"tolerance\\" and \\"reason\\" screech to drown out the voices of dissent. And how intensely bigoted these voices are; who then, has more reason to fear? If anyone is in danger of having their rights stripped, it would seem to be the conservative Christian minority in America.Reading this book, I found myself agreeing with some of Phillips' points concerning our voracious appetites for oil and our inconsistencies in Mid-Eastern politics. I also strongly agree with him on our out-of-control spending as a nation. I will say, it is disingenuous to ascribe these behaviors to just one political party. There is plenty of blame for Republicans and Democrats alike.However, it is extremely unfortunate that Phillips chose to attack America's Christians, who are not, it should be noted, out rioting in the street whenever they are mocked or their faith is slandered. They are not chopping off the heads of their detractors or sentencing Muslim converts to death. They are not imposing \\"Sharia\\" law nor are they blowing up rival houses of worship.A little balance and perspective would have helped, in both Phillips' book, and in some of the more vitriolic reviews posted here. Attention forces of \\"tolerance\\": your true colors may be showing.By the way, I am not a fan of Pat Robertson or of reflexive fundamentalist Christianity. But to tar all conservative Christians with the same brush is both inaccurate and irresponsible. I would have thought that Phillips would be above that kind of sloppiness and bias; I was wrong."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The author gets right to the point in the beginning and shows his bias. His entire attack on America's alleged theocracy is based on the usual mistakes of simpletons who don't bother to do solid in depth research. Here are examples of his mistakes:1) He takes Bush at his word when he claims to be a Christian or hearing from God. Lying is the oldest trick in the book, how can the author be so gullible?2) He lumps Christianity and all religions together, as if there aren't much differences between them, and lumps all Christians together as if they all believe the same things as well.3) He blames the sins for one person on everyone else, for example if George Bush, claiming to be a Christian, says God told him to blow up Iraq, that therefore it's the fault of all Christians and the Bible.Ironically, he preaches against terrorism using the above reasons, yet his above reasons are the same type that terrorists use, right? For example how many Muslims think all Christians are bad because of the crusades, which the Catholic denomination engaged? At the very least THE EXTREMISTS. So what does that make the author? Guess.Besides showing how he lumps all Christians together as being evil, he, on page viii, shows his historical ignorance: He says, \\"We have had a theocracy in North America before, in Puritan England and later in Mormon Utah but except in their earliest beginnings, they lacked the intensity of those in Europe, such as John Calvin's Geneva or the Catholic Spain of the Inquisition.\\" No doubt he is implying that the Puritan government was no good because of the Salem Witch Trials. However, that is a poor reason to bash it or put all the Puritans and Christians in a bad light. Also, there is no evidence (as far as I've seen so far) except with Judge Sewell, that any of the judges were saved, or the one who appointed them to judge the trial. Furthermore Judge Sewell APOLOGIZED, having realized what he did was wrong, how many judges or leaders will apologize ON THEIR OWN who are NOT Christians? And not all Christians have the same amount of wisdom just as non-Christians aren't all equal in wisdom let alone \\"wise\\", some will be more reckless than others, that doesn't mean the religion they have is necessarily bad or flawed, it could also mean they weren't adhering to it perfectly (Love your neighbor as yourself was not exactly demonstrated in the Salem Witch Trials now was it?). If a CEO of a food company sells bad food that doesn't make all C.E.O.s of food company's bad does it? And remember also, these were a people running away from the corrupt Catholic denomination and were just beginning to learn more and more about the Bible, they were far from perfect and were afraid to cast off all the bad ways of their parent so to speak. There is no evidence that the Puritan government wouldn't have improved.As for the old government of Mormon Utah, it sure did NOT lack intensity, see One Nation Under Gods. Wow, and that is a huge error to compare it to Calvin's government. The Mormon government of Utah was based on false prophecies being made by a money-loving power-loving liar who hated TRUTH. John Calvin LOVED the truth and would not say whatever the heck for money or power. Shame.Again, as for the Inquisition OF Spain (not the other way around as the author states), to compare Catholicism to saved Calvinists is a huge error and a bad comparison. Genuine Catholics hold tradition and opinions OVER Scripture and often change their laws to suit the culture, not so John Calvin, he was hardly as corrupt in that way.Was John Calvin a murderer? As one who was forgiven God says no. It's because according to Scripture a saved person has a pure spirit that is always good, so they are significantly changed. But did John murder? Yes, sadly. But as even liberals and Christian-haters acknowledge, even murdering doesn't necessarily make a person evil or worthless, and that is especially true of John Calvin, despite his partial bad example. But what a hypocrite, how many people has the author lead to Christ and helped get eternal life? ZERO. How many, despite his sins, did Calvin lead? About 100 million as far as I can tell. And even if not that many, his awsome explanation of how salvation works surely strengthened the faith of those who wondered if they understood the Bible right or not. So give us a break, how dare anyone finger Calvin, \\"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\\", and hey, lead a few million people to Christ before railing against Calvin. \\"Get the log out of your own eye before trying to help your brother with the SPECK in his eye.\\" Ok? And how callous, the author doesn't even point out what would have provoked Calvin to murder, what happened to the excuse making that liberals are so fond of? All of the before hand events that supposedly excuse a person's bad behavior? They sure are biased when it comes to those evil truth-loving Christians. Anyone remember Calvin being chased out and persecuted? Oh yeah, but naw, that don't matter, because he was a truth-loving Christian.Something the author misses which is typical of many other books like his is that one of the major problem philosophies is NEUTRALISM, sometimes wrongly called \\"Being Tolerant\\". Neutralism means to \\"not obey God too much or too little and accepting all religions as being true.\\" Neutralism - as Bush Jr. shows by exploiting the Constitution to claim it teaches to accept any religion - leads to oppression, murder, and ruin. Or do suicide bombers not exist?The U.S. Constitution, is a neutral set of laws: are they working well? As for secular governments being better, let's talk about the government of Turkey, the former Soviet Union, and China, have fun living there."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"It is a very sad fact that those on the political Left WANT to believe this kind of drivel. They want to believe the only reason for the war in Iraq was oil. They want to believe the head of Chevron can ring up George W. Bush and give him instructions. They want to believe the GOP is little more than a Christian Theocratic Party.Those on the extreme Right are just as bad. They want to believe that Hillary Clinton is evil, planning to dispense with all private property and that the Democrats are little more than Marxist-Leninists who won't admit it and will close all Churches and deny their children the right to pray. Some of them even believe the UN will soon be sending troops door-to-door to collect their guns.Worse still is that the Cable News and Broadcast News agencies want ALL of us to believe this is the way the world is today.Just ain't so, children.Most of the oil companies OPPOSED, not supported, the war in Iraq, fearing it would screw up supplies and cost them a fortune. The massive ENRON debacle began during the CLINTON administration (it just didn't surface until Bush) and BOTH parties have some blame to be left on their doorstop.The world cannot be saved by mass transit, there is no secret solar panel design that has been hidden by the oil companies and the 300mpg carburetor is about as real as the Easter Bunny.GET A GRIP, people. George W. Bush isn't some evil man who wants to see you in chains. He may well be limited in his view of the world, but SO IS EVERYONE. The average poor person in America is as unlikely to know about the problems (and there are many) of wealth as the average rich person knows about being cold and starving on the streets.Kevin Phillips has been writing this same sort of crap for years. He has no evidence in solid fact to prove it, but legions will believe it because they WANT to believe it. Their black-and-white world would be really difficult to understand if we put it in Technicolor for them."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This timely and well researched book sets out to explain three of the major problems that plague modern day America and just might herald the country's imminent decline. Author Kevin Phillips has divided American Theocracy into three distinct albeit related parts.Part I, \\"Oil and American Supremacy\\", lays out the history of America's dependence on and never ending search for fossil fuels. It emphasizes the deep ties the Republican Party, George W. Bush and especially Dick Cheney have with the giant oil companies and related corporations. The most disturbing message spelled out by Mr. Phillips here is that the 2003 incursion into Iraq is only the latest manifestation of \\"petro-imperialism\\" as practiced by America and its ally Great Britain.My only criticism of this part of the book is its overdone presentation of historical precedents to the current oil crisis. It is doubtful that the history of the whale oil industry has much to teach us about today's petroleum markets.Part II, \\"Too Many Preachers\\", is perhaps the most interesting of the book's three sections. Here, Phillips discusses how fundamentalist Protestantism has become a vital constituency to the Republican Party and the dangers this particular demographic phenomenon brings. For example, Phillips asserts that a large percentage of Republican partisans believe that the \\"end times\\" of biblical prophecy will soon be upon us. To these voters, the current Middle East conflict, in all its ugly manifestations is a necessary milestone on the way to the Rapture they expect to be enjoying soon.He also gives four precedents for the phenomenon of religious zealotry among the ruling class becoming a key factor in the downfall of past \\"superpowers\\". Specifically cited are Rome, Spain, Holland and most relevantly Britain.Part II, \\" Borrowed Prosperity\\", decries America's debt burden at all levels. The take away message of this section is that the US economy now consists more of \\"shuffling money around\\" than actually creating goods people can use. Just as the agrarian society gave way to the industrial revolution, Phillips contends that America's manufacturing base has given way to the financial sector and this is something that does not bode well for continued American hegemony on the world stage. Again, Phillips points out the parallels between the present day US and once great nations on the verge of precipitous decline.This section is the least effective of the three primarily because it presupposes a detailed knowledge of economic institutions and financial instruments the average layperson reading this book would not be expected to have.All in all, American Theocracy is a thought provoking work which articulates the concerns many people have about the direction America is headed. Phillips' analysis is not at all kind to the George W. Bush administration, which is portrayed as espousing policies diametrically at odds with the nation's future well being."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I have read two books by Phillips and this is the best yet. Very informative.Every Independent Moderate should read this book."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"A non-fiction that reads like a novel! I first read a library copy in 2006, and was frightened that the religious right would drive our country to ruin.

Phillips' main thesis, though hard to find, seems persuasive enough: ill-founded fundamentalist politics enables two key hazardous trends: 1) oil-driven foreign policy and 2) irresponsible financial policy, resulting in unprecedented private & national debt.Phillips' strengths are his focus on realpolitik consequences of policy & his preponderance of disturbing facts, although to keep up, you will need some familiarity with history or other social sciences. His weaknesses are his repetition & length, questionable read of history, and lack of integration between the three main subjects, although each section is informative in its own right. Also, a handful of his points seem to rest on loose analogies, circumstantial evidence, or evidence without footnotes, making evaluation difficult, but overall, his analyses are plausible enough to warrant closer attention."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Morals from this outstanding review of practical economic and political history.- The only thing new is the history we don't know.- Philosophical decisions are elegant because they are impervious to data.Read it and Learn!"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Phillips has a lot to answer for, given his early career as a neocon apologist, but he has come a long way. It can be argued, however, that his background lends some measure of credibility to his later work. It certainly suggests intellectual honesty and in this volume he ties up a lot of loose ends. The confluence of religion, oil and power isn't new, but it appears to have become an overwhelming force in world politics. (I know I was surprised, but probably shouldn't have been, to discover Billy Graham's close connection to big oil, as far back as the 1950s - seeThe Prince of War: Billy Graham's Crusade for a Wholly Christian EmpireReading Phillips in conjunction with Jared Diamond'sCollapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeedshould be enough to keep anyone awake at night. We are living in very dangerous times, and Phillips comparison of our economic straits with those that felled past empires is enough to make one contemplate divestiture and emigration."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is the second book of Kevin Phillips that I have read. Gives you a complete different look at what happens around you everyday."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I read this amazon book after seeing the author interviewed on BookTV.Born in 1940, he was a political advisor to president Richard Nixon, and originally a Republican, he has since switched to being an Independent.The thrust of his political view seems to be that he favored Eisenhower and Nixon, but opposes the ideas of the Bush presidents.In this book, he convincingly argues that fundamentalist Christianity, the pursuit of oil riches, and the evil of national borrowing and debt, have left the Republicans in a position of great political vulnerability.The author has written many many books on politics and history.

As the key implementer of Nixon's \\"southern strategy\\", which used southern white backlash against racial integration to realign the political parties of the US, Philips helped give birth to the modern Republican Party.In this book he sounds the alarm over how things have gone since. He now sees the rise of theocracy and economic plutocracy being advanced by the Republican Party as undermining not only the Middle Class, but the entire US economy. Copiously documented and backed up with world historical analysis and statistics, this is a formidable book. Must reading for anyone truly interested in understanding the current political and economic situation in the United States."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"He does an excellent account of the history and current predicament we have regarding our national addiction to oil and lack of a true energy policy because of political weakness, and the incredible national debt to China and Saudi Arabia. But the book stumbles on the concept that \\"perhaps\\" one third of the republican voters truly believe the \\"end times\\" are near and that the Bush administration heeds this call, such that our nation will be led willingly into more wars to hasten the Second Coming of Christ. Greed for oil, a gamble to create a client state, etc all the real reasons for the Iraq war are cited by Mr Phillips but he seems to not understand the fundamental role of religion in American society - it's never as weak - or as strong - as you may assume."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Most of what author Kevin Phillips talks about in American Theocracy seems absolutely true. The \\"end of oil,\\" the huge personal, corporate, and government debt, and political ties too close to religion seem like impossible burdens for the US to bear. However, the book is so overloaded with statistics about who voted for whom in what counties for the last 150 years, the percentage rises and declines of various religious denominations, and esoteric economic theory that it will be rendered unreadable to most anyone who does manage to slog through it.On the face, it seems we're going to get an analysis of the perils of too much religious influence in politics in general in a title like \\"American Theocracy.\\" But what we find is that Phillips has a particular disdain for evangelical Christians and the Southern Baptist Convention. Most of the rants directed toward that denomination are primarily directed at the denomination's role in electing both Presidents Bush. He gives historical nods to the fact that yes, both President Clinton and President Carter are Southern Baptists as is former VP Gore, but he only seems to be concerned now that Southern Baptists elected republicans, not when they rallied behind democrats.Phillips also has a condescending habit of categorizing religious denominations he seems to have little respect for. Reading his grouping of denominations into \\"sects\\" (to me \\"sect\\" carries very negative connotations the way it is primarily used in the world ) you'll basically come to find that if you don't belong to a mainline Protestant denomination (I think he names 5 -Presbyterians, original Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalian, and Church of Christ) you belong to a \\"sect.\\" Yes, Southern Baptists, Missouri Synod Lutherans, any variety of Pentecostal (another group he shows repeated disdain for apparently due to a bitter dislike for John Ashcroft), Church of the Nazarene, any \\"non-denominational\\" mega-church, or any of dozens of other denominations, he has determined you belong to a \\"sect.\\" And if you are a Mormon he has determined that your religion qualifies as a \\"cult.\\"It's unfortunate that he has decided to make this book one-sided in its attacks on the Bush family, republicans, and Southern Baptists. He cites, for example, the improper use of the church pulpit as a platform to promote specific political agendas or politicians as if the republicans/right wing invented it. In doing so, he's guilty of a huge double-standard by completely failing to mention the democrats' mingling of religion and politics in a stronger sense with the Rev. Jesse Jackson (who gets of one sentence mention in the whole book) and he also completely misses the highly televised clearly pandering church appearances Pres. Clinton was prone to making around elections and policy times in churches where it seemed unlikely he'd ever attend without TV cameras in tow.Another double-standard is that the whole book centers around what he sees as unwillingness of the republican party to alienate conservative Christians (who he feels are the most radical 20-30% of the electorate). (See page 348 for a summation of \\"blind constituency commitments\\" and \\"stagnant but entrenched politics.\\") But he never mentions the democrats' unwillingness to question their ties to the radical feminist elements within NOW, unions, and other left-leaning special interest groups. He misses the point that if either side were to make the radical leap of not pandering to the extreme bases, they might capture a huge majority in the middle. As far as I could tell, he makes only one nod to the democrats' blunder in this regard, on page 237 when he acknowledged that the 60s and 70s attempted by secular liberals to push all hints of religion out of public life were the first shot fired in the culture war and were what has caused such a tremendous backlash from the right. He saves until a couple of sentences in the afterword any exposing of his double-standard on the Bush dynasty when he finally owns up that the dems have enjoyed a Kennedy dynasty as well and look to be banking on a Clinton Dynasty.Despite his overwhelming use of statistics from voting results and surveys, he makes assumptions and guesses lacking data to back them up. I can't to count the number of times he cites sales and readership of the \\"Left Behind\\" book series as evidence that x% of the population probably thinks or votes this way or that. At one point he cites anonymous internet chat room economists as a source of trepidation. While his points might be valid, for such a heavily researched book with 30 pages of end-notes, such assumptions and lack of valid sources in places are major short comings.He also makes thinly veiled attempts to tie evangelical or fundamental religious beliefs to poor education, mental health, child poverty, and homicide (page 203). He almost seems nostalgic for McCarthyism when on page 245 he notes the similarities between the current efforts to expose radical right \\"reconstructionism\\" and the successful outings of communists. All part of a very elitist attitude that permeates his writing.What I did find fascinating about the book though (when he wasn't burying me in needless statistics - he needed an editor to talk some sense into him in this regard especially in chapters 5 and 6) was his ability to relate out current energy crises, looming financial crisis, and political dependence on religion to other world powers who have come and gone down the same road: the Dutch, Spanish, and British empires. He makes a strong case that the parallels in those societies to that in the 21st century US are too great to ignore. I consider myself above average in reading habits and education but much of what he presented to me went into the \\"wow, I didn't learn that bit of history in school.\\" For that reason alone, I do recommend reading this book, but I'd also recommend skipping and skimming some, and being honest about your own leanings when he's criticizing someone else."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This book is very well written and researched.

There are retributions to be paid by the \\"evil doers\\", prisons to be built and wars to fight;prophesies to fulfil and a better place to be purchased for all who find themselves disenfranchised.Fundamentalist zealots will know when the time is right.

Perhaps more importantly, he tells us WHY and HOW we got here over the past 30 years. If like me, you sat back in 2000 and 2004 scratching your head and wondering what is happening to this country, read this book and much will become clear. Unfortunately, Phillips offers little in the way of ensuring US world leadership in the next decade. My hope is that patriots on both the left and the right read and understand what this book is saying, then come together in the center to shore up our declining country."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips - the inventor of the Republican \\"southern strategy\\" - has written an excellent book that describes three current problems he sees in the current Republican party: debt, oil, and the christian right. He writes in a manner that has much detail but is easily read. Mr. Phillips, a life-long Republican, presents to me, a moderate Democrat, an evenhanded discussion of these problems. He is not a fan of the Bush family so if you are one of the 30% who still believe in Dubya, you are not going to like this book.You may agree with his thesis or disagree with it but it is a very worthwhile read to at least think about his points."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"One can agree that the oil industry has undue, even harmful, influence in our political affairs, that the rise of fundamentalist religious thinking of obsessive moralizing and fatalism is disturbing, and that the personal credit bubble, budget deficit, and trade imbalance seem to portend financial disruptions without being ecstatic about another book concerned with the highly questionable direction in which the Republican Party is determined to take this nation. Phillips' books all seem to be overly long, tedious, repetitious, and overloaded with scraps of data, as is this one.It is difficult to compare nations or empires of different historical eras, but the author makes some effort to show that excess, ignorance, inflexibility, and arrogance had much to do with the decline of Spain, Holland, and England in previous centuries. He makes it quite clear that he considers the US to be in a similar situation. He is most concerned (one-half of the book is devoted to such) that skewing personal and world events into a fundamentalist religious framework justifies actions or inactions that can have or are having severe consequences both domestically and internationally. Furthermore, he notes that, more so than anytime in our history, one political party, the Republican, has become the party of religion. The political polarization makes rational governing policy next to impossible. Among more important issues, religion is used to justify or ignore the unsustainable use of fossil fuels with obvious environmental impacts and a foreign policy of preemptive warfare.As said, the author throws a lot of data at the reader. Clearly the South, the main location of the oil industry and fundamentalist religion, once again dominates national politics, and the finance and real estate industries are driving an economy increasingly operating on thin ice. But for those on the left, the book lacks a broader perspective. The most obvious trend in the US is the dominating influence of corporations throughout our society - in all areas, not simply reliance on oil or debt to finance our lifestyles. What is the role of the mass media and our educational institutions in maintaining the status quo and all manner of delusion? Emphasizing the diminished number of doctorates in science awarded in the US versus China or Europe is data-centric but doesn't address the larger role of education in a democracy. Though the author is sounding an alarm, the combination of the corporatization of American life, the manipulation of information, and the growing religious imperative may be more significant than the author suggests.In many ways, this book is a gathering of facts behind trends suspected and now confirmed. The data is interesting, but one has to be willing to wade through it. In addition to previously noted characteristics, the author has a somewhat awkward style with quirky asides and analogies interspersed."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Former Republican strategist, Kevin Phillips, believes he knows what is wrong with our nation. Chances are, by very virtue of your reading a book review on a Christian e-zine, you contribute to the erosion of our national health. American Theocracy: The Politics and Peril of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century is at times scathing and at times coolly analytical in its survey of dangers Phillips sees threatening our superpower status.Part I examines the effects of America's dependency on oil. Our industry, automobiles, and military have an insatiable appetite for oil. Phillips argues that this energy dependency gives Big Oil too much sway over our domestic and foreign policies. At home we lax our environmental laws to accommodate oil drilling. And abroad we resort to international thuggery to secure control of Iraq's mostly untapped oil fields. \\"The war on terror?\\", \\"Importing democracy to the Middle East?\\" Phillips sees these as slogans to sell an imperialistic war.In Part II: \\"Too Many Preachers\\", Phillips takes aim at Christian Fundamentalism, a movement the he sees embodied by the Southern Baptist Convention, Pentecostals, and the charismatic movements. Phillips chronicles these denominations rise to prominence and how they shape national politics. The culture wars are provoked by radical Christians attempting to establish a theocracy--a Christian America governed by God's rules. \\"Disenlightenment\\" is Phillip's descriptor for the effect that these empowered believers have on our country: They value faith over science and a literal Armageddon over peace.Phillips closes his diatribe with Part III on our national and individual debt. Again, Phillips provides a valuable historic context at how debt played a role in the decline of England, Spain, and the Netherlands as superpowers. Phillips offers an undeniable outline of the depths of our national debt as well as personal credit lodes. He argues that our increasing debt and decreasing hard industry has created a thin ice that will eventual give in under our largesse.American Theocracy finds its value when Phillips is able to sustain his analytical voice, and he's able to do so for extended periods of time. His historical perspective on our oil dependency, the changing face of American religion, and our national debt demand your attention. I'll confess, as an evangelical with political tendencies a few notches right of centrist, this was uncomfortable stuff to read. Even so, Phillips places important issues on the table.However when Phillips slips into his polemic voice the book becomes tedious. Phillips has open contempt for people superstitious enough to buy into the Biblical creation account, Noah Arc, or a literal interpretation of Revelation, such as the one popularized by the Left Behind franchise. Phillips also makes too many gaps in his evidence with clauses like, \\"Although the evidence is weak.\\" He's on a mission to connect the dots and is willing to supply any missing points along the way.Make no mistake; Kevin Phillips wields too much anger and bias to be objective. But are there any takeaways for the evangelical and fundamentalist Christian communities?I think so. American Theocracy provokes us to ask several poignant questions:-- Have we developed what Phillip's calls \\"American Exceptionalism\\"; a belief that America has an exclusive blessing from God? How does this belief influence our foreign policy?-- Does our theology concerning the end times make us overly tolerant of military interventions in the Middle East? (\\"The faster we get to Armageddon the faster we get to heaven.\\")-- Should the political arena our primary method of advancing God's kingdom on Earth? Does Jesus truly expect that we establish an \\"American Theocracy?\\"I won't pretend to offer the final word on these questions. Instead, I just note that in spite of all the book's weaknesses, American Theocracy provides the agenda for an important conversation that's long overdue"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I usually avoid political books of this type, viewing them as mostly disposable and irrelevant once thier two-month topical shelf-life has expired. However, I was tempted into buying it for two reasons: the author is well-known for charting a course for the Republican party back in the 1960s which led to its current reliance on a southern, religious base (so he knows more than just a little about his topic). Second, I heard author Kevin Philips inerviewed on several different programs and I was intrigued by the authority and pragmatism with which he presented his thesis. Namely, that Americans have three things to fear: religious rule, dependence on a foreign product without which our current lifestyle and economy is impossible (oil) and, finally, crushing debt.The book can get a little dry at times, but the background and the recitation of facts is necessary to truly put the present situation in perspective. This is no sensational name-calling book, it's simply an attempt to explain how American politics got to where it is today and what the practical implications are for the future. Philips provides such a well-costructed argument, that it's hard to ignore his concerns. If you're not concerned for our national future by the time you're through, you probably weren't reading carefully.If you're looking for repetitious Bush-bashing, skip this book. While there are certainly indictments of Bush policy, Philips traces a much longer arc than simply the most recent administration. There's plenty of blame to go around...and it's been decades in the making. Beyond the already troubling issues of possible theocracy, future oil shortages and a ballooning debt economy, Philips draws many parallels to other historical superpowers which folded. America is charting a very close course with countries such as Spain and Great Britain, both of which ceased to produce actual goods that poeple could buy and which, towards the end of their reign, also shyed away from rational thinking in favor of a religious fervor which held that each was special in the eyes of god and, therefore protected from failure...a view that is, with benefit of hindsight, delusional."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"A well researched look at the Evangelical right and their gradeschool level of Pollyannism politics which is chilling to even the most casual viewer.

No, not gay marriage, but the kidnapping of Christianity in the name of political conservatism.The deficit is unquestionably the biggest fiscal challenge facing this country; social security is floundering in the shadows; once again, American auto makers are discovering the need for smaller, more economical cars; Iraq is disintegrating even beyond the Fox New Channel's ability to hide the unpleasant truth; \\"Some people say . . .\\" is the President's favorite rhetorical device; your sons, fathers, and husbands are at risk of a being drafted as the saber rattling over Iran continues . . . but thank the almighty Lord Clinton is no longer in the White House.This very faithful Catholic is looking forward to an excellent read."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips' first and perhaps best-known book, \\"The Emerging Republican Majority,\\" was written in 1967 and published in 1969. The reason for the delay was that it mapped out the \\"Southern strategy\\" for the 1968 Nixon presidential campaign. The strategy was to win over working class whites to the Republican Party. The strategy was so successfull that it has been used in every campaign since. In his new book, Phillips describes how this strategy has become a social movement and a powerful force in American politics. He goes further to describe how this social movement is entangled with America's dependence on foreign oil and debt, and how it will lead to our inevitable decline.It has long been known that the US population density and political power is moving from the Northeast towards the \\"Sun Belt\\" states. (Every elected American president since 64 was from the Sun Belt.) This movement, which Phillips calls the \\"Southernization\\" of American politics, includes the infusion of evangelical and fundamentalist Christianity. Phillips goes so far as to conclude that the Republican party is now the first religious party in American history.Phillips tells us that the \\"premillenialist\\" evangelicals believe that the end is near and that they believe the final battle for civilization will be fought in the Middle East. He would also have us beleive that this is the driving force behind the Bush administration's decision to intervene in Iraq. Yes, Bush panders to the evangelical wing to get elected, but this has also alienated him from many secular and libertarian Republicans - not to mention budget-balancers and noninterventionists. I think Phillips overstates the influence of the evangelicals; in fact, as of late, it seems that their power is waning due to the widespread revulsion to their extremism. The faith-based view of the world is becoming increasingly at odds with the world of science and reason. Phillips term for this worldview is the \\"Dis-enlightenment\\".The second source of our decline comes from our dependence on foreign oil. Phillips gives us a mini-history of how American civilization and power is based on oil. (The British empire was based on coal, the Dutch empire on wind, etc.) Oil, of course, is a non-renewable resource. Its production peaked in the US in the 1970's and it will peak worldwide in the next 10 to 30 years, depending on which expert you believe. This dependency is a danger if, as Phillips claims, America lacks the will and the flexibility to switch to alternative sources. Although I have little faith in the current fossil fuel administration, there is a glimmer of hope as the president is currently touring California and telling us that hydrogen is the wave of the future. I have great faith in America's ability to transform itself through technology, I just worry about the current vested interests.Which brings us to the third source of our so-called decline. I worry even more about America's ability to control its spending. Our current accounts deficit is running about $700 billion annually, our national debt stands at about $8 trillion, and there is about $40 trillion committed to a retiring generation of baby boomers. Americans can't seem to elect politicians that want to raise taxes and cut benefits, and they have the unfortunate habit of spending more than they earn.Some Republican critics have scolded Phillips for being on the side of the Democrats, but this is not the case. He dismisses the Democrats as not being serious contenders for leading the country. He loathed LBJ in the 60's and he loathed Clinton in the 90's. Rather he is an old-fashioned Northeastern Republican who believes in hard work, manufacturing (not financial services), balanced budgets, reason, and science. He abhors the Southern, faith-based, oil and debt-centered worldview of the current administration.This book is good, not so much for its jeremiad about America's decline, but for its insights into the rifts within the Rebublican Party. The last chapter, \\"The Erring Republican Majority,\\" is the best part of the book."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is a wonderful book for thoughtful conservatives who still believe that governement should (A) live within it's financial means, and (B) stay out of our private lives.The only people who have criticzed this book are far right religious fanatics ... the very people that Phillips articulately warns us all about.This is also a wonderful book for all those of us who believe that people should keep their religious views to themselves, stop shoving their religious zealotry onto the rest of us, and just mind their own business.If, instead, you believe that government should spend spend SPEND, no matter how much debt we rack up, and/or believe that America should give up it's freedom and free thinking to instead adopt a Christian Taliban-like theocracy run by ignorant religious freaks, then this book is clearly not for you.But for all thoughtful conservatives with half a brain, READ THIS BOOK ... it will fill up the other half."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is an important, thoughtful, well-written book that I didn't really like very much. On the one hand, it analyzes the current political/economic situation in the US and argues very convincingly that it parallels the situations that other world-dominating powers (i.e., the Roman Empire, the British Empire, Hapsburg Spain, and the Dutch Republic) faced at the ends of their periods of influence. The comparisons focus on the ways that all of those empires-- and the modern US-- found their societies polarizing, the ways that religious fervor began to influence the governments, the decay of science in the face of faith, rapidly growing national debts, and, most of all, an overweening sense of exceptionalism, which led those empires to become aggressively ignorant about what had happened before them, since they believed that they were not only unique in history, but favored by God.Doing all of this in a single book sounds like too much, and it is. That's why I didn't really care for the book. It's also why I found reading it something of a chore; the reader has to provide a lot of the work needed to connect the dots.However, there's another reason this is an important book. In 1970, the author wrote The Emerging Republican Majority, which correctly predicted and described the current ascendancy of conservative Republicanism in the US. In many ways, he is literally one of the midwives of the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush I, and Bush II administrations. Phillips now finds himself in what must be a very uncomfortable position: The strategy he created has spun wildly out of control, producing what is in his view literally a theocratic political party, the first such in US history. Further, he believes that the consequences of this will be potentially fatal to the republic.By trying to do too much in a single volume, Phillips risks oversimplifying the issues, and at times, he takes rhetorical shortcuts in his arguments. However, his essential theme that the theocratic politicians currently in power have set us on a course that may doom the nation in the same way as earlier empires were doomed is well-supported.So, I see this book as important, but reading it frustrated me in a number of ways."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"No powerful country can survive the triple onslaught of indebtedness, military adventurism, and extremist religious addiction. Bush and his allies represent the worst possible scenario for America in the 21st Century. While including some excruciating historical detail, Kevin Phillips examines the most probable and dangerous outcome of American foreign policy based on biblical prophecy. In short, we are doomed unless common sense returns to government. The author is pessimistic."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"It appears Kevin Phillips and Reagan-era conservative Bruce Bartlett, who wrote the recently published \\"Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy\\", have a lot in common - both are longtime, die-hard Republicans who have gradually become more vocal critics of their own party. Their reluctance and resulting denunciation are borne out of their obvious mistrust of the current administration, which espouses values that coalesce into a series of irreparable policies that will linger far longer than Bush's tenure in the White House.A former Republican strategist, Phillips is the one who wrote the blistering intergenerational biography of the Bush family with 2004's \\"American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush\\". His tendency toward fact-finding remains consistent with this book, but this time, his scope is much broader than the power of a dynastic influence. The author systematically categorizes the triumvirate of forces that he sees are decimating the possibility of long-term economic recovery in this country. The first is our intractable reliance on oil, a dependency so entrenched in our daily lives that the Middle East holds court over us with their every political upheaval. Although the Bush administration claims the Iraq war is not about oil, Phillips does a meticulous job in delineating how it is completely about oil and how this represents a broader historical pattern of laying claim to energy resources not within our borders.The second force is the red and blue state landscape that has polarized the citizenry to the point where influential voting blocks are mobilizing based upon value-based judgments. Phillips illustrates how the ascendancy of fundamentalist religion is not a new phenomenon to the U.S., nor have there have been examples in our history which support a long lasting impact of religion-fueled politics on our government. In the most interesting part of his comprehensive book, he goes further with the current geopolitical tensions at work, specifically how the divide between North and South is as pertinent today as it was during the Civil War and that in fact, how that conflict was as much about religion as it was about emancipation.Much of the geographic analyses has been covered thoroughly in John Sperling's fascinating 2004 treatise, \\"The Great Divide: Retro Vs. Metro States\\" and Thomas Frank's more scathing study of political disenfranchisement, \\"What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America\\". However, Phillips really makes the strongest case in illustrating how the current layout of blue and red states is really a compass for the varying levels of religious fervor in the country and that church attendance says more about political allegiances than current pundits are willing to admit openly. His arguments give credence to the indefatigable belief that many Southerners have in feeling they are the chosen ones who are committed to the idea of American imperialism as a means to spread their beliefs to a heathen-dominated world. At the same time, this is not a simple diatribe against the red state constituents as left-leaning liberals are not spared. Their inability to mobilize is put to task with almost as much criticality in Phillips' treatment.The third force Phillips discusses in great detail is what he labels the \\"financialization\\" of the economy, in particular, the unprecedented scale of the national debt. Similar to the points raised by Bartlett in his book, Phillips provides further evidence of how the Bush administration has done little to restrain the growth of government in feeding into the first two factors and in turn, allowed the gap between the rich and everyone else to widen. This is the least surprising point raised by Phillips' book but still an essential topic to cover in order to paint the cohesive landscape he does here. Even though all roads lead to the Bush administration, the author does not pave those roads with empty rhetoric but rather an abundance of facts, figures and reasonable historical analysis that sets his book apart from others on this subject. This is a strongly recommended read."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"As a former GOP strategist, Kevin Phillips has a viewpoint that other Bush Administration critics do not. He sees the multiple faults clearly and up close. His superb writing abilities have provided the curious reader a true gem. Put simply, GET THIS BOOK!Phillips' broad knowledge and experience are only exceeded by his careful research and analysis. He takes aim at difficult and disturbing current events, and succeeds in making sense out of these unusual times. Big Oil, The Bush administration, Iraq, Iran, are only part of the problem. Rising, irrational and destructive evangelical beliefs, rooted in the supposed inerrancy of the bible, together with even more irrational beliefs in a present day Rapture and Armageddon, have taken a choke hold over important parts of society, government and policy. Phillips' analysis is often scary, yet it becomes patently (and painfully) obvious due to his interesting and informative historical perspective.Phillips' analysis of our debt situation is sobering. Yet, this looming danger is being ignored by almost all of today's MSM. Phillips manages to convey his fears and analysis without ever sounding like a hysterical teenager, screaming about pimples and acne before a big date. To the contrary, his approach is all the more effective because his research and facts seem irrefutable.One comes away with the strong feeling that this generation is seeing the destruction of America - not from \\"terra-ists\\" or those who \\"hate us for our freedom\\", but from incredible debt, peak oil, corporate mismanagement, a thoroughly incompetent Bush Administration and worst of all, the rise of evangelical beliefs which are actually damaging the country.I would have no doubts that Mr. Phillips will suffer from threats, abuse and potentially dangerous situations caused by the ultra-religious right, but for the fact that most of those he so accurately describes probably have difficulties with words containing more than two syllables, unless they pertain to NASCAR or the bible. Add to that, his targets probably don't read anything outside the Tim LeHayne religious propaganda. Thus, we hope that Mr. Phillips remains safe from those extremists.Mr. Phillips has provided Americans with an important, well-written, beautifully edited and impressive book. A generation from now, when historians look back at the fall and collapse of the United States, they will point to his book and say, \\"Ah, here is one guy who got it, and even warned about it, but like the oracles of old, he suffered greatly by being ignored simply because he was correct.\\"Some works of fiction make for great brain candy, and are fulfulling because they are hard to put down. Rarely does a non-fictional book take on difficult times, scary subjects and do it so well. Phillips' latest is hard to put down, even if his conclusions and findings are so disturbing. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is a lucid treatise in three sections: \`Oil and American Supremacy;' \`Too Many Preachers;' and \`Borrowed Prosperity.' Vital questions on the politics of energy, partisan religion versus science, and the nature (and sustainability) of economic productivity are raised with comparative profiles of previous (Spanish, Dutch, and British) superpowers in ascent and decline.Phillips measures up to his previous work (\`American Dynasty,' \`Wealth and Democracy,' etc) as a talented author and advocate. Those troubled by our lack of energy strategy, belief ascendant over science, and growing speculative financial services (debt) increasing at the expense of manufacturing and genuinely productive enterprise may find solace in this book.My only disappointment was the dedication: \\"To the millions of Republicans, present and lapsed, who have opposed the Bush dynasty and the disenlightenment of the 2000 and 2004 elections.\\" The text merits engagement of every American.Well written and well worth reading."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"On a business trip to Ashgabat, Turkmenistan and brought along \\"A Thousand Barrels a Second -- the coming oil breakpoint\\" (Tertzakian), \\"America at the Crossroads..Neoconserative Legacy\\" (Fukuyama), and \\"American Theocracy.\\" Also brought along my iPod with a number of PodCasts with Open Source programs. Man, what was I thinking?Turkmenistan is an autocratic theocracy, and a very surreal place. Gas is about six cents a gallon. The reason I mention this is visiting the place you get a sense of how impossible it is to change hundreds of years of cultures. I wonder if top administration officials had lived in a place like Turkmenistan they'd be as optomistic about Iraq? Not a chance.Anyway, I thought Fukuyama's book was the most interesting, policy-wise. Phillips book gets into the name-calling, but hey, this is a book about American politics. And the history and influene of big oil is a facinating subject. If you've never heard about Hubbert's Peak (like most members of Congress) you're probably a candidate for natural selection, but it's not too late. And of the three topics focused on, energy is the crucial one -- debt and too much religious influence are easily addressed (given the will).I hope that books like these stimulate a genuine effort to seriously confront our energy challenges.

I was especially impressed with the author's analysis of US debt in the last third of the book. This, I think, is most scary; the fact that we are subsidizing our lifestyle witih money borrowed from other nations against our future - and our children's future! I'm not as concerned as Phillips seems to be about the Christian Right - I think the American public is tired of them. And I have a great deal of confidence in the ability of new immigrant groups to keep us from the fates of early 20th c. Britain and the like. The author doesn't talk about this aspect of American culture, but I think it's an important and unique one. But if you think that the current occupants of the senior federal branch are self-serving, cynical and dull-witted, this book will not dissuade you!"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Here Kevin Phillips combines three modern political trends into a very compelling historical analysis. This includes America's ignorance of growing problems in energy resources, religious and political fundamentalism, and national debt. These three troublesome scenarios are covered in plenty of other books that deal with one of them exclusively. Phillips goes through each a little more sketchily than they deserve, but he has a winning sense of historical developments, in that these same trends were evident in the collapses of previous Western empires. The parallels that Phillips finds with old imperial downfalls are extremely worrisome for the thinking American, and he provides plenty of strong historical and statistical evidence. This entails the current administration's severe ideological addiction to oil, the influence of a growing conservative religious lobby on social and military policy, and an economy focused on credit and investment rather than manufacturing and development. Plus a governing style controlled by yes-men, a pandering to conservative extremism, and bombastic military hubris. This is an effective thesis from Phillips, and he has added credibility as a knowledgeable and informed Republican strategist.But while this book's conclusions are solid, there are some flaws in the way Phillips put his triple-pronged thesis together. Part I, about oil and energy policy, is thin and perfunctory, and is mostly quoted from stronger books on that subject (such as the masterful works of Paul Roberts and Michael T. Klare); while Phillips commits one severe oversight in forgetting about the massive subsidies enjoyed by the fossil fuels companies, which keep them artificially profitable and entrenched in the status quo while also unfairly holding back alternative technologies. Part II, in which Phillips analyzes the growing influence of Southern religion and culture on national politics, is the strongest and most chilling section of the book. We find that Southerners have now nationally fomented their culture of good/evil indignation, myopic millennialism (why talk about long-term social and economic policy when the Rapture is just around the corner?), and fundamentalist hostility to Church-and-State issues and world politics. However, Phillips misses the point that the Bush administration mostly coddles this coalition for the votes, and his mini-hypothesis about the Christian Right's collusion with the oil and credit industries is a bit of a stretch, socially and religiously. Part III focuses on the looming collapse of the American economy due to ballooning debt and speculative bubbles, and this portion is terrifyingly informative, though rather tiresome as Phillips tries to prop up the argument with a parade of repetitive statistics.In general, Phillips is really on to something here, and while the book is occasionally alarmist, the open-minded reader will see that there are real cautionary tales in his historical analysis. However, the overall three-part political philosophy just doesn't quite come together. But still, anyone concerned with America's future direction will be considerably swayed by this book's mostly powerful arguments.

If you consider yourself conservative, Christian and patriotic you may angrily dismiss it, but please do so on the basis of contrary evidence and post your review.Phillips never lets us know what his own religious leaning is. If it's Christian, it would add to his credibility. However, religious is not be a prerequisite for writing strong history. He makes a good case behind the premise that America like other empires before it will fail by over-extending militarily, letting our manufacturing base be superseded by finance and credit, ignoring the physics of energy and by becoming a theocracy. The parallels to The Netherlands, England and Spain are convincing.Anyone who loves America will be stunned. With relentless streams of scary statistics and eery historical similarities, he reads like a Steven King of political history. He has observed and written about the religious right's evolution for 25 years, since working for Ronald Reagan. What he says can't easily be dismissed as fiction or the ranting of the newly converted.It's sad that the GOP mainstream will be told what they need to know about the book and will take it on faith that they don't need to read it.

What makes American Theocracy even more frightening is that Phillips is a former Republican political strategist.Phillips' theory is that throughout history, world powers have lost their premier standing because of common factors. These factors include the inability to adapt to new energy sources, the influx of right-wing religions, and the crippling debt amassed by nations and individuals. He begins with the Roman Empire, and analyzes the downfalls of Rome, the Spanish Hapsburg Empire, the Dutch of the 17th Century and the English of the 19th Century. He then drawls parallels with what is happening now in the US. America is definitely on the decline as a world power if we can't overcome the mistakes of the present administration.The first section of American Theocracy details the history of energy sources. He begins with the Dutch and whale oil production and ends with the Iraqi War. While our current president might tell us that this war is about \\"freedom and democracy,\\" the actions of our troops tell us otherwise. After our invasions, the first building to be occupied by our troops was the Iraq Oil Ministry, home to thousands of oil maps.The section I found most disturbing was on religion. The religious right has hijacked the GOP to produce our nation's first religious party. It is hard to argue with a president who speaks with God, takes the Bible as literal truth, and believes that \\"the Almighty, not carbon dioxide, brings about climate change.\\" What is especially scary is when societies start disregarding science and logic for religious reasons. The Roman Empire of the 4th and 5th Century did just that when \\"Christian regimes closed famous libraries like the one in Alexandria, limited the availability of books, discarded the works of Aristotle and Ptolemy, and embraced the dismissal of Greek Logicians.\\" The effects of these policies lasted over 1000 years. Science in the US is in deep trouble as funding for research is cut, research universities lose their edge, and science and math scores for high school students plummet.American Theocracy should prove to be a wake-up call to Americans. Unfortunately, it is difficult to change the minds of those (our administration included) who believe they are doing God's will. Phillips quotes Harry Truman \\"The only thing new in the world is the history we don't know.\\" And as George Santayana explains, \\"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\" America will continue to follow down the same path of these other fallen world powers if we don't make some major changes, and soon."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Even if you know a lot of this stuff, it's bracing (to say the least) to see it all presented at once. It's the kind of book that may permanently taint your view of the future, and/or get you to start making worst-case-scenario plans in the event that \\"all the wheels come off at once\\".Especially interesting were the chapters on the history of \\"mainstream\\" and \\"outsider\\" churches in the US over the past two centuries (definitely a neglected topic, as the author points out) and the \\"southernization\\" of America. If Mr. Phillips' sterling credentials and decidedly non-left orientation aren't enough to convince you that this isn't a biased, one-sided polemic, you're probably unreachable."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"To read American Theocracy as I did in 2006 when it first came out, is to accept that you're likely to be more depressed about America's prospects than when you started. On three broad topics - the reliance of America on Middle East Oil, extremism in religion and the fast-growing financial debt and reliance on financing to shore up the economy - Phillips was both smack on and scarifying.The three years since have changed the picture, though Phillips' take is absolutely as pertinent today as it was then. The financial bubble he precisely laid out then, at the time a minority view, has exploded essentially as he predicted it would. But the country has come to some new realizations, and that and the other two problems are being addressed in some surprising ways. This was one of the most valuable books of 2006 and it is still one of the most valuable now, by way of measuring where we've come and where we have yet to go."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Like an earlier reviewer I decided to give \\"American Theocracy\\" 5 stars, although I do not think it is a perfect book.If I could talk with Kevin Phillips, I would raise two issues.First, are the \\"fringe groups\\" within Christianity really as influential as Phillips seems to believe they are? (I am speaking of groups like Christian Reconstructionists, not Southern Baptists or the Assembly of God Churches). I did not think that Phillips made a strong enough case for this. However, I would have thought that in the 21st century, people who regarded the biblical book of Genesis as science would be considered as marginal and quirky as flat-earthers. That so many of us do accept Genesis \\"literally,\\" is frightening. And, like every other kind of Christian, conservative and evangelical Christians are quite selective in what they regard as biblical truth. That this selectivity influences U.S. politics is also frightening.My other concern has to do with Phillips' references to the costs of people's labor in various countries. In one part of the book, he states that Germany, Japan and Switzerland successfully export manufactured goods in spite of high labor costs. In another part of the book, he states that China and India's relatively low labor costs will be a big help in their becoming leading economic powers in the world. How are both statements true?Nevertheless, I think this is an excellent book which every American concerned about our future should read.But if we believe Phillips, what do we do about it? Why won't we support the leadership that we need? What won't we vote for leaders who will address the concerns Phillips raises? Why do we always seem to vote for a representative or senator who promises to do nice things for our district or state, instead of challenging us to work for the good of all?And why won't we change our selfish, greedy habits of consumption, where it's everyone for him or herself?If all of Phillips' predictions come to pass, Americans will have no one but ourselves to blame."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I was amazed the 1st 97 pages of this book. It confirmed my beliefs that American Over Seas Policy is driven by corporations, peak oil theory, and clandestine operations. It also points out that it does not matter who in the White House, providing interesting documentation to prove this. Then it points out the many connections between the our politicians and the oil business, and the revolving door that exist between the corporate world and high public office. Dick Cheney is possibly the most powerful man in the world, being at the corner of the White House and Haliburton. I have thought these things for years, but the author's research is astounding!The 2nd second section of the book is about how religion influences America's politics, and to be honest my eyes glazed over during this section. I tried to read it, but could not follow the thinking. My eyes glazed over and I did not get it, that is why I only gave the book 3 stars.The book also covers key points of the book American Dynasty, by the same author, of how the Bush Clan operates. The book provides a history of oil from ancient times to present, which is useful. The author also explains the reasons for the invasion of Iraq,and the explains a timeline that is amazing. The author explains world politics around oil, the American dollar , and the Reserve Currency status of the dollar. Common beliefs about the oil supply that Republicans put out there are shattered one by by one. The book made sense, and when combined with the footnoted material it will shatters your beliefs about why America does anything. The author writes about the pending financial crisis, as this book was written in 2006; he does so looking forward about the problems obvious in 2006: Social Security, Medicare, Deficits, and credit bubbles. The whole time your reading the book, minus the religious section, you just keep saying wow about every page or two!I read the book twice in a few weeks......and that does not happen often.You could skip the religion section of the book, and the book would stand alone.

You can't use God as an excuse for hatred or to do harm to other nations. When you use God, you take away the right of others to doubt and criticize you legitimately. Also our demands for oil and how we borrow money will destroy this nation. It is a wake up call for those who care for this nation to ignore the Christian right and get really right!

The book offers a good overview of some very ominous trends. Something I wish he had spent more time on is counter-vailing trends like the world-wide growth in renewables, the rise of progressive spirituality (see New Dimensions Broadcasting or Sojo.net), and the expanding tentacles of honest media (Free Speech TV, documentaries like \\"The Corporation,\\" and publishers like New Society and South End Press).The other issue I have is with the term \\"Christian fundamentalism.\\" It seems many of the people who promote or have been ensnared by this imperial theology have little to do with the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ. Rather, Satan seems to be the guiding force of the right-wing and its lust for money, its cultivation of confusion, and its celebration of militarism. The crosses currently used as an accoutrement should be replaced with pentagrams; or maybe Pentagons.For more info on satanic fundamentalism, I'd recommend the books and blog of Chip Berlet.\\"When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.\\" -Upton Sinclair"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in the last year.

The fact that Phillips was the intellectual architect of the Republican Party's \\"southern strategy\\" which allowed everything he now decries to develop only adds to its poignancy. Because Phillips attempts so much, however, he is bound to overreach. That's a fault, though, that can be easily remedied by adding a couple of excellent new volumes on kindred topics to your reading list. For a better appreciation of the deep historical background to the Iraq War, I would start with Greg Grandin's breathtaking new book about US involvement in Latin America, from the early nineteenth century forward. It's called \\"Empire's Workshop.\\" Stephen Kinzer's \\"Overthrow\\" is also worthwhile, though less historically grounded."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This book describes in utmost detail how religion defines politics and why as a conservative religious institution in place at the white house, we make the moves that we do.

We have heedlessly used up our own oil and must therefore secure someone else's for our use. A goodly portion of the Republican supporters believe God will provide, or that the impending cataclysm is the beginning of a beloved end-times. And since we have sent our factories off to where the destitute vie for the work, we try to sustain prosperity by borrowing money and purchasing each other's stuff.If another country were so positioned, we might feel compassion (or disdain). But since this is us, our blinders are snug in place as we lock-step on down this path."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Then the remaining one-third is shot through with doubtful connections. The author commendably states clearly his three big topics right off the bat: 1. Oil is \\"done\\"; 2. Religion in America is poisoning us; 3. The US is drowning in debt. Topics #1 and #3 as stated in \\"American Theocracy\\" have been shown to be largely untrue by many, many sources, and #2 seems to conclude that Americans are bad because we let religion (fundamental kinds, anyway) drive us to all sorts of homicidal and larcenous behaviors. Southern Americans, anyway. Actually southern white Americans of English/Dutch/ sometimes Celtic/sometimes German/sometimes other ethnic origins. These awful prejudices unfortunately weave through the whole book.The book in one sense is well-written, though. The line of arguments are clearly stated, and the facts and stories Kevin Phillips chooses to write about can sometimes be interesting and informative. As many reviewers noted, there are pounds of research cited and statistics listed. The problem is that he is extremely selective about which he presents. In the \\"oil\\" segment, for example, you will find almost no mention of experts who estimate the relatively long period of oil reserves worldwide (one actually makes a cameo appearance, and the reader is hereby challenged to find it!). Nor does he cite the fact that estimated reserves have always, always edged upwards. In the \\"religion\\" segment he makes a quite-wrong statement about Newt Gingrich's historical fiction series on the Civil War, meaning he could not have actually read the books. With this kind of selective reporting, one cannot sift the truth of his arguments. Then there is the ending: there isn't one. No summary, no conclusions, no points for action. After all that.For the sake of backing up the title of this review, the badly-misleading part of the \\"debt\\" section in this book concerns the author's own - perhaps unwitting - argument against himself. He actually stated that the amount of total personal savings was greater than the total personal debt. Gracious, mendacious! If the statistics sound overwhelming in this section of the book, the reader is invited to skim over them, because they are hard to trust anyway.In spite of these rather harsh judgments (and overly long review!), \\"American Theocracy\\" really is interesting. The prudent reader will discount the alternating condescension and panic, and just enjoy the discussion. If you are inclined to think as the author does, you will certainly like the debating points you could use. If you are inclined to dismiss the author's point of views, then don't - just read it. If you are wary of what a leftist-in-charge might do, then note the line of argument and hone your own."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This book is a great analysis of three of the major problems in today's U.S.: the end of cheap oil, the rise of fundamentalist Christianity, and the debt explosion. Phillips blames the Republicans for much of this, but also points out that the Democrats are far from being ready for prime time on any of this. Both parties have been falling over themselves to promote unworkable social-planning abstractions. I tend to agree.Some great quotes from the book:\\"Slowly but surely, the U.S. military is being converted into a global oil-protection service.\\"\\"The arguable rights of women (or parents) are being displaced by the rights of embryos or by the prerogative of sperm and egg to join, decisions rooted largely in theology, not science. Perhaps the preoccupation involves maximizing the soul count for the hereafter. . . . . The Bible abounds with the killing of those already born, both by God and by lawful authorities.\\"\\"These days, it seems, they also serve who spend like there's no tomorrow.\\"I especially liked the discussion of how the financial sector has become the dominant U.S. industry. Phillips makes clear that banks and other financial services have become the favored industry, to be bailed out by the government even while others go under. Phillips doesn't discuss student loans, but I think the state of the industry supports his thesis: American higher education has become a sideline of the student loan industry."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"God bless Kevin Phillips. His heart is in the right place: against the rule of the oil companies, against rampant globilization, and especially against the radical Christian Right. But he tries too hard in this book to join together many things which don't really belong together.The heart of this book is an attack on and analysis of the Christian Right in America which is probably the greatest danger to democracy America has ever faced. Phillips admirably demonstrates the tactics and goals of the religious Right and the Southern base it depends on. One can only hope he is right in seeing a tremendous backlash against this use of mindless religion to turn American back hundreds of years.He is also right in seeing the evil influence of the oil companies on American government and the dangers of excessive indebtedness.What hold these themes together is only the fact that George Bush is president: a man controlled by oil, oblivious to financial disaster, and beholden to the evil Christian fundamentalists. The fact that Bush, a man from the elite of New England, could embrace redneck Christianity is appalling enough. His father also went to Texas and started eating pork rinds. When you leave the Northeast anything can happen!But Kevin Phillips tries too hard to connect these to something more than George Bush. He tries, for instance, to show that the empires of the past -- Rome, Holland, Britain, -- all failed because of religious excess. Actually they failed because of their competition -- especially the British competition with the Dutch and the German competition with the British. I would love to believe that religion had a place in the decline of these empires -- since I believe religion to be a serious mental disease -- but Phillips cannot establish this. George Bush is the only connection between fiscal, energy, and intellectual decline -- bad enough to be sure, but not explicable in Phillips' imagined way.Nevertheless, if people take this book seriously they will at least become vigilant against the Christian fanatics who seem hell bent on destroying this nation. Our involvement in Iraq is what they have accomplished and we must guard against it ever happening again. The first thing to do is to vote Bush and all Republicans out of office totally. Phillips demonstrates that the Republican Party is the anti-American party and the party of repression and ignorance."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I liked this book a lot, but I couldn't help thinking that much of what was in it has been said by more radical writers, like Noam Chomsky or Tariq Ali.

If anybody should be familiar, it is he. The core of Nixon's \\"Southern Strategy\\" was to use RACE as a bait in getting white southerns to vote. Using the civil rights movement and protest on Vietnam war as an excuse to enforce law and order frenzy, the use of fear as political weapon was strong then as is now post 9-11. Don't underestimate the politics of boogy man."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips makes some good points--over and over and over again. Big Oil has a dangerous degree of influence over the US and its policies. The Republican Party is in the sway of the religious right and the fundamentalists. There is a corresponding degree of clout in the southern states--reversing the reults of the Civil War. We have too much debt, in government, in families, in American businesses. All of this makes the future scary and could lead to the downfall of American preeminence, influence, etc. It happened before with Spain, the Netherlands and Great Britain. Dynastic leadership is bad for America. (OK, that was Phillips' last book, but he continues the drumbeat.) That's it, for this very pessimistic and depressing book. To me it seemed to be a literary fillibuster. Lots of data. Lots of redundency. There may be enough insight here to justify a couple of extended magazine articles. But a book? No way."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend as persuasive that theocracy threatened America. The book is actually about three things: peak oil, the influence of the radical Christian right, and an economy financed by debt. The author links these three things by means of the Bush administrations, both of whom hailed from the oil industry, achieved political power by means of an appeal to the Christian right and furthered an explosion of dependence upon debt financing in both private and public sectors.Kevin Phillips is a noted political commentator who predicted the shift of the south from a Democratic stronghold to a Republican one. His career started as a Republican strategist for Richard Nixon, but he has shifted to being one of the party's harshest critics. He is particularly damming of both senior and junior Bush administrations. He suggests parallels between current US trends and the decline of the hegemonies of Spain, Holland and England in earlier centuries. The book was first published in 2006 and subsequent years have seen significant developments in all three of the areas he treats. To me these developments illustrate the hazards of macro historical predictions. Although Kevin Phillips was sometimes right in the past, some of his concerns have been overtaken by events.Starting from the back as it were, the financial collapse in 2008 was, in fact, the result of an inability to obtain credit. Although Americans had been buying homes as though their values would climb indefinitely, there proved to be limits on how much money could be borrowed. There are conflicting accounts on the exact causes of the collapse, but the Government Supported Entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, almost surely played an important role. The scope of their activity in mortgage markets was greatly expanded by the Clinton administration and encouraged still more by George W. Bush. However, financing consumer goods with debt has a trajectory that extends over several decades. It cannot be laid at the foot of a particular administration. One of the largest areas of consumer debt is now higher education, in which Democratic administrations have had an initiating role. No one would claim that higher education is a Republican enclave. The issue of how to address government debt and the funding of future government liabilities in health and social security is the main subject of current political discourse.Mr. Phillips is no friend of religion, but his weapon against it is condescension. He is relentlessly condescending towards people of faith. Condescension is a substitute here for reasoned argument. It is not that Mr. Phillips fails to present facts. It is that his facts fail to back his argument. For example, he gives no example of religious right influence that was not achieved by means of the ballot box. He refers to the belief in the return of Jesus Christ as part of radical right wing Christianity, but this belief harkens back to the very beginning of Christianity, in fact, to Jesus' own words. It is mentioned in the Apostles' Creed and is intrinsic to Christian orthodoxy. He is dismissive of belief in Creation, but the authors of America's founding documents believed in Creation and that the Creator was the author of our \\"inalienable rights.\\" He conflates government support for faith-based organizations with an undesirable intrusion of religion into public life, but the grounds for this support was the fact that such faith-based organizations have had demonstrably better results in preventing recidivism in former prison inmates and in recovery from drug addiction. The irony is that the initiative to support faith-based organizations was subsequently defeated in George W. Bush's first term by a coalition of liberals and conservative Christians, the latter fearing an undesirable intrusion of government into religion. This is all to the detriment of valuable public service performed by religious organizations.The charge of \\"theocracy\\" is really an effort to drive people with religious faith from the public square. Nowhere does Mr. Phillips show that people of religious faith circumvent or subvert the democratic process. In fact, the situation is exactly the opposite. One is left with the conclusion that Mr. Phillips opposes the influence of religious people in public life because he disagrees with their beliefs. Despite the fact that many highly educated people, physicians, scientists, lawyers, etc. attend evangelical and conservative churches, they are by definition obscurantist and ill-informed simply because they are religious. It is Mr. Phillips who is disdainful of democracy.We are left with peak oil. But this has clearly been overtaken by events. Energy production is rising in the United States and there are predictions that the US will not only become self-sufficient in energy, but actually be an energy exporter over the next decade. So much for macro economic forecasting.I am tempted to give the book five stars for being a good example of a bad argument. But this might be misconstrued-so one star only."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"helps to make sense of the insanity that's infested USA politics domestic and foreign policy in the last quarter century, with emphasis on the last 6 years."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"\\"American Theocracy\\", the startling new book by longtime Republican Kevin Phillips, details a pessimistic view of the United States today and an even less rosy picture for the future. Phillips writes what an increasing number of Americans think.....the country is being run by religious right-wingers who have far too much power. Garnering and presenting facts and figures, Phillips is one to listen to as he also knows a thing or two about prognostication....he's been deadly accurate before.It's refreshing to hear Phillips as he weaves together histories of Spain, Holland and Britain, how their empires grew and ultimately collapsed and their collective comparison to the United States today. The author centers on three areas about which Americans should be very concerned....our over-reliance on oil, our soaring debt and the frightening new religious base of the Republican party.Phillips says that the connection of oil to the invasion of Iraq was one of the most underrated stories of the war. As George Bush would have liked it, the oil wells of Iraq would be under American control by now and we would be dictating who got Iraqi oil and how much it would cost. The immense failure of the Bush team in Iraq is but one of a plethora of disasters brought on by the current administration. Phillips, an ardent foe of the Bush \\"dynasty\\", mirrors the view of a majority of Americans who feel that Bush is inept. He minces no words about it, either.The author is good at relating how and why the debt is a growing problem. The loss of manufacturing as a basic tool in the American economy has been replaced by finance. As he points out, certain preceding empires (the ones mentioned above) all began with agriculture as an economic base and proceeded through to climaxes which ended in reliance on finance. He speaks of \\"rentier cultures\\"...(\\"rentier\\" being a French word that means a person living off unearned income... the United States now having a myriad of people in that category) as one sign of an empire's doomed fate.Regarding religion, (the last of the three areas upon which Phillips discusses) the mainline Republican party of a generation ago went south, turned hard right and discovered religion. The fringe elements became the core and made the present-day Republican party the first truly religious party in our history. Here Phillips gets most impassioned, and for good reason...the anti-science, pro-faith, Armageddon-waiting fundamentalists have stripped the once middle-of-the-road Republican party of their respectability. The dangers, he reminds us, are that this new core of Republicans are in control of all three branches of government. They've caused havoc already and haven't ceased yet.\\"American Theocracy\\" sometimes has a textbook feel to it as Phillips writes as he sounds on tv.....informative, but dry. What he has to say, though, however provocative, should be a wake-up call to those millions of Americans who want to turn the country around. I highly recommend this book for its forthright message and terrific insight."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips most recent book, American Theocracy, chronicles the growth of the Religious Right in the past 50 years.

This is an exceptional book and should be read by everyone.A"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"In his latest book, Kevin Phillips draws an alarming picture of where we are politically and where we are heading.Unlike other best-selling polemics, \\"American Theocracy\\" is extensively researched and, for the most part, persuasive.Phillips, a former Republican strategist and current media pundit, has an impressive tack record. Almost four decades ago as a young political strategist for the Republican Party, he wrote a remarkable book called \\"The Emerging Republican Majority.\\"Published in 1969, he forecast the movement of people from the industrialized north to the south and the west would produce a conservative Republican majority that would dominate American politics for decades. The benefit, he wrote, was that it would restore stability and order to a society that was experiencing disorienting and at times violent change.Although controversial at the time, it was the first book I read that forecast what, now, is history.Shortly before publishing that book, the author joined the Nixon administration. He hoped to advance his forecast changes. Although a prolific political commentator, he has lost his enthusiasm during the ensuing decades for the Republican majority he forecast and helped create.In his latest book, Phillips identifies three trends which threaten the United States' future:1. The defining, yet distorting role of oil in foreign and domestic policy.2. Religion's growing intrusion in politics and government.3. Debt's astonishing growth.Using these three themes, Phillips weaves a convincing and well-written condemnation of the failure of our leaders to look beyond their self-interest and immediate ambitions to plan for the country's future.Although he continues the trend of his recent books to be critical of the policies of the current Bush Administration, for the most part, the author avoids inflammatory invectivesRather he uses training as a lawyer, to deliver a skillful and thought-provoking indictment against this country's leadership. However, unlike his first book, Phillips fails to offer the reader an original prescription for this country's current problems.Never-the less, this book's broad and structural discussion of political and social changes makes it worth reading. Phillips' passionless discussion draws a portrait of American society that readers may not welcome.Yet, they will ignore it at their peril."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I certainly hope that every American of voting age will read Kevin Phillips' newest book, \\"American Theocracy,\\" but I suspect that is asking too much. Most of America's citizens, it seems, are too concerned with other interests than learning about what is going on in their country and how the current policies of their government may affect their future. This is not so much a criticism as simply an observation based on polls I've seen and \\"man (or woman!)-in-the-street\\" interviews I've heard on the national media. From that little evidence, I have surmised that not many ordinary people get concerned about the country's sociopolitical direction until it affects them personally.That being said, I want to highly recommend \\"American Theocracy.\\" I have read many of Phillips' books before this, but I think this may be his most important one yet. The author, for those who are not familiar with him, is a former strategist for the Republican Party, the very party which is now in control of the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. And this book is a devastating critique of contemporary Republicanism (the party, not the political theory!) and especially it is an indictment of the current Bush administration and its programs and policies.Phillips clearly summarizes the present problem with the Bush White House in his preface: \\"Since the elections of 2000 and especially of 2004, three pillars have become increasingly central: (1) the oil-national security complex, with its pervasive interests; (2) the religious right, with its doctrinal imperatives and massive electorate; and (3) the debt-dealing financial sector, which extends far beyond the old symbolism of Wall Street.\\" I could not agree more, and I've been an acute observer of national and local politics for over half a century (B.A. in political science, 1960).Furthermore, as if to drive his point home, Phillips states later that the Bush family \\"...over multiple generations, has been tied to a politics that conjoined finance, national security, and oil. In recent decades, operating from the federal executive branch, the Bushes have added close ties to evangelical and fundamentalist power brokers of many persuasions.\\" Again, later in the book, the author emphasizes that \\"More than any other U.S. political family, the Bushes exemplify the interaction of oil interests, the financial sector, the military-industrial complex, and the intelligence community.\\"I have no quibble with the oil-interest argument on the part of George Bush. I never thought from the beginning of the current Iraq War that we were interested in protecting anything else but oil for the American market. Although I temporarily accepted Bush's claim regarding weapons of mass destruction as a reason to attack Iraq, this soon made no sense, and I rejected that, and later it was shown to be fictitious. Since Saddam Hussein had not presented an immediate threat to the United States, I could only conclude that we had made a preemptive strike on an independent country without justification. In other words, under the \\"just-war\\" theory, there was no objective justification for doing what we, in fact, did.The above refers only to Part One of Phillips' book which is titled \\"Oil and American Supremacy.\\" This is only one leg of the problem which he discusses. Far more of a problem, in my view, is what he discusses in Part Two: \\"Too Many Preachers.\\" The author says that \\"If anything, the United States of the early 2000s, for all that it lacked Britain's established church, was under George W. Bush in the grip of a considerably more powerful religiosity, constituency pressure, and biblical worldview.\\" This is fearful stuff and demands attention. While Phillips probes into the web of the many characters who constitute the so-called \\"religious right\\" and appear to have influence over the Bush administration, one name especially popped out for me: the Reverend Tim LaHaye. He is involved with the \\"Left Behind\\" series of books which have become bestsellers in recent years and deal with the \\"end times\\" or Armageddon.I became familiar with LaHaye and his writings back in the distant 1960s or 70s, as I recall. Sometime during that period, Reverend LaHaye, who is a fundamentalist Christian minister, wrote and published a book about sexuality and, more specifically, about homosexuality, even before that topic became the controversial issue it is today. I remember thinking at the time, after reading his book, what a piece of pseudo-scientific \\"garbage\\" it was and that this guy would never make it into the major leagues of book publishing. Well, evidently, I was wrong. LaHaye's \\"Left Behind\\" series has reportedly sold tens of millions of copies.According to Phillips, \\"the surge of fundamentalist and evangelical religion in the United States, outlining the way a long tradition of radical and sectarian religion has taken an unprecedented political role under George W. Bush, as more and more Republicans think in apocalyptic terms and seek to shape domestic and foreign policy around religion.\\" LaHaye is supposedly part of this \\"surge,\\" as are Jerry Falwell and Pat Robinson and others. If, in fact, Bush is being advised or influenced by people such as this, then that might explain why President Bush appears to be so little concerned about what is happening \\"now\\" in the world and hasn't tried much to communicate with the American public at large.Part Three of the book, \\"Borrowed Prosperity,\\" should be of interest to everyone, although it is also a retreat into the rather arcane subject-matter of economics and may be too dry to keep most people's attention. However, there is no doubt that current the public and private debt being incurred in America is a genuine threat to its future. The Bush administration is spending money like there's no tomorrow, and the average individual, according to Phillips, is spending more money than he or she makes in income. This situation has potential disaster written all over it.This is must reading for everyone. Everything Phillips says is worthy of immediate attention."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"As someone who grew up in a conservative mormon household, went to a conservative mormon college and was one of the 17% of BS degrees granted in the sciences in 2001, I can tell you that Mr. Phillips research and ideas are on point.Yes, the republican party is leaning more and more heavily on biblical phrases and broadly supports a \\"biblical worldview.\\" Yes, Mormons, and many other evangelical and protestant groups, are teaching that evolution is a lie, that the earth is \\"full enough and to spare\\" with respect to natural resources and that the end is nigh.Yes, Mormons and many other groups are teaching lax fiscal strategies from the pulpits. For example the Mormon prophets have gone from teaching saving to teaching that we should not wait to have children until after our debt is managed.We are falling behind as a nation, especially in math and science. We are over-burdened by debt and using our homes as ATMs. We are unwilling to conserve our resources our invest in our country's future. We are at war with Iraq because we need oil. My husband, while serving overseas did spend all of his time guarding Iraqi oil platforms. And this war was sold to us as a battle of good v. evil, not as a resource war, which it is.And as a geologist I can tell you that we are nearing the maturation point for Saudi oil supply.This book is a wake-up call for America. It is time to individually look at our finances and at our futures and change our ways. Otherwise, yes, we will follow the decline of the other great nations who came before us."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips is one of a now rare community: a true conservative with deep felt convictions with whom one can disagree but nevertheless regard (and in turn be regarded by) as an honorable, upright individual. In American Theocracy Phillips analyzes the disturbing evidence that the United States, like the Roman Empire, the Dutch Republic, Hapsburg Spain, and the British Empire, is now experiencing numerous danger signs of a precipitous economic, political, and spiritual decline. With what must have been among the most painful words Phillips has ever written, the predictor of today's Republican dominance points the finger of blame squarely at the Grand Old Party and its leadership.The book is divided into three parts. Parts 1 and 3 deal primarily with economic matters, Oil and Debt. The desire to control and protect petroleum supplies for the Western industrial economies is traced from the early twentieth century to the present. Like British dependence on coal in the 19th century, Western oil dependence has led us into questionable economic and political decisions and most recently has embroiled us in the Iraq debacle. Much of what he reveals has been reported before, but now we have all the links completed and the necessary conclusions made clear. In the third section Phillips again reveals his true conservatism, decrying the deficit spending and budget gaps and forewarning us of any number of probable disasters lurking in the future.I wanted to discuss the second section most thoroughly since it hits closest to home with me: the influence of the American South and of \\"conservative\\" churches and denominations on the US political system. As a 15-generation Southerner with seven Confederate veteran great-great-grandfathers, I yield to no one in my pride in and love for the American South. Yet despite the fact that I still get a lump in my throat when I think of all those men in gray going off to fight for a hopeless cause, I am not morally blind enough to believe that all parts of that cause were noble or deserving of present day praise, and I find it deeply insulting when a political party attempts to gain my support as a Southerner by championing (albeit in kinder, gentler guise) that same cause today. Phillips makes it very clear that the GOP's Southern Strategy of fomenting racial divisions (which Phillips helped create) is alive and well. Phillips also decries the Republican distortion of religion: seeking political gain by cynically exploiting the fervor of truly believing and faithful Christians and causing good people to become convinced that the path to Heaven lies through an agenda of right wing social change injurious to their own economic and moral self-interests. Here again I am affected personally. I am a member of one of the churches targeted by the Republicans, and while our congregations, unlike the Southern Baptists and other denominations, do not typically take overt political actions, the atmosphere in some of our churches has become less pleasant for those members who do not agree with Republican politics. This distortion of religious faith is catalogued with great detail and readily apparent anguish by Phillips, particularly when he details the Republicans' readiness to exploit those who believe the theologically groundless rapture/end times doctrines.Throughout American Theocracy, and particularly in the second section, Phillips warns the United States by drawing parallels with similar situations in past societies. He spares none of his party's leadership, particularly George W. Bush himself, who is either the most cynical of them all or a hapless stooge. especially their absolute refusal to take into consideration criticisms by other leaders here and abroad. He also warns that while the Republican coalition is too narrow and self-absorbed to govern effectively or even survive, the Democrats have not yet come up with a plausible alternative.America should be grateful to Kevin Phillips, who has the courage to stand up and say that his own political party has abandoned honorable conservatism and has become captive to its Radical Right Wing. It is to be hoped that there is time before the 2006 and 2008 elections for principled men and women in all American political parties to take up the challenge and take our country back from Theocracy."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Old-school economic Conservative Kevin Phillips confronts some of the most vexing issues facing the United States today. Pulling no punches in this enthralling volume, Phillips blasts some of the most dangerous wings of the right today, namely madcap religious fundamentalists and big spending pet-project-earmark-pushing Republicans who no longer have Democrats to hide behind now that they're in control of the National Senate, House, and White House. While not a perfect academic work as far as citing sources, the author forcefully debates real issues which threaten to have long-term effects on us and our children.As a non-partisan without party affiliation, I appreciate Phillips stand and introspection concerning his own party's beliefs and actions. It takes a lot of courage to examine those in power. Our leaders have shown they need constant supervision and shouldn't have a free pass to do whatever they please. Conservative, liberal, or otherwise, they work for and represent us--We The People! So Phillips willingness to step up and provoke the wrath of the mealymouthed yes-men now weilding control over so much (media, gas, taxes) is welcome.We should worry about issues concerning our constitutional rights, and we most certainly should be concerned about the absurd build-up of debt, loss of jobs in the American Manufacturing sector, and the insidious spread of blind irreason in our society. Looking at the madness of theocratic regimes such as Iran should have kept our vision straight and sober. It is time for people to act and express their discontent with the present embarassing incompetence in government. Bravo, Mr. Phillips."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"No policy answers or panaceas, but an impressive description and analysis of how the U.S. got into its present predicament(s).I had heard brief commentaries by Kevin Phillips on the radio over recent years, and increasingly came to respect his analyses. Recently I picked up his newt book, American Theocracy. After a quick perusal - cover blurb, intro, and chapter headings - I started skimming (in my graduate student mode). Part I, Oil and American Supremacy, was easy to skim because many of these topics have been prominent in the news over recent years, including an assessment of how AND WHY how Bush et. al. put us in Iraq. Of particular interest were petroleum- related foreign policy cases from previous decades. By the end of Part I I was reading everything. The material is too meaty and interesting to skim, even for someone who always reads hurriedly.I did not even try to skim most of Parts II (radicalized/political religion) and III (public debt and its associations). The were too interesting. As in Part I, the author brings together cases from distant historical epochs, drawing on a wealth of literature on the various topics, including some sources I had read (scholarly studies) over the years.In sum, this is a valuable and interesting book, and 400 pp of text is not too long given the wealth of good material."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The author goes over three things that undoubtedly have had and will continue to have a major impact on the way we live and more importantly the way our grandchildren may live (or not). These things are: 1) our addiction to oil and some alarming indicators of where it is and where it mostly was and but is now past peak - like Saudi Arabia. 2) His second section covers the alarming trends in the takeover of government by religious zeal (if ye be not for us - ye be against us) and 3) lastly, he covers our position on the predictive curve of major society maturation and decay. He says we are past the point of making money by producing real product and are entering the phase where all we do is manage money, while India and China are now entering the phase of major wealth creation (and concomitant use of resources/creation of pollution). This book, if even half of it is true, is a clarion call for us to re-examine where we are going and how we really want to live. Must reading for all who lead - Congressmen, Senators, and elected and appointed officials at all levels, federal, state, and local and most importantly, for serious voters right now.Retired Colonel - nattybumppo"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"While not a perfect book, I feel it deserves five stars because it has stimulating discussion of inescapable trends of American life, and their frightening parallels to the experiences of other great powers, specifically Britain, the Netherlands, and Spain.Phillips divides the book into specific sections which discuss, first, the role of Big Oil and energy in the development of our current system and how it might lock us in to a future that will see other nations develop alternatives to oil as oil reaches its peak in the next decade or two. Next he discusses, descriptively, the development of evangelical and apocalyptic religion in America in recent decades, and its role and dominating influence in the Republican Party, especially in the era of George W. Bush's presidency. This element leads to dogmatic rejection of scientific study and understanding, and policymaking that hews to the ideological framework of the Republican base. The third major area is the increasing burden of debt in American society, and the uncertain future that we face, by increasingly being at the mercy of Asian central banks that now hold vast amounts of our debt. He warns that they may decide to ease out of dollars and convert their holdings to euros or other currencies, which could precipitate a major economic decline in the US.Given these three trends, and the likelihood they will continue until a crisis occurs, Phillips is ultimately pessimistic about our future, and strongly suggests that the 2010s and 2020s will be decades of reckoning as the ultimate consequences of these patterns are experienced.One strong criticism I have of this book is that he does not spend nearly enough time discussing the role of the media in fostering these trends. He talks only briefly about how media reinforce attitudes, but he should have augmented his case by explaining how conservative media outlets like Fox News, The Washington Times, and internet websites create a powerful ideological network that sends repeated messages that keep the faithful supplied with Republican talking points, and which keep the Republican base energized and focused on electoral triumphs. Perhaps in his next book, which we can no doubt expect within the year, given how prolific he has been recently, he will spell this out in greater detail.All in all, whether you like him or not, Phillips has made an important contribution to the discussion about the elements of our current political, social, and economic difficulties."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips writes a very detailed explanation of how different special interests have brought about the current American crisis. The book is roughly divided into thirds: oil, religion, and credit. Phillips starts very slowly, but picks up when he gets past oil. His anger at the religious right is palpable, and he makes his case against their excesses clearly and with great rigor. The third section on credit moved along more quickly than I expected. The book is well researched, the examples plainly described."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"American Theocracy is an extraordinary piece of sustained analysis of the political and economic future of the United States. Its argument based on the work of Kennedy is that the country is in a terminal decline due to a mixture of radical religion, oil dependence and chronic debt.As a former Republican analyst, Phillips is clearly disenchanted with the direction of the Republican Party and the Bush family. He makes a clear and convincing case that the US is going down the wrong path.I did have some quibbles in that he is constantly refering to his previous books as though they were standard works. A work needs to stand clearly on its own legs.Secondly, I would have liked some call to action to address the issues he raises. The book paints a bleak picture and then provides no roadmap or even a suggestion of where the United States should be heading."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"For a start, this book is right about everything it says.It talks about corruption, mounting debt that could soon ruin this country, weird and wonderful religions, and the dangerous selling of oil.This book is fantastic for people with an opinion on just about everything,(just like me!)He has establised himself as one of the leading and most harsh political critics in the whole of the U.S.A!And with his stunning new book, it's bound to blow you away."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"In American Theocracy, Phillips examines valid points relating to the influence of religion, debt and oil on our political process. I found the book interesting and the concepts enlightening. However, the book soon becomes redundant, stating the same points, with some minor differences, over and over again. Perhaps the abridged version of this book would be better, but my reading of the unabridged version seemed to last much longer than it should have. However, the concepts were informative and useful in understanding current political events."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This book is one of the best about our nation's current plight if, like me, you look around and do not like what you see. Phillips' also does not mudsling and gives sober, considered thought to the subjects of his book. This and being a former Republican strategist of the highest order will most likely garner him knee-jerk praise from the left and a particular level of venom from the right.The war in Iraq is there, but not center stage as many books place it. It is the technicolor, prime example of what is happening in America but Phillips' digs beyond this. I am a Veteran and am struggling to understand why we are in this war and what good, if any, will come of it. Phillips' book does not address the tactical errors of the war, which most books about it do, or pretends that history begins on 9/11 as many want us to believe.Phillips' book is far deeper than this. Most books out about the current administration and its policies are by journalists. They have their place but generally can not see the forest for the trees. These other books connect dots; they match up one group or person with another, a certain meeting and what was said to a later policy development, current issue stances to action or former issue stances, etc with a \\"gotcha\\" feel but no analysis of trends or movements. They simply match up associated things/people/groups/interests without investigating why or how they are related. They help us to be informed but not to think critically. Historians tend to use those \\"dots\\" to find an undercurrent of feeling or culture to help us see how those dots are connected into a larger picture rather than simply drawing a line between them. Phillips does this brilliantly and what makes the book have more impact than say, a history of the Napoleonic Wars, is that we are living with the cultural trends and their results from previous years that Phillips' examines with a historical eye.Phillips' does not give you a ready made opinion. He simply lays out a scholarly argument that would take as much scholarship to refute. He answers the more important questions that we often do not hear asked or approached by today's journalists or mass-media. To keep with the Iraq War point, journalists ask what mistakes we have made in its execution or should we have invaded Iraq. The book eschews these surface, although important questions, and asks what developments in the American political and social landscape allowed us to entertain the notion of invading Iraq much less actually doing it? He does this with all the topics in his book by probing them from their genesis, chrysalises, current states and alliances. Again, this book is written like a history book and so it requires some effort and critical thought on the reader's part to fully enjoy and gain some level of wisdom.Phillips' is also a good writer as well as a scholarly historian. He displays some wit and also writes in a manner that will feel comfortable to the highly educated as well as the not-so-highly educated. I can not help but hear his New England, George Plimpton-esque tones when I read the book. Watch some of his interviews and you will begin to understnad when he makes jokes. Finishing the book is felt as a worthwhile accomplishment rather than a task to complete. I may be more interested in the subjects than most but I read it in three days. Those of you who are equally curious will tackle this book in no time. Phillips' also dilligently citates his sources so anyone can scrutinize his sources and come to their own conclusions form the same data he has used.Phillips' does not fall into the trap of stating what is right or wrong. Though I know he does not approve of the Bush administration's policies and actions he stays away from pointing this out. He lays out arguments of actions and their consequences rather than arguing for what we should or should not do and what is right vs. wrong.Each section on the various influences mentioned in the subtitle are given extensive treatment. Were the book divided into sections rather than tying them all together, they would be equally salient on their own. This also allows the reader to pick what parts of the political problems we are having that the book treats, to focus on for edification. Phillips' use of other historical powers without equal and their decline as models are also important to show that we face the same problems and how we deal with them is in line with the inappropriate action or inaction of those other powers and so we can expect much the same fate lest we correct course. As he points out, there have been several \\"New Jerusalems\\" in history who have not gotten divine intercession to save them, mainly from their own excesses. They are all on history's ash-heap. So why should we expect anything different? His sections on our debt and its crippling effects on empires past and what we can expect are truly shocking.Though most will buy this book for the provocative title, as I did, and Phillips' does argue that a peculiar religiosity of a certain portion of the electorate does contribute and exacerbate all of these problems, Phillips' treatment of the debt problem is the best since it was the one for which I was least informed. The debt will kill us when the world goes to euros if we do not stay our own hands from suicide through deficit spending and the borrowing to fund it. The most appalling thing about the debt is that, as Phillips' points out, is we are doing the same thing towards it as those other past powers he profiles which were ultimately wrecked by their own profligacy. Debt can not be killed off like human enemies and it is a self-inflicted wound that we choose to ignore until, as Phillips' says, it becomes \\"gangrenous\\" to every part of our life. He talks at length about what lays ahead and what collectively is not being done to avoid it. You will like the parts about zealotry in this book but even more eye-opening for me are the ramifications of debt and its ballooning. Since most people do not have a strong economic background, like me, these sections will be educational and also give some structure about how to think of the problem and its antidotes.I bought this book to try and gain an understanding of why our country has become what it has become. In many ways this book simply confirms many of my suspicions but also helps me to peer beyond the veil into others for which I had less knowledge. I have seen personally, and carried out, a foreign policy driven by oil and its acquisition. That came as no surprise to me but I did gain greater understanding of the role of religion as code and ready made policy for a large part of America and how it can be manipulated to justify pursuits that have no religious underpinnings. i.e. giving God's gift of democracy becomes the party line for selling invading Iraq when a simple idealist would have said it was to insure security, others and in turn ours, where there was only a tenuous hold on it. A cynic, like me, would have said those both were covers for oil. Phillips' does not state what is the true reson but that a different reason was given depending on the audience, showing the interdependence of all the factors in his book for each other's legitimacy, expansion, and maintaining control on the rest of us."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I'm very sceptical of any infusion of religion in government, and agree wholeheartedly with our forefathers who wrote our constitution over 200 years ago.

I am one of those who has been increasingly disaffected for years, and Kevin Phillips appears to be as well based on his recent writing. I am a long-time fan of Mr. Phillips, as someone who has the courage to see something that he has in the past and still wants to identify with unravel and decline in front of him, and give voice to the frustration, as well as the fear for where this alarming trend might take us.The book takes the reader through a well-detailed account of how we have reached this point, and where this likely leads. The \\"here\\" that Mr. Phillips outlines is a country where the dominant political party in the country has entered into a \\"great alliance\\" with the dominant religious organizations in the country in order to maintain joint dominance. The religious organizations benefit by continuing to assure that their agenda's are met by the politicians, while the political party benefits by keeping the eye of the governed off of the rape and pillage that is going on within the political apparatus. The focus weaves this involvement of the extreme right-wing fundamentalist clerics through all aspects of government, focusing in particular on the debt that has resulted and the foreign oil dependence that continues to drive most decisions, plunging the nation further into debt, resulting in increasing profits from those few who \\"own\\" that industry.The historical aspects of the book were excellent, helping the reader to understand how we got where we are, as well as making it clear where history would advise that all nations end up when they get on the path that we have put ourselves on. It is not a comforting picture. I have given the book 4 stars because while the message and content are excellent and timely, I do think that the writing became just a little disjointed and rambled down some alleys at times. I would still highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I heard his interview on NPR and was impressed with the degree of synthesis the author put into his arguments.

This book does this. In fact- that is the major point of the whole book. It is well written, insightful and engaging."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"If a person spends ninety-five percent of her time doing network engineering and five percent of her time praying in or attending a (Christian) church, should we label her a network engineer or a Christian? And what if she adamantly professes to follow the Christian faith in spite of her behavior to the contrary? Should we even then describe her as a Christian? And what if she decides to run for public office or vote for a political candidate who also professes to be a Christian but does not appear to follow its doctrines at all? Why should anyone be concerned with her behavior or beliefs, or those political candidates she supports? Why are her statements of belief of any concern, given that she does not really practice them anyway? She spends most of her time doing network engineering, and doing it well. The profession of network engineering requires activities and thought patterns that are far removed from what the practice of Christianity requires. Why then should we let Christian beliefs be her defining characteristic?If we now examine the people who profess to believe in Armageddon, the rapture, or one of the other bizarre beliefs attributed to Biblical Christianity, should we in any way be concerned of their keen interest in politics and in their support of candidates who profess to believe in the same things they do? These individuals certainly have jobs or professions that requires them to behave or think in ways that are in no way supported by Biblical Christianity. What then is the fuss about?Well, one should only be concerned if they resort to the use of physical force to bring about certain world events that they believe will happen in the \\"last days\\" predicted in the Bible. Otherwise, their beliefs are completely benign and have no influence. As long as they use persuasion as their tool to gain converts or to \\"encourage\\" the \\"last days\\", there is no cause for alarm. Again, they are spending most of their time being productive citizens and working in professions that are socially beneficial. One could view their Christian beliefs as purely ancillary, as purely peripheral to who they really are.The author of this book clearly thinks otherwise, and he has written a book that raises extreme alarms about the participation of \\"Christians\\" in politics. To substantiate his fears, he discusses some historical events that he believes are analogous to those today. There is no doubt when looking at his historical summarizations that religion has played a large role in the regimes of the past, particularly Roman Catholicism. But these regimes, in many ways similar to the ones of today, were not staffed by Christians. Even a cursory reading of the New Testament reveals that the initiation of force is prohibited or at least viewed as an anathema in the Christian faith. If, as the author wants us to believe, there are people who are encouraging the US government and the military to wage war in the Middle East in order to bring about \\"Armageddon\\" then they are not Christians. A person who advocates or initiates the use of force is not a Christian. The only thing for anyone to worry about is whether the people in government are planning or initiating violence without just cause. Clearly the yellow regime in Washington at the present time is waging an illegal and immoral war in Iraq. It is completely irrelevant whether they claim to be Christians or not. What is relevant is to find a way to remove them from office and replace them with people of greater moral standing.The influence of \\"Christians\\" in the American political scene is not the only pressing issue for the author in this book. He strikes out at the influence of \\"big oil\\" in politics, and includes fairly detailed evidence for this influence. His evidence though has been written down many times before and is therefore repetitive and actually intellectually tiring. The author's evidence, along with others he quotes, for supporting the idea that the war in Iraq is an oil war is overwhelming. The predominant reason for going into Iraq was for control of its resources. The author is correct to be sure, but he does not add constructive solutions for how to remove the influence of \\"big oil\\".The author also takes aim at the financial industry, complaining that the American populace has become deeply in debt to the degree that makes the future a perilous one. He likes to toss around big numbers, such as \\"trillions\\" to substantiate his thesis, but he does not offer give any coherent reasons for his concerns. Will massive debt truly result in a disaster as he predicts? What is the basis for his predictions? Is it commonsense or does he rely on financial modeling, the latter of which he speaks out against in the book? Indeed, derivatives trading, particularly the new financial instruments called \`collateralized debt obligations' rely on mathematical models in order to predict how they will behave in practice. The author though calls this \`high-priced guesswork', and points out the possible \`dangerous illiquidity' of these instruments, along with a version of credit derivatives called \`credit-default swaps.' His only evidence for his concerns about the dangers of these instruments is to quote the financier Warren Buffet, who referred to them as a \\"time bomb.\\"The author is not alone in his anxieties about the state of world in the twenty-first century, for the extremely rapid pace of technological innovation and the exotic nature of some of the new technologies have intimidated many. It would seem that the author is longing for the days where things were calmer, a time when the huge financial volatilities of the present time did not exist. Those days are gone though, and only those who understand the dizzying, whirlwind nature of the twenty-first century will find comfort and solace. There is no going back."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The author strings together his opinions about what people who call themselves Christians in America believe. He is simply wrong about what all but perhaps a few people might think. Christians do not like Theocracies. They like fair governments that do not attack their faith at every turn. He should harken back to founding of the country by Christians who established a constitution that says the government cannot make laws to establish religions..this was driven off the oppression in England, primarily, of those who did not subscribe to the official state religion. Christians today, even the \\"right wing\\" Christians, do not want a Theocracy, but they would like to see something other than a government that has, in my opinion, become hostile to religion, especially Christianity. The establishment clause, in my opinion, also prohibits the oppression of religion and the establishment of a state based on precepts that oppress people of faith and the suppression of any ideas/moral positions that may be based on the religious beliefs of the majority of citizens."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Are we truly in peril, or is this yet another doomsday prophecy based in theocratic substantialism? I fear that the authors geopolitical premonitions gather little momentum in his theocratic based reservationist philosophical slant. Is it movable beards or simply the theory of a previous relative pseudo dominance? (Once held in high regard in mid 18th century political powers) Yet any proposed dynamism remains elusive, and why? Look deep within the democratic aspired stronghold in the coming elections. Will Hilary run? Of course she will, and she'll undoubtedly make history, however (and you can be almost assurred that)...this genre of meandering melancoly will not, and can not obfuscate the dominant theory espoused heretofore!

This book fulfills that need, but in reality it is little more than fluff mixed with a dramatic but hollow and simplistic rehash of the current challenges facing the nation. Leftists enjoy the fact that the author is a former Republican, which presumably makes his words they feel - like those of say a reformed drug addict - especially credibile. Illogical nonsense, the fact he was a Republican does not in itself guarantee (though I admit there IS a correlation) that he is either intelligent or knows of what he speaks!What Kevin Phillips misses entirely is the history of the United States, its people, and its culture. He doesn't \\"get it\\" when it comes the deep spirtual traditions of the American people, preferring to characterize them in political terms that simply don't apply. Intellectually, in this regard this work falls down as being dumb. As for all of his rantings against capitalism etc., once again he fails to demonstrate any real comprehension of how this country was built and what its success has been predicated upon. Every few years someone writes a book predicting the downfall of \\"freedom\\" or of American values or whatever. It sells books but it has nothing to do with truth.File this work as an interesting artifact of a fading radical left in the United States and of the poverty in geniune intellectual thought in the public marketplace of ideas. In a year it and its \\"message\\" will be (and should be) completely forgotten!"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"but this guy is a raving lunatic, and this is a hate book for those that hunt out every kind of anti-Christian, anti-religion book they can find. This seems like a book written for some kind of retribution. I don't know what this guy is angry with, but I do know that he knows absolutely nothing about the history of religion in this country. I suggest he start reading with something as elementary as the Mayflower Compact and continue reading until he understands how big of a part the Judeo-Christian morality and work ethic played in developing this country.Phillips' anti-Christian ignorance is only surpassed by his anti-Mormon ignorance. He knows absolutely not one single item of truth about the LDS Church. He's been reading too many hate books. It's people like him that are destroying the very foundations of our society. There is enough religious hatred already. The problem is NOT religion, it's people not following religious principles. Muslims hate Christians, and all the Christian sects hate the LDS (Mormon) Church, and no one can say anything good about the Catholics, or Jehova's Witnesses,or anyone else; they all keep adding to the destruction of their own religion by causing hate mongers like Kevin Phillips to hate all religions even more.. Maybe this book will wake these people up and help stop the cross-religion arguing, especially the nasty tirades of the fundamentalist Christian right who want to send everyone to Hell who doesn't agree with them.This is the basis for hatred from people like Phillips. That part he understands correctly.If you want to read this book, try to find a used one. Don't give this hate monger any money."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I must say that there is a severe problem in America concerning our ongoing dependance upon foreign oil (and oil in general). And our spiraling, out-of-control debt will be a concern for us the rest of our lives and for potentially many generations to come.However, where Kevin Phillips really misses the boat here is that he launches a thinly-disguised attack against Christians in America. As others have noted, moral equivocation between law-abiding, patriotic American Christians and Islamist terrorists (both are called \\"radical\\" and \\"fundamentalist\\") does a disservice to people of faith and to the truth.It is shocking and disturbing how many people are willing to buy into Phillips' twisted and bigoted hypothesis. If he really knew all that much about Christian Reconstructionism, he might know that many in that movement favor a no-deficit policy and also environmental conservation. To try to link fundamentalist Christians with deficit spending and oil dependance is a shady proposition.Frankly, I think this book is simply an opportunity for Phillips to vent his spleen over his own frustrations that conservative Christians now have a stronger voice in Republican politics, whereas, 40 years ago...in the Goldwater era...they did not. However, Christians by and large now exercise less influence over American culture and government than perhaps they did in earlier times. A reading of our Founding Fathers or even later Presidents such as Lincoln and Wilson will show that Judeo-Christian philosophy once formed the very basis of our nation's Constitution and laws, and important public policies.All in all, this is a very misleading book that uses viable concerns over oil and money as trojan horses for his poison pill of Christianity-bashing."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I'm always skeptical about individuals, be they bloggers, authors, or just the guy on the street, who think we're living in a \\"theocracy.\\" They simply don't know what the word means.(Liberals also like to forget that \\"theocracy\\" is what we're fighting against in the Middle East; terror is merely the enemy's tactic.)Kevin Phillips can't name a single person who lost their right to vote or wound up in jail for refusing to convert to Christianity. That _would_ be a theocracy, but that's not what we have today, and no one with any sense would see that scenario becoming reality any time soon. Phillips should also be honest enough to admit that Bush isn't a religious fanatic, and the real \\"Christian Right\\" founded a party of their own, the Constitution Party, which actually _steals_ votes from the Republicans.Instead, Phillips regurgitates the same old liberal spew his masters at NPR (National Peoplesrepublic Radio) have been paying him to spout for going on thirty years. Some \\"conservative\\" Phillips turns out to be!If Kevin Phillips wants to solve our energy problems, he should advocate opening up the reserves in ANWR. If he thinks the military is overstreached, he should encourage people to enlist. If he doesn't like huge deficits, he should call for an end to the welfare state. That's what a _real_ conservative would do -- only liberals resort to the myth that Bush is a \\"theocrat.\\""},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Author Kevin Phillips, a learned man and skillful writer, really should know better. His confusing fusion of disparate issues makes for a toxic brew. His anti-Christian bias (which might be termed \\"Evangeliphobia\\") so muddles his thinking that he is unable to distiguish between modern-day American Christianity with branches and brands of faith that were prevalent in other societies at other times. He also seems to think that the \\"dangers\\" of Christianity supercede those posed by radical Islam.Furthermore, he asserts that the influence of Christianity has never been stronger in our government and in our public life here in America. Honestly, I would like to know what was influencing Mr. Phillips when he made that ridiculous assertion (maybe it beverages or herbal substances). Many credible scholars believe that there has never been a time in American history when Christianity had LESS of an influence on American public life and government than it does right now.Conspiracy theories sell books, and sadly, there are plenty of bigots out there already who loathe Christianity and who are well-schooled in the hyperbole of hatred against people of faith. Just read some of the reviews here for this book. But for all of Phillips' vitriol and energy, this book fails to make his case. At the end--and I say this with all apologies to our \\"Evangeliphobes\\" here--Kevin Phillips is just singing to the choir."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Phillips believes that our biggest danger in America is the threat of militant religion and its dominance of governmental policy. Except he's not talking about militant Islam and its dominance of so many Mid-East governments and enemies of America--he's talking about Christianity and it's influence on our democratically-elected government.What a sickening and insulting premise. To morally equate groups in America who exercise their rights of free speech with terrorists who slaughter the innocent and bully their own people is grossly unfair and inaccurate. The message of Christianity and the modus operandi of Christians in the world today contrasts starkly with the message and m.o. of militant Islamists.And the whole \\"it's all about oil\\" lie is such a tiresome cliche perpetrated by the leftists and anarchists and the naive. I hated this book, I hated it's vile presuppositions, and I don't know whether to think the author is just dumb, or if there is something more sinister behind his motives."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Wow, did you know that America's piety, dignity, and adherance to Biblical principles are driving it to the edge of destruction? You know, just like Rome was destroyed because of it's righteousness and pure lifestyle? What a laugh! the only people who think that America is, at present, a Christian nation, are a few ill-educated Mullahs in Iran, and a few over-educated leftist professors at Columbia, Princeton, and Berkley.To call this book \\"factual\\" is like saying Maureen Dowd and the NY TIMES are just \\"telling it like it is\\" with no bias involved whatsoever. This book is shoddy scholarship and as such, is terribly disappointing. Phillips paints with such a broad brush that his hysteria comes off less as analysis and cogent, toughtful criticism and more as the spittle-tinged spewings of a bitter old man.I must say that some of the reviews here (which call Christianity \\"rabid\\" and \\"radical\\" and \\"scary\\" and \\"Pollyanish\\") are themselves frightening to consider. It would seem that David Limbaugh, in his book \\"Persecution,\\" may not have been so far off in his allegations that the increasing attacks on Christians in America are part of a growing trend.The danger in America is not that Christians are \\"about to take over,\\" but that certain secularists would severely limit their Constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of worship if they only had the chance. These secularists would do to Christians what the truly radical Muslims are already doing to Christians in places where Sharia law is in place. Isn't it ironic, that Phillips finds himself on the side of many radical Muslim clerics?How messed up is that, man?"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Being a former leftist I can see how this book would enthrall its intended audience. It clearly lays out three of the Democratic Parties talking points. However, if you have a modicum of knowledge, a smattering of logical reasoning ability and slight amount of historical acumen you will find Mr. Phillips and the Democratic Parties talking points break down to absurdity very quickly. However, these points are not really intended to be factual instead they are used to instill fear and more importantly the byproduct of fear - hatred; into the automaton-like zealots of the left.However, to give Mr. Phillips his ado, his book is NOT a venomous diatribe. He does not use the extreme incivilities that pepper most of the writing from the left. While he does an excellent job in inciting fear Mr. Phillips tome does not spew hatred. Instead the writer has wisely left it up to the intended audience to convert that fear to hate.The book has three main parts. The first part states that the world will be running out of oil in this century and of course America is to blame. But what Mr. Phillips doesn't do is state that he is using estimates that include only CURRENT producing LIGHT crude fields. This is in NO WAY the total amount of oil reserves in the earth since Mr. Phillips doesn't even count the following1. Heavy Crude fields2. Tar Sands3. Oil Shale deposits4. Deep Water Drilling sites5. Non Producing KNOWN Light crude fieldsSo if we add up just these KNOWN oil areas we find that reasonable estimates of reserve are in the 200-320 year range. Add this to Mr. Phillips minimal estimate of current production and we have between 300 and 400 years of KNOWN oil left.This doesn't mean we should not be conserving or finding alternative sources for our energy needs. Only the extremist's on the right would say that, but the skeptical middle of the road person finds these scare tactics involved in this book a little over the top. We should take a sensible approach to our energy needs. Known oil fields should be allowed to go into production and nuclear energy should be given a second chance.Part two of this book focuses on the influence of Christians on U.S. Politics. I found this section to be the most dangerous and most disingenuous of the whole book. (NOTE: The book portrays the largest groups of Christians as fringe and the smaller least orthodox groups as mainstream to help embellish the writers' myth. I will not use the Orwellian terms that the author uses in this review but rather stay with factually correct terms.) Mr. Phillips tries to incite the gullible readers that mainstream Christians have a large and powerful influence over the government and that the country is on the verge of a theocracy.I understand WHY this is done, more on that latter, but just how na ve are people out there. Christianity has played less of a role in America and its government every year. Just read some of the speeches of politicians from the 1800's. These sounded more like sermons with long sections quoted out of the bible and hell-fire damnation preaching. If only the American people knew their history they would laugh out loud at this assertion.Also anti-religious groups such as the ACLU and Americans for Separation of Church and State, have used the legal system to remove crosses from graves, are challenging the constitutionality of saying Merry Christmas. The pledge is under assault because it mentions God and so is our country's motto \\"In God We Trust\\"On the opposite side of the spectrum we see how successful the Christian right has been in getting Abortion banned, making pornography illegal, instituting prayers in school, criminalizing homosexuality, etc. etc. The list could go on and on but for a group to have so MUCH power they sure are ineffectual. In fact it appears that the Humanistic groups promoting their agenda seem to have the power.So how does Mr. Phillips come up to such wrong conclusions by talking incessantly about the wacky Christian Reconstruction(CR) movement. He portrays CR as big and mainstream. He tries to link almost every major player on the Christian right to this movement thereby hoping to impugn them by using guilt by association. There is only one problem, those on the Christian right explicitly deny and reject CR and to make matters worse even Mr. Phillips finally admits on page 368, at the very end of the book, that CR is a very VERY small fringe group with very few nonessential players. Mr. Phillips after spending 4 chapters and the very title of his book blows his whole opining out the window.The real question is why does the radical left glory in demonizing Christians? Why do they have such fear and hatred of this group? One could argue that it is purely metaphysical but I think there might be other reasons. In order for the Liberal Fascist's to take over they need to have the public whipped into a frenzy about a certain group they have made out as a threat. Obviously the hard left in this country has taken note that another socialist leader in Germany was able to whip his people into a rage by demonizing the Jews. In this case the leftists have learnt a lesson from history and are replacing the Jews with the Christians. Pretty scary stuff if you enjoy individual freedom and liberty.I'll finish this section with a quote from the author \\"Indeed, demonizing the other side's extremists has often been a particularly successful tactic.\\" (Page 373) So true Mr. Phillips, so true.Part three does bring up some good points such as the alarming rate of personal debt in America however; most of the authors' conclusions are only conjecture and can't be proven. Mr. Phillips wrote volumes about how much debt was in foreign hands and how bad this is. Actually when foreigners INVEST in any country they are showing their faith in that country. But lets get realistic, many figures were bandied about leaving the unknowledgeable reader that china owns huge amounts of Americas debt. This is plain fabrication, the actually number China owns is 4.02% and this is verifiable. But that factual number doesn't cause enough angst in the fear-mongering crowd. Those darn statistics can get maddening huh.Also his stale talking points about the tax cuts that supposedly benefited the rich are just silly. Total Federal Receipts have been growing dramatically since 2004 and it is the evil RICH people that are paying more money than ever into the government coffers. As a matter of fact if federal receipts and federal outlays stay growing at the same rate as they have we will have balanced budget in April 2008. And this will be the first balanced budget achieved through economic growth instead of tax rate hikes. Something that Mr. Phillips should be highlighting. Well, whoops sorry about that if he said something positive that would NOT create fear - never mind.The book was written for the fringe left - a type of person that willingly accepts anything their leaders tell them. If one was to look at the footnotes in the book you will be surprised to find that about 50% of them lead back to opinion writers and bloggers. Therefore, Mr. Phillips, in-depth-research is merely regurgitating other people's opinion. And when the author could not find a source for one of his conjectures he simply footnoted himself. Now that's research!My advice to the reader is to do your research, learn history, and be skeptical of what any ideologue tells you."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Phillips doesn't personalize the book in this way, but this is clearly the story of how this life-long Republican activist and presidential advisor fell out of love with his party. As such, it's interesting and it parallels the political journeys of a number of people in my family. He believes the GOP is guilty of two bad sets of policies, those encouraging both public and private debt in the United States, and those policies supporting over-reliance on oil.What is really driving Phillips away from his party, however, isn't a question of bad policy choices. He's frustrated and disgusted by the party's growing reliance on fundamentalist Christians who are intolerant of others, hostile to education and science, and, frankly, downmarket kinds of people. Some of Phillips' reaction to the fundamentalists is well-reasoned and grounded in legitimate concerns about where this 40 percent of the electorate would like to take the country. A large part of Phillips' frustration is more emotional - - he belongs in the mixed group of secular and mainline Protestants who used to dominate the GOP, and he thinks that lower-class, rural fundamentalists are icky.As this suggests, there's a mixture of reason and emotionalism that pervades this book on the question of religion. Nonetheless, I found the chapters on religion the most interesting because Phillips works hard to trace the spread of Southern denominations outward into parts of the border states, upper Midwest, and intermountain West.In contrast, his discussions of oil and debt are frustrating. He doesn't know enough economics to make the analysis of debt convincing, so we're left with a kind of schoolmarmish disapproval of people who borrow too much. On the question of oil he tends toward the kind of conspiracy theories that one expects from the Michael Moore Left instead of from a disillusioned Republican.Most importantly, Phillips never makes a convincing case that these three concerns are linked. Why do fundamentalist Christians like oil? On the face of it, it's an odd association and there's certainly no biblical foundation for it. There's even less reason for \\"Christians\\" to be associated with debt, given biblical prohibitions on usury. So Phillips leaves lots of unanswered questions in this review of the last fifty years of the Republican party."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips analyzes thoroughly the US policies of the last twenty years under Republican leadership.For him, these policies are not less than disastrous, putting the US under the demonic spell of a four headed ghost: the simplistic, Taliban-like radical religion of Christian fundamentalists, the energy (oil) vulnerability, ballooning public and private debt and global military overreach.The GOP bets heavily on, what the author calls, national Disenlightment (religious fundamentalism), e.g., by funding public services through church-related groups.The direct consequences of this policy can be seen in education (neglect of scientific infrastructure), climatology (no signing of the Kyoto protocol), biological research (no embryonic stem-cell research), morals (attempts to prohibit abortion again), science (promotion of \`intelligent design' versus Darwinism), sex (promotion of abstinence and no support for contraception), social issues (women's rights against the rights of embryos), food protection (abolition of the EPA), theology (crusade against Islam) or business (justify wealth and oppose regulation).The ultimate aim is to reduce the separation between church and state.The world's age of oil has been the era of American supremacy. But, oil production has peaked and oil prices in dollar continue to peak. Will OPEC countries continue to be satisfied with their paycheck in devalued dollars?There is apparently one oil \`biggie' left: Iraq. That oil was the critical factor in the Iraq invasion is proven by the fact that after Saddam Hussein was defeated the US troops occupied immediately the Iraq Oil Ministry and seized the seismic maps of its oilfields. For the rest, the Iraqi people were free to loot everywhere and everything else.\`Moving money around' (financial transactions) became a bigger \`business' in the US than manufacturing (making things). The population's savings rate is dropping like a stone. Public and private (\`I shop, therefore I am') debt reaches all time highs, creating a monstrous \`credit-industrial complex'.The risk of overreach in military human and financial resources for the defense of petro-imperialism is becoming extremely high.The author compares the actual world context with the ones confronted by other imperialisms (the Roman, Dutch, Spanish and British). He sees dark and ghostly clouds at the horizon for the American theocracy.Kevin Phillips\`s book is a must read for all those interested in world politics."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I tend to resist new fads. When recorded books came out, I decried them for I don't even remember what reasons. Since, I find that I don't have the time to read what I'd like so, God forbid, I pick up an occasional recorded book. I did so with this volume, and the only thing I regret is that I'm not sure how much Phillips had provided references for some of his claims, even though I agreed with most or all of them.Now, to the story:I always thought that \\"manifest destiny\\" wasn't enough to describe the theology that makes people believe in US superiority. Phillips starts with one theme, a US religious history. And, sure enough, there were many who thought our Revolutionary War was a religious cause. Many, especially those in the south, found the war between the states--known by many a Southerner I know as the War of Northern Aggression--to be a religious war. That doctrine, in fact, has led many a Southern citizen to argue to this day that they won the Civil War.Well, it seems that religion has made quite a comeback. Among its manifestations is the sale of Tim LaHay's \\"left behind\\" series which has sole an astonishing 60 million copies. To those participating in that comeback, what's going on in the Mideast today is representative of biblical prophecy--was bound to happen as the Lord cometh soon.Another theme--weave, to continue my metaphor--is economics, particularly that of oil. I like Phillips' description of the history of energy politics. I was aware of the gold mine that was whale oil until later in the 19th century when they struck black gold in Pennsylvania. But that's just an early episode.Still another dimension of that economy, though, is how the US has changed in, say, the last 50 years. When I was a child in the Midwest over a half century ago, all of my friends' fathers worked at factories and founderies. They had a home, a car or two, could send their kids to decent schools, and on and on. Most of us with our eyes open have noticed that such an economy doesn't even exist any more. And times are getting worse. Before long, we won't be able to compete with China--where some items I just bought for my house today were manufactured.Phillips does a masterful job of weaving those elements together with reflections on history, including some of the more frightening fundamentalist preachers and tendencies over the last 140 years or so.The only objection I have to the text is related to what I started this review with, the fact that I listened to it rather than read it: Some of what Phillips said--with much of which I agreed, incidentally, from my own experience--I'm not sure was his speculation. In other words, had I actually read the text, there many have been any number of footnotes and references.Aside from that, though, I think this is an extremely important text. If a reader wonders why he can't make ends meet, while his GOP activist boss is driving a Lexus; if he or she wonders why Pat Robertson is taken seriously--or as a dangerous threat--by commentators; or any other wonders about today's political environment, there is a lot to think about in this book so I recommend it."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips says the three major perils facing America are: shrinking oil supplies, radicalized religion, and reliance on borrowed money. Oil politics created Anglo-American activity in the Middle East since around 1901. [The first and second World Wars were over oil, and so will the third World War. Has it started already?] The \\"Armageddon hucksters\\" represent the growing power of religious groups (who is behind them?). The ballooning deficits are another peril, with declining manufacturing. Phillips mentions theocracies like Puritan New England of Mormon Utah. These conditions have caused the downfall of former leading world economic powers (p.ix). \\"Exploding consumer debt\\" is a euphemism for impoverishing America. [No mention of the devaluation of the dollar since 1971 as contributing to this.] The Bush dynasty has been one of the leading families of the American ruling class.Chapter 1 says declining US oil production will force a military invasion of the Middle East (p.5). This will compete with the countries of Asia and Latin America. Human history is full of wars over natural resources (p.6). Phillips says that economic success leads to an eventual decline, and not by accident (p.11). [Newton's Third Law in history?] Oil production is dying out in America (p.21). Was the 2003 invasion of Iraq done to grab their oil (p.26)? Chapter 2 tells of American oil utilization. In 1973 Kissinger planned to attack Saudi Arabia for their oil (p.41)! The oil industry is associated with political corruption (p.45). Pennsylvania oil earned foreign exchange during the Civil War (p.46). American oil companies expanded abroad after WW I (pp.49-51). Long commuting drives were created by separating housing from jobs and shopping (p.61). Fear affects vehicle purchases and voting (p.62). Chapter 3 says invading Iraq was for its oil and for a permanent military base (p.69). The stories about Iraq were similar to the \\"Big Lie\\" trick (p.74). The 1992 intervention in Somalia was done for Chevron, Amoco, Conoco, and Phillips (p.81). Clinton's intervention in Yugoslavia was to create an oil pipeline (p.82). This also involved Afghanistan (p.83) and Colombia (p.84). Is Nigeria next (p.85)? [Could the growth of fundamentalism be correlated to the growing impoverishment of Americans (p.96)?]Chapter 4 discusses Christianity in America (p.100). The explosive growth in church membership isn't explained (p.109), or the splitting of churches (p.110). Does liberalization mean declining church membership (p.120)? Religious fervor may be explained by freedom; recent converts are more dedicated than older members (p.123). [Part II is too verbose, and should be reduced to about 100 pages.] The enormous southern support for Nixon in 1972 was only possible after George Wallace was eliminated (p.176). Could the loss of the House and the Senate in 1994 be a payback for 1992 (p.182)? Phillips never asks who controls the religious leaders (p.217). Chapter 7 lists 5 criteria of national decline. Chapter 8 notes how increasing debt is bleeding American production, a sign of \\"economic decline\\" (p.268). Phillips points out how other countries had to take American paper money because they were occupied by American military forces (p.269). The \\"household deficit\\" measures increasing poverty (p.272). The Founding Fathers warned against debt (p.288). Chapter 9 explains why the importance of finance marks the final chapter in a nation.Chapter 10 discusses the falling savings rate in America since Reagan's reign (p.319). Will this lead to a nation of \\"indentured servants\\" (p.324)? The US deficit is without precedent (p.335)! Who forced Asian Central banks to buy US Treasury Bonds (p.336)? The dangers zones are: national debt, household debt, and financial sector debt (p.338). Wars and economics lead to an end of a hegemony (pp.340-343). Phillips points out the fantasy of a 75-year projection of Social Security and Medicare costs (p.344).Bush's attempt to grab the oil of Iraq is a total failure; prices increased instead of falling (p.350). Phillips doesn't ask \\"who controls the churches\\" when he discusses the political use of churches (p.371). [Doesn't that go back thousands of years?] The loss of manufacturing guarantees the decline of America (p.379). Wealth is depleted to buy foreign oil; is this the result of incompetent political leadership (p.382)? Phillips comments on religion in Spain, Holland, and Britain don't mention tax-supported churches (p.383). Average incomes are stalled while the super rich become wealthier (p.385). Are those conservative preachers controlled by corporations (p.394)? What will happen when America declines to a second rate country (p.394)?"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips has written a compelling and masterful analysis of American politics. Using facts - not opinions - he has analyzed three powerful forces at work today: Fundamentalist religion, oil and debt.

It is insightful, informative and alarming."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Never expected a book like this coming from a former Republican insider.

It is unbeliebable what has transpired in our country since the Bush administration. Our government has been hijacked by the Christian Right, blurring the lines of church and state and pushing for a semi-theocratic government. I am not a Christian and recognize many so called \\"Christian values\\" are not moral or godlike at all. So where does that leave me and millions like me.This doesn't seem like the United States anymore, the secrets, the king-like attutude of our president, cracking down on dissent and the press. The list goes on. We are truly heading down a dangerous road.I was born and raised a Christian but Thank God I left that long ago. I believe in God but recognize Christianity as mostly fiction like any other organized religion. I know the history of Christianity, the creation of the Bible, the how, and the why. Most Christians are incredibly ignorant of their own religion and how it came to be.(that goes for any organized religion.) People do not want their belief systems shattered. They go into Christian shut down mode when confronted with lies, contradictions and inaccuracies of the Bible. It is just too disturbing for them and they go into automatic defensive mode. There is no critical eye, just blind faith. Christianity is man made, not God made. It is truly a primitive belief system. God wants you to question and discard the myths.Hopefully someday if humanity survives, we will learn to let go of our primitive and stone age belief systems, they are killing us.This well written and researched book shows the frightening and dangerous direction our country is heading in.

Rather, he argues that it is rapidly following in the wake of the demise of past imperial powers Spain, Holland and Britain. The extraordinary rise and influence of extremist religious tendencies; the financialization and extreme indebtedness of the economy as \\"real wealth production\\" is outsourced; and the inevitable decline and gradual replacement of the economy's main fuel resource, are the three main streams that Phillips sees as once having broken their banks over previous leading imperial powers and that are now beginning to deluge the US.I'm not an American but do have an interest in understanding the nature of the power that is so dominant in the political and cultural life of my country (Australia), in particular with a view to better understanding how one might best address issues that I see as detrimental to our society -- such as rising religious fundamentalism, the determination of many in power to follow the more extreme attitudes of the Bush administration re war, climate, human rights despite widely expressed public opinion to the contrary.Perhaps for this reason I found first section of Phillip's book detailing oil's role for the US in comparison with the roles of other energy sources (coal, wind, timber) in past empires (Britian, Holland, Spain) painful with its baroque level of descriptive detail.But I did find most absorbing his discussion of the historical roots and evolution of the Southern \\"character\\" (my term) and in particular of the Southernization of the North, or of the US as a whole. The role of the Southern Baptist Convention is especially enlightening. It helps me see the current Bush president -- the less educated persona, the disdain for science and progressive values, the born again (revived) Christian, filled with sense of being besieged, responding with arrogance and aggression, imbued especially with a sense of exceptionalism, of a unique mission to play out in the world -- as a fulfilment of the final rise of The South after the \\"divine chastening in righteousness\\" of the Civil War and Reconstruction period. This gives an interesting perspective to think about after having read Lieven's America Right or Wrong (my review on this is yet to come) which analysed many such nationalistic traits and attitudes to the rest of the world from a more \\"whole\\" US perspective.Phillips then attempts to link the rise of religious fundamentalisms as a principle motive in foreign policy decisions but I felt he did little more than reinforce the what most take as a given (albeit with much added detail from regional election statistics) -- that the Bush administration has relied heavily on the religious fundamentalist vote. Although he discusses Middle East policy in the context of apocalyptic beliefs of Bush himself I remain sceptical: if Iraq were the proverbial world's supplier of broccoli rather than oil does anyone really think Bush's religious imagination would be so exercised in that region? Indeed, it is in this discussion that Phillips lets some of his otherwise love of detail desert him, and the reader finds in its place the old conservative biological and psychic metaphors commonly attached to \\"decline and fall\\" motifs: in place of hard supporting documentation one reads of a nation's \\"hubris\\", its \\"high-wire walks\\", its \\"youth and early middle age\\", its \\"animal spirits\\" and \\"vitality\\", the \\"lesser resilience\\" of its \\"clogged arteries\\" (p.311).This is a book rich in illustrations of \\"decline\\" and I personally find any hint that the US power is on such a brink both disturbing and encouraging. Disturbing because one fears the potential for more irrational and bloody responses from the superpower in misguided efforts to delay the inevitable, encouraging because one seeks the eventual end of Anglo-Saxon imperial domination and power rivalries with related European nations these past 200 years with what must be one of the most bloody and genocidal periods of human history. The only real regret I have with American Theocracy is that while its author can see signs of \\"the end\\" of the current \\"empire\\", he apparently fails to see that the whole exercise from the beginning was one not of \\"greatness\\" but of arrogrance, greed and inhumanity."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This book does a great job of placing historical fact within the context and explaining how it can be seen in our govenment and how it is run.

However, the bias against conservatives is presence once again and once again, this is unfortunate because there is no need for such bias in what would otherwise be an excellent analysis of how our country has arrived at its current situation.Phillips readily admits that he has always had trouble understanding religious fervor and this difficulty in understanding shows in this book. His perceptions and analysis of the Religious Right are definitely skewed through his upper-middle class Yankee perspective. It is also quite apparent that much of his research is based on reading rather than experiencing (either firsthand or through interviews) the evangelical Christian lifestyle. Phillips is a better historian and political analyst than he is a religious sociologist.However, this book is worthwhile because it others a good look at the dynamics of power in the real world as opposed to the theoretical worlds conjured up by academic political scientists and politicians.

But it all adds up - the U.S.A is steadily plodding down a historically proven path of empirical decline. It is hopelessly addicted to a resource, oil, that cannot sustain it in perpetuity; it is awash in debt at every level fostered by a bewildering variety of debt instruments; and in thrall of a backward-looking zealous religious minority influential far beyond its actual numbers.

Readers see that U.S. foreign policy is strongly, perhaps dangerously influenced by conservative Christians. We also see how the USA is spending itself into danger, and is doing far too little to end its risky dependence on foreign oil. Phillips offers several parallels between between the USA and Britain; for example comparing the questionable U.S. invasion of Iraq to British colonialism in the middle east after World War I. Readers also see how losing control of an energy source can cost a nation dearly - as Britain's power declined in the 20th Century when oil began replacing coal. Phillips writes with an alarmist tone, one that readers (and non-readers) should listen to.Phillips proved his eye for future trends with EMERGING REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, his 1969 book correctly forecasting GOP dominance of the South and White House via rising conservatism and racial backlash. Phillips recently left the GOP in disgust at its right-wing Christian politics.

It is chocked full of suppostions supported by a good deal of empirical research. It however in the end, is not one coherent narrative. But rather a fairly disjointed indictment of a whole host of often unrelated entities.If one is convinced that a demon lives amongst angels then that demon almost assuredly will rear its ugly head. Kevin Phillips is convinced of that demon. He ahbors the Bush family and the Republican party and is convinced that there is a transnational unholy alliance that seeks to dominate and control this country's politics for personal gain. His assertion that today's party is inextricably controlled by a combination of the right wing evangelical movement and the house of Saud reeks of the type of third rate conspiracy theory that would make Oliver Stone proud. In the end conspiracies exist more often in movies then in real life. Kevin Phillips chose to cram his own world view into a text that makes connections that seem to pass the sniff test. He argues that the presidency and the Republican party is corrupt at best and treasoness at worst.Phillips is a gifted writer and master story teller and does craft an interesting-- if not well connected narrative-- but it is not one that is worthy of the veneer of serious scholarship it is painted with."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"if you read his american dynasty then skip this bookadds little except a screed against religionbut otherwise 3 stars if you are not duplicating what you read thereand worth reading if you dont drink his koolade about religion andrealise that only some of what he says is actually true bu twhat is true is helping the gop screw the citizens of the usa and destroy the country.right about baby bush kowtowing to the nutcase rightincluding neocons and their pointless preemptive wars for oiland for the gop giving the finance people the weapons to destroy the economy (which they did after the book was written) so they could make a few more bux but push the risk and cleanup onto the taxpayers..but mostly wrong about everything else he claims about religionand Christians --not all of whom are against abortion, against stem cell research, or keeping dead peoples bodies functioning at a reflex level ala schiavo ---- and darwin evolution could not happen because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. explain the chicken/egg, how an eyeball came about, how man/woman got evolved at the same time/place so they could continue propagating. the probabilities of evolutions being feasible are infinitesimally small. ----- and evolution is not science because science requires that independent experiments be able to duplicate the claimed results and nobody can run an experiment about evolution, which always means that evolution is at best a conjecture. ---- plus the so called \\"proof\\" of evolution is based on logical fallacies and is not a valid proof merely bloviation of the atheistic human secularists. evolution could be preprogrammed in the genomes but it will be a while before they are fully decoded to see whether that is true or not. either way that would be *proof* of what did happen..key points are that empires fall for 4 basic reasonsand the usa appears to be going down for the countalthough it could take 20-40 years to happen(coincidence that that is when ssa and medicare run out of money?)(or are they runnign out of money because of what bush & gop did to screw teh country up after clintons financial surpluses?).reagan set the country on the right path againdaddy bush gave away all the reagan gainshow the gop could nominate baby bush is a mysterybut they did and the shrub put the usa into a death spiralof massive debt and needless wars that cost us friendsthat we desperately need to survive.he is wrong about why baby bush won -- the religulous right did vote for him but so did too many others who had no real choice. if dems had not run gore enough real republicans/conservatives would ahve voted for the dem candidate, but gore was worser in their eyes than the shrub. so they voted libertarian or stayed home. that is why obama won. if they had run hillary perpaps mccain would have won as the true gop/conservative/moderates would ahve stayed home or voted 3rd party again..good points about the economy and how the govt is messing up big timeand why..good points about how oil and wallstreet/Finance/realestate/insurance are driving the govt to do things that will completely destroy the usaso they can get rich and dont pay no never mind to screwing over the average joe sixpack citizen..fully footnoted, well written, no padding.good insights except for his anti-religion screed, which tars all religious people with the same brush blaming them for what a few nutcases who are vocal and active demand the grumpy old pervert (greatly obsolete party) do.."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I read this book at the behest of a quasi-lefty friend of mine, who worries that the evangelical right (of whom I am an equally quasi-member) has unparalleled power and influence in the current administration. You know the feeling when you sit through a stupid movie to the end, hoping it will get better, only to finally you say \\"Darn, sure wish I had those two hours back?\\" Well, I have that feeling. This book is quite possibly the dumbest book I have ever read.If the evil backroom dealers of Dobson, Falwell, Robertson et al had the power Phillips believes they do, I know what they would want. Not an invasion of Iraq. Nope, without a doubt, they would end abortion as it exists. After that, they would tinker with other policies that they see as anti-God or family, but I doubt any invasion anywhere would incite much passion. These power-brokers have been able to get nothing they want, and yet they have all this power? Don't they wish......Even when they are so secret, and no one admits to be at their beck and call? Even then?Phillips is clearly a well-read man, but he reads the wrong people. Spending too much time in the wacked out paranoia of a left that checks its closet before going to bed at night, he has fashioned a tale about me and my friends that is so silly it's almost amusing, if it weren't so dangerous. He tosses the insults fast and furious, hoping to get, as he says approvingly on page 373, religion and morality out of politics. Leaving what Kev? Ah, science, good old objective science, the province of impartiality, honesty, decency and love. Whoops. Remember eugenics, Kevin? The wholesome, logical and scientific plan, endorsed enthusiastically by Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger to control who could breed and who could not? Who fought this abomination, nearly alone until Adolf and his boys gave it a somewhat sour flavor? The Catholic Church fought it, all the while your ancestors laughed at their backward and anti-scientific attitudes. No, science is a tool, and like all tools is as good or evil as the practitioner. Just like a gun. Guns are neither good nor bad. But that's another one you guys can't get. You trust science wholeheartedly, you may find you organs harvested for someone younger and stronger. And you'll be hard-pressed to complain. After all, survival of the fittest.One could open this book to nearly any page and see something foolish, ludicrous, or downright crazy. I am not a geologist. I am not an economist. Though I know that there is wide variety of opinion among them on nearly every topic, including what day of the week it is. But I do know something about evangelicals, and almost every assertion he makes is either wrong or inflated by such clever parings as \\"those who read the Left Behind series or believe in the rapture\\" similar in my mind to \\"those who watch Star Wars or believe in Wookies.\\" The fact that millions of people choose something for entertainment does not mean that they believe it as truth. Some do, I am certain, but many more do not. This is misleading, deliberately and deceitfully misleading, and makes me doubt him on topics where my expertise is small. He lies, he exaggerates. He confuses, contorts , and whitewashes. Come on, has he never read anything about the Scopes trial other than the fictional, or maybe hallucinatory, \\"Inherit the Wind?\\" And Terry Schiavo? He makes it all sound so simple.And I don't get his constant references to poll data. If so many Americans are spendthrift nitwits enthralled by their silly Sunday morning sermons, who cares what 57% of them think about anything? Or his endless referring to the opinions of the disdainful, enlightened Europeans, who put all this primitive religiosity away two centuries ago, and simultaneously unleashed two centuries of barbarism, Imperialism, and butchery unmatched in human history? I don't think we can look to them as models of restraint and objectivity.So, I too think Americans spend too much and waste fuel. Someday we will run out of oil. And maybe, though I'm not so sure, we will fall as the Dutch and Spanish did. But I'm not sure that the government that, as he says on page 385, didn't curb the attitudes that offend oil-producing countries (Oh my.... Women in shorts? Movies? Which of the many things that offend them should we curtail?) can be counted on to fix these problems. I don't trust the market, but I trust the government less.

I would be critical of any author who published such a poorly researched volume. Though the wikipedia is useful as a reference in some areas, most academics would never use it as a sole source for any statement. Mr. Phillips cites the wikipedia at least once, chapter 7 note 66. Whether or not this particular fact is correct, his laziness makes all his remaining research suspect. He also lists several other dubious or biased sources, both internet and printed. If you are citing an internet source you should at least list the date a website was accessed, especially when dealing with a frequently changing site like wikipedia. Mr. Phillips does not do so.In unrelated comment, the author includes a great deal of material that is somewhat extraneous to his argument and has a somewhat annoying habit of plugging his own previous books in the text. I was at least expecting an interesting argument out of this book. There may be some validity to parts of his beliefs but his failings as a scholar and writer make it easy to belittle his arguments."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I heard the author on NPR and rushed out and bought the book. I was very disappointed. I think this book is full of esoteric insights about history and culture, and tries to tie things together that are just not there. For instance, just to give one example, the author talks about the oil/automobile complex that dictates U.S. policy. So what ? That is true in every country (Japan, Germany, France, etc.). Everyone has to drive to work, and thus, oil and cars are important. So what ? It is a banal insight, masquerading as profundity. The author then evern tries to tie this back to whale fishing in the 1700s, etc. I just didn't buy any of this.Also, if there is a \\"car complex\\", then I would think it would affect the Democrats much more than the Republicans, the Democrats being centered in the northern auto-producing states like Michigan. Do you really think that Clinton was not influenced by the auto industry (SUVs and large trucks were introduced during the Clinton administration, not after Sep.11, as the author states, and the author provides a list of psychological reasons [\\"security\\"], why people wanted those large vehicles [the real reason is, Americans haul things like boats]. All this happend under a Democractic administration, not under the Bushes. The Democrats are much more likely to be \\"in bed\\" with the auto industry than the Bush family is.Regarding religion, yes, the evangelicals are sometimes very weird [I personally don't want someone to have nuclear weapons, who believes that the 'End Times' are here, and the anti-Christ exists as a real person !]. Yes, they are powerful in terms of sheer numbers [100 million !], but as David Frum [ex-White House aid] said, in his time in the White House, one single large union in the U.S. put vastly more pressure on the White House in terms of wanting concrete legislation to be passed, than the entire \\"religious right\\", which mostly, in his view [he is a Jewish Canadian] want to \\"be left alone\\". What have the evangelicals actually accomplished at the national level in terms of real legislation and laws ? Have they overturned Roe vs. Wade ? I read the other day that Walmart is being forced to carry a contraceptive, even though it goes against the religious view of the company leaders and most of the customers. Is that the \\"religious right taking over\\" ? Name one \\"victory\\" that the evangelicals have achieved that really is significant (they can't get a stone tablet with the 10 Commandments put on state grounds, they can't get small stickers put on books stating the \\"evolution is a theory\\". At the 2004 GOP Convention, the evangelicals were not even allowed to speak, and were treated like \\"odd relatives\\", and pushed into the background, which to me shows that the GOP knows it can't win with them on a national level. [it should also be noted that Clinton spoke a lot more in his speeches about God and religion. In addition, Democrats like House speaker Nancy Pelosi can say things like \\"to us Democrats, the environment is a religious issue\\", and that is viewed as ok, but god-forbid if a Republican should mention religion and politics !!].And whenever business interests collide with \\"social conservative\\" agendas, the business side ALWAYS wins (for example, Bush signing into law a new bankruptcy bill, which helped the financial industry, but hurt families). So this idea that the evangelicals are gaining the upper hand is not true. At the state level, I would say it is true (I live in Texas, and the Religious Right has basically taken over the GOP here, going so far as to insert all kinds of odd things into the party platform like, the U.S. should leave the U.N, which does in a way conform with Phillips' assertion that the \\"wackos\\" [which is a term a Republican lobbiest famously used to describe them] are taking over, in the south, at the state level]. But not at the national level. Re the financial aspects of the book, also true, but you can say that about Clinton or any president. Do you really think Clinton was not influenced by the \\"credit industry\\" (wasn't Bob Rubin, a cabinet member under Clinton, directly from that industry, for example] ?This idea that the U.S. is just another \\"great power\\" in decline, and that what we see today are just signs of that (\\"religious extremism\\") to me is just \\"too easy\\" to really be true, and has already been said before in the book, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\"; but that book I think was mostly discredited. One reason for \\"religious extremism\\" is just that in the U.S., we allow more freedoms than in other countries [which control the churches directly], and one reason why so many Ameircans are in debt is because we are a rich people and we are free and we like to buy things. We use a lot of oil because our country is very big, and the oil industry is very efficient. The strengths of our country are in software, finance, and entertainment, not in oil or cars. So, all in all, the book didn't do much for me.The author states the old economic theory that if you make things, you are rich, but if you do finance (\\"move money around\\"), you are poor. Well, not true. Mexico makes a lot of things and has a strong manufacturing base, whereas Singapore and Switzerland are services and finance-based economies. And yet, those economies that \\"push money around\\" are vastly better off than Mexico, where people drive down to the factory to \\"make things\\". Japan also makes things, and has been in a 15-year macroeconomic decline.If you are liberal Bush-hater, you will see all your beliefs reconfirmed.

Is that your question? \\"could anybody have predicted this?\\" Well, if we are expected to buy into this book \\"American Theocracy\\" then what guarantee is there that he won't be similarly \\"entirely wrong\\" once again?And you know of course his terrible political marksmanship isn't limited to that book.

Anyway, he was sure that the Marina had probably raised launch fees over the past year, and damned if he wasn't right.My point: Is Mr. Phillips a genious to anticipate that peak oil and soaring prices had occured over such an extended time frame. Hell, a 16 ounce bottle of RC Cola costs almost a dollar if you can even find one. THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING GOES UP OVER TIME (EXCEPT SPECIFIC LADIES OF THE NIGHT; THEIR PRICES GOES DOWN OVER TIME).As for Phillips: Plenty of rage -- he points out many ghosts in the machine -- but where are the solutions? With over 30 years to contribute, he is content to sit on the sidelines and pull his little notebook from his backpocket everytime he hears a clever new way to insult someone.Phillips has made three sweeping predictions in the past and not ONE -- none have come to fruition! He has been consistent only in his weak attempts to conceil his bourgeoisie with hi-jacked verbage. He was,is and always will be ignored by the powers inside the beltway where he so longed to fit in and now his politics have changed so drastically \\"only\\" when it became clear that he would never fill a productive role.He is quick to characterize religious works as Armageddon hysterics, but what is this book if not a blatant warning of a global disaster. If his claims were to somehow magically come to fruition wouldn't this book be just as extreme as any radical Southern Baptist evangelical."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Author, advisor, and academic Kevin Phillips is a man of considerable intellect. In the late 1960s he penned a signal work (\\"The Emerging Republican Majority\\") that successfully prophesized the ways in which massive socioeconomic and demographic shifts in American society from a northern and industrial one to one more centered in what he euphemistically referred to as the \\"Sunbelt\\". In detailing this momentous transformation, Phillips made some then-startling prognostications how such a shift in population and potential electoral votes would presage the long-term shift to a more conservative and Republican-oriented political majority for generations to come. Of course, being a conservative Republican himself, he assumed that this development meant greater fiscal responsibility, more rationally-based international savoir-faire, and much greater social stability. Yet, as he admits in his latest volume, \\"American Theocracy\\", that is hardly what the record reflects having transpired in the intervening thirty five years.Instead, in this calm, clear, and well articulated tour of the social, economic, and political territory with which he is so familiar, Phillips describes the contemporary topography of conservative republican rule as being an inhospitable and ungovernable landscape pocked by craters of ideological fervor, fiscal insanity, and unspeakable personal greed. In many ways, his well-articulated broadside against the political right is all the more damning because it is not only from a true believer, but also from an outstanding academic with a persuasive resume, a man who carefully documents and substantiates everything he cites, especially in this scathing look at exactly where it is that the 21st century's form of rabid Republican conservatism is leading us. Yet one does not find here so much a prosaic attack on the present Bush administration as it is a penetrating historical analysis of how we got to this point in terms of three frightening enduring social and political trends, phenomena neither invented nor originated by the present administration.Phillips sees three interlocking tendencies as now reaching a critical point in defining and even threatening the future of the polity. First is the rise of the corruptive influence of oil on both domestic and foreign policy; second is the rise of an intolerant form of radical Christian doctrine into key areas of public life; and third, the incredibly irresponsible increase in the level of both public and private debt. Each of these trends threatens to undermine both the short-term and long term stability of the nation, and each in its own way is a key factor in the way that describes how it is that both the Executive branch and the Congress are becoming increasingly beholden to special interests and are increasingly undemocratic. In particular, the fashion in which President Bush and the Congress have used permanent tax cuts for the wealthy as a device to transfer responsibility for future debt away from the wealthy and toward those with less means and less political voice, while at the same time insanely increasing that public debt, defies both morality and logic. Moreover, Phillips finds that the ways in which these trends are unfolding makes us as individual citizens and as members of the larger collectivity substantially less likely and immensely less able to determine our own future in anything resembling a rational and progressive fashion.In many ways, this book represents a kind of sequel to Phillips original tome in the sense that herein he once again provides for the reader the sort of broad structural perspective illustrating the ways in which social, economic, and political change profoundly impact the future for both society at large and individuals in private, personal existence. In so detailing the powerful fashion in which these three powerful trends relate to each other and how they combine to impact the nature of American society itself, how they tend to push the nation toward ever more limited and ever weaker versions of its former substantial self, he also offers the reader an opportunity to understand the true nature of forces around us that demand public action now. This is an unnerving snapshot of America at a fateful crossroad, at a point that even the dullest among us must begin to recognize the palpable dangers. With the publication of this thoughtful and thought-provoking book, we can no longer say no one has warned us. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is the kind of book that would have kept me up at night had I read it six or seven years ago. American Theocracy convincingly and chillingly compares the current situation in the U.S. to that during the beginning of the end of the Roman Empire, The British Empire, Hapsburg Spain, and the Dutch Republic. Scared yet?Author Kevin Phillips comes up with a series of characteristics of what he called a \\"power already at its peak and starting to decline.\\" The list includes a polarization of the society and widespread concern with cultural and economic decay; growing religious fervor and an increasingly close relationship between church and state; a rising commitment to faith over reason; growing government debt; and \\"hubris-driven national strategic and military overreach.\\"Jeez, open most days' newspaper and don't be surprised to find concrete examples of each of these points.The point risks being lost amid all the white noise predicting doom and gloom of different sorts these days. No doubt most readers will find themselves a little more jaded to these sorts of prognostications than they would have been just a few years back.But what separates Mr. Phillips from the pack (at least to some extent) is his curriculum vitae: he is the same Kevin Phillips who, as a Republican strategist in the 1960s, shattered the Democrat's \\"solid south\\" in his book The Emerging Republican Majority. Most political scientists credit the book with sowing the seeds that handed the Republicans the White House in every election since then that didn't feature a highly-intelligent southern governor on top of the Democratic ticket as a way to wrestle a few electoral votes away south of the Mason-Dixon line.If Mr. Phillips can recognize the hubris in what he helped create, then maybe that's something we should take seriously.The book comes a bit unraveled at the end, though, when Mr. Phillips unconvincingly argues that the disastrous war in Iraq was precipitated by the needs of several key Republican constituencies: energy producers looking for new oil and gas fields to develop, currency traders worried that OPEC might abandon the dollar and cause its collapse, and evangelical Christians who see events of the last generation in the Middle East as coming right from the Book of Revelation, hailing Armageddon. While he there some validity in his conclusions, Mr. Phillips is no doubt oversimplifying an astonishingly complex set of issues.But his ultimate conclusion -- that Republican extremists currently pulling the strings of power in Washington are responsible for the country's energy vulnerability, over-stretched military, sky-high debt levels, and the indulgence of radical religion -- are a threat to the country as great as the one facing fifth-century Rome is rings true and is without a doubt bone chilling. Come to think of it, American Theocracy may yet keep me awake with worry tonight."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips is one of the most widely read and acclaimed in this field. Of his many works, \\"The Emerging RepublicanMajority\\" written 40 years ago in 1969, gives him the credibility, as well as his 13 other books since. \\"American Theocracy\\" discusses the 5 decades of growth many recent developments occurring in the US political, economic, religious and cultural realm in the GOP. He supports his points with lots of research and referencing.Phillips states the GOP and US government are \\"a fusion ofpetroleum-defined national security; a crusading, simplisticChristianity; and a reckless credit-feeding financial complex.\\"At one time, the GOP was the party of stability, order, low taxes, low spending, and small government (in theory at least).The author notes the transition of the GOP to what many others think and believe today: In 2006, it's over. The Republican party can never argue again that it's the party of low taxes and spending, and small government. The 'big-government GOP' began long before The G.W . Bush administration, but Bush 43 has greatly exacerbated to shift to big spending, biggovernment, conglomerate control, and the erosion of personalliberties and freedom of speech. Today there is a Cult of Personality and a lack of critical thought and even disdain -- to the slightest questioning or criticism of American domestic and foreign policy: Bushbots. Federal bureaucratic interference in education with the \\"No Child Left Behind,\\" Act, and the promulgation of the pseudo-scientific \\"Intelligent Design.\\" The federal government's interference in the Schiavo case is another clear example of many, noted in \\"American Theocracy.\\"Borrowed Prosperity:\\"a preference for conspicuous consumption over energy efficiency and conservation,\\"\\"Never before have political leaders urged . . . large-scaleindebtedness on American consumers to rally the economy,\\"It was Phillips who coined the well-know term \\"The Sunbelt.

Buy more stuff. How? By using their home equity as an ATM machine as they falsely believed they were \\"wealthier.\\" Will there be consequences?Perhaps. Perhaps, not.Petro-Politics and the Military-Industrial Complex:The U.S. government learned during WWII that high military and defense spending helps the US economy, provides jobs which in turn, spur consumer spending, while redistributing wealth to corporations (defense contracting companies).Petro-Warriors:When troops first went into Iraq, what was the first thing theysecured? the Iraqi Oil Ministry, and several oil refineries. One of the primary and public arguments for the invasion of Iraq by the US government was 1. it would help the U.S. economy and 2. it would cause oil prices to decline.Potential Impact:As for Phillip's latest, even more convincing is his perspective. He isn't a fan of the Royal Bush family, NOR does he see Hillary as a viable and effective alternative. If Americans can stop pretending that parties are really that different on the political spectrum they can realize, that American culture, habits and behaviour, will be thedeciding factor. However I don't see it happening.This is a breakthrough book that will receive attention. It's not the first book published recently, that offers these opinions. But it's the credentials of the author, Kevin Phillips that will spur discussion. Things won't change; but things will be discussed. His objective historical notes about previously fallen Empires involved several historical facts that have occurred to other great powers in the past: global usurpation, religious intransigence, debt, and dependency on resources that are *outside* of the nation.What Phillips is describing is not Earth shattering, bold, nor brave. Because it's a truthful observation based on statistical facts, not necessarily just opinion. And, it's a concept that happens to ALL empires over the course of world history. The Roman Empire declined over a period of 300 to 400 years. The United States does not seem to have that long. I suspect when it starts, which may be now, it will take 50 to 100 years. However, when it will begin exactly , is what we don't know. Like all of history, time moves on, and so does Earth's civilization.Worth noting again, readers must disassociate themselves from their own natural biases. Like all books regarding the current political, cultural, and religious landscape: don't focus on opposing sides and viewpoints. Focus on the book's various perspectives and then apply to your perceptions. Then, deconstruct this book by yourself."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"In my opinion Kevin Phillips understands the real problems facing America better than any other Republican in America. He is also the kind of Republican who has increasingly been marginalized in the take over of the party by the far left. By no stretch of the imagination is he a liberal (though unquestionably a host of Republicans who haven't read the book will write a review here proclaiming him a liberal), but more of a classic, pre-Reagan conservative in the Russell Kirk, Peter Viereck mode. Despite being a leftist myself, I have long found Phillips to be one of the most acute analysts of the genuine-as opposed to trumped up-problems afflicting American life. In WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY he wrote eloquently of the problems of the undue influence of the wealthy in our democracy as well as the extraordinary and dramatic growth of economic inequality over the past two and a half decades.AMERICAN THEOCRACY may be Phillips's most important book yet. I was ecstatic when I found a copy this past weekend at a bookstore that broke the moratorium and put their copies out a few days early (bookstores-especially the big chains-often get copies of books to be released on a Tuesday late the previous week, and occasionally they will inadvertently put copies out) and spent the weekend reading it. Phillips explicitly states that his goal is to deal with three of the most pressing problems in American life today, problems that surpass terrorism as a real threat. These three problems are referred to in the subtitle and are dealt with in serial order, though because the problems are intertwined the discussions spill over into one another. The first problem is our dependence on oil and the degree to which it has shaped and determined our national priorities and policies. Phillips thinks historically and understands that nothing takes place without a rich historical context. While many talking about oil and its place in contemporary society begin with the discovery of oil in Pennsylvania in the 19th century, Phillips goes much further back, discussing the way that the discovery and mastery of new forms of energy has parallels in previous economically dominant nations. In particular, he writes of the ways that the mastering of water and wind by the Dutch led to their economic ascendance in 17th century Europe and exploiting coal led to the creation of the British Empire. But he also writes of how both nations eventually lost their international preeminence, a change that could very well have begun for the US right now, which became predominant in the previous century due to its exploitation of oil. Phillips writes at length of the development of America's involvement in oil both domestically and abroad. He writes eloquently of how our preoccupation with oil, despite the protests of virtually everyone in the Bush administration to the contrary, was one of the primary causes for our adventurism in Iraq, which has not only has some of the richest oil reserves in the world but has large reserves that have not yet begun to peak, which means that it is cheaper petroleum to harvest.Because the world's largest oil reserves are in the Middle East, and because premillenial fundamentalists harbor a host of beliefs about the fate of the world and the role that New Babylon (i.e., Iraq) and Israel will play in the end times drama, this part of the book often branches over into the many connections the area has with the aspirations and hopes of many in the Religious Right. But I was ecstatic in reading the book to see Phillips deal not only with the premillenial crowd, which is for the most part the only part of the Religious Right that most mainstream Americans are familiar, but with Christian Reconstructionists or Domionists. Christian Reconstructionists are generally not premillenialists, i.e., they do not believe in the kind of scenario mapped out by Hal Lindsey in his THE LATE-GREAT PLANET EARTH (repeatedly updated due to repeated failures of any of the events he prophesies to take place), where Jesus will return, remove all the Christians from earth, leaving nonbelievers to struggle with a host of trials and tribulations. Christian Reconstructionists believe it is the duty of Christians to strive for the founding of the Kingdom of God on earth. Although even many fundamentalists have never heard of these guys, they have exerted far more influence than many would suspect. Because they have been so far under the radar (mainly because they know that even many within the Religious Right would find their beliefs repulsive), their influence, which is considerable, has gone largely undetected. There are both extreme and somewhat more moderate Reconstructionists. The more extreme, for instance, don't merely believe that homosexuals, for instance, should be killed, but debate what the Biblically approved method of execution should be (stoning or burning are two widely approved methods). Reconstructionists hope gradually to establish a Christian Theocracy, where the Bible (and for some reason these guys are especially oriented towards Old Testament law) establishes the basis for society. The more extreme wings of this movement envision a society in which women are not allowed to work but stay home with their children (don't want children? well, too bad), gays and even heretics (i.e., nonbelievers) are candidates for stoning or burning, and we live in a nation as fundamentalist as any imagined by even the most passionate ayatollah. Milder forms of Reconstructionism sees America as being founded as a Christian nation (all on the Religious Right seem to have a completely bizarre view of the founding fathers, especially Madison) in which Christian law should dominate. Presidential candidate Sam Brownback is of this ilk.Christian Reconstructionism is, of course, utterly unacceptable to the vast majority of Americans and it is impossible to imagine it ever gaining any of its most cherished goals. But I've been concerned that they have influenced so much American policy behind the scenes. All that needs to be done to overwhelm their efforts is to expose them to the light of day. Phillips goes a long ways towards doing this. I have read extensively about the Religious Right and politics (I was raised a fundamentalist and am a licensed Baptist minister, though I did not go into the ministry after attending seminary and divinity school) and found Phillips discussions to be well informed and balanced. I think he does a fine job of showing that the Religious Right is not a monolithic movement but a coalition of movements, many with their own agendas and concerns. He does not believe that America is in fact in danger of becoming a theocracy, but he does feel that religious influence has become extreme and unacceptable. I have to add that I do think the title of the book is a bit misleading, since he doesn't think America either is or can become a theocracy. The subtitle is a far better pointer to the book's content.The third problem he addresses is that of our culture of debt. This does not refer merely to the deficit, but the degree to which debt penetrates virtually every aspect of our society in general and government in particular. Phillips's shows in detail the host of ways that this indebtedness threatens the national security and could endanger the most crucial social programs that the aging segment of society depends upon.I think that between this book and his previous WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY Phillips has dealt very successfully with four of the five major problems in America today, though I think Phillips curiously fails to note the fifth. The four problems he deals with are the three in this book-the influence of oil on our national policy, the growing influence of right wing religion on national priorities, and our growing culture of debt-and the main one in WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY, the growing economic inequality in the country (I would argue that on a practical level this is the major problem). The fifth is the massively bloated military-industrial sector. When over half of all government spending goes to the military, especially when there are no other military superpowers in the world, you have a long-term recipe for economic and political disaster. I hope that Americans begin to take note of the warnings found in these books. For the most part America seems to me a distracted nation, focusing on lesser problems or pseudo problems. Meanwhile, the problems that are beginning to undermine our nation and our democracy are largely ignored. This is a brilliant discussion of three of the threats facing our nation and I urge everyone who loves America to read it as quickly as possible and then hand it on to friends."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips is perhaps the best person to write a book like this - a Republican analyst, he can not easily be dismissed as someone with a lock-step animosity toward the Right wing. He analyses in the past, including the rise of the Republican party in the manner that it has, has been correct in many ways for several decades. Phillips writes in many ways as someone who is a court insider giving fair warning to the king - the kingdom has some troubles.Phillips identifies three principles areas of concern - the rise of certain elements of religion into the political sphere, the problems of oil as a national addiction (to use the President's own words), and the growing crisis of deficit and economic mismanagement. Phillips is a political commentator with an eye toward history, he makes apt comparisons with empires of the past: the Dutch trading empire, the British colonial empire, and even the Roman empire provide parallels for the United States in the twenty-first century. One thing to note - the period of stability of empires has decreased over the millennia; whereas an empire like Rome might sustain itself for half a millennium, later empires were able to sustain themselves for less and less time. The United States has been the pre-eminent global superpower for less than a century, and is already looking at relative decline.The problem with oil, according to Phillips, involves problems with both foreign and domestic policy as well as cultural issues. Rather than address growing needs, the Republicans in power have instead adopted a dangerous laissez-faire approach that threatens long-term stability, Phillips notes.The problem with the deficit and finance is similar to this - the Republican party used to be the party of smaller government and less spending, but in the past twenty five years, it has only been a Democratic administration that has been able to get the budget deficit under control. This is the kind of fiscal management that again jeopardises the long-term for the country.The problem of radical religion is not a new thing in American politics. While the country might not have been founded on quite the same principles being touted as Founding Fathers Theology today, it is true to say that religion has always had a role in the culture, and hence the politics of the nation. However, the danger is real - Phillips makes very telling comparisons with the ante-bellum situation of the North and South, showing how many issues prior to the Civil War involved religious dimensions, and how the long-term injection of religious radicalism can destabilise the culture (this works on both the Left and the Right, by the way).In addition to a critique of the Right, Phillips has strong words for the Democratic opposition as well, in that there isn't any kind of consistent vision or organisation being offered in distinction from the incumbents.This is a worthwhile book for anyone Left, Right or in the muddle (er, middle)."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips is a Republican who puts voice to what concerns many American citizens, (both Republican and Democrat, secular and Christian): 1) that our nation is being taken over by extreme radical right-wing Christian clerics, 2) that our budget deficit is becoming more and more dangerous and 3) that our dependence on a dwindling oil supply will eventually permanently cripple us.This is a gripping piece of non-fiction that presents a balanced and well-researched view of a growing problem many people seem to prefer to ignore rather than address head-on, as Mr. Phillips courageously does in this book.I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who feels that our country is becoming more and more unrecognizable to what it was even 6-8 years ago."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips is a well-respected political analyst who is garnering hostility among right-wing reviewers precisely because his account of the rise of the Christian right is factual, objective and compelling. There is no bigotry in calling a political movement a political movement. Christian doctrine is broader, and Christianity more inclusive, than the narrow views and political boundaries adovcated by the religious right, the members of whom hide behind their religious beliefs when their political opinions and actions are challenged. I am a Catholic and a liberal democrat. Phillip's book -- which describes the perils to our nation caused by overdependence on oil, excessive debt, and the hijacking of the national agenda by relgious right -- is a must read for anyone who believes that freedom and justice for all is a higher value than domination by the zealous few."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Mr. Phillips has obviously struck a nerve with his latest book. A former Republican political strategist recognizes how his party, and our nation, has been hijacked by people who are either unable or unwilling to recognize the perils of religious fundamentalism; Muslim, Christian, or otherwise.Excellent book, highly recommended."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"since I did not want to wait for shipping. Thanks to all those who reviewed it accurately (and apparently read the book before writing a review)The details of the American theocracy movement (Dominion-ism and reconstruction-ism) were not really new to me having done extensive research over the past 10 years. I came into contact with some of the more rabid branches long ago and made it my business to keep tabs on the political takeovers of churches and homeschooling textbooks. The alliance of the radical right and the dominionist heresy is, if anything, downplayed a bit from it's reality.The chapters on the politics of oil and the credit industrial complex, while made mostly from published evidence, is compiled in a very readable way that living through it as the flow of \\"current events\\" does not allow us to comprehend. Phillips lays it out in a narrative and style that ties those incremental changes together.Sure the radical wing of Christians will not read it or will try to convince the mainstream christian denominations that it is somehow aimed at them, but the truth is, Philips has identified the biggest threat to Christians and to religious liberty that we have seen in the history of this country.Remember, a theocracy will not tolerate a diversity of sects and denominations past the point where it gets power and no longer needs them."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is a five-star book that offers up two very serious values:1) There is no other author who has written in such depth, over the course of four books, on the Republican party, the Bush dynasty, and the inter-relationship between the religious right and corporate wealth. This Republican is as serious an analyst as any that can be found. he joins Clyde Prestowitz, Paul O'Neil, and Peter Peterson as \\"go to guys\\" for when Senator John Edwards forms the American Independence Party and breaks away from the idiot Democrats and the Clinton mafia.2) The author has done his homework and very ably integrated, with all appropriate footnotes and index entries, three broad literatures, two of which I have read multiple books on (oil and debt), one on which I have not (radical US religion--fully the equal of Bin Laden and suicidal terrorists, these folks just send others to do the dying for them).So I have to say, given that this is a serious book by a serious author, why so many obviously loosely-read individuals writing short dismissive reviews? I have to conclude he has touched a nerve. When I used to appear on NPR, before I was kicked off for condemning Israeli lobbyists and suggesting that the common Arabs (the real people, not the sadistic opulent corrupt House of Saud or the other dictators) never got a fair shake from the US, I would get hate calls and mail from what I now realize were know-nothing radical right-wing religious nuts. We'd get into the issues, and I would ask, \\"what books have you read on this?\\" only to be told, \\"There is only one book that matters, the Bible.\\"Well, this author has helped me understand where the Bush constituency comes from: these are the folks that graduated from rote reading of the Bible to the \\"Left Behind\\" fiction series. They are the intellectual equals of the Islamic kids learning to be suicide bombers by reciting old Arabic they don't understand.If you do not have the time or money to buy all the other books I have reviewed, spanning emerging threats, the lack of strategy and the inappropriate force structure, the anti-Americanism that we spawn, the corruption of Wall Street and the shallowness of white collar law enforcement, the end of cheap oil, the end of free water, the rise of pandemic disease, the coming date with destiny when the 44 dictators we support are overthrown and the US pays the price for its long-term nurturing of all but three of them....this book brings a lot together. It avoids only two really important topics: the environmental implications such as covered by TIME Magazine in the 3 April 2006 cover story on Global Warming; and the minutia of how America is no longer a real democracy--not only do most voters not vote, but once elected, most Congressman are corrupted immediately by lobbyists.The author, who is uniquely qualified to sum this all up in this book because of his three prior books centered on the Bush Family, oil, and wealth, does a tremendous job of outlining how oil money ultimately bought the White House and Congress. If you have time for two other books, I recommendCrossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oilin which a former LAPD investigator makes a case for indicting Dick Cheney for fabricating the march to war on Iraq under the delusion that we would get another ten years of \\"cheap oil\\" andTwilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economyin which it is clearly documented that both Congress and the White House knew in 1974-1975 that Peak Oil was over, and they concealed this for another 25 years in order to keep the bribery coming--this was nothing less than a treasonous betrayal of the public interest worthy of retrospective impeachments for all concerned. The books by moderate Republicans Prestowitz (Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentions) and Petersen (Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It) should be read as well asBrand Hijack : Marketing Without Marketingwhich is about why Paul O'Neil quit the Bush Administration--he realized that ideological fantasy and Dick Cheney had displaced a reasoned policy process, the Cabinet, and Congressional concurrence.....This is a very bad time. This book is as good as any at setting the stage for intelligent people to campaign and vote in 2006 and 2008.EDIT 7 Dec 07: Since I wrote this review, several gems are newly available:American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War On AmericaPiety & Politics: The Right-Wing Assault on Religious FreedomGod's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It (Plus)Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidencyand on and on and on...."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips' book American Theocracy really outlines the more likely truths behind the Iraq War and the expansion of the US military throughout the middle east. He describes the crisis in the oil industry in historical detail that led to the ultimate decision to invade Iraq. It wasn't for weapons of mass destruction as we all suspected but for strategic purposes (building key military bases in the Middle East outside of Saudi Arabia) and to secure remaining oil reserves that reside largely in that area of the world. The US multinationals especially the oil industry, engineering construction giants like Halliburton and Wall Street firms were hungry to pry open the markets of Iraq and gain access to these substantial oil reserves and markets. In addition they wanted to protect the American dollar and put a check on OPEC's excesses. With the Iraq fields in tow, the US remains largely in control of the major world oil markets. This book does an able job of discussing this history and the events leading up to the war as well as the constituencies that have fueled the current Bush administration's fortunes: fundamentalist Christians (whose numbers have been growing steadily since the 70's) who view the middle east as the site of Armageddon and the growth of the debt market which now commands more of the US gross national product than manufacturing. My one criticism of his history is his omission of the enormous power of the US defense industries whose influence is felt in all 50 states and whose interests are certainly furthered by the Administration's aggressive response to the war on terror. Finally, Phillips does a very compelling job of detailing the importance of the events of 911 in prompting the American people and our media to support these current policies with minimal dissent. It's a chilling picture but a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"In his book American theocracy, Kevin Phillips gives a frighteningly accurate view of the religious right. For the purposes of my review I will stay on the authors point of the Christian right and their agendas.Phillips assessment of the dangers of biblical literalism isn't over stated. As Phillips points out the right believes that the decisions that they make are moving the world closer to the \\"end times\\" and the \\"second coming of Jesus Christ.\\" For the men and women who truly believe this type of church propaganda their beliefs color all of their decisions. The leaders of today's administration truly believe that they are ushering in the end of the world and the return of their Messiah. Armageddon is not just a cataclysmic event; it is an actual place in the Middle East around the area we know as Iraq and Iran. Those government leaders who lead by \\"biblical design\\" and not by conventional wisdom or rational world views lead us into possible destruction.Phillips is not exaggerating in his assessment of the situation facing the United States and other nations of the world. The fundamentalist Christian mentality could very well lead America into another world war. We are governed by leaders who speak of \\"Evil\\" powers that look to destroy our way of life with a blind eye to their own actions.Phillips turns the focus back to ourselves and asks Americans to look at what they are doing and realize that it is our own actions that are leading us down a possible road to ruin. An eye opening expose on American ideals and the people who are pushing their apocalyptic agenda on an unsuspecting nation and world."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Drawing on historical precedents, Kevin Phillips paints a stark picture of the U.S.A. in her twilight; overburdened by an outrageously large and growing debt, dependent on a diminishing resource, and blinded and misled by fanatical religious elements. This book should be required reading for all high school seniors - we may be able to \\"dodge the bullet\\" if enough Americans understood the situation - but, alas, this will not happen soon."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips new book, American Theocracy, is a brilliant contribution to the field of political analysis. Painstakingly researched and with point by point detail, he examines the elements that have catapulted the G.O.P. into political dominance. Far from being a simple attack or iconoclastic doomsayer, American Theocracy is a history book: the history of voting patterns, attitudes and foundations of the electorate over more than a century. These elements he breaks down into three main categories: energy consumers and interests, the religious right, and the financial sector.Lest you immediately attack the author's credibility, I remind you that this he was described by the Wall Street Journal in 1982 as \\"the leading conservative electoral analyst -- the man who invented the Sun Belt, named the New Right, and prophesied \`The Emerging Republican Majority' in 1969.\\" His work as Senior Strategist for Nixon (1968) followed by a stint as Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General, John Mitchell solidify his credentials as a traditional political and fiscal conservative, although his written opinions on social issues define him as a social liberal.In the first section of the book he makes the case that for more than five hundred years international dominance has centered around energy, to the benefit yet eventual downfall of each of those nations. Once the economic infrastructure of the country becomes dependent on the energy source, that same country becomes mired in inefficiency when that source becomes scarce or outdated. First the Spanish with wood, then the Dutch with water and wind, and finally the British with coal. As Phillips says, \\"One generation's innovations become another's entrenchments.\\" Why is this important to the thesis? As he shows, energy consumption can be charted directly to voting patterns: the more fuel a person uses, the greater likelihood that person votes Republican. The first leg in the triad of support.Next he goes into an exhaustive study of religion in America, where he shows that evangelizing and Charismatic sects of Christianity are as much a part of the national identity as apple pie. We've always had a tradition of religious freedom and extreme displays of Christian worship. However, starting with Reconstruction that tradition flourished in the South and moved West with the migration of disenfranchised Confederate families. Far from being an anomaly, these fundamentalists consisting of such various sects as Southern Baptist, Pentecostals, Mormons and Seventh-Day Adventists have thrived and grown where traditional Old-World Religions have suffered from declining attendance and diminished influence.The third leg in his Conservative triad is the financial sector. For that he once again shows the evolution of dynastic powers - the Spanish, Dutch, and English - showing that when a nation becomes more a banking power than a producer it has transitioned into the declining phase of its influence. For evidence he gives pages upon pages of debt calculus. To be honest, this is what I believe to be the weakest part of his thesis since the debt to GDP ratios don't support his hypothesis of a massive debt crushing trend on our economy. That is not to say that I don't believe that we should be cautious with our national debt, because just as with personal finances, I believe that debt should be an instrument of growth not a dependency of excess to prop up an unsupportable lifestyle. That said, this is Phillips weakness in terms of ominous forecasts.In contrast to The Holy Vote by Ray Suarez, I think American Theocracy takes a strong look into the reasons behind the rise of fundamentalist political power and the powerful block that it represents. As he correctly points out, the last two Democratic Presidents were Southern and (at least outwardly, in Clinton's case) Baptist. Carter was America's first Born Again president. And, it's doubtful that any Democrat will win the presidency in the near future without at least some share of this important fundamentalist vote. For anyone who wants a great lesson in political strategy and demographic history, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips, the same arch conservative from 30 years ago who predicted the rise of the right, but he didn't imagine what it actually became. His vision was of a true conservative government of small government, and very little governmental interference. He now sees what has mutated out of this original vision, and it scares the hell out of him. And well it should. Imagine an American Taliban, dictating when and how we worship, keeping us in a state of constant warfare. It is a horrible vision of the future, and one that is all to possible."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The broad scope of Phillips' latest work is stunning. The manner in which he draws on historical parallels of earlier global hegemons to the contemporary US is enlightening and even a bit disturbing. The same can be said of his extensive description of the role religion, especially protestant fundamentalism in the South, has played and continues to play ever more so in American politics. This is the sort of book which will keep you awake at night thinking."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"A lengthy interview with Phillips on NPR prompted me to read this book. In lesser hands, American Theocracy's long lamentation about the potentially terminal problems this nation faces could have worn thin rather quickly, no matter how well taken its points.But Phillips keeps a lively and wry tone throughout, and the volume is imbued with such clear-eyed analysis, I am immediately curious to read more of the author's work.In the meantime, I will try to press this book into the hands of every money-hungry business person, SUV owner, and Iraqi war enthusiast I know. (I won't bother with the born-again Christians; a good argument never changed anyone's religious persuasions, more's the pity.)"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"While waiting for end-times and the Rapture and the NBA Finals and whatnot, I have been doing some creative thinking on the American presence in the Middle East as well as the evolution (Intelligent Design?) of American political thought. Lucky for me Kevin Phillips has written a thoughtful book designed precisely to inflame my partisan passions.It has always been my position that Cheney and Rummy and their neo-con brethren care nary a whit for spreading freedom or Jeffersonian democracy or saving preemie babies in a Kuwaiti hospital (a pretense for the 1991 invasion) but rather have a keen understanding that continued American hegemony in the 21st Century is entirely dependent on a copious supply of friendly, reasonably-priced oil. Iraq is admittedly the cradle of our civilization, having produced the wheel, writing, and the first code of law. As has been noted by Phillips and others, the first building we secured in Bagdad post-invasion was not the National Museum commemorating these achievements (rather, we allowed that to be looted.) American forces secured the Oil Ministry instead, which contained all the seismic portraiture of the Iraqi oil fields.All of this is covered in Phillips new book and makes fine meat and potatoes for those of us who are amused and frightened by Bush's Messianic visions and robot-speak. Nevertheless, there is plenty of objective reporting and even a bit of science (remember science?) for everyone else.The best quote in the book belongs to the late historian Edward Said, and I think it sums up Phillips' thesis rather neatly:\\"Every single empire, in its official discourse, has said that it is not like all the others, that its circumstances are special, that it has a mission to enlighten, civilize, bring order and democracy, and that it uses force only as a last resort.\\""},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"You may not like what author Kevin Phillips says about President George W. Bush and America's current state. In fact, loyal Bush supporters may write off Phillips' views as paranoid left-wing poppycock, although he is a former Republican strategist who played a key role in Richard Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. Here, Phillips unleashes a furious bare-knuckle assault on the Bush administration. He insists that it is setting up the U.S. for a mighty fall. Utilizing historical evidence to construct his case, Phillips postulates that the combination of America's crushing debt, dependence on foreign oil and conservative religious fanaticism is a recipe for disaster. Those who agree with Phillips' contention that \\"history is likely to remember George W. Bush as one of America's most damaging two-term presidents\\" will be screaming \\"I told you so!\\" as they traverse this tome. And yet, Bush backers should resist the temptation to dismiss Phillips completely. The book is heavily footnoted, but Phillips skillfully connects the dots, extracting information from hundreds of newspaper articles, scholarly journals and speeches to assemble a compelling presentation. Whether you are for Bush, against Bush or worried about the shape the U.S. is in, we recommend this well-researched, thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I've read this book twice (from the library) and bought my own copy so I would have access to the information that Kevin Phillips presents. This well-written book is a must read if you want to understand what's going on in the US today. The author of The Emerging Republican Majority describes how the Republican party has sold out it's conservative principles to interests representing oil, religion, and the financial services oriented debt-industrial complex. Citing historical precedents that show the parallels between what's going on in the US today and what went on in past empires that entered decline and are now \\"over the hill\\" (Spanish, Dutch, English).

The younger George Bush, contrary to the old ridiculous saw about \\"big spending Democrats\\" doubled the national debt from 5 trillion to 10 trillion by breaking what has always been a 24-carat, carved-in-stone axium: \\"You can't have both guns AND butter\\". But what made this volume even more enjoyable (to me) than Kevin's earlier one is that he really DOES examine in pretty much equal parts the largest facets of the 2000's quamire. There is an excellent profile of radical religion...a great view of oil's crucial place in the soon-to-turn-terriblu ugly equation...and an accurate and sickening look at the billions and billions and billions Bush and his lapdog Congress happily and in cavalier fashion spent as if they were nickels!! In short, if like current events and especially looking back to try and figure out, \\"What the heck HAPPENED ??\\" between 2000 and 2008...So, wrapping it all up, what does Christian Carswell say you should do?

The acronym GOD suffices to penetrate the dangers facing our country: G for God and the danger of so-called Christians wishing to blur or even eradicate separation of Church and State and set up their concept of religion; O for oil and how it has controlled our foreign policy, military adventures and economy for decades. My, oh my, sounds simplistic, but Phillips, a former Republican strategist and a TRUE conservative has no truck with conspiracy theories. He just presents the facts without hysteria. The D stands for our national Debt and the danger it holds for our and the world's economy when \\"the chickens come home to roost\\". As a conservative he deplores the financial profligacy that at this point is increasing our indebtedness daily to the tune of 1.5 billion dollars.This book is not for the fainthearted and those zombies who would follow this administration into the abyss."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This well researched and documented volume is divided into three parts. He begins with oil, next with radical fundamentalist religion, and finishes with debt. Phillips brings these disparate elements together into a synthesis of the state of America in 2006.Beginning with oil he discusses the coming world oil peak in the production of conventional oil and makes a strong case (really obvious) that the war in Iraq is to secure their oil for our use, and that the excuse to invade Iraq to look for WMDs was just a charade. Well, the American people may have finally caught on, the last poll I saw had 58% of Americans believing they were misled concerning the war in Iraq...I guess better late than never. He also discusses Washington's efforts to keep all worldwide oil purchases in American dollars and how this benefits our economy. Much more in this section is included.The next section is about fundamentalist religion and how the Republican party is now tied to fanantical religion in the USA, and relies on their support at election time. He writes extensively of fundamentalist belief in a 'rapture' and how stirring up trouble in the Middle East will hasten this rapture, in their opinions, so they support Bush in this war. I believe Phillips makes a very good case here, and he also quotes several middle of the ground theologians who say the very idea of a rapture is false and mistaken. Interesting reading indeed. Phillips also goes into detail how the believers in the 'ends times' could care less about stewardship of the planet, such as conservation, global warming issues, wildlife habitats, overpopulation, as the 'end' is coming anyway, so lets hurry it along...crazy, crazy. I think Phillips is 'right on the money' here, some of these people are real loony tunes. Also wrote at length here is comparisons betweeen England just before World War One and America 2005-2006. England just prior to WW1 contained a fanantical religious fervor, believing God to be on their side in everything, and that they had to spread their 'way' to the rest of the world via wars and missionaries. They believed the war would be short and sweet with Germany, of course that was not to happen, they became overextended and reality soon crushed in on them. This is a must read, as many Americans are following the same false path. Covered here also is the Republican effort to saturate conservative super-churches with their propaganda to enlist their support in elections. Phillips himself is a former Republican stategist who writes here that he is ashamed at what these Republicans are doing with their marriage of empire building, radical religion, and massive debt of all kinds.As for the last section on debt, Phillips writes extensively about personal debt, government debt, and the trade deficit with other countries. It all seems like a 'house of cards' to me. He writes of the top one or two percent of Americans getting much richer over the last two decades or so, but the average American struggles to get by. Much, much is covered here. Along the way he writes of neo-conservative Republicans' distrust of science if it does'nt agree with fundamentalist religion, I personally find this very offensive as I am a chemist, and this concerns areas such as stem cell research, global warming, evolution, you basically name it...loony tunes again! I could go on and on with this review, but as Phillips states here, the 2010's and 2020's could be dangerous decades. Phillips, I believe, is a visionary, this book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is an excellent book that deeply explores the history and politics of America's oil addiction, and how it is enslaving the U.S. to foreign countries. If you care about American democracy and America's independence, you will read this book.The book also explores how a small minority of religious fundamentalists have highjacked the Republican Party, and want to turn America into a Puritan village, where everybody will be wearing a scarlet letter.Lastly but not least, the book also describes how mounting personal, corporate, and national debt can and will ruin the economy of this country.This book is an important primer to understanding the politics of the Bush Presidency."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is an important book for those interested in the future welfare of our nation. It doesn't read like a novel, it demands concentration and patience, but those attributes are richly rewarded. No one has the depth of understanding of political demographics and the profound influence of radical right religion on the present administration that Phillips displays. Be afraid!"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is much more than a current affairs + politics book! It is an insightful and very, very disturbing discussion of the current state and future direction of the United States. It carefully discribes the historical basis of the strength of the \\"religious\\" right, the economic self-distruction of the United States via oil dependency and the substitution of monetary manipulation for actual production of \\"goods\\". Phillips is careful to show that the transition from greatness to second class is a well traveled path. The US has been proceded by Spain, Holland and England. We are not uniquely blessed. We are only the next chapter in the retelling of the cycle of greatness and decay. This is a MUST READ BOOK."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This book did keep me up at night because Mr. Phillips was so influential in building today's modern Republican Party. Like the late Barry Goldwater, his name is indelibly associated with the successful rise of the GOP.Sure, other people (Ivins, Hightower...etc) could write similar exposes, but we would be quickly dismissed as leftist partisans. Of course we would have disagreed with a Republican administration's plan to invade Iraq and of course we would still be critiquing their policies.Phillips's background gives him both the insider status and credibility necessary to deflect most potential criticisms around this work.He makes a very frank assessment that America as a whole is starting to decline. American society is becoming more autocratic and theocratic all while we publicly (and to some extent ironically) attempt to bring democracy to other countries using the military. Phillips is also concerned the country sinks further into financial debt.The information in the other half of the book about the Middle East was interesting. However, other authors made a similar argument (Rick Abraham, Robert Bryce, Paul Sperry, Vassilis K. Fouskas and Bulent Gokay, and Gore Vidal) so this portion was less riveting. Here it seemed like Phillips was jumping on the 'insider dissent' bandwagon after the fact.I also wish that after presenting such powerful arguments in a well reasoned manner this seasoned strategist had then offered the reader ideas to fix the admittedly dire situation. Idenifying a bad situation is important, but knowing that it can be fixed and how to fix it is critically empowering.Plus, it would be important to Mr. Phillips's own resume. Especially because had helped to construct some of the current ideology, pitching in with the clean up effort for the things he now criticizes is only fair."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips book \\"American Theocracy\\" describes three trends that he believes are occurring which are unhealthy for America and for politics in general. They are:1.Depletion of petroleum reserves with little effort being made to conserve energy or find alternative sources of energy;2. The GOP's holy, or unholy alliance with conservative elements of Christianity and the Christian denominations;3. The proliferation of credit and the decline of America into the status of a debtor nation with far more GNP value in the finance, insurance, and real estate sector of our economy than in manufacturing.Phillips book suffers from the fact that he uses too many numbers and statistical measurements to make his case. Its easy to get lost in all the numbers he is constantly throwing about. However, he does succeed in making the point that all three of the trends that he has listed above are occurring in some measure and are not healthy for America.I started the book expecting the most interesting section to be about the interwining of Christianity and republican politics. In fact, I found the section on depletion of oil reserves and energy sources to be the most interesting. As a country, we need to start taking the energy problem much more seriously. Even if we aren't running out of petroleum (and almost all good evidence suggests this is slowly occurring)most large oil reserves exist in countries with unstable political regimes. The Middle Eastern countries and Venezuela are the best examples of this.With respect to politics and religion, Phillips does point out that Americans are more religious than the European countries are. This undoubtedly drives are public policy in many ways. There is definitely a correlation between religious conservatism and political conservatism. However, Phillips and many others who draw this parallel tend to simplify things. Otherwise, how does one explain someone like former President Jimmy Carter? Jimmy is both a strong democrat and an evangelical Christian. Perhaps, votes depend less on political parties than the issues the election hinges on.Phillips has written a thought-provoking book. Hopefully, it will produce more intelligent discussion about these problems and some possible solutions."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I never fail to be impressed by Phillps' comprehensive and thoughtful political and economic analysis. Note also that he is careful to tell us that as compelling as the evidence is, history repeats itself in broad themes and specifics may vary. Careful readers will not see this as anti-christian, but as a useful study of the role of religious fanaticism, economic hegemony in decay, debt, and moving money around instead of making goods and services in the pride that cometh before the fall in dominant society's.Only fantatics respnd to thoughtful criticism as though it were opression and that is why proponents of christian right will call this book \\"anti-christian.\\""},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips sounds a wake-up call for Americans in this cautionary book about religion, oil, and consumerism. The chapters on religion were the first I read, and I was disappointed. Not all Christians believe that the Earth was created in 6,000 years (I certainly don't) yet that point is constantly hammered home by Phillips. Not all Christians are young-earth creationists. Some believe in evolution; some don't. Any scientific theory--be it evolution, gravity, or relativity--should be questioned and tested. The notion that questioning the validitiy of evolution makes one stupid is nothing more than an ad hominem attack. Logical fallacies do not prove a theory, Mr. Phillips. A better question to ask, 'is the radical religion that is being quoted extensively by Mr. Phillips really the religion that Jesus taught his followers?'There is a huge amount of corruption in government today, both in the U.S. and abroad. This book really is telling me something I already knew."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Read this book and be afraid - very afraid!"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The Author does with this book what Michael Moore does with producing movies, for the same political objective. It really is hard to read thru all the bias. He is very clever at making things logical, but if you check the facts they don't add up. Don't waste your money.This book is a pawn of political history. George W. Bush wasn't just attacked for his policy's. He was hated so much they, like this author, go after his supporters. This author creates farfetched paranoia on the religious right, feeding right into the hands of atheists who want to believe that garbage. If you are an atheist and want to validate your paranoia and prejudice against God and his followers, this is the book for you. If you are a Liberal and want to reminisce about how bad George W. Bush was, then this book is for you. If you aren't into politics, hate Michael Moore movies, then wait until this book shows up at a Garage Sale for a penny, then passover, as it is overpriced.I can't wait for the authors sequel on what followed in the wake of George W. Bush. But then again, with Obama's recovery who can afford a book?"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"As a former Republican strategist, Phillips writes \\"the Republican coalition, near and dear to me four decandes ago... has become more and more like the exhausted, erring majorities of earlier failures.\\" American Theocracy draws parallels between 21st century America with 16th century Hapsburg Spain, 17th century Dutch Republic, and 19th century Britain. This pattern of comparisons is repeated with oil, religion, and debt themes. While being in-depth in history, moderate in analysis, there is less here in conclusion. Phillips does carefully construct the book to lead to a single conclusion.Phillips has his own version of the War on Intelligent Thought. \\"Broadcast, publishing, and direct-mail empires have grown up around these fellowships and communities, creating umbrellas against the effects of secular communications.\\" Others might have called it brainwashing, or taking up arms against truth.Noting that the recent administration and its followers carefully believe that jobs are created with tax cuts, Phillips wonders why this continues when tax cuts have produced so few jobs. Phillips misses this: Republicans (and also Democrats)love the feeling of being able to hire people with their tax cut profits. That feeling mimes religion. People are especially greatly moved when they hire someone they imagine might otherwise be hungry or homeless. Unfortunately, reality doesn't follow feelings. The numbers have never been there to connect tax cuts with true job increases. The reverse is true. Job gains have been consistently higher in years without tax cuts. Expanding government, with its experience in handling bureaucracy, its ability to open otherwise unprofitable markets, and its ability to direct efforts toward specific problem areas, outperforms tax cuts for creating jobs. This will seem like heresy to the radical religious, under umbrellas sheltered from secular raindrops.Despite the scathing review of recent Republican politics, the book offers no cheerleading, and no analysis of Democrat politics. Immigration policy problems loom at least as large as those three discussed here."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips appears guilty of the same technique of fire and brimstone preachers, as he paints a three-headed nightmare vision of oil, theocracy and debt coming together in the collapse of America as we know it. He supports his arguments with the usual assemblage of statistics and historical footnotes we have come to expect from him. In many ways this book is a continuation of American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush, which he refers back to several times in his narrative. He also marshalls information from a wide variety of other books that draw the same conclusion -- the United States is an empire in decline.The crux of his narrative lay in the middle chapters on American theocracy, illustrating how fundamental and charismatic religions have come to dominate the Republican Party, and in turn the nation. He takes aim specifically at the Southern Baptist Convention and Pentecostalism, which he feels have usurped Catholic, Episcopal and Methodist Churches in this country in terms of moral authority, if not numbers. He charts the growth of the evangelical religions and the decline of the mainline religions in a series of demographic charts and tables, but views these evangelical religions as monolithic fronts, when they are anything but. The Southern Baptist Convention has produced such disparate figures as Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Carter, but Phillips glosses over these differences, noting that the SBC is primarily conservative and as such has hijacked Southern political thinking, and in turn has \\"Southernized\\" the nation.He provides a brief overview of the complex nature of petro-dollars and our enormous debt burden, which has grown astronomically since the Reagan years, blaming it on the deregulation that occurred in the 80's. While I tend to agree with his appraisals, I don't think the nation will implode, but rather sink into a long recession at some point when the enormous credit bubble finally bursts.While he compares our impending collapse with that of Great Britain, the Dutch Empire and Imperial Spain, he doesn't note that all these former empires bounced back over time, even if they no longer exerted as much influence as they once did. However, Britain still has its commonwealth, and as such remains a powerful global force.You can draw your own conclusions, but I would take Phillips' findings with a grain of salt. He strikes me as a disillusioned neocon (he once was a speech writer for Nixon) who is unhappy with the way religion has come to dominate Republican party politics. After all, he notes that he was one of the first persons to see the potential to tap into Southern frustration with the Democratic Party, and draw on it for Republican gains in the South during the Goldwater campaign, which Nixon later exploited in 1968.However, there is nothing unique about the current confluence of religion and politics. Our country has gone through peaks and valleys of overt religious influence in politics, most recently during Eisenhower's administration, when the pledge of allegiance was amended to include \\"One Nation Under God,\\" which radical religious conservatives would dearly like to see happen, but as such they still remain a minority in this country, not the \\"moral majority\\" evangelicals like Falwell would like to claim."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The book dares to contend that 'most Orthodox Jews cant read Torah' and from there it is all down hill. One might wonder just exatcly how Jews became mixed up in a book ostensibly about how the 'evil' religious right controls America. In many ways this book is a great insight, and for this reason it should be read, into the mind of the extreme left in AMerica. Rampant, insane, conspiracy theories are paraded out onto the set and then taken away as quick as they appear.For instance not only does the oil lobby control America, but in fact a small cabal of 'end of times' people is involved as well, and maybe John Birch and aliens. It only gets worse and worse. The title of the book has little to do with accuracy or the diatribe. America is, obviously, not a theocracy. Saudi Arabia is a theocracy.Any well thinking American shouldnt be taken in by this blatently sad hate filled rant. But it exists. And perhaps one should do it justice by reading it, if only to understand how demented the 'other' is.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I heard the author on NPR and rushed out and bought the book. I was very disappointed. I think this book is full of esoteric insights about history and culture, and tries to tie things together that are just not there. For instance, just to give one example, the author talks about the oil/automobile complex that dictates U.S. policy. So what ? That is true in every country (Japan, Germany, France, etc.). Everyone has to drive to work, and thus, oil and cars are important. So what ? It is a banal insight, masquerading as profundity. The author then evern tries to tie this back to whale fishing in the 1700s, etc. I just didn't buy any of this.Also, if there is a \\"car complex\\", then I would think it would affect the Democrats much more than the Republicans, the Democrats being centered in the northern auto-producing states like Michigan. Do you really think that Clinton was not influenced by the auto industry (SUVs and large trucks were introduced during the Clinton administration, not after Sep.11, as the author states, and the author provides a list of psychological reasons [\\"security\\"], why people wanted those large vehicles [the real reason is, Americans haul things like boats]. All this happend under a Democractic administration, not under the Bushes. The Democrats are much more likely to be \\"in bed\\" with the auto industry than the Bush family is.Regarding religion, yes, the evangelicals are sometimes very weird [I personally don't want someone to have nuclear weapons, who believes that the 'End Times' are here, and the anti-Christ exists as a real person !]. Yes, they are powerful in terms of sheer numbers [100 million !], but as David Frum [ex-White House aid] said, in his time in the White House, one single large union in the U.S. put vastly more pressure on the White House in terms of wanting concrete legislation to be passed, than the entire \\"religious right\\", which mostly, in his view [he is a Jewish Canadian] want to \\"be left alone\\". What have the evangelicals actually accomplished at the national level in terms of real legislation and laws ? Have they overturned Roe vs. Wade ? I read the other day that Walmart is being forced to carry a contraceptive, even though it goes against the religious view of the company leaders and most of the customers. Is that the \\"religious right taking over\\" ? Name one \\"victory\\" that the evangelicals have achieved that really is significant (they can't get a stone tablet with the 10 Commandments put on state grounds, they can't get small stickers put on books stating the \\"evolution is a theory\\". At the 2004 GOP Convention, the evangelicals were not even allowed to speak, and were treated like \\"odd relatives\\", and pushed into the background, which to me shows that the GOP knows it can't win with them on a national level. [it should also be noted that Clinton spoke a lot more in his speeches about God and religion. In addition, Democrats like House speaker Nancy Pelosi can say things like \\"to us Democrats, the environment is a religious issue\\", and that is viewed as ok, but god-forbid if a Republican should mention religion and politics !!].And whenever business interests collide with \\"social conservative\\" agendas, the business side ALWAYS wins (for example, Bush signing into law a new bankruptcy bill, which helped the financial industry, but hurt families). So this idea that the evangelicals are gaining the upper hand is not true. At the state level, I would say it is true (I live in Texas, and the Religious Right has basically taken over the GOP here, going so far as to insert all kinds of odd things into the party platform like, the U.S. should leave the U.N, which does in a way conform with Phillips' assertion that the \\"wackos\\" [which is a term a Republican lobbiest famously used to describe them] are taking over, in the south, at the state level]. But not at the national level. Re the financial aspects of the book, also true, but you can say that about Clinton or any president. Do you really think Clinton was not influenced by the \\"credit industry\\" (wasn't Bob Rubin, a cabinet member under Clinton, directly from that industry, for example] ?This idea that the U.S. is just another \\"great power\\" in decline, and that what we see today are just signs of that (\\"religious extremism\\") to me is just \\"too easy\\" to really be true, and has already been said before in the book, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\"; but that book I think was mostly discredited. One reason for \\"religious extremism\\" is just that in the U.S., we allow more freedoms than in other countries [which control the churches directly], and one reason why so many Ameircans are in debt is because we are a rich people and we are free and we like to buy things. We use a lot of oil because our country is very big, and the oil industry is very efficient. The strengths of our country are in software, finance, and entertainment, not in oil or cars. So, all in all, the book didn't do much for me.The author states the old economic theory that if you make things, you are rich, but if you do finance (\\"move money around\\"), you are poor. Well, not true. Mexico makes a lot of things and has a strong manufacturing base, whereas Singapore and Switzerland are services and finance-based economies. And yet, those economies that \\"push money around\\" are vastly better off than Mexico, where people drive down to the factory to \\"make things\\". Japan also makes things, and has been in a 15-year macroeconomic decline.If you are liberal Bush-hater, you will see all your beliefs reconfirmed.

The author takes on three areas - oil, religion and the economy.Religion permeates the other two. The tenants of Fundamentalism are uninterested in alternative sources of energy or depletion of oil reserves. They also are not concerned with economic collapse. Mr. Phillips was prescient on the impending economic collapse of 2008.By gaining the complete adherence of the religious right which makes up possibly 40% of the U.S. population the Republican Party has narrowed its focus to religious and Biblical tenets to the detriment of education, climatic change, energy alternatives and energy reduction. The religious right also supported the disastrous war in Iraq - along with other liberal groups it must be added.Mr. Phillips points to the abundant Biblical references in the speeches of George W. Bush. He also makes an interesting correlation between car size and fuel efficiency - the bigger and the less efficient the car the more likely the voter is Republican - or said otherwise NASCAR votes Republican.Mr. Phillips gives us a history of religious evangelism in the U.S. - and one is presented with the constant struggle for secularization of government. The U.S. would appear to be split between the secular Northeast and Western States and the evangelical South and Mid-West. The strife between these two groups has been going on since the Civil War.Mr. Phillips suggests that this over-reliance on the fundamentalist vote may yet cause a rupture within the Republican Party - as the results of the 2008 election demonstrate by the geographical breakdown of votes.This book is sobering reading - in some ways his doomsday prophecy is occurring with an economic recession and oil prices that cannot be controlled. Mr. Phillips does not offer a solution. Hopefully the current Obama administration can do something to resolve the religious malaise.There are a few question marks. The U.S. today has one of the highest immigration rates of any country in the world - making for a constant renewal of the melting pot. Also American post-collegial schools (Harvard et al) are still among the best in the world. I don't know if manufacturing is as important today as 100 years ago. There is a vast entertainment industry in the U.S. This includes not only movies but books, magazines all being wrapped around the internet. This was all inconceivable 50 years ago. Also Britain declined not only due to lack of innovation (I dispute the arguments of Mr. Phillips on religion in Britain) - but from German aggression in two World Wars.One of my favourite quotes in the preface from Bill Morgan: \\"one of the biggest changes in politics in my lifetime is that the delusional is no longer marginal\\""},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Oh America, what has become of you? This might well be the subtext of Kevin Phillips's \\"American Theocracy\\". How could such a previously enlightened nation conceived with such great hope fall to imperial over-reach, debt and uncompromising religion?Kevin Phillips has written a thorough book that broadly compares 21st century America with other historical examples of over-reach. He notices eerie similarities. In America today we see the prosecution of wars on several fronts, a nation falling into increasing private and public debt and the rise of religious intolerance. Indeed, although this book was published in 2006, he very presciently anticipates the rise of the tea party movement.So, can America fail? Well, possibly but not in the short run. A nation of such depth and entrepreneurial spirit will not collapse overnight. But, in the longer run? Well, the jury is still out. Afghanistan looks like a morass, debt will take decades to be repaid unless inflation helps out, and this creates problems of its own. And, as far as religion is concerned, America has made a clear turn to the unenlightened. No other nation in the developed world has such belief in a supernatural god, miracles and an eventual world ending clash between good and evil. The rest of the world is far more rational. Yet, it is not just the fact that Americans are religious. This is not a problem per se. Rather, it is that religion has become so intolerant. Never in living memory has America elected a non-believing President and there are no signs that this is about to change.Kevin Phillips has done an admirable job documenting modern America. It will not be well received. My fear is that it will be even less heeded."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"\\"This book is dedicated to the millions of Republicans, present and lapsed, who have opposed the Bush dynasty and the disenlightenment in the 2000 and 2004 elections.\\" {Dedication of American Theocracy.}The author would not have rejoiced when this volume was published to know the 2008 election could be included. The religious right is certainly alive and kicking and the author details why this is not a safe presure for American democracy. He points out how the religious right centers on one problem or social/political item at the exclusion of all others--thus a disenlightenment. He cites the increase in Black support between 2000 and 2004 because of Bush's stand on gay marriage, a strong stand among Black churches. Bush also gained in support from the radical right of the Jewish interest because of his stand with the radical Israeli demands in their disagreement with the Muslim world.The religious right is used to support the neo-conservative proposals regarding oil, environment, pushiing \\"democracy\\" in the world that does not agree with our foreign policies eithout much concern about dictators who support U.

Phillips wrote The Emerging Republican Majority in 1969, which presciently identified the coalition of religious Southerners, big-business types, and economic libertarians that led the Republicans to electoral dominance throughout our lifetimes. Since 2000 he's increasingly become a dour analyst of the moral and societal failings of the Republican Party, and this book identifies America's traits (increasing religiosity, dependence on foreign energy sources, and declining manufacturing base and reliance on the finance sector as a source of wealth) as identical to the traits of Spain in the 1500s, Holland in the 1600s, and Britain in the 1800s that led to their decline. The book is periodically heavy reading -- especially the discussion of the \\"financialization\\" of the economy -- but compelling and convincing. Obviously, the religion discussion has been done to death, and Phillips relies heavily on well-known analyses of the growing dominance of the Southern Baptist Convention and its allies -- Mornons, Assemblies of God, and various other right-wing Protestant denominations -- but it's frightening enough anyway. The oil argument, too, is increasingly prominent in the general discourse, although those of us who studied international energy politics recognized its reality a decade or more ago. But Phillips is really almost at his most frightening when discussing how our economy has shifted dramatically from first agriculture, to manufacturing, and at an ever-increasing pace, toward the FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) sectors. This he ties to Spain, Holland, and Britain as a crucial and underrecognized factor contributing to their eventual declines as world powers. That's scary stuff. Oddly, although each of the components is either riveting or at least eye-opening, the conclusion is a rather tepid affair. He doesn't think the current alliance comprising the Republican base will last (safe bet to make in mid-2006) but fails to stake a claim on the question of whether the confluence of conservative religiosity, energy dependence, and dominance of the financial sector will really spell our doom in the long term."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Kevin Phillips picked a worthy set of topics but unfortunately, his diagnosis misses the boat. He tries to suggest that oil dependence, (Christian) religious fundamentalism and what he calls the \\"financialization\\" of the American economy hold great peril for the United States. He is right that the nation faces peril, but his preference to engage in feel good populism rather than truly identify policies and attitudes that put the nation at risk weakens his message.According to Phillips, U.S. foreign and domestic policy is substantially influenced by the oil industry. Obviously it is, but he tends to focus on the easy boogeyman of Big Oil and gives only scant attention to the real problem, the expectation from American consumers that they are entitled to low-priced fossil fuels. While the American oil industry has received its share of breaks, it really doesn't need the American military to survive in prosper, it has proven more than willing and able to profit from ties to anti-American and rogue nations. Most of the world's oil supply is in fact controlled by state-owned industries not private investors. Phillips's populist instincts seem to override reality. When talking about efforts to increase conservation, he mainly implies it is a problem of regulating industry and ignores the problem of consumer preferences. Thus, when discussing the ways to control consumption, he limits himself to talking about energy efficiency standards and ignores a much more effective method to restrain consumption (higher fuel prices, either via taxation or market forces). When discussing foreign policy he emulates the most vitriolic anti-American activists by claiming even the peacekeeping missions in Somalia and Bosnia are dismissed as oil-inspired power grabs.On religion, Phillips is also off the mark. He devotes time to the rise of Christian fundamentalism and delves into \\"end of days\\" beliefs and implies that a significant number of the American population would welcome Armageddon and thus the government maintains presence in the Middle East at the behest of these folks. In the process, he mostly ignores a much more obvious religion-based reason for a high American profile in the Middle East: Support for Israel. He could have successfully built a case linking fundamentalists support for Israel (along with Jewish and other sources of support) as a liability for the country because it leads to policies that are really not in the nation's interest. Instead, Phillips only mentions U.S. support for Israel in passing even though there is far more evidence of it than any obsession with precipitating Armageddon. Again, Phillips seems to come across more as politician than some truth teller. One wonders if he is afraid of being attacked by the pro-Israel lobby.Finally in his discussion of the U.S. economy, Phillips reverts to the traditional myopic populism of his earlier writings. Although nominally a traditional conservative, when Phillips' economic nationalism is translated into actual policy it is hard to see how it is distinguished from socialism. There isn't anything wrong with that except that he merely tosses facts to wind or ignores difficult questions so he can make the easy class-based arguments. \\"Financialization\\" is meant to describe the growth of finance as part of the U.S. economy; he is concerned that the United States has gone from being a nation that produces things to one that just shuffles money around. Even if one shares his cataclysmic view of this phenomenon, as his own data shows finance has grown from 15% of the economy 1980 to 20% today, which is hardly the monumental shift he claims. He obsesses about the decline in manufacturing but all his data show the relative decline of manufacturing, not an actual decline in manufacturing output and thus he ignores the growth of other non-financial industries. He also never explains why manufacturing should maintain a fixed percentage of any economy and ignores the fact that as a share of employment, manufacturing is undergoing a secular worldwide decline as technology allows industries to produce much more per man-hour of work.Even when Phillips is right, such as his mention of the looming crisis in entitlement programs, he offers no solution, again sounding like a politician. In a discussion of contemporary Europe he bemoans the British economy (because it fits into his narrative of national decline) and lauds that of Germany. Apparently Phillips hasn't looked at growth and employment trends in the two countries lately or perhaps he would really prefer the stagnation and high unemployment of Germans rather than the vibrancy and growth in the UK.This book works as part of some extended populist stump speech with obvious villains and no discussion of real trade offs; as such it is a missed opportunity."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I've been reading a lot of political analyses lately (Thomas Friedman's The World is Flat, T.R. Reid's The United States of Europe to highly recommend two) but for sheer, weighty scholarship this one takes the prize. Phillips' critique of an oil-based economy, religion in politics, and the American addiction to debt is meticulously cited, exhaustively examined and ultimately devastatingly conclusive, with a final paragraph that nearly moved me to tears. I wish I could say that I found it comforting to be told that this has all happened before, to the Romans, to the Spanish, to the Dutch and to the British. What really stings is that this guy is a Republican with serious street cred. He's not some wild-eyed way-to-the-left liberal, he's my dad."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I have read and plan to re-read this book a lot. It confirmed a lot of things I have seen happening for the past and continuing to happen now. And we have cause to be uneasy.1. For many years I have watched the Republican Party turn into something I don't know any more. Phillips' chapter about America in a \\"Dixie Cup\\" gave form to a lot of what had been on my mind for a long time. (Although in all fairness, \\"Dixie\\" is not the same as it was even when I was a child)2. I also agree about the debt-ridden society, our consumerist attitude and other financial problems we have in this country as well as the lack of addressing environmental issues and the problem of a diminishing oil supply worldwide.3. Especially I agreed with his evaluation of the bad effect that the militant Christian religious right is having on politics. As a lifelong evangelical Christian, I have often felt that my faith has been hijacked by the religious right. And I am alarmed at the political power they have been trying to get. A careful reading of key New Testament writings -- such as Romans and Galatians -- will make it clear that righteousness does not come by obeying the law. And plain old observation and experience will show that righteousness does not come by one group of people trying to impose their faith on other people.Having said that, I would like to share some misgivings about a couple of things in the book:First of all, I think he paints the \\"religious right\\" with too broad a brush. He frequently mentions Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. He is justified in this, because these two men are very influential in the religious right. But they are hardly what you would call best friends. Robertson is Pentecostal/Charismatic and Jerry Fallwell most decidedly isn't and they have important differences that would prevent them from working together for long. And although Phillips admits that evangelist Billy Graham was astute enough not to label himself \\"fundamentalist,\\" on page 139 he quotes writer John Egerton as asserting that Graham spread his southern style old-time religion into the nation and the world. Anyone familiar with Billy Graham will know that his motive is not to spread a \\"southern style\\" religion and that his motive in anything but regional.Also, I think he paints conservative evangelical Christianity as being more anti-intellectual than it actually is. Yes, many Christians reject Darwinism, but no thinking Christian respects intellectual slackness. As a teacher in the public school system, I have seen many students transfer into the public school system after being taught in small Christian schools -- many of which Phillips would call \\"fundamentalist\\" -- and these children often are academically ahead of their classmates. And by the way -- I have at least two friends, neither of whom claims to be a born-again Christian, who also disagree with Darwin's Theory of Evolution! You don't have to be a Christian to do that. (Incidentally, there were ancient Greek thinkers who advocated a form of evolution) If there are problems in American education, they can't be blamed on conservative evangelical Christianity -- for decades we haven't been able to have any Biblical teaching in the public schools and yet our students' scores have slid.Interestingly, Phillips made some references to the Scopes trial -- but authors Don and Joy Veinot and Ron Henzel mention that the textbook Scopes was using taught that blacks were the lowest form of evolved humans while Caucasian Europeans were the highest!Phillips has had to concentrate on the militant Christian right which has been trying to dominate politics in an unbiblical and un-American way, and in the process has left out the fact that evangelical missionaries have, quite separately from their own countries' governments, built hospitals, schools and bettered the lives of the people to whom they were also preaching the Gospel. A great deal of the abolitionist movement in the United States and Great Britain was backed by born-again, evangelical Christians.Read the book. It's well worth it. And it is right on the mark in the antics of these religious zealots who claim to speak for all of Christianity when they don't. People who call themselves Christians but who think they can enact laws imposing biblical standards on those who don't believe like they do need what Phillips is saying. He rightly calls this group up short on what they are doing -- and they deserve it.But let's be careful not to lump all Christians together or to use the activities of one group to cloud our judgment on Christianity in general. I'll give Phillips the benefit of the doubt and say that this is not his motive -- but we need to keep it in mind."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"For the first time in my 45 years I'm beginning to understand my struggle with being an \\"American.\\" Phillips' insight and explanation into the historical context of the fundamentalist Christian church's social and political determinations on our society was \\"new\\" for me.

Help!"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I heartily recommend this book to American citizens, and also to others trying to understand Americans. There being at least one cabal intending to take over this country sneakily with a theological conceit as pretext, why should one doubt that there may be others? American science is losing its world-wide pre-eminence, thanks to being disparaged and hobbled by Bible-banging charlatans in home territory. That figment of a fevered theological imagination called \\"American Exceptionalism\\" has clouded the judgment of our elected officials, tempting them into hubris and rashness that we will long regret. Meanwhile, the novel notion of an imminent \\"rapture,\\" with the inevitably concomitant smug presumption that when it occurs, oneself will be deservedly whisked away from all trouble, gives them an excuse not to care about the future of the rest of us or of the world as a whole.These alarum bells so urgently need to be rung that the author can be forgiven for rushing his book into print. But one gets the impression that his theological insight sometimes has the texture of cramming for an exam, or the feel of new clothes not worn long enough to be comfortable. With a little deeper acquaintance, he could have been more eloquent still.His ample discussion of the Southern Baptist Convention, for instance, might have included a page or two on the irony whereby within a single generation, this ecclesial community been transformed from one that especially proclaims the sovereignty of the individual into one that expects the lowly flock humbly to take orders from a central authority on high (and I'm not talking about God in heaven). The authentic Baptist doctrine of soul competency ought to have made this body among the most immune to such a denouement, yet it has occurred. For details, please turn to \\"Stealing Jesus\\" by Bruce Bawer. You won't get them from Phillips.He also disappoints in his promised treatment of Christian reconstructionism, AKA dominion theology. With a little more systematic exposition of the subject, readers could better appreciate both this movement's novelty and its rigor. It is not just a mentality or meme, but a tight intellectual edifice, the brain child of one Rousas J. Rushdooney dating only from 1970. We should know the full horrors of this movement: its followers have no actual loyalty to the Constitution of the United States whatsoever, nor to the status of their fellow citizens. They seek office with the dream of overthrowing our form of government and substituting the strictures of the Old Testament Law, literally and unrelieved. They hold that legitimate power of any kind resides solely in Christians (as they define the word, of course) and that all others must be reduced to subservient status if not executed outright. And they don't mind dissembling to achieve their objectives. The end justifies the means.Now, in my history book, any officeholder found to meet such a description would once have been impeached and hanged for treason. But even Phillips fails to blow the whistle adequately. The name \\"Rushdooney\\" is missing from both text and index.At one point he refers to the \\"gospel of Paul.\\" He might have something metaphorical in mind here, but since anyone with a few years of Sunday school should know that Saint Paul wrote epistles, not gospels, the phrase is comically inapt at best.The author quotes the English headmaster Matthew Arnold. Hmm. The great headmaster of Rugby was Thomas Arnold, and Matthew was his son. One is therefore left in doubt as to who originated the quote, and hence (since it dealt with schooling) its relevance and applicability.In comparison to the urgency of the case Phillips presents, however, all the above are merely quibbles to explain why I can't give the book a full 5 stars. His repenting of his earlier associations takes guts and only adds to his credibility. I repeat: we should all listen to him if we love our country."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The author has a point to make, and he makes it relentlessly, and backs it up with research. References which I troubled to check supported claims made for them in the text. This book was apparently published sometime in 2005, and it examines a number of trends which are either still continuing today, or which have come to fruition in the intervening 4 years. One which stands out is his speculation of the economic problems he saw -- in 2005 -- as lying ahead.On the other hand, the author is very much caught up in the particular excesses of the Bush administration, which were in full flower at the time he was writing, but many of which have since gone by the board.While the general situation he explores seems, to me, accurate -- and indeed of some concern -- the book at the same time demonstrates the problems inherent with assuming that /any/ particular administration is the one that's going to bring wrack and ruin down upon American society. It needs to be remembered that the bureaucrats who actually keep the government working from day-to-day tend to transcend administrations.

Still, a good read."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"I found this book to be full of frightening insights about the future of our country. Phillips makes a good case that the United States exhibits symptoms similar to those of other major powers as they went into their final decline. If you are optimistic about the future of the country, then you should read this book. On the negative I found the book a bit ponderous. Phillips is over thorough in his arguments marshalling extensive evidence that tends to overwhelm a reader. The book could have been half its size without being any less convincing, at least to those (like this reader) who are already worried about the trends in our country.The book consists of three parts \\"Oil and American Supremacy\\" (3 chapters), \\"Too Many Preachers\\" (4 chapters), and \\"Borrowed Prosperity\\" (4 chapters). The title reflects mainly the second part, so in a sense it is misleading. (Even there is a lot of mention of religious zeal in other parts.)The first part argues that the world will be running out of oil in this century. Phillips bases this view on predictions of certain scientists that others (e.g. \\"The Economist\\") find too pessimistic. While it seems that Phillips overrates the danger, his case that energy conservation should be a much higher priority than it is now is still valid. It makes little difference if we run completely out of oil or if its price increase by several multiples.The second part focuses on the influence of fundamentalist Christians on U.S. politics. The issue also spills in the other two parts on the basis of the argument that fundamentalists Christians expect the end of the world to come soon so there is no need to worry about global warming, running out of oil, or the collapse of the U.S. economy because of excessive debt. I am not sure whether the influence of that group is a prime factor or a side show. At the end book Phillips points out that \\"the financial sector - and a large majority of the richest Americans ... find the alliance convenient ... (because fundamentalists) are too caught up in religion, theology, and personal salvation to pay much attention to economics ...\\" Of course this was the theme of Thomas Frank's book \\"What's the Matter with Kansas\\". I tend to the view that religion is being exploited rather than being a prime mover even though most of the book argues otherwise.I found the third part the best because it documents how the expansion of the finance sector as the manufacturing sector is declining is leading to a ballooning debt with US obligations held by foreign banks, a far more serious threat (in my opinion) to our national security than any terrorist. While worries about the debt appear daily in our newspapers, the books presents an in depth analysis of why we have reached this sorry state of affairs.In short, while I used to worry about our state of affairs, I worry even more now, even though I do not agree with everything Phillips says."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Phillips is absolutely correct regarding the political influence of the fundamentalist Christians. They have succeeded, after more than thirty years of trying, in taking over the federal government. Leaders of influential fundamentalist groups, such as James Dobson of Focus On The Family, and their lobbyists, meet regularly with President Bush and the leadership of the House and Senate, and they have been entirely too influential in setting public policy, executive branch initiatives, and legislation. And now, the Senate, controlled by fundamentalist Christians (Bill Frist is one), is rubber-stamping Bush's choices for lifetime seats on the federal appeals courts and the Supreme Court. All the judicial nominees have themselves been fundamentalist Christians.Phillips warnings are not to be taken lightly."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This book is a must read and very thought provoking.

K Philips brillantly explains(and foresees the current 2007-9 Real Estate bubble and recession)a lot of the troubles America is in now by going back to the past religious,political, and mercantil history of Europe and America. He weaves his facts with statistics,quotes and clever analysis.The recent rise of the religious right,its links to Oil and politics, the rise of the Financial milieux take-over of the US economy, the monstous debt weighing the average American consumer and the merger of the Republican Party with religious fondamentalists and creationists is troubling for a multitude of reasons. He deplores the new backwardness this creates in America(less Sciences more Faith based curiculums in schools)and the loss of our influence in the World.A fantastic read."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Viewers of C-Span and readers of his many books on politcs and economics have come to rely on the sober judgments of Kevin Phillips. The former White House strategist in the Nixon years has grown disillusioned with the politics of big oil, fundamentalistic religion and our nation's mad leap into the economic abyss of huge national and personal debt.Phillips deals with these three major problems with well argued prosed, statistics to back up his position and a thorough knowledge of the players involved from the Bushes to the Congress.A brief survey of what he says about:1. Oil-Phillips looks at former great powers whose empires declined. Specifically he focuses on Spain and the Dutch Republic relying on wind and water. Great Britain relied on coal and seapower to stay at the apex of power during her Victorian world hegemony. Phillips critically examnes the 21st century US with its heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Phillips views our invasion of Iraq as a disaster. Bush and his team in the White House wanted Iraq to serve as a fueling station. The invasion cost thousands of lives, drove the nation deeper in debt and led to America being viewed with disfavor by our allies. Americans produce fewer cars which are less gas efficient than overseas products. Our heavy industries are running well behind such coming behemoths as China and India. We are a nation of gas guzzlers who have relied too much on the continuing abundance of black gold to fuel our SUV's and heavy pickups.2. The American economy has led to massive spending and trillions of dollars in debt. Americans are worshippers of the plastic god known as the credit card. Few realize how the economy functions or what are the penalites for wild spending. The Bush adminstration has spent like a drunken sailor. Dire consequences will follow as the American dollar becomes edged out by euros and other foreign currency in the money market global economy. Phillips writes for the layman and presents this gloomy picture of corporate and personal greed.3.Radical Religion deals with the nexus between the far right and the Republican party. Many evangelicals believe in the world entering its final days due to premillenial rapture theology. Books like the Tim LeHaye bestsellers in the \\"Left Behind\\" series dealing with the coming rapture lead many political leaders to be blase about such concerns as world environment and global peace. They do so since they believe will sound end anyway in an apocalyptic day of judgment.Phillips vision is a grim one. Can we Americans turn it around at this late date? Perhaps our decline as a nation is not inevitable. The election of Barrack Obama is an indication to people waking up to the perils we face.Phillips style is dry and statistics fill his pages. We read him not for literary beauty but for the facts he presents with years of study of the American electorate and how and why they vote the way they do. The emergence of the Republican party married to big oil and fundamentalist religon is a story every thinking citizen needs to become familiar with.Kevin Phillips is always worth reading."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"A word to the unregenerate who may attempt to read this review without having read this revelatory rehash of a book: \\"Ye must be born again\\". You are either a saint or you ain't. As a fellow human, created in the good image of the Triune God, albiet fallen in sin and inability, I confess that only the grace of my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ has made any difference between fallen men. When poor, lost sinners attempt apart from God's grace to build, the result is inevitable: tragic failure. Witness babylon; witness the recent catastrophic acts of God (including the 'war' on terror) upon apostate, post-christian America are for all who have eyes to see. if you are not deceived, if you are being transformed by the Holy Ghost, read this book and rejoice in the Almighty judgments and awesome power of the True and Living God - Who will NOT be mocked. America is reaping already what she sows; it is only a matter of time before the Herodians of today and their politico-handlers meet and face the terrible truth: they are fallen, unregenerate men seeking power and glory in their greedy lust for money. Read, too, and marvel in the Scriptures' depictions of age-old empires that rose and fell on the merest whim of the creator Who does all things according to His eternal counsels.Kevin offers an excellent analysis, of course, of the problem. But don't problems have solutions? America was made great by Christian charity; has the love of many waxed too cold? Mr Phillips is right; Fallen man has no solution. The solution rests in the mighty arm of the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: father of the Only-begotten Son of God: The living Lord and Only Saviour, Jesus Christ. Four Stars!

This book is more of the same of his post Republican discontented phase. The sections on economic dominance based on resources are interesting, but the book suffers from excessive repetition as well as his obvious hatred of the Bush clan, which causes him to become a bit splenetic at times"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Wow! This is a book that will really make you think. You need your brain engaged to fully appreciate all of the points - this is not a very good book for a few pages at a time before bed.Kevin Phillips uses a whole lot of research, combined with some good old common sense, to come up with some pretty scary historical parallels to the current United States situation.At different points in history, nations such as England, Holland, and Spain have all been dependant upon a natural resource for their continued dominant position in world politics and economics. They have also become very theocratic, believing that they were a nation \\"chosen by God.\\" And they all went through a phase of using money to make money - as we have seen in the US with manufacturing moving offshore, and the banking and finance industry growing to be a larger part of GDP than manufacturing.He also makes some fairly scary accusations, such as dating the planning for the invasion of Iraq back to the time of Kissinger. Whether substantiated or not, he builds quite a case for Bush being tied into world oil connections. This leads to domestic and foreign policy being dictated by what is best for American oil interests, using the Bible for guidance.This was an eye opening book, and recommended to anyone with an interest in the future of the United States."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"\\"America Theocracy\\" is an odd title for a book where the subject of religion only occupies about a third of its pages. The overarching topic of the book is a warning that the United States has all the earmarks of a society in decline and the author draws continual comparisons with the collapse of Britain, Spain and Holland as world powers. In three ways the United States is traveling down a dangerous albeit well trod path. First, is America's utter dependency on petroleum and refusal to seriously explore new energy sources. Second, is the increasing convergence of government and religion and the denigration of science. Finally, the dramatic increase in U.S. debt both in government and individually and the erosion of manufacturing. Each of these strands is a ticking time bomb with the potential to do massive damage to the world's only super power. Kevin Phillips lays most of the blame on the GOP despite being a former Republican strategist. Like John Dean he has seen the effects of the Republican majority through unclouded eyes and doesn't like what he sees.Too... much... information. That was my continuing thought as I read through Kevin Phillips thick, dense tome. At just shy of 400 pages \\"American Theocracy\\" is a long hard slog chronicling the history of religion in the United States from the 1600's to today. I have to give Mr. Phillips credit for creating a meticulously well researched book but man does it ever read like a dry history book. Along with religion, Mr. Phillips also spends considerable time discussing how mastery of fuel resources and empires coincide and how large energy companies can drive foreign policy. I suppose it all ties together but I would have hacked out the first 100 pages of the book.A little less than half way through the book the author finally hits his stride and the reading moves from tedious to frightening. The fact is that there has been an increased merging of church and government in the past couple of decades. During the Reagan years the goal was merely to influence government but Reagan's failure to enact true changes (school prayers, ban on abortions) inspired the religious right to try a new tactic, become the government. There is a powerful Christian influence in the United States that would like to see Christianity acknowledged as the national religion and government legislating by puritanical Christian standards. The author uses graphs and figures to show how this movement initially drew its strength from Southern dissatisfaction after the civil war and a feeling of persecution.I used to think that the religious right was the most dangerous threat to American prominence but over the last few years I've changed my opinion. The biggest threat is the unbridled greed of man and the increasing power of wealth in the United States. Mr. Phillips throws out some mind numbing figures. Household debt increased 39% in the first 4 years of the Bush II presidency. Since Bush has been president 40% of new private sector jobs created were housing related. For the first time ever the average household in the U.S. saves less than nothing per paycheck. America has become a debtor nation and the government is doing nothing about it because it serves some wealthy constituents. Of the three strands this is the one most likely to drop the United States from super power status. So how would a nuclear powered, conservative religious country behave in decline? Hopefully we will see some politicians come into government who are concerned with more than just their wealthiest constituents and the next election cycle and correct the mistakes that threaten our country."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is a must read for anyone concerned about the future of the U.S. It clearly points out the danger we are in by having the government allow religion to govern their policies."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Like drifting early morning mustard fog through a valley, author Kevin Phillips sees a dark age of \\"Disenlightenment\\" descending over America shrouding its civilization in false prophesies and hallucinations heralding decline as sure as Rome.

Freedom is slavery.In time, everything seems to stand on its head. In my memory, the Republican party stood for fiscal conservatism and responsibility. Today, it seems to endorse the same sort of debt-induced thinking Kevin Phillips used to accuse Democrats of.If the book achieves less in the way of \\"viewing with alarm,\\" as others here indicate, perhaps what Phillips wants us to do is think carefully about where we stand in the world. Christian fundamentalism is losing its hegemony (if it has not already lost it) due so much to the ebbing credibility of its most recognizable leaders. Pat Robertson. Jerry Falwell. Catholic church leadership. These men have run up debts which will now have to be repaid, with interest.We Americans have, for generations, loved our celebrities almost as much as loving the downfall of our celebrities. That is not at all new.But since this \\"power base\\" has shifted, Phillips encourages a thoughtful examination of where we go from here. The value of this book is not as a call to action, but a call to careful thought. If fundamentalist Christianity is no longer the ideological center of our nation, then what is to take its place? Let's face it: it served a very useful purpose as a clear centerpiece for American values and shared principles. If it goes away (or has already gone away), where do we find our national heart and soul?"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Those three topics might seem bizarre in juxtaposition. According to Phillips, however, the combination is the motivation behind present US national and foreign policies. This tangle of apparently unrelated forces has been instrumental in toppling earlier empires. Phillips draws on the history of Rome, Spain, the Netherlands and Britain as the prime examples. The examples are pertinent for the policies and programmes implemented or dissolved under the current administration - overexploitation of available energy sources leading to heavy imports, religious interference in domestic and foreign policies, and an economy more concerned with quick profits and extended debt than long-term planning.This is a frightening book to read. Instead of a nation growing strong and resting on democratic ideals, the US has come to be dominated by a conglomeration of particular interests. Oil, supporting the burgeoning consumer glut, is sought in the Middle East, scene of the forthcoming Armageddon in the view of Christian fundamentalists. That region produced an attack on US soil, leading to both a crusade mentality and a consumption spree to prove how strong the US was after the Towers fell. Instead, says Phillips, the Bush regime blundered in Iraq, driving up the price of oil and stimulating terrorist recruitment. Worse, for the rest of the world, the instruments to encourage consumption only put the US in its worse debt status in its history. That precarious credit structure has tentacles reaching into Asia and Europe. If US policies and actions lead to withdrawal of credit extensions and higher import prices, the economy could collapse in shambles. It's a precarious balance, since the nations holding the US debt know foreclosure or abandonment is economically unsound, yet they have no wish to be dragged down in the collapse.Phillips portrays clearly how the trio of themes interact and reinforce each other. Oil, the clear purpose of Bush's crusade in Iraq, has its roots in US \\"exceptionalism\\". A nation founded, according to its own lights, on \\"religious freedom\\" has turned outside to extend its power over the \\"New Babylon\\" of Baghdad and Saddam Hussein as Satan incarnate. In order to support this view, US Christians have formed an amorphous bloc of voters to install their most religious President in the White House. Bush, who claims a deity grants him his mandate, strikes a chord with US Christians anticipating The Second Coming of Jesus. Not only does this view encourage an expansionist policy, argues Phillips, but it's destructive of the values and practices of a powerful and secure nation. More than just plugging religion into the classroom, the US Christian lobbies have curtailed scientific programmes, they object to changes in lifestyle dictated by human-induced climate change and want restrictions on personal freedoms. Again, these attitudes in an earlier age portended the collapse of great powers. The 17th Century Dutch may not have debated stem-cell research nor the 19th British the issue of \\"right-to-life\\", but similar views on society ultimately shaved down their empires.Although the book is divided into three parts that might have been well separated, Phillips wisely keeps the themes tightly woven into the picture. That integration gives his theme greater impact and explains the interactions among them. It also allows his historical comparisons more validity, as each segment returns to the earlier examples. For many of his readers, history began in 1776 CE. The more expansive may push that back to 1492 CE. Phillips does better, drawing both on the examples of other empires while also depicting the conditions in the 20th Century that have led to the crisis facing the US today. There are some charts and tables in this book, and the spikes that appear in the past decade remind one of a bed of nails. Declared fundamentalist Christians emerge at the same time as oil prices and the the extent of the US debt. The lesson is clear - the US must begin smoothing down those peaks and abandon some of its grandiose and selfish tactics. Phillips doesn't offer much in the way of therapy for these problems. He has spelled them out clearly and effectively. It's now up to his readers to take action. Action is sorely needed. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Phillips is spot-on about how the Republican Party he knew in 1968 has been, to put it bluntly, hijacked. (Of course, a mea culpa for his lack of foresight would be nice to hear, but could anybody have really predicted this?)Phillips is also dead-on for scoring conservative evangelicals and fundamentalists for being so thoroughly \\"next-world\\" focused that, in general and overall, they run up massive debt, exploit the earth and don't care that their Republican darlings' tax breaks all go to rich big business conservatives who are all too willing, all too able, and all too slick to exploit the Religious Right for their votes.Nowhere is this clearer than Peak Oil and soaring oil prices. As Phillips points out, many of the Religious Right give at least some indication they believe oil is a divinely renewable resource. Combine this with \\"America as chosen nation\\" mythology and you have a serious problem.(Of course, many more moderate people hold close the myth of America's manifest destiny/chosenness as well. Phillips avoids looking at that; someone more approaching the territory of a Chomsky really needs to explore that.)Phillips demonstrates the research chops to back this up. For example, in number-crunching the 2004 election, he uses the Kelly Blue Book to analyze the electorate and its choices by type of vehicle purchased or owned. This painstaking work in and of itself gives the lie to Christine Rosen's ludicrous, yes, ludicrous, Washington Post review.Phillips also shows how Clinton, including but not limited to his 1998 executive declaration officially favoring regime change, had his hands oil-dirty, too. The Iraqi sanctions, while they had other legitimate ends, were in part designed to keep French and Russian oil interests out of Iraq, leaving only American and British ones. Remember, there were only two countries' planes patrolling the \\"no-fly\\" zones in northern and southern Iraq.The caveat against Phillips? He repeats the old canard that Democrats from the the 1970s on trashed religion, in essence.How can he overlook President Carter? Despite the GOP \\"southern strategy,\\" he got a clear majority of self-identified evangelicals in 1976, and a very solid minority in 1980.Even in 1984, religion was not yet that big an issue, despite the nascent Religious Right's attempt to identify it with the single issue of abortion. Nobody accused Walter Mondale of being irreligious.I will concede some degree of truth to this in the 1990s, though. However, Phillips could have been more precise on dating this, as it was not a direct contributor to the rise of the Christian right, for the most part.Two more caveats about Phillips' observations.No. 1: As I read further, I see that Phillips paints with a broader brush and writes in a less academic style than in most his previous efforts.The clearest case in point: Referring to President Clinton as \\"The sorts of Bubba Democrat who had a wink in his eye and often an AstroTurf cushion in the back of his bachelor pickup truck.\\"No. 2: Around page 145, Phillips blames a fair amount of Southern post-Civil War intransigence, the rise of the myth of the Lost Cause, Redeemer governments ending Reconstruction, etc., on Northern heavy-handedness during and after the war. He cites not just military heavy-handedness, but that of the Northern wings of mainline Protestant denominations that split over slavery before the war, calling them aggressive in trying to evangelize Southerners and in their message in that evangelism.Sure, Phillips, let's just treat the South with kid gloves and blame more yet on the North, eh? From my point of view, the one thing wrong with Reconstruction was that, rather than having 20,000 troops in the South for a decade, we should have had 200,000, yes, 200,000, for a full generation or more.This ties in with my original review note that Phillips isn't very apologetic for his role in the Southern Strategy nor his lack of foresight as to where it would lead.Finally, the caveat about the review above from Christine Rosen of the Washington Post. I quote this graf to show its INCREDIBLE bias.\\"But contrary to Phillips's claims, speculation about the doomsday-era 'end times' -- which has been present among certain segments of America's Christian population for more than a century -- does not necessarily lead to the embrace of apocalyptic economic or foreign policy goals. It does not even guarantee sustained support for war; the percentage of white evangelical Christians who back the war in Iraq has dropped from 87 in 2003 to 68 in January 2006, according to Charles Marsh, an evangelical professor of religion at the University of Virginia. To suggest, as Phillips does, that the Bush administration, at the behest of born-again Christians, is intent on launching 'international warfare to spread the gospel' is astonishingly simplistic.\\"What's \\"astonishingly simplistic,\\" is to not recognize or report that 68 percent support for invading Iraq is MUCH higher than among the general public.No, let's change \\"astonishingly simplistic\\" to OUTRIGHTLY DECEPTIVE. I have no doubt Rosen knows that overall support for the war is below 50 percent. This just shows how much the mainstream media is willing to lie and distort, even on a book review, to support its predetermined ideas.To ignore the clear research that Phillips has done on how many of the Religious Right identify the UN as the Antichrist and thus applauded Bush for ignoring it in 2003 further shows her bias, her ignorance or both."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"In this book, Kevin Phillips thoroughly examines 3 socio-economic/political forces that he believes will bring American \\"Empire\\" down. Those 3 forces are oil, religious extremism and national debt. Although Phillips abstains from Bush bashing or piling on the GOP in general, he hints that at least today's GOP party has abused power and instead of solving these crisis, only furthered it.For each of these 3 forces, Kevin Phillips heavily relies on historical precedents and utilizes them as analogies. One gets the detailed historical perspective as well as its relevance to his thesis. Although the book is not strictly historical, Phillips uses overwhelming historical references to strengthen his thesis.As a political analyst, he also does a great job crunching statistical data/numbers in order to back up his claims. He especially uses it overwhelmingly in dealing with polls regarding religion.Overall, the book is extremely detailed with facts, stats and historical analysis and is aimed more towards a more educated audience willing to sit through this tour and examine it closely.This is also its drawback. Because of the rich detail of the book, sometimes it's hard to grasp every detail and incorporate its relevancy to today's politics. Phillips extensively reviews Civil War in its regard to religious uprising today; he briefly reviews the fall of Rome, British, Spanish and Dutch Empires as a consequence of those 3 forces. At times, it's hard to read and understand every detail of the book and therefore may become occassionally frustrating and boring.

The 3 big problems are dependence on foreign oil, the ascendant power of the FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) industries, and the growing power of the religious right wing. The author shows how the Republican party has intertwined itself with the Religious Right, Big Oil, and Wall Street such that they are almost indistinguishable from each other by the end of G. W. Bush's 2nd term in the White House. The author also shows how this has played out over election cycles, affecting the electoral landscape, and helped to produce today's Red vs Blue divide in the US.

He then goes on to document in detail that the U.S. is headed down the same path.About 25% of Americans now are affiliated with fundamentalism/evangelical religion; further, this may understate the picture by leaving out Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses. Their growth has been spurred by Roe v. Wade, rulings against school prayer, ERA, and the sexual revolution (includes gay rights, pornography, contraceptives). We have an elected leader who believes himself in some way to speak for God, a ruling political party that represents religious true believers and seeks to mobilize the churches, many Republican voters believe the government should be guided by religion, and a White House that seems driven by religious motivations (blocking the \\"morning-after\\" pill, limiting stem-cell research, insisting on an abstinence only approach to AIDS etc. prevention) and supporting biblical world views (eg. invading Iraq takes advantage of the religious right's seeing it as a step towards the \\"second coming\\").As the new century began, average Americans consume twice the energy of Europeans and the Japanese, ten-times that of the world average. We are driving about 1/3 more than in 1980 (primarily due to living further from work) and 40% of vehicles are particularly fuelish \\"trucks.\\" One objective of invading Iraq was to support the U.S. dollar by preserving the tie between oil and dollars (Iraq and Venezuela had switched to Euros); Iraq's oil reserves were seen as plentiful, cheap, and an opening for U.S. companies to take over - in addition, by increasing Iraq's production the U.S. would also be able to break OPEC's leverage, and we would have a new base to station troops in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia was no longer willing to host them).Moving money around (finance, insurance, and real estate) has surpassed making things - 40% of GNP in '04, vs. 14.5%. Similarly, the Federal Reserve has regularly bailed out crises in the financial sector - 11 times; little attention, however, was given to manufacturing. Republicans have used interest rate cuts to fuel the economy through rising home values and lower interest rates. Meanwhile, since 2000 the entire new supply of Treasuries has been purchased by non-residents - mostly foreign central banks, despite negative real returns. At the same time, rising oil prices and increased U.S. needs from foreign sources will push the U.S. bill from $100 billion in '02 to an estimated $400 billion in '10, and the U.S. gets twice the return on foreign investments as foreigners get in the U.S. (Paul Krugman, in a 4/24/06 OpEd piece suggests that foreigners understate U.S. earnings to avoid taxes; U.S. firms overestimating foreign profits - untaxed until repatriated - is also possible.)Phillips is at is finest in pulling all this together. He sees danger that U.S. defiance of Kyoto, its pursuit of pre-emptive war and an expensive military spread all around the world, our refusing the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, acceptance of poor pupil achievement and declining manufacturing strength, energy profligacy, negative savings, placing religion over science (eg. inhibiting stem-cell research and science education via \\"intelligent design\\") will make central bankers less confident of American economic strength, and thus more likely to precipitate financial crisis by declining to continue to fund America's record and rapidly growing trade, government, and family deficits.The \\"good news?\\" That the strength of the religious right will sharply decline as America incurs dark days in the future - refuting their belief that we are God's New Israel.\\""},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The latest prediction of American decline and fall is written by one of America's most astute political commentators, famous for having foreseen nearly four decades ago \`the emerging Republican majority' Kevin Phillips in this work sees through a glass darkly. Three interrelated major elements in present American society are seen by him as seeds of future catastrophe. The first is America's dependency on fossil fuels as source of energy .The second is the increasing part played in American political life by right- wing quasi-fundamentalist religion. The third is the culture of debt, on private, communal business and governmental levels.In regard to the oil involvement Alan Brinkley writes in his NYTimes review \\"that the pursuit of oil has for at least 30 years been one of the defining elements of American policy in the world; and that the Bush administration - unusually dominated by oilmen - has taken what the president deplored recently as the nation's addiction to oil to new and terrifying levels. The United States has embraced a kind of \\"petro-imperialism,\\" in which the U.S. military works as a global oil-protection force,\\" and which \\"puts up a democratic facade, emphasizes freedom of the seas (or pipeline routes) and seeks to secure, protect, drill and ship oil, not administer everyday affairs.\\" Phillips implies that the major reason that the U.S. entered Iraq was to secure oil supplies for the next thirty years. He points out that the U.S. troops in Baghdad surrounded the Oil Ministry there when first reaching Baghdad.However this argument is questionable when one considers the present skyrocketing price of oil, the failure of the U.S. to have provided a more stable world - oil market. A more plausible criticism of the Bush Administration is not that they were motivated by securing energy sources in moving into Iraq, but rather that they did not carefully enough plan out to ensure the continued availability of Gulf oil for the U.S. consumer. And this in a world where the growing Chinese super-economy has already in a special deal with Iran secured long - term energy supplies, as it too forges a new relation with Saudi Arabia.Philips draws historical parallels with other Empires that have collapsed. The American oil empire is compared with the Dutch 17th century Empire with its wind and sea power, and the British empire fueled by coal- both of the latter overextended themselves, and lost their historical primacy.Such historical analogies may however be of limited value considering the tremendous complexity of factors involved in determining the present historical situation of the United States. The United States after all remains the great center of the world's \`knowledge industry' and its superior universities and science- technological structure will no doubt produce innovations which will make the world look much different in a few decades than it does now.Philips book is perhaps strongest in outlining the danger presented by the culture of debt, and fiscal irresponsibility. This extends all through American life and constitutes as many other commentators have indicated a possible source of international weakness. Here the problem also connects with the shrinking of America's industrial sector and the rapid economic development of other areas of the world. This concern is another source of Phillips indictment of the Bush Administration who he feels has abandoned traditional Republican principles of fiscal responsibility.The centerpiece and main talking point of Phillips book is however given in its title. The role of Religion in determining American policy, the breaking down of the separation of Church and State, the seeming infiltration of ways of thought which do not suit rational political criteria mean for Phillips that the United States' policy is more and more enslaved to the \`religious right'.Phillips presentation is by all accounts rich not simply in wide-ranging and brilliant arguments confirmed by batteries of statistics but also by his broad historical knowledge.In his previous works he emphasized another great American problem the growing gap between the \`haves' and those who have a lot less.I think it is wise to consider his book in connection with a number of others which also point to great dangers for America in the years ahead. Samuel Huntington in \`Who We Are' focuses to the chagrin of many on the ethnic constitution of America, and worries about the loss of Protestant work ethic as driving force in the culture. Ted Fishman in his work on the rise of Chinese society as commercial empire is concerned about whether the United States will be able to retain its economic first- place in the world. The threats presented by international Terrorism, and the radical Islamic effort to not simply drive the United States from Iraq and the Middle East but to undermine its role in the world completely, constitute another complex set of threats and problems.The rise of China, the recalcitrance of Russia and the possible Chinese-Iranian- Russian anti- American alliance bolstered by the weakness of Western Europe also threaten America.Phillips has made a strong argument for certain dangers in the American future, but the proper evaluation of them would too require a more thorough elaboration of the unique strengths of American society and its traditions."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Whether or not readers agree with the book, trying to define Kevin Phillips as a \\"lunatic\\" or a \\"liberal\\" is baseless, and in fact, negates any review of the actual material contained in the text. Phillips was widely regarded, during the Reagan years, as being one of the architects of the plan to secure a Republican majority in Congress. His criticisms about the current administration, and he has had many, stem from his fears that the Republican party that he served for so long has lost it's bearings. He's not alone in his thoughts...many long time conservatives have reached the same conclusion. If you disagree with his premise, say so, but to attack the messenger is to do exactly what he is claiming in his book. Maybe if real facts and opinions can begin to be discussed again, rather than character assassination and claims of treason, we can regain faith in both parties."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"The title is somewhat misleading. We expect the text to dwell on the rise of Christian fundamentalism and its effect upon American democracy. In fact the Southern Baptist Convention, for one, does constitute a major focus. However, Phillips also wants to show how radical religion, debt overhang, and politics of oil comprise three major perils for 21st century America, and collaterally, how this troika has given rise to our current debacle in the Middle-East . If we add to these subtopics, an additional concern with drawing historical parallels between America's trajectory and past empires, we get a pretty complex mix that is difficult to evaluate. In sum, I think this rather unwieldy sprawl does constitute a problem with the book. Instead of coming together in a sharp focus, the needed cohesiveness tends to scatter out over the 400 pages. Radical religion remains the center-piece, but I think a book dwelling on all three perils equally or one on radical religion exclusively would have been more effective. Nonetheless, when a pedigreed conservative like Phillips (no enemy of religion) sounds alarms about the rise of fundamentalism and the Southernization of Republican party politics, many of us not alligned with the right sit up and pay attention, no matter what the overall mix.There are two points regarding the nation's current borrowing binge (one of Phillip's three perils) I want to briefly mention. This issue ultimately pivots on whether the national economy has genuinely entered a newly international phase such that old borrower-lender risks no longer apply. If that's the case, then the many parallels he draws with past debt traps, despite appearances, are rendered moot. I wish he had given this key aspect more critical attention than merely marshaling the adverse debt numbers, informative though these trends are. Then too, for some reason the discussion pays surprisingly little attention to defense expenditures which-- whatever their intimidation value-- are eating up much of the federal budget. Some perspective is in order here since weapons sales amounts to one of our few export bonanzas, while military R&D; amounts to one of our few remaining sources of industrial innovation. How this aspect of budgetary policy affects the broader national trajectory would have been a valuable inclusion. Of course, whatever relevance value these have to the borrowing binge, such additions would add to the sprawl.Nonetheless, behind the largely detached prose, Phillips is clearly worried about longer term trends propelling the Republican party and the nation as a whole. Moreover, there's some irony in his current electoral findings. If liberals underestimated the role of religion in American life in past decades, conservatives now risk overestimating it, creating a base too narrow to sustain the politics of fundamentalism. Coming from the strategist who was an earlier voice in the wind, such words should resonate in the age of Falwell and Robertson. There are a number of works discussing these pressing topics available. However, as a principled conservative and proven trend-detector, Phillips should not be passed up."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"Thank god for the Internet to bring about forums like this to share views on very important issues, which are brought about in \\"American Theocracy\\". Unfortunately the major majority of the American public has no idea what is going on. They get their information from newspapers, television, radio, etc.. A quote from Ted Tuner \\"95 % of what we read, see, or hear is controlled by five companies, this is not good\\". Did the majority of the public know before the Iraq war, that in 2000 Sadam Hussan started selling his oil for euros instead of dollars? Are we being censored in our own country? Another important read for all is \\"Petroldollar Warfare\\" by William R. Clarke. I think our founding fathers would turn over in their graves if they knew what was going in our country today."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This is one of three really great books I have been lucky enough to find (or have recommended to me) recently. (The other two - Jed Perl's NEW ART CITY & Robert Brace's IRON BUTTERFLY - I am going to review, too.)I think the importance of this book is that it clearly expresses what many of us must surely be feeling but have difficulty putting a finger on: that as a country we've somehow gone seriously off track in recent years.It is not partisan, in fact the author is a Republican, but he clearly has contempt for both Bushes. He comes at the problem not from the usual left wing angle of civil liberties and distribution of wealth and so on, but from the other side: he says basic Republican values have been turned on their head by the Bushes, and he puts the blame squarely on the religious right. This part of the book is particularly well argued, I thought -- he makes the case that the religious right has morphed from a band of marginal loonies into a serious, insidious, well-organized political force that firstly captured, and then grossly distorted, the Republican Party. With huge debt, government bigger than ever, and an endless legislative preoccupation with people's personal lives, it's pretty hard to argue against this: where is the fiscally conservative, small government, leave-people-alone Republican Party of days past? Answer: replaced by Bible-bashers.The other two sections deal with what Phillips sees as the great threats to the US, both of which are consequences of the political failure caused by the religious right's takeover: unsustainable debt and oil addiction suicide. At $70 gallon for crude, the latter point is so obvious that it hardly needs arguing, but nevertheless the steady pounding of facts that Phillips provides really drives home the message. More important I think is his emphasis on debt - debt ruins everyone, from individuals to empires, and he makes very clear that the US is no different. (This is also well argued in Brace's IRON BUTTERFLY, something surprising in a paperback thriller). The bottom line is: either we change, or we go down.The sad thing is that there is no longer a fiscally sound alternative to pull the lever for in November."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"\\"American Theocracy\\" represents one of the most powerful indictments of the political juggernaut that was the Republican Party in the first part of the twenty-first century. A coalition of religious conservatives, big oil businessmen and financiers, and not a small number of people with authoritarian leanings, it was successful in electing George W. Bush to the presidency twice, implementing a set of policies and legislation that reflected its worldview, and engaging in a preemptive war on Iraq that few worldwide viewed as necessary. Unraveling how all of this came to pass is the task that Kevin Phillips takes in this important book. Phillips argues that \\"Never before has a U.S. political coalition been so dominated by an array of outsider religious denominations caught up in biblical morality, distrust of science, and a global imperative of political and religious evangelicalism.\\" They have been aided by \\"the financial sector--and a large majority of the richest Americans--[which] understandably finds the alliance convenient\\" (p. 393).In nearly 400 pages of detailed, lucid, insightful, and well-referenced text, Phillips explores how all of this development in the latter third of the twentieth century and emerged full bloom with the election of George W. Bush in 2000. Even so, Phillips finds in this political success the seeds of its destruction. The Republican Party, he writes, \\"has become more and more like the exhausted, erring majorities of earlier failures: the militant, southernized Democrats of the 1850s; the stock-market-dazzled and Elmer Gantry-ish DOP of the 1920s; and the imperial liberals of the 1960s, with their Great Society social engineering, quagmire in Vietnam, and New Economy skills expected to tame the business cycle. Now the Republicans are again the miscreants\\" (p. 348).Like those earlier political coalitions, Phillips finds that ideology has come to trump rational analysis and argument. This represents a fundamental subverting of whatever genius might exist in the American political process, for ideological arguments can neither be debated nor compromised. Accordingly, it is impossible to reach a pragmatic public position that all can at least accept, if not full embrace. This is where American politics is at present, according to Phillips: \\"Much of what the Republican party stood for had become based on faith, not reason--and this across a spectrum that ranged from domestic economics, science, and constitutional jurisprudence to souring relationships with Europe and the United Nations, and preemptive war-making in the holy lands of the Middle East\\" (p. 364).Unless this changes, Kevin Phillips forecasts dire consequences for the United States at least by the middle part of the twenty-first century. He comments on three major strains of ideology that lead toward national decline, if not ruin. First, there is the economic situation present in the U.S. in which we have become a \\"rentier\\" nation, financing our short-term well-being on loans that will have to be paid by our descendents. Phillips expends considerable time analyzing the manner in which previous world powers--especially Spain, the Netherlands, and Great Britain--have declined through foreign indebtedness and drawing parallel to the present situation in the United States. Second, the emergence of an evangelical Protestant political constituency that has sought to have its beliefs carried into public practice. He likens this to the dire situation in Europe that led to the religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, before being supplanted by the ideas of the Enlightenment. The millennial aspirations of these groups, likewise, argue for preparation for the Rapture and Christ's triumphal return rather than for the solving of mundane political and economic concerns. Finally, Phillips notes the looming problem of a world more dependent on oil than ever before and the prospect of less of it to go around as the twenty-first century progresses. All of this suggests a horrendously difficult time for the United States in the new century.\\"American Theocracy\\" does not offer solutions to these difficult challenges; rather it lays them out in sophisticated detail and well-researched and -argued prose. It is a must read for anyone who wants to understand recent political history--and it is very much history rather than analysis and commentary--in the United States."},{"Title":"American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21stCentury","review":"This outstanding book is the best study of the current state of the USA. Kevin Phillips, the vastly experienced American political and economic commentator, depicts the USA's economic and religious interest-groups and their effects on the Republican coalition. For this paperback edition, he has written a brilliant 40-page introduction updating his 2006 analysis.He shows how deindustrialisation is destroying the US economy. The debt-driven finance, insurance and real estate sector accounts for 21% of US GDP, manufacturing for only 13%. 44% of all US corporate profits come from the finance sector, 10% from manufacturing. Household incomes have not risen since 2000. Wages are 62% of national income, compared to an average 73% in the late 1960s.He describes what he calls the \`oil-national security complex' and its \`100 years' oil war'. The USA, with 200 million of the world's 520 million automobiles, defeats conservation and energy efficiency. The USA consumes a quarter of the world's energy, but has only 5% of its reserves. Since 1998, the USA has been importing more than half the petrol it uses. A barrel of oil cost $3 in 1970, $10 in 1986, $30 in 2002, $75 in 2007. Non-OPEC oil will peak in 2010.So the US state wants to secure oil supplies from the Middle East, but in a classic case of imperial overreach, its efforts are counter-productive. White House economic advisor Lawrence Lindsay said in September 2002, \\"the key issue is oil, and a regime change in Iraq would facilitate an increase in world oil so as to drive down prices.\\" Pre-war, Iraq produced 3.5 million barrels a day, now just 1.1 million, \\"U.S. mismanagement in Iraq having only aggravated the oil-supply and terrorist threats\\", as Phillips writes. The war has caused most of the recent $45-a-barrel rise.Phillips also studies the USA's rightwing religious fundamentalism - a toxic brew of Biblical inerrancy and born-again evangelicalism. It claims that we live in the \`end-times', when the defeat of the antichrist at Armageddon heralds the second coming. It is anti-women, anti-science, anti-modernism and anti-Enlightenment. It opposes sex education, women's rights, contraception, stem-cell research and abortion.He shows how successive US governments have indulged the soaring debt and credit industry. They encouraged reckless credit expansion, blowing up the ballooning national, international, business, financial and household debts. Low-interest rates led to the credit-card boom, to exotic mortgages, derivatives (which the speculator Warren Buffett called \`financial weapons of mass destruction'), hedge-funds and debt instruments. Buffett also said, \\"Hyperactive equity markets subvert rational capital allocation.\\"Americans now owe more than they make. Finance firms are debt collectors; credit card companies offer to consolidate people's debts, but once the debtor is hooked, the company can raise interest rates to 20-30%. No wonder that in Bush's first term (2000-04), there were five million personal bankruptcies and by 2006, the USA's total debt was $40 trillion, 304% of GDP."},{"Title":"Colombia: Inside the Labyrinth","review":"The Independent (London)March 19, 1990, MondayBarons of The Violence; 'Colombia: Inside the Labyrinth' - Jenny Pearce: Latin America Bureau, 8.99 poundsBy COLIN HARDINGCOLOMBIA is a notoriously difficult country to write about - or, to put it another way, a notoriously easy one to caricature. If it has any image at all in Europe it is as an archetypal Latin American republic: violent, unstable, dominated by drug traffickers and gunmen of one sort or another. That is part of the truth, the part seized on by the television crews and assorted firemen parachuted in after the Colombian government declared war on the cocaine cartels last August. But there is, inevitably, more to it than that.There have, for one thing, been very few military coups in a 170-year republican history that began with a ferocious war of independence against Spain. Political life has for the most part been run by two traditional parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, and power has changed hands through the ballot box more often than not. But this apparently mature, not to say cosy, arrangement has been punctuated by a succession of civil wars, the latest and most bloodthirsty of which, known simply as The Violence, cost up to 300,000 lives between 1948 and the early 1960s. So perverse, so inexplicable by normal human standards was this period of communal bloodletting that historians and social psychologists have been driven to devising theories of collective psychosis, of ''thanatomania'', a morbid obsession with death.Since the generalised political violence began to abate in the late 1950s the traditional two- party arrangement has reasserted itself, and still dominates Colombian political life. But many of the armed groups that sprang up during the civil war, mainly for self-defence, subsequently declined to lay down their weapons, and tens of thousands of armed men and women remain in the field to this day, in defiance of a political system they regard as illegitimate. The current President, Virgilio Barco, a Liberal, is attempting to restructure Colombia's political life and institutions to induce the guerrillas to come in from the cold. He may even succeed.Where do the cocaine mafias fit into this mixture of venerable institutions and random slaughter? Contrary to appearances, the Colombian economy is neither backward nor dominated by a single crop, and the business groups that control it are not easily penetrated or taken over by racketeers. In addition to coffee, which accounts for about 30 per cent of exports, there are well-developed textile, leather, chemical, cut-flower and printing industries, and Colombia adapted to an ''export culture'' long before most other Latin American countries. Public finances are notably well run, and Colombia is almost alone in the region in not having an unmanageable foreign debt. The industrial and financial heart of the country is Medellin, a bustling highland city now known to the outside world almost exclusively as the home of the most murderous of the cocaine cartels.But even the drug traffickers have come to realise that they cannot beat the system. They have been driven to sue for peace, and some sort of accommodation with the existing order. What can it be that makes this apparently ramshackle set- up so durable, and what is it about this strange country that makes it so different from its neighbours?Now is not a bad time to have a stab at tackling these questions for a general audience. Jenny Pearce's book on Central America, Under the Eagle, sold 30,000 copies at a time in the early 1980s when savagery in El Salvador and US interference in Nicaragua were in the news every day. Whether her latest effort will be as successful is less certain. Perhaps the moment for Colombia has already passed. Jenny Pearce argues that the Colombian political system is in crisis and under attack on all sides, becoming a ''political time bomb'' which may go off at any time. But it seems more likely now that it will stagger on much as before, with just enough reforms to disarm the challengers from below and without.However debatable her conclusions might be, Jenny Pearce has mustered a formidable amount of information. There is no pretence that this is an impartial book, but it gets better as it goes on, and persevering readers will be rewarded with illuminating accounts of The Violence and the rise of the cocaine barons. The author's energy and commitment amply compensate for occasional infelicities of style."},{"Title":"Hibakusha Cinema: Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the Nuclear Image in Japanese Film (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"This book helped me alot in working on a project on the atomic bomb."},{"Title":"Fibromyalgia Syndrome- Fighting the Devil With T","review":"A Victim's Point of View and Survivor's Guide IS exactly what this book is all about.

Students, mostly women, were not receptive to the book or its ideas finding them too extreme in attacking males even within the context of discussions of cyborg sexuality and other fantastic ideas such as futuristic sex role reversal and males bearing children.

It should be read by catholics to see what the skeptical side has to say. Although I do not agree with everything the author has to say, he does make some good points. In one section of the book, he talks about divine tradition. In a catechism called 'My Catholic Faith' by Bishop Morrow in the lesson on divine tradition, it clearly states that divine tradition should be believed in as firmly as the bible, since both come from God. Divine tradition is the writings of the fathers and doctors of the catholic church. Now God is infallible, so divine tradition should be also. But Boettner writes that Augustine, a prolific church father, wrote a book of retractions to his writings later in life. Another Church doctor, Alphonsus Liguori, in his book, the means of salvation and perfection, wrote that if God willed all the angels to go to hell, they would willingly do so to follow the divine will. This is absurd since God cannot make a contradiction. If this were so I wouldnt blame the angels for becoming atheists.

I have read and am concerned by other reviews written by seemingly Protestant imposters that seek to attack the book in an effort to keep the dark secrets of the Roman Catholic Church hidden.Also, as a quick note, previous reviews claim poor documentation and quotes in the book. This is an out and out fallacy. There are approximately 130 quoted authors and texts and I have yet to find one that was false or even controversial.I will admit that some of the things claimed to be believed and taught by the Catholic Church were hard to swallow. But after doing further research on my own including the Roman Catholic Catechism, Vatican II Council documents, etc., I found them all to be legitimate claims. I am afraid that either the people writing the negative reviews are either oblivious to the false and blasphemous teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, or they know them to be true and are trying to guard them from being exposed.This is a fantastic book and a Must Have for anyone truly seeking honest and straight forward knowledge about God's plan for man and for His True church-which does not fit with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.One reason that it is so cheap (as one of the negative reviewers mentioned) is because it seems to be written with exposing the truth in mind and not personal gratification or greed.I would like to close with this final statement. I have an older copy of the book, and wanted to order another copy for a friend. (I am not willing to give mine up :o) This book was first published in 1962, and the copy I have is dated 1987. At that time it was in its 26th Printing. This is a fantastic book. When I noticed the ratings, I attribute that to people buying the book thinking that it will support the Roman Catholic doctrine and not expose it for what it is. The Truth seems to sting those living in the dark."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This is a great book that really uncovers much of the paganism and just plain made up traditions for which the Catholic church has become known. I was freed from a \\"pre-Vatican II\\" church some years ago. It was a group of Catholics and their very elderly priest who rejected the changes made after the Second Council. They practiced the old ways (which is what Lorraine's book mainly addresses). They kissed a box filled with \\"relics\\"...you would not believe how many churches have a piece of the cross that was used to crucify Christ! Sometimes they hosted the \\"pilgrim\\". this was a case with a statue of the Virgin Mary. It circulates and when your household has it you sit around it everyday and say certain prayers to Mary. For those who do not believe that Christ is re-crucified in the Eucharist, I site the following: \\"356. Why does Christ give us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist?Christ gives us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist: first, to be offered as a sacrifice commemorating and renewing for all time the sacrifice of the cross; second, to be received by the faithful in Holy Communion; third, to remain ever on our altars as the proof of His love for us, and to be worshipped by us.\\" and \\"357. What is the Mass?The Mass is the Sacrifice of the New Law in which Christ, through the ministry of the priest, offers Himself to God in an unbloody manner under the appearances of bread and wine.\\" These are taken from the Baltimore Catechism of the 50's. This is falsehood plain and simple. Christ offered himself once and for all...not continuously. Some might answer...but the Baltimore Catechism is not used anymore. That would mean that the church is not un-changed through history...but changes continuously to teach \\"new truths\\". Yet God is the same before, now, and forevermore. Christ offers the wine and the bread to all in the Bible. In the 1400's the Catholic church officially decided to keep the cup from the laity. This is in no way supported by Scripture where we are instructed to take both. I could go on and on. The teachings of the Catholic church MUST be compared to Scripture. Where they disagree...the Scripture must stand in authority. Even Paul said that if he or even the angels were to teach apart from the teachings of Christ they must be rejected."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I grew up observing many catholic neighbors and classmates going thru the preposterous and ridiculous &quot;rituals&quot; and &quot;sacriments&quot; that were invented by the popes and &quot;councils,&quot; and are absolutely NOT IN THE BIBLE.Most of the reviewers are obviously roman catholicswho feel a &quot;need&quot; to &quot;protect&quot; themselves, but never point out ANYTHING that is &quot;untrue!&quot; They just &quot;SAY&quot; it is untrue! This was an extremely thorough research, and proves to be VERY ACCURATE!The ROMANS are so wrong in scores of important things, and the book carefully points them out, and gives good references that can be easily checked out!MOST OF THE R.C. reviewers seem to have very little education, and therefore they can't EXPLAIN their negative views of the book!The INFALLIBILITY of the popes is totally destroyed by their condemnation of GALALIO, when he said the Earth &quot;goes around the sun.&quot; And he was Jailed and punished for the rest of his life! 300 years later the church &quot;apologized! &quot;Jesus would not have made such a mistake! The book has about a 2 star rating, because the catholics checked in and complained without a WORD of evidence to support their negative bluster.Great effort should be made to have many others read this book! It's a necessary education."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Boettner deserves much more credit than the many distractors here want the reader to believe. His book, \\"Roman Catholicism\\", is spot on and accurate in its assessment of the man-made doctrines and traditions of the Roman Catholic institution. Having been taught, since childhood, the so-called traditions of Rome, it is refreshing to me that Boettner can still be read and perhaps even be used to help save some souls from the inventions of Romanism. His work will never be outdated. Don't let such reviews, like Garver's above nit-picking, discourage anyone from reading this book. Yes, Garver did fine an error with Boettner's citation of \\"Valencia 1229\\", but the mistake was in name only and not outcome. It should read \\"Toulouse 1229\\", which did restrict the use of the Bible. Regardless of the Albigensians, or what they believed, the so-called church and council had no right to place the Bible on a forbidden book list, which is the correct and accurate point Boettner outlines in his \\"Roman Catholicism\\". On the major issues Boettner is spot on and accurate. Take something major like the invention of the role of papal authority, or the Pope as the Universal Bishop over all of the church. Boettner perhaps doesn't list every single reason for discrediting this hoax invented by Rome, but let Pope Gregory the Great offer support where Boettner might be lacking, \\"Certainly Peter, the first of the apostles, himself of the holy and universal church, Paul, Andrew, John, what were they but heads of particular communities? And yet all were members under one Head [Jesus Christ]. Was it not the case, as your Fraternity knows, that the prelates of this Apostolic See, which by the providence of God I serve, had the honor offered them of being called Universal Bishop, by the venerable Council of Chalcedon. But not one of them has ever wished to be called by such a title, or seized upon this ill-advised name, lest if, in virtue of rank of Pontificate, he took to himself the glory of singularity, he might seem to have denied it to all his brethern.\\" (Epistle XVIII). The reader can get the whole truth by reading the teaching and letters of Pope Gregory the Great, but for now Boettner's work will stand the test of time, especially when measured as a complete work, and not against a minor mistake in name only and not a point of fact. May the Lord Jesus Christ bless all the readers of Boettner's \\"Roman Catholicism\\", which other than the Bible, the Roman Catholic will fine no better book to read. In fact, don't let the Pope or his puppets stop the reader from reading both at the same time!Gordon A. Stamper"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Believe me I have other things to do tonight than write an amazon book review. However, I just couldn't let all these negative reviews go unchallenged. This is a great book! The bad reviews are primarily written by Catholics who have never read the book, but know of it through a very biased trashing of it by Karl Keating in his Catholicism and Fundamentalism. One reviewer I saw even referred to the author as a \\"her\\" ... any reader of the book would know that Lorraine Boettner is a man! This book is a great source of embarrasing information. You will learn how many Catholic doctrines are not only unbiblical, but also relatively recent concoctions. You will learn of many of the frauds that the Catholic Church has perpetrated on its unsuspecting followers - such as the house in Italy that they claimed was Mary's flown in from the Holy Land. The greed, the corruption, the bizarre practices - it's all here. Let's not forget the atrocities, such as the Inquisition and the war crimes in Croatia that the Catholic Church was so intimately involved with. Sadly, pointing out the truth about Catholicism has been termed \\"bashing\\" and is now politically incorrect. It has been getting harder and harder to find resources that tell it straight. Dear Catholics, you are saved only by grace, through your faith in Jesus Christ, the One mediator (no Mary), not by works nor through sacraments."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"If one was being charitable they might call this book pathetically unscholarly and unresearched, written by a well meaning ignoramus. A less charitable approach would be to call it a dishonest screed written by a dishonest man who sees no evil in bearing false witness against his neighbours.Protestant Christians living in Protestant enclaves with no real interaction with Catholic Christians, living in a pre-internet world and having no particular disposition to learn what the Catholic Church even teaches and claims about itself could be fooled by this book and take it at face value. And no ill will should be held towards them. I as a Catholic may have done the same if I had been born into similar circumstances as those well meaning yet misinformed Christians. Let all Catholics remember the words of Archbishop Sheen, \\"There are not one hundred people in the United States who hate The Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they wrongly perceive the Catholic Church to be.\\"In this day and age however, there is no reason whatsoever to take the claims of this book at face value when so many of its accusations can be disproved with a simple google search. Karl Keating's book Catholicism vs Fundamentalism soundly puts to rest the untruths of Boettners opus. I would recommend his website Catholic Answers to any Protestants who would like to get an honest presentation of Catholic Doctrines. Be careful though, you might find yourself following Tim Staples, Scott Hahn and others who came home to Christ's Church after they learned what it truly is, \\"The Pillar and Bulwark of the Truth\\" - 1 Timothy 3:15."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This book has been referred to by many as the Anti-Catholic Bible. After reading it, I see why. The author makes many convincing arguments regarding the non-Scriptural basis for Catholic ideology. However, the author is looking at Roman Catholicism from a Protestant perspective. Roman Catholicism, like Judaism, is based as much on oral tradition as it is on Scripture. Take this one with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Please do not waste your time on this obviously anti-Catholic book. Try reading the second chapter of Karl Keating's \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" for an interesting look at Boettner's silly book. If you want to know what Catholics believe try reading the \\"Catechism of the Catholic Church\\". Looks to me like Boettner is very confused or just making up a lot of nonsense."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Boettner's book is a lie, it does not correspond with Truth or what the Catholic Church teaches, it is quite pathetic. If you want to read about Catholicism, try reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church,also try the Bible, it's also a good Catholic book since it was a Catholic council in the 4th Century which compiled the Bible and declared the books sacred and canonical, I think many forget that the Bible did not just fall down from the sky, there were hundreds of Christian books and Gospels, e.g. The Gospel of Thomas, and it was the Catholic Church, the only Church in existence who compiled,proclaimed,and preserved the Bible. Consequently this being True not only is The Bible inerrant, but also the Council of the Catholic Church which proclaimed it 'sacred and canonical'. Please if you want to read about Catholicism go and read what She herself teaches, why don't you are ya too afraid? I know Luther was afraid when he read the whole Bible, so scared he had to rip seven books out. Finally Jesus said he'd be with his Church till the end of time, not that he'd hide for 1500 years and wait for Luther or the 15000 other denominations!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I will fully admit to being a Roman Catholic myself and thus approach this book with an understandable bias. Since this book is the one from which many of my Protestant friends received theor view of the Catholic Church, either directly or indirectly, I thought I would read it to see, as it were, what the \\"other side\\" was saying.Clearly Boettner has done some serious research for this book. He cites from a multitude of sources in his vitriolic attack upon the Church. And therein lies the problem. According to Boettner, apparently, anything written by any Catholic over the 2,000 years of the Church is definative Catholic doctrine (as least so far as when he agrees with it). A catechism written by a priest is not a definative statement of Catholic Doctrine and can be, and indeed sometimes is, wrong. Should I damn all Protestant doctrine because Marting Luther wrote \\"The Jews and Their Lies\\" in which he advocated burning down synagogues and denying Jews the right to praise God or to use the Torah?Boettner takes great delight in setting up his own straw-men and then merrily knocking them down. Even when Boettner does quote from official Church documents, they are often quoted partially or out of context.I grant that there are some serious differences between Catholic theology and Protestant theology. A reasoned, scriptural and historical debate on such issues can go far in understanding where we agree and where we differ. (c.f. Norman Geisler's Roman Catholics and Evangelicals: Agreements and Differences). Books such as Boettner's, however, are the literary equivalent of some of the things I have seen written on bathroom walls, albeit with footnotes."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Even if we are right, we do not honor God by misunderstanding or misrepresenting--for God is truth. To put it another way, when we are actually correct, we have no NEED of false or misleading arguments.I am a Protestant Convert to Catholicism. While I understand some of the misunderstandings of this book, others seem absolutely willful. In any event, the author's carelessness regarding accuracy is appalling.This is the source book for myths about Catholicism. If you don't--in fact--love the truth, you will absolutely love this book!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"First off let me say that I have no ax to grind in reviewing this book because my family is Lutheran, and I married a Methodist girl, who is now Lutheran. The book was brought to my attention by my wife who has many Catholic friends who she said were very upset by this book. So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book \`Roman Catholicism' was full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a \`Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions\\" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these \`Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these \`Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, but downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; \\"If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it.\\"Boettner tries to give the impression to the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become \`card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small numbers of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was \`pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally \`free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even \\"Republics\\" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the \\"Republic\\" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former \\"Republics\\" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the \\"CIA World Factbook, 2011\\" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a \\"Hate\\" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these \`rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like \\"Catholic Answers\\" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2\\" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This is easily the greatest example any teacher/professor could use in teaching how NOT to write a book.It's clearly a novel, full of exaggeration, distortion,and in many places complete lies.May God have had mercy when Loraine tried explaining his part in his false witness crusade against the the Church, our 2000 year old Catholic Church!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"There are inumerous errors in this book! 100s in fact!

As it stands Boettner's book is for people who want to reinforce their own misconceptions of the Church to make themselves feel better."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"The anti-Catholics' Bible, it contains lots of misconceptions about the Roman Catholic Church, plenty of alleged quotations but without many citations to any source. Full of blunders and misunderstandings, it is one of the worst things you could ever spend your monsey on. As Bishop Fulton Sheen said, &quot;There are not many people in the United States who hate the Catholic Church, but thousands of people who hate what they mistakenly believe the Catholic Church to be.&quot; A refutation of parts of this book can be found in Karl Keating's &quot;Catholicism and Fundamentalism.&quot; Boettner clearly demonstrates his little knowledge of Roman Catholic history"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Given all the extreme rhetoric of many of these reviews, I'd like to attempt to present something closer to a rational evaluation, largely borrowing from a review I wrote for another book sales website.Lorraine Boettner's thorough and expansive treatment of Roman Catholicism has certainly become a classic since its first publication in 1962, widely disseminated and used as a basis for further critiques. Boettner's book is, however, also infamous. The book's infamy stems from its method of argumentation which combines various strategies: not only biblical exegesis, citation of Reformed creeds, quotations from Protestant authorities, and social analysis, but also innuendo, guilt by association, half-truths, and distortions of Roman Catholic teaching. Today, the book is also rather dated, failing to take account of the Second Vatican Council and other developments in 20th century Roman Catholic biblical and theological studies. For all its 450 pages, there is very little of continuing and helpful substance. It is, however, fun to read and bears witness to the polemics of an earlier era (one would wish!).I do not have the space here to give a complete analysis of Boettner's shortcomings, but will cite some representative examples. Moreover, I do not speak here as an apologist for the Roman Catholic church. I am, in fact, like Boettner, a Reformed Protestant, though also a philosophy professor at a Roman Catholic University. It does not seem to me, however, that the cause of Protestant Christianity is well-served by inaccurate portrayals of other traditions or criticisms that only attack straw men. I write this review, then, on behalf of truth.Boettner's first chapter combines various ends: defining Protestantism, attempting to associate Catholicism with communism, accusing Catholicism of developing various heresies and inventions, and painting a portrait of the supposedly sad state of Roman Catholic nations. Let's consider his discussion of the &quot;heresies&quot; and &quot;inventions&quot; which he implies are held to be part of the unchanging and infallible teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and thus are &quot;binding&quot; upon all Catholics (pages 7-10).In point of fact, very little of what he mentions would fall into that category. For instance, fasting on Fridays, the temporal power of popes, the withholding of the cup from the laity, and the use of Latin, have all changed since they were never a matter of Catholic &quot;doctrine&quot; per se. Moreover, Boettner distorts the implementation of many of these practices. For instance, the &quot;imposition&quot; of the Latin language by Gregory in AD 600 was done in order that the liturgy might be celebrated in the common language of the people (i.e., Latin), rather than in the Greek that was widely used up to that time. Likewise, while the discipline of celibacy was required for most priests since 1079, that is only true in the Latin rite of the Catholic Church. In the Eastern rite, married priests have always been permitted and are to this day. Nor was the Bible ever &quot;forbidden to laymen&quot; by a Council of Valencia in 1229. For one thing, there was no council in Valencia in 1229 since it was under Islamic control. A local council with local authority, however, was held in Toulouse that year and it did temporarily (and quite understandably) limit the use of the Bible by roving lay-preachers who were spreading the Albigensian heresy.As another example, we can consider Boettner's treatment of the mass in chapter eight. It is evident here that the book is quite dated, presupposing a eucharistic liturgy which hasn't been enacted (except rarely) in three decades (pages 169-171). Boettner's discussion of the Roman Catholic priesthood and the &quot;sacrifice of the mass&quot; gives little indication of any detailed knowledge about those doctrines, their histories, or their current status. For instance, he appears unware of centuries of debate among Roman Catholic theologians on whether the notion of the eucharistic &quot;sacrifice&quot; is to be taken in an &quot;oblationist&quot; or &quot;immolationist&quot; fashion. The &quot;oblationist&quot; view focuses more upon Christ's present priestly intercesssion before the Father. The &quot;immolationist&quot; view, on the other hand, focuses more upon Christ's presence upon the altar in a figure of death. While the latter view is certainly problematic for Protestants and the view against which we have traditionally objected, it is the former view (&quot;oblationism&quot;) which has gained ascendency in the 20th century and thus must be addressed today. And I know of no Roman Catholic theologian who would agree with Boettner's description that the mass is a &quot;re-crucifixion&quot; of Jesus and few who would even accept the language of the mass as a &quot;continuation&quot; of the sacrifice of Calvary (page 174). Unfortunately, Boettner's almost complete lack of bibliographical references to Catholic authorities makes it difficult to know from where he drew his information.I cite these few examples as representative of the ways in which Boettner's book falls short. As Protestants we certainly must maintain a faithful witness to Reformation truth, but that task is not advanced by careless scholarship, distortion of one's opponents, and slipshod argumentation. While there are some things of value in Boettner's classic book, I would advise those who are interested in understanding the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church to refer to offical documents (the catechism, councils, encyclicals) and their prominent interpreters among recent theologians."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I read this book back in the early 90's when it was given to me by a fundamentalist co-worker. I was a lax Catholic at the time who sailed through 12 years of Catholic schooling without ever really delving deep into my faith. I read the book with interest, and an open mind, since I already began having some serious challenges with what my friend was teaching me about the \\"obvious contradictions\\" (as he saw them) between Biblical teachings and Catholic doctrine. I found many of Dr. Boettner's historical accusations so over the top, and distorted that I soon began to question his scholarship (not to mention his motives) on everything else.My curiosity was piqued and I began to devour every book I could find that would shed some light on how the early Christians read and understood scripture (starting with William A. Jurgens', \\"Faith of The Early Fathers\\") . It took the good Dr. Boettner to get me interested enough to finally begin searching for the truth - and it led me deeper into the Faith I was raised in. Thanks Dr. Boettner!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"\\"Divine tradition is the writings of the fathers and doctors of the catholic church. Now God is infallible, so divine tradition should be also. But Boettner writes that Augustine, a prolific church father, wrote a book of retractions to his writings later in life. Another Church doctor, Alphonsus Liguori, in his book, the means of salvation and perfection, wrote that if God willed all the angels to go to hell, they would willingly do so to follow the divine will. This is absurd since God cannot make a contradiction.\\"In response to this post and this book, all I can say is that people need to do a better job of understanding what it is they are trying to condemn. First, Boettner misleads the reader to believe that Augustine \\"comes to his senses later in life\\". Maybe the reader should, himself, read Augustine to find the TRUTH. Boettner also attempts to build up a Catholic strawman and then knock it down. He does it well (who couldn't). In fact, if this was actually what the Church taught, I would be objecting myself. Furthermore, he is dishonest, which is a cardinal sin for a \\"scholar\\".For starters, Catholic tradition is not the \\"writings of the fathers and doctors of the Catholic Church\\". The Church fathers bear witness to Apostolic Tradition, but they aren't in themselves \\"Tradition\\". Thus, a Church Father OR Doctor CAN err. Their writings are only accurate in as much as they agree with what the Church has always taught. This does not mean that our understanding cannot grow or expand. However, teachings cannot be contradicted (i.e. cold-blooded murder is never morally acceptable). The teaching on infallibility only extends to matters of faith and morals. And that only extends to the Magisterium. Thus, a Pope declaring that one Bible is better than another one is not a contradiction on infallibility. \\"Faith and Morals\\" simply put are articles of the faith that are necessary for our salvation along with moral teachings that guide our faith.Furthermore, the teaching on infallibility only states that the Holy Spirit will PREVENT the CHURCH from teaching error in these areas. It does not extend to INDIVIDUALS, except the Holy Father (in Ex Cathedra pronouncements). These rarely occur. Thus, both the author's accusations and all critics of Catholic (Apostolic) Tradition are unfounded. Remember, all you critics of Catholic Tradition, the words of St. Paul, \\"So then Brothers, stand firm and hold to the TRADITIONS we brought to you, whether by word of MOUTH or by LETTER\\" (2 Thess 2:15). Also, that the \\"CHURCH of the living God, (IS) the PILLAR and FOUNDATION of TRUTH\\" (1 Tim 3:15). Thus, Scripture (which is a part of Tradition itself, said St. Paul in 2 Thess 2:15) bears witness to the Church's teaching on Tradition. A teaching that was handed down by Christ and the Apostles in the once and for all, complete deposit of faith.To sum it up, let us see what the Church teaches about it's own beliefs on Tradition. \\"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely together and communicate one with the other. For both of them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some fashion to form one thing and move towards the same goal\\" (CCC, 80). \\"The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what they learned from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of Christians did not yet have a WRITTEN NEW TESTAMENT, and the New Testament itself demonstrates the process of living Traidition. Tradition is to be distinguished from the various THEOLOGICAL, DISCIPLINARY, LITURGICAL, or DEVOTIONAL traditions (little \\"t\\"), born in the local churches over time. These are the particular forms, adapted to different places and times, in which the great Tradition (Big \\"T\\") is expressed. In the light of Tradition, these traditions can be retained, modified or even abandoned under the guidance of the Church's magisterium\\" (CCC, 83). Thus, man-made traditions can be modified or abandoned, but Apostolic Tradition is objective truth revealed by God and cannot ever change. This is what the Church claims infallibility over. Don't take my word for it, do your research, and try reading something other than anti-Catholic sentiment if you ACTUALLY want to learn what the Catholic Church teaches."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"\\"Roman Catholicism\\" by Loraine Boettner is easily one of the worst pseudo-histories/studies of the Catholic faith ever written.Boettner most definitely did not do his homework, even when it may appear to the uninformed that he has.He was among the worst of the anti-Catholic bigots of the 20th century and like anyone with a hateful prejudice he swallowed hook, line and sinker every lame and groundless piece of nonsense he could scrape up concerning the Church and the faith instituted by Jesus Christ.He managed to get Church history, theology, doctrine, practices and beliefs wrong all at the same time. There is probably not a single page in this book that is not riddled with errors, but that is what one would expect from a misguided, misinformed and spiteful man with a terrible axe to grind against the Church of Jesus Christ.If you are interested in a much higher level of reading about the Catholic Church I would recommend \\"Triumph: The Power and Glory of the Catholic Church\\" by H.W. Crocker III for honest and accurate history, and for an explanation and discussion of Church doctrine, \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" by Karl Keating.Don't waste your time and money on Boettner.

But if you want the Truth then ignore this books and read &quot;Catholicism and Fundamentalism&quot; by Karl Keating, &quot;Fundamentals of the Faith&quot; by Peter Kreeft, and &quot;Rome Sweet Home&quot; by Scott and Kimberly Hahn.

I would say this has to be one of his worst. I doubt he intended to write a diatribe; I am willing to be charitable and give him the benefit of the doubt. But, when searching for words to describe his treatment of Roman Catholicism, &quot;charitable&quot; doesn't come to mind. I'm not an expert on RC doctrine, but my impression is that the book repeatedly falls into the grave error of taking an aberration of one segment of Roman Catholicism or at a particular point in time, and painting the whole church with that brush. The net result is that even though he may have had the best of intentions, the book verges on slander at times. This is a shame for various reasons. I think there is a strong case that can be formulated against the Roman Catholic church -- it is more in need of reform than ever -- so why knock down straw men? If one's book is full of grotesque caricatures, one's legitimate points will not get the hearing they deserve. On top of that, the book is sorely out of date. I think it merits two stars, but even then only with reservation. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have a strong theological background already. Then, if you are in a position where you need to do extensive research of Roman Catholicism (as a Protestant) or of Protestant critiques of Roman Catholicism, then this book should probably be just one of many that you read. Don't take anything in this book as authoritative without corroborating it elsewhere first! Let us all pray for God's working to protect all the churches from sin and error.

If it's such a wonderful seller, maybe they don't want to \\"mess with success\\".The work reads well and lacks some of the caustic tone seen in these reviews. It lacks sound references in an academic sense - i.e., footnotes, bibliographies to specific editions, etc., typical for the time but unacceptable today. The reason? Because some of Boettner's facts are just wrong. Look at \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions in the introduction. \\"Baptizing of bells\\" is presented so the reader thinks that bells are actually baptized, a simply unexcusable stretch of the facts in a book filled with such items.Boettner consistently uses religious terms that mean different things to Protestants and Roman Catholics. This is the root of much of the book's misleading statements and a cause of this controversy. As Christians (you potential reader) I suggest you refrain from this book and look elsewhere. There are many better books (on both sides of the controversy!) That this one sells is largely due to the nature of the audience that reads it, an audience afraid to have its assumptions challenged and afraid to undertake the difficult labor of validating this work. Don't take this short-cut. Get James White's \\"The Roman Catholic Controversy\\" or on the other side try Karl Keating's book. Both of these writers do a good job of presenting the case as Christians ought to do, and include academically rigorous footnotes, bibiographies, etc. Those are good values for the money.Pick a side, pick a better book.

Any Catholic (or Protestant who is knowledgeable in the least about theology) could refute this book without much effort.The case for Catholicism is made more by this book than by many modern Catholic apologists. Such slanderous attacks, having no foundation in truth, led me to consider that the Catholic Church is the one Church which Jesus promised would be so hated. This search led me to the deepest of convictions, and one which as a former Baptist I did not even want to consider, that the Catholic Church indeed is the Catholic Church mentioned in the Apostle's Creed and the Creed of the Council of Nicea.If your view of the Catholic Church is formed upon this book, you will have a very warped and inaccurate view indeed.

How could anyone take it seriously? I nearly laughed out loud when I saw people recommending it as a book to learn more about Catholicism, but they were serious. I hope they are seriosly misinformed about Catholic teaching, so it's not totally their fault. If that's the case, then I suggest they read the Catechism (so they can know what the Catholic Church actually teaches). However, if they do know what Catholics believe, then I want to know why they feel it necessary to instead look to a book filled with straw-man arguements, misquotations, misrepresentations, lies, deceit, etc. such as this one? The only reason I can think of is if they're afraid of the truth. Now don't get me wrong. I have no problem with people simply disagreeing with Catholicism; that's one thing. Many Protestants have sincere questions about Catholicism. But this book is more than simply disagreement; this is plain trash. It relies on people's total ignorance and prejudice. If anyone thinks this book is an &quot;excellent book&quot;, then I think they need to do a little more research.

Sheen once said something along the lines of, \\"Few people in America hate the Catholic Church, but many hate what they mistakenly think is the Catholic Church.\\" There is a great deal of truth in Sheen's observation. Oppositions to the Catholic Church are often full of misrepresenations and misconceptions concerning its teachings and practices, such as the accusations that Catholics worship Mary or think the Pope is sinless. In some cases these misrepresentations may be deliberate, the result of hateful bigotry. More often, however, those who make such assertions have been unfortunately misled by anti-Catholic propoganda - propoganda like Lorainne Boettner's Bible of anti-Catholicism.Whether Lorainne was himself misled or in fact deliberately misrepresented the Catholic Faith, his book, Roman Catholicism, is full of inaccuracies.Here are some of his historical inaccuracies in his list of \\"Catholic Inventions\\":Transubstatiation was not invented in 1215. It had been believed for over a thousand years prior to this. 1215, however, was the first time it was formally defined and given the name Transubstantiation.Contrary to Boettner's claim, the Bible was not forbidden to laymen and placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1229. The Bible could not have been placed on the Index of Forbidden Books, which did not yet exist and would not for another several hundred years. At the Council held at Toulouse, France (which is certainly the council Boettner mistakenly thought was in Muslim occupied Valencia and called by that name), a inaccurate translation of the Bible published by an heretical sect (which claimed that there were two gods and that marriage was evil) was condemned.The Sign of the Cross was practiced by Christians since before Tertullian wrote of it in 211 (not 300, as Boettner states), perhaps even since the time of the Apostles.The worship of images was authorized in 786. In fact it was never authorized, as Catholics do not worship religious images anymore than the United States worships the Lincoln Memorial or Mount Rushmore, but merely use them as reminders of God and his followers or as aids in prayer. In 787, a council condemned the iconoclastic heresy which asserted that statues of Jesus were unacceptable. The council did not condone worship of such images, however.Confession to a priest existed long before 1215. Cyprian, Origen, and others refer to it nearly a millenia earlier. Nor do Catholics go to a priest instead of to God for the forgiveness of sins.Finally, the \\"Apocryphal books\\" (seven dueterocanonical books which Protestants do not accept as Scriptural) were not added to the Bible at the Council of Trent. Rather, Martin Luther had removed them, and the Council affirmed what had always been held - that they were truly books of the Canon of Scripture which was established definitively at the Councils of Rome, Hippo, and Carthage in the late 4th century.These are only some of the inaccuracies contained in Lorainne Boettner's inaccurate, unreliable, and seriously misleading book, Roman Catholicism. It is unfortunate that many have been led into a false view of history and the Church by this book, and whether one is Catholic, Protestant, or otherwise, nothing should justify going to it for information regarding the Roman Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I always find it interesting when certain groups of people attack the Catholic Church based on the assertion of &quot;inventing&quot; doctrine. They often point to the dates when the Church officially names such previously shared and accepted beliefs. They say 'That proves that it was &quot;invented&quot; by the Church because it was documented well after the death of the apostles.&quot; The Catholic Church, when a long standing, all the way back to the first and second centuries, tradition becomes challanged or distorted will establish a special council to lay out the exact meaning and often name to a doctrine (example being - The Trinity) to do away with misconceptions. I use the example of the Trinity because most protestants are unaware of the Council of Nicene back in the fourth century that officially defined and named what was considered to be a commonly held TRADITION, but had at that time come under attack from various heretics. The word TRADITION scares most protestants because in order to discredit the Catholic Church they have decreed that all TRADITION passed down from the earliest of times is false if not found in the Bible. If you are a protestant reading this, read about the history of forming the New Testament. It wasn't handed directly from God's hand to Christians, but was a long process of evaluation in determining what was divinely inspired and what was not. Many books were left out that some wanted to include - they are known as the &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot;. It was the Catholic Church who determined which books were to be included and which ones were not. This was 300 years after the Apostles. Please tell me what bible were the earliest of Christians using to verify and justify their beliefs prior to the fourth century. They relied on TRADITION.

How this hate can be tolerated in Churches that dedicate themselves to Christ I do not know. Jesus was clear that we were to love our enemies, our perceived enemies here.Those afflicted with this kind of hate should be prayed after.

The book was brought to my attention by my wife who has many Catholic friends who she said were very upset by this book. So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book \`Roman Catholicism' is full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a \`Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions\\" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these \`Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these \`Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; \\"If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it.\\"Boettner tries to give the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become \`card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small number of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was \`pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally \`free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even \\"Republics\\" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the \\"Republic\\" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former \\"Republics\\" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the \\"CIA World Factbook, 2011\\" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a \\"Hate\\" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these \`rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like \\"Catholic Answers\\" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2\\" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"When researching a subject one much read each side's point of view. Those who believe that the material presented in this book is an accurate representation of Roman Catholicism are mistaken.To truly learn about Catholicism why read a book by someone trying to refute it? Why not then read accurate information about Roman Catholicism such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC). The CCC is cross referenced with the Holy Bible so one can read the Roman Catholic side of the argument.If in the end one still disagrees with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, at least that person went to the source for accurate information.For a side trying to refute a theory or in this case religious denomination it is unethical as a scholar to present a presentation of your opposing theory in what can be proceed as an unbiased way.In short if one wants to learn about Roman Catholicism go to the source, in this case the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If one wishes to learn about Fundamentalism one can read any number of works by several educated Fundamentalist writers.This is a poor work.(Also a note should be made that not all Catholics who believe in Papal succession and the Mass are \\"Roman Catholics\\" or Latin Rite Catholics; there are over 20 liturgical rites in the Catholic Church.

Nothing changed with Vatican II (or it shouldn't have if the RCC is as unchanging as it's adherents like to claim, or did we get a new and different RCC with Vatican II, in which case it's not the same church as the original and would be in contradiction to the original teachings, making it apostate).In any case, give the man his due (though I disagree with his Reformed position myself) and recognize his work for the excellent documentation and him for the scholar that he was."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I agree that this could have been written with a lot more love and a lot less judgment.

I will print the jacket of my copy below for reference..................................................................Roman Catholicism By Lorraine Boettner The widespread activity of the Roman Catholic Church makes it imperative that all Christians regardless of denomination should know something about it's doctrines, it's practices and it's goals for the future. Dr. Boettner has written an interesting and informative book from the viewpoint of evangelical Protestantism which presents the two systems in strong contrast. The present day Roman Catholic Church is compared with the Church of the first century. And Protestantism is shown to be not a new system that arose at the time of the reformation, as some have attempted to represent, but a return to New Testament Christianity and the simplicity of the apostolic Church. Constant reference is made to Scripture teaching,and the material is presented in non-technical language that the average Christian can follow with ease. Some of the major subjects discussed are: The Church, The Priesthood, Tradition, Peter, The Papacy, Mary, The Mass, The Confessional, Purgatory, the Infallibility of the Pope, Penance, Indulgences, Salvation by Grace, Ritualism, Celibacy, Marriage, The Parochial School, Contrasting Moral Standards, Intolerance and Religious Persecution. Historical aspects and the relationship of Church and State are also dealth with. Designed to be a standard work on the subject, this book undoubtedly will live for years as the most comprehensive and penetrating analysis available fo the two systems. It is an Evangelical Book Club selection................................................................My name is Scott D. Berner, I am a Baptist minister and have studied the Roman Catholic Church for many years. Dr. Boettner's book is an EXCELLENT reference work and highly educational. I value it highly as part of my personaly library and refer to it's documentation regularly in sermons and radio broadcasts. It is a work of Truth.The chapters on Roman Catholic doctrine are witout error or misrepresentation, I can assure the customers of Amazon of this. To the very best of my ability and study of these matters I do so attest this to be true.In chapter 18 of this great book, &quot;XVIII - Intolerance - Bigotry - Persecution&quot; , one may find a rare expose of the true historical record of this religious institution. To rate this book anything but FIVE STARS is almost a sin. I just thought I would take a minute to set the record straight. May God bless all who read this book with understanding and boldness to stand for the Truth.Just for the record I would disagree with Dr. Boettner on numerous of his doctrinal teachings. I do not espouse the Presbyterian doctrines, for I am a Freewill Baptist and find this to be closer to the &quot;faith ONCE delivered to the saints&quot;. However, our differences being what they are, still, I cannot but recommend this book for all students of history and the Roman Catholic Church. It is a worthy book. I thank Amozon for making this book available to the masses. It is my staunch opinion that every faithful Christian should have a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Catholic apologetics cannot ignore Boettner's account of the Inquisition, the Hugenot Holocaust of 1572 or the overall political machine which smokescreens its hidden agenda behind a non-scriptural, works-oriented system.

Has intellectual honesty gone out of style? It seems that Boettner's hatred of the Catholic Church lead this pitiful man to throw truth and accuracy out the window when he wrote this forgettable work of lies and distortions. In fact, the reader can visualize Boettner with clinched fists and gnashed teeth as he swerves recklessly from one mistaken conclusion to another. WHY IS THE TRUTH SO SCARY TO SOME?

Indeed, I would even say that most fundamentalists who rely on this book as their source manual, or \\"anti-Catholic Bible\\" as Karl Keating put it, are aware of the dishonesty, but continue to use it in hopes of swaying the uneducated with sensationalist and inaccurate citations.For example, Boettner claims that extreme unction, the Catholic sacrament also known as anointing of the sick, was invented in 526 AD. The implication being that it was not practiced by the early Church, but was, as the story goes, Roman paganism incorporated by the state. What he doesn't tell you is that this practice can actually be found in the Bible. The Epistle of James 5:14-15 reads \\"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.\\"I dare any person who finds accuracy in this book to support the vicious claims it makes. You won't see it. Jimmy Swaggart, Jack Chick and Bob Jones University avoid open debate; the reason being, as Plato predicted, because they know they are spreading malicious propaganda. To confront those they persecute would give them a chance to defend themselves, and with reasonable argument comes a clearing in the fog. The lies fall apart.Look at some other claims \\"Roman Catholicism\\" makes. Boettner believes that transubstantiation, or the idea that Jesus is literally present in the Eucharist, was invented in 1215 AD. In reality, that's when the term \\"transubstantiation\\" was deemed fit to describe the miracle of the Mass. The actual doctrine of the Real Presence comes from the Gospel of John, chapter six: \\"Amen, amen, I say unto you: except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you\\" (verse 54). Boettner claims to derive his theology from the ante-Nicene Fathers (that is, early Christians who lived after the apostles but before Constantine). In actuality, EVERY SINGLE Church father believed in the Real Presence.\\"They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again.\\" Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to Smyrnaeans, 7,1 (c. A.D. 110).\\"For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.\\" Justin Martyr, First Apology, 66 (c. A.D. 110-165).\\"He acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as his own blood, from which he bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of creation) he affirmed to be his own body, from which he gives increase to our bodies.\\" Irenaeus, Against Heresies, V:2,2 (c. A.D. 200).\\"For the blood of the grape--that is, the Word--desired to be mixed with water, as His blood is mingled with salvation. And the blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual, that by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus, is to become partaker of the Lord's immortality; the Spirit being the energetic principle of the Word, as blood is of flesh. Accordingly, as wine is blended with water, so is the Spirit with man. And the one, the mixture of wine and water, nourishes to faith; while the other, the Spirit, conducts to immortality. And the mixture of both--of the water and of the Word--is called Eucharist, renowned and glorious grace; and they who by faith partake of it are sanctified both in body and soul.\\" Clement of Alexandria, The Instructor, 2 (ante A.D. 202).Don't buy the vicious lies."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"As an ex-protestant seminarian and now a Catholic priest I know how wrong Boettner is first hand.

He states correctly that the Pope must be speaking \\"Ex Cathedra\\" but in the footnaotes makes is seem that the Pope must be literally sitting in his Papal chair, instead of the \\"Seat of Authority\\" of his office.The rest of the book is filled with much of the same.If Boettner had done the tiniest bit of research maybe he might not have presented some of these, maybe.If it wasn't so sad it would be funny.

Dr. Boettner quotes priests, ex-priests, bishops, cardinals, popes, nuns and ex-nuns in this lengthy, but captivating piece of research. One of the most valuable insights that he brings to the table is the fact the the Catholic church in the United States is very different than the Catholic church in most other countries - mostly because the U.S. is dominanted by Protestants.

For the Catholics here, you might want to read Martin Chemnitz's Tridentine Commentary available through Concordia Publ House. Three volumes. Good stuff. Good history. Good review of the fathers. As a Protesting Roman Catholic, those fathers are our's, given Rome's perversion of the Gospel and excision from the continuing church. The terms of readmission remain the same as in the days of the Reformation. Repent and embrace the apostolic witness of supreme guidance. Thanks. Have a published lined up and maybe will do alot of research, writing, and updating. But the rubbishy comments below by Cath's are one-sided. Can you folks still read Reformation materials? While the Index of Forbidden Books was in effect until the 1960's (talk about anti-intellectualism and control), have any of the Prot-bashers below read, let's say, 200 books for starters from the Reformation period?

Boettner presents Catholicism as HE understands it, without any real effort to ask real Catholics why they believe what they do, and cites as sources many ex-Catholics, ex-priests and ex-nuns. Sadly, many people have taken this book at face value, without bothering to look any further, and have grown up with a vision of Roman Catholicism which is hideously wrong.

As a life-long Catholic, I must say that her book betrays a fundamental (no-pun intended) ignorance of the true history and nature of Catholicism. The author describes a Catholicism based upon her own misconceptions (and those also held by her fundamentalist colleagues) rather than the reality of the Church itself. This distortion is not surprising, as the purpose of the book is to foster the author's own personal point of view by castigating an institution which, while flawed (as any human endeavour is flawed) is Christianity.Even worse, the book also shows a fundamental ignorance of the Bible and contextual scholarship itself; rather the author twists and parses words and phrases to suit her own purposes without.The author would do well to actually read and understand the Bible. Perhaps she would better understand what Roman Catholicism and even in a broader context, all of Christianity is about."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world.

If you read \\"Catholicism vs. Fundamentalism\\" by: Karl Keating to obtain the REAL beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church, and then you read this, you will realize that this book doesn't present Catholicism fairly, honestly or correctly...in the least! Not even close. This has to be one of the worst books, right on par with Fundamentalists like Jack Chick and Dave hunt.Trust me, this book will not, in any way, help you to understand what the Catholic Church truly believes at all. It's only success, besides consistently lacking footnotes, is to MIS-represent the Catholic faith with straw man arguments.If you really want to know what the Catholic Church teaches read:1. \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism,\\" by Karl Keating2. \\"Surprised by Truth,\\" By: Patrick Madrid3. \\"Pope Fiction,\\" by Prtick Madrid4. \\"What Catholics Really Believe,\\" By Karl Keating (Answering 52Misconceptions about the Catholic Church)5. \\"The Catholic Answer Book\\" (4 books in set - All are great), ByPeter M.

Boettner was horribly misinformed about what Catholics actually believe or was so blinded by anti-Catholic bigotry that he didn't care to get his facts straight. Any fool can knock down a straw man, which is all that Boettner does in this book. If you believe that fundamentalists are right and Catholics are sadly misguided and bound for Hell, I dare you to read Keating's book, cover to cover."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I bought this book in hard cover at a Protestant book store and was surprised at the low price. Apparently, they print them cheap in order to get them in the hands of as many people as possible? I started reading it and had to stop--it was so full of lies and inaccuracies--it insulted my intelligence."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"When researching a subject one much read each side's point of view. Those who believe that the material presented in this book is an accurate representation of Roman Catholicism are mistaken.To truly learn about Catholicism why read a book by someone trying to refute it? Why not then read accurate information about Roman Catholicism such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC). The CCC is cross referenced with the Holy Bible so one can read the Roman Catholic side of the argument.If in the end one still disagrees with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, at least that person went to the source for accurate information.For a side trying to refute a theory or in this case religious denomination it is unethical as a scholar to present a presentation of your opposing theory in what can be proceed as an unbiased way.In short if one wants to learn about Roman Catholicism go to the source, in this case the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If one wishes to learn about Fundamentalism one can read any number of works by several educated Fundamentalist writers.This is a poor work.(Also a note should be made that not all Catholics who believe in Papal succession and the Mass are \\"Roman Catholics\\" or Latin Rite Catholics; there are over 20 liturgical rites in the Catholic Church. Around 97% of Catholics are of the Latin Rite."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I bought this book because it was given either one or five stars. So I thought it must be very (!) controveral. If you are looking for a scholary insight in catholic theology, you will be at the wrong place. You can get better books on this subject by evanglical scholars. I highly recommend the book of John Armstrong (ed.)&quot;Roman Catholicism etc&quot;. To get catholic theology right read catholic sources and compare it with the evangelical view. If you do this you get some new ideas and possibillities to interpret scripture. Especally if you compare the modern evangelical thoughts with the Early Fathers. There you can see protestant errors, but also catholic errors. For an honest seeker of information this book is too polemical, but it is not as bad as some of the (fundamentalist) catholic rewiewers said."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This book is full of problems (like implicit christological errors), but my favorite errors in it are the historical ones.The best example regards the use of icons. Boettner mentions the iconoclastic controversy which ended with the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Nicaea II), then goes on to say that one of the chief issues dividing Catholics and Eastern Orthodox today is the use of icons: according to this book, the Eastern Orthodox refuse to have icons! This is not only historically inaccurate (the Eastern Orthodox have always accepted the Nicaea II Council), it can be disproven by simply walking into any Eastern Orthodox church. Eastern Orthodox churches are full of icons and sacred images! If a book doesn't have simple facts like these straight, how can one trust it with more nuanced questions of theology and philosophy?Boettner's Roman Catholicism, with its shoddy scholarship throughout, reminds me most of God's decree &quot;You shall not bear false witness.&quot;If you're curious about the history of Christianity and the development of Christian doctrine."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"As a biblical scholar of sorts, I thought that I would find some interesting arguments in this book. However, what I actually found was a book FULL of claims with virtually no referencing to sources. This book is such a farse of intellectual trash that it does not warrant reading.The sad fact is that this book tells you less about Roman Catholicism and more about fundamentalist bigotry. His list of Catholic inventions is a ridiculous attempt at scholarly insight and he actually has factual errors in the list. Some dates are totally wrong and other &quot;inventions&quot; can be seen in practice long before the &quot;invention&quot; date, even in non-Catholic writing! Mr. Boettner, thank you for retiring.

The writer uses the teaching of the Apostle Paul predominately that brings &quot;new insight&quot; which is definitely beneficial in two major ways, higher educating of the faith and faith strengthening. This is something all real believers seek, bringing us closer to gods spirit. Also a book for persons flagging in their faith and on the verge of making a decision to convert. I wish to recommend a great spiritual book, SB 1 or God by Karl Maddox."},{"Title":"After \\"I Believe\\": Experiencing Authentic Christian Living","review":"I sometimes liken what passes for Christianity today as a process of administering the equivalent of a religious vaccine--they introduce a watered down shadow of Christianity that has the effect of rendering the recipient immune to the real thing, should he ever see it. Although I suppose this is not just a modern day phenomenon--as C. S. Lewis noted long ago, the reason so few fail at Christianity is because do few try it.I have my own ideas as to why this is, but more on that in a moment. First, the book.This is a great book. It provides a basic overview of what I'd call the &quot;how's and why's&quot; of daily Christian life.So many seem to think so much of what is discussed here is unimportant and/or optional--prayer, worship, fellowship, religious study and so forth are, for some reason, too often seen as minor adjuncts to &quot;the Christian Life&quot;. The book looks at each of these--and other--topics and explains why they are vital to the daily life of Christians and need to be performed/observed/pursued. The church has lasted over 2000 years in large part because these actions were developed as a means of communicating, enriching and protecting the faith and its followers. Roberts does an admirable job of explaining the roots of these activities, their history and their importance both to the church in general and to the individual specifically.I particularly like the subtitle of this book--Experiencing Authentic Christian Living. I believe there are two factors that undermine the Christian faith in general these days. One is shallowness derived from Christianity as marketing as opposed to Christianity as religion. Success seems in all too many cases to be based solely on the number of bodies that come through the door. Entertainment and marketing thus replace faith and evangelism. The other is Christianity as politics. The radical right and left seem to have decided that the church pulpit is primarily a political pulpit.This book works because it focuses on Christianity as a faith--not an entertainment or a political medium. It is not about getting right with your karma or right with a political agenda--it's about getting right with God, complete with an array of actions that will facilitate and strengthen that activity.If you're worried about your temporal life, go to a mega church and join the softball team. If you are concerned about your spiritual and eternal life, read this book."},{"Title":"After \\"I Believe\\": Experiencing Authentic Christian Living","review":"This is well written, easy to read, and full of challenging thoughts and questions. Dr. Roberts is not afraid to touch on the controversial, but is gracious and rational in his approach. He gives sound advice for people who are in all stages of their walk. I especially appreciate his emphasis on fellowship in all areas of life for the purpose of intimacy with God and others. Anyone who reads this will be sure to walk away with great insights for their personal spiritual development.

It is written with the purpose of finding a higher meaning to the changes undergoing literature during this time period, and Kazin does a remarkable job of keeping this long book interesting. The book helped me understand how many of my favorite authors fit into the 'grand scheme of literature' as well as how authors and individual books fit into political and social history.

This is the astounding apprenticeship piece by the 27 year old Kazin. Does it have weaknesses? Surely. Young Kazin was blazing trails, as well as sharpening his tools, making way for future works of the journeyman.

'On Native Grounds' a study of late nineteenth- century and early twentieth century American Literature is his most well- known critical work. It opens with a masterful consideration of the dilemnas of the Dean of American Literature of the time, the great champion of Realism, William Dean Howells. It shows how Howells became despite his great eminence increasingly isolated in a world in which Naturalism and even young Realists seemed to go their way without him. Kazin displays a vast reading in this work but wears this quite easily. The book is a highly readable one. There are those who say that he despite his efforts came close to producing a work of criticism on this level of originality again.

And while we are viewing the stunning, full page color plates, we receive an accompanying historical narrative, covering some eight hundred years, from the Seljuks to the Ottomans. We have verse from Omar Khayyam, drawings of ancient cities, and illustrations of construction techniques. And our disbelieving eyes widen to the stunning color and creativity in the glazed tiles and mosaics. When it was published in 1968 there was little available for scholars of design and architecture in Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey.

Indeed, his writings on the age old complexity of eye dominance for the shotgun user is the most concise I have ever read.As a Brittany owner I found this book especially joyful in that the author really does know the breed...the wonderful little French hunting dog to whom the author refers to as God's Bird Dog."},{"Title":"Bobs, Brush and Brittanies","review":"This book is easy reading and brings back memories of years past for an upland game hunter.

Overall, a good book."},{"Title":"Bobs, Brush and Brittanies","review":"Joel Vance does a wonderful job of drawing you into his hunting life, and painting a word-picture that makes you feel like you're there.

Absolutly wonderfull stories that had me run the full gauntlet of emotions. I myself train Brittanys and have 2 of these remarkable dogs.

Mr Vance you would be welcome to hunt pheasant with me at any time!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Public Health","review":"Mary-Jane Schneider's \\"Introduction to Public Health\\" is just what she claims it is - an introduction. The book is a very concisely and clearly-written overview on a range of public health topics such as water quality, epidemiology, and chronic diseases. Schneider divides the book into seven parts that look at the definition of public health, analytical methods of public health, public health's biomedical basis, social and behavioral factors, environmental issues, medical care, and the future of public health. The book should be valued not for its depth but its breadth - Schneider does cover a variety of important public health topics but she does not go into great detail. Including a list of resources or suggested reading at the end of each chapter would have been greatly appreciated. However, to Schneider's credit, the book does have cute illustrations and includes numerous charts, graphs, and discussion questions at the end of every chapter. The book is also very readable and isn't as daunting or dry as some other public health textbooks. This book is a great complement to Bernard Turnock's introduction to public health, as Turnock does go into some of the nitty gritty of public health but doesn't cover as many issues as Schneider does."},{"Title":"Introduction to Public Health","review":"Truly a wonder. Not only is it full of useful information, well organized, thorough, and insightful - it's readable!!! For once, I could not put a book (other than a novel!) down! The author kept my interest alive with the excellent use of the language and the ability to keep even sub-sub-sections organized and to the point.I turned to this book because I'm writing an evaluation of Washington State's substance abuse prevention efforts during the last few years, and my boss requested that I analyze it from the perspective of the public health model. I needed a review, and this book provided exactly what I needed.I especially enjoyed the open, honest statements in the preface about how difficult it was to define public health during the author's involvement in establishing the School of Public Health in the University at Albany. The book is a delight to read and oh-so-useful."},{"Title":"Introduction to Public Health","review":"this was required for my intro to public health class, and so far it's a pretty good accompaninent to our class lectures. however, often times, i find the explanations and supports they give too redundant. if you buy this and read it, i suggest not reading every paragraph. if you understand an idea or concept with just one example they give, don't feel as if you need to read the 2 or 3 other examples they go into detail for the next couple of pages.so far, out of the 4 or 5 chapters i've read, i have actually found the prologue to be the most interesting. the prologue talks about some famous, most obvious cases of public health - i.e. AIDS and a water treatment caused breakout somewhere close the Great Lakes area.

Schneider attacks the Bush administration often. This is ridiculous, there should be both sides in a school book."},{"Title":"Introduction to Public Health","review":"This book is a good example of why public health has become irrelevant to the average citizen. The content was biased and relied heavily on progressive philosophy. Public Health should be integral to improving and restructuring the health care system. The content is replete with accusations and blame for poor funding and indifference to purpose. Any discipline should be able to define itself and provide a realistic scope of objectives,goals and services. The author's conclusion was that legislation and education were the primary functions of public health in America. (More taxes for that?!)The system has not adapted to current problems and needs since the later 60s. Practical application was nonexistent in the 80s and 90s and accounted for lack of funding. AIDS should have been a reawakening for public health professionals but they were paralyzed with fear of creating offence or lacking \\"compassion\\" for the gay community. Too many academics, unable to define purpose, strategies and practical application. AIDS is a public health problem and should have been treated like TB, venereal disease, and the many others!The book was expensive and my daughter's professor taught only the standard line contents.The assignments were unchallenging and lacked creativity. No wonder, students see future employment options only as PHDs and researchers. How exciting.This is a critical time for public health with many opportunities and possibilities, but professors, you need to come out of the classroom and perhaps definition, scope and purpose may become clear to you."},{"Title":"Introduction to Public Health","review":"USUALLY WHEN I ORDER SOMETHING FROM AMAZON IT TAKES TWO DAYS TO ARRIVE WITH THIS BOOK IT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN EXPECTED I WAS STARTING TO FREAK BUT THEN IT ARRIVED.

Easy to read and better yet, easy to learn from. Buster and the Amazing Daisy allows the reader to peek into the life of a child who is different than their peers. I found my emotions swelling as I entered into the life of this little child who overcomes the challenges many children face by simply being different. Certainly children with Asperger Syndrome, families, friends and teachers can all benefit from reading this book, in addition, any child who feels they sometimes just don't fit in can enjoy and learn from Buster and the Amazing Daisy. I hope to see more books by Nancy Ogaz out soon."},{"Title":"Buster and the Amazing Daisy","review":"This is a delightful book about a young girl who has Asperger's Syndrome. Asperger's Syndrome is a neurobiological condition that is on the same spectrum as autism and the accompanying behaviors are as varied as there are individuals who have it.Daisy, the young protagonist is fully aware that she is on the a/A spectrum. She is easily distracted by noises; a classmate's hair-chewing annoys her; certain sounds, tastes and smells upset her. A grade-schooler, Daisy enters the story as a newly-mainstreamed pupil from a self contained program for persons with autism. Her previous school carries the sad name School of Social And Developmentally Delayed, which automatically screams stigma. Instead of being a helpful program, Daisy's previous school does not appear tailored to meet her academic and social needs. At Ocean Vista, where she is mainstreamed, she has a very understanding teacher who explains her behaviors, e.g. hand flapping, noise sensitivity, verbal outbursts, uttering non sequiturs as well as esoteric words to her classmates. Daisy often tended to use stilted utterances such as \\"powers of darkness\\" when describing bullying and her spontaneous display of affection when her principal sympathizes with some of her social difficulties. Daisy also makes good use of the Resource Room when stimuli become too overwhelming.Even with good back up, Daisy is targeted by a group of bullies, some of whom are her classmates. In time, she learns to defend herself and makes friends with a boy named Cody who had also attended Daisy's former school. A girl named Lauren takes Daisy under her wing and is amazingly accepting of Daisy's explanation of what it means to have Asperger's. Indeed, a very funny exchange occurs between the girls when Lauren mispronounces Asperger's, thinking Daisy was making a rather rude joke. That part was truly hilarious!In time, as the girls bond with Cody, Daisy demonstrates her skill at animal training. She had been working with the class rabbit Buster and had trained him to perform tricks. It is through her work with Buster and with her two new friends that Daisy becomes empowered to act as a friend and step up to the plate for someone who really needs her help.This is a wonderful book and a treat for all ages. Please read this and share it with someone. The acceptance of the principal, Daisy's teacher and Resource Room teacher point up to just how important inclusion really is. I also like the resorces that the author lists at the end of the story. Hats off to this book!"},{"Title":"Buster and the Amazing Daisy","review":"Although the author may not have Asperger Syndrome, she seems to understand the syndrome very clearly. While showing the differences of AS for everybody she also shows the benefits for everybody. Once I started the book, I wanted to read it without stopping."},{"Title":"Buster and the Amazing Daisy","review":"My son loved hearing a story about someone else with Aspergers. This may not be award winning literature, but it was certainly entertaining enough to keep my son's second grade class interested. The kids enjoyed the story, and learned about Aspergers in the process. This was the perfect story to open up discussion in the classroom. The teacher tells me that the class was much kinder and more understanding of my son's behaviors afterwards. The main character is very likable, and the reader is left with a sense of understanding and compassion for her quirky behaviors. I plan to read it again to his 3rd grade class."},{"Title":"Buster and the Amazing Daisy","review":"\\"Buster and the Amazing Daisy\\" seems a bit more polished to me than Kathy Hoopmann's books and not only has main character who is female (Daisy White), but an animal (Buster the black bunny), that cinches it as my top choice for Asperger's fiction for young people. It also features a pair of unfortunate puns (p. 55-6) on Asperger that leave names I used to be called in school in the dust--every kid with Asperger's should be aware that they are coming, however.The illustrations also add a nice touch, wispy little sketches that capture the tale. There's a little bit of Judy Blume's \\"Blubber\\" in this tale, too, as Daisy copes with a girl (a girl given to rhyme, no less) who torments her. There's also a character confined to a wheelchair, showing a more physical disability along with the more (but not entirely) mental one and how the kids with them view their lives. All in all, this is a fine, multidimensional book for the 3rd to 7th grade set focusing on Asperger's, but dealing with many other issues as well, making it less a blatant vehicle to educate and more just a great book.Readers should also be aware of two other books--polar opposites for suggested readership--that I enjoyed: \\"The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome\\" by Tony Attwood for parents, educators, and clinicians (and, apparently, me), and \\"Can I Tell You About Asperger Syndrome?: A Guide for Friends and Family\\" by Jude Welton and Jane Telford for young people. Also keep your eye out for Kathy Hoopmann's \\"Asperger Adventure\\" series of children's books."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"It would not be correct to say The Autumn series is a Romero-fan's ultimate zombie series, but its not fair to say its \\"the thinking man's\\" zombie series either.If you worked your way through Autumn and its sequel, The City, you pretty much know what you're getting. Some occassional grisle and gore but mostly a lot of complaining and \\"didnt-we-already-go-over-this\\" dialogue. Still, I know I was at least invested enough to see how things turn out. The sadist in me wanted more of the survivors to get mauled by the hordes but the Lost fan in me was interested to see how the ending would develop from here.Most of the most annoying characters have been weeded out by now, so you know that you won't get too many \\"what's the point\\" speakers from here on in, but you still get your gaggle of quitters and whiners, which would be fine, if it weren't every other conversation.The scenes at the airport are certainly intense and make for the most thrilling in the series since the farmhouse stand-off on the first book.The Autumn series did just-enough blood/guts/gore to keep me invested, the characters were interesting at time, annoying at others, and Moody's reliance on describing the state of decay on the zombies became less powerful the more and more he did it. By then, he needed to raise the bar and emotional resonance by sacrificing a few more brave souls in a gruesome demise."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"Autumn, Purification, basically marks the end of a trilogy of zombie-focused books.The story evolves around the same group of survivors that was featured in the previous, \`Autumn, the City' book. The action starts exactly where it stopped there. The survivors are sheltered in an underground, army-occupied bunker. They take the decision to venture out of it after the shelter gets overwhelmed by a mass of zombies and all hope to stay safely in is lost. What follows is their quest for survival in a devastated, highly perilous world.Without lifting the curtain off of the story plot, please remember that David Moody is a talented English writer who has decided to take his time to tell a very realistic tale of survival without any kind of biased opinion. Zombies are never called zombies, they are depicted as beings that used to be normal and that now suffer from their decaying condition. They don't hurt for pleasure, or without reason. The military is shown as a group of very different characters. They are not described as a stereotypical, 2-bit group of dumb-minded, orders-obeying robots. Some of the survivors are selfish and meet their end without judgment, while it becomes clear that their attitude is actually dictated by their incapability to feed their hope any longer. Some others are brave and courageous, but also subject to doubt. Boredom is shown as an implacable enemy. The fragility of hope in people's heart is demonstrated over and over. Only a handful of people get to see some kind of light in the gloom of their everyday life.Moody seems to be willing to get away from any kind of judgment on the zombies' conditions, hence it becomes difficult to really feel disdain towards them. Rather, their evolving attitude becomes logical and, from them, less of a threat, more \`acceptable'.Overall, action is continuous and logical. The whole book is a real pleasure to read. It concludes with class and smoothness a fine trilogy of books that really deserves any reader's attention."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"After having loved David Moody's Autumn and its sequel Autumn: The City, I was eager to get started on the third title in the series, Autumn: Purification.Autumn: Purification opens with a brief recap leading to the events narrated herein and thereafter, picks up almost immediately from where Autumn: The City left off. This had me ever so slightly worried since it would have been incredibly easy for Moody to take the path of least resistance and created a clone of the plot from Romero's Day of the Dead from this point. Thankfully, this is far from the case with Purification.Moody continues to develop not only his characters and the undead in this third instalment of the Autumn series but the universe which they occupy also. The tone of the book, as with its predecessors, is suitably bleak and the focus is very much on the plight of the characters, the daily trials they suffer, how they cope with their own emotions and despair; and how much they have changed despite less than six weeks having passed since the cataclysmic event which wiped out the majority of the planet's population and the dead started to rise. At the same time, Moody pays attention to the degradation of the physical states of the walking dead, but Purification, as with the previous instalments in the Autumn series, sees the shambling corpses continue to evolve in a fashion that I can only imagine that other authors wish they had thought of first...Although there is plenty of action, death and decaying flesh in this book and it is undoubtedly at home in the horror genre, it will leave those looking for an adrenaline-fuelled mindless zombie tale unsatisifed. I would submit to you that this is no bad thing. Autumn: Purification continues to flesh out Moody's Autumn universe admirably and although this book only runs to 260 or so pages and could be read as a stand alone title, I would suggest to any potential reader to do as I have done and read the series from the start since it has greatly enhanced my enjoyment of each of the books by taking them in sequence.There's no need to take my word for it either, award-winning author Jonathan Maberry said of Autumn that: \\"This is smart fiction, written with style and insight. Not for the gore-hounds who can't think past a pile of entrails, but the rest of the readers in the world.\\"Taking into account my love of post-apocalyptica and how many books concering the sub-genre that I read, I can honestly say that Autumn has, to date, seriously impressed me and consistently hits the mark where so many other books fail and simply rely on gore and decay. In short, my advice to genre fans is simple. Get involved with the Autumn series as soon as possible. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"Love this whole series almost as much the Hater trilogy, this one is a little toned down. Not as nearly as much blood and gore. David Moody is able to keep me want more throughout the first three books, waiting on the fourth to be released this month."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"I thought this was a very good read. I have just got into this series but cant put the books down. I had my doubts while reading the first book \\"autumn,\\" because it is slow at first, but once it picks up you really want to know what comes next.The character development is great. You really want to see what happens to the characters you are introduced to. I could really sympathize with them, because of this I give Moody lots of credit as an author.If you like Apocalyptic stories or are a fan of the Zombie genre, the autumn series is for you. Although the pages arent covered with blood this series is sure to prove to be a cult classic."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"UNLIKE most zombie novels, the Autumn series explores the horror of the situation with an incredible depth into the many character's psyche. To even refer to this series as being about \\"Zombies\\" shows a complete lack of literary understanding, and shallowness.I was fortunate enough to find David Moody's writing by accident while searching the internet for something to read. I had never read an on-line novel before, and that was the only form offered at the time. \\"Autumn\\" is an incredible read. The way David takes you into the mind and souls of the characters is masterful. The interaction between the helpless victims is completely real and true to life. Their thoughts could easily be your own.While David's writing does center around the \\"undead\\", that is never its main focus. From the military, to the loner, to the lover, you experience the passion and motivation that drives each person. There is also a simplistic, yet far reaching epiphany to be had for those that can see it. In short, each book in the \\"Autumn\\" series leaves you frantic for the next. You just have to know how it all plays out. And, you won't be disappointed.I have read all four books in the \\"Autumn\\" series, and also \\"Trust\\", a spectacular, real version of first contact. I hesitated to read \\"Straight To You\\" for the fact that it was a love story. I was so mistaken in putting it off. \\"Straight To You\\" has ended up being one of the most thought provoking novels I have read."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"I have read the entire Autumn series, and loved every book. It is not your typical fanfic type of zombie story, and the buildup is slow (not in a bad way), but as you go through the books and read the points of view of the different characters, it all tells an horrific but compelling story."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"The survivors from AUTUMN and AUTUMN: THE CITY have finally come together and are holed up in a military bunker. Unfortunately, the soldiers in said bunker have been cut off from the virus and are not immune, making things complicated for the groups. As the dead swarm above, the survivors come to the conclusion that they must soon move on. Their opportunity comes when the soldiers begin a mass attack on the horde outside.Third in the series of five presents new challenges to the growing group. The interaction with the military was brief. Not sure if this element will return (though they're kind of doomed anyway). The end of PURIFICATION was great, though, and I look forward to what comes next for these poor survivors!"},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"Unlike the first sequel, you do need to have read the prior novel to enjoy this one and even understand to a decent level what is going on. The second novel in the series Autumn: The City, had a cliff hanger to be continued ending, which is where Autumn Purification starts. Although it isn't necessary to do so, it's probably not a bad idea to read the original book one Autumn, before both of them as well, simply as the main two characters in this one, were in that one so you'll know who survives and so on if you later go back and read it. Autumn Purification does leave room for more sequels (and there's two more at the time of this review), but the central following these characters story does wrap up, it's not a to be continued ending, so if you are interested in what happens to the characters from Autumn but are hesitant thinking the same thing will happen, rest assured if you chose to do so you could end your reading the series here, (or take a rest from it, read other books or whatever before reading book four).As I said Autumn Purification follows the characters from where they ended up in the prior novel (I won't give away where), of course it wouldn't be much of a novel if they lived happily ever after there so of course after a little while they are back in those vehicles and on the run again, with a couple of extra characters, desperate to find somewhere to stop where they can escape the tens of thousands of putrid smelling rotting corpses that like flies, just seem to want to hassle them. One on one a corpse is just a bother, but on mass their numbers seem to present some sort of danger (although to be honest I still don't really see it). But the point is the survivors seem to think there's one and are terrified and act accordingly. Internal tension is just as much if not a bigger threat than the walking corpses. When all hope seems lost this group will encounter a couple of other survivors with an idea that injects a massive amount of hope to a possible peaceful zombie free existence. But is it too good to be true?I did find that the consistency of some of these characters has changed a fair bit from the initial and previous novel, especially Emma who seems to have gotten younger, either that or the affects of travelling alone with someone in highly stressful circumstances, when there's not a lot of other prospects around can create lustful feelings no matter if that person is old enough to be your grandmother. More likely Moody has made her younger since the first novel became a movie (which I haven't seen so I don't know how old she is but I assume she would be younger than the book) or just to allow the changes in the plot of the series to work. Also Cooper's actions at one point seem completely out of character, especially when you consider there was a safe way at hand to transport the people who needed to get to where they needed to survive, and when you consider they used to be his colleagues before the world changed. I would have liked to have also seen more of the story told through these characters eyes, especially in those scenes and in the place they were at the start of the story. Although maybe Moody will put us in their minds in one of the next sequels, as going back in time with parallel stories to the first novel occurred with the first sequel. But still Purification would have been more satisfying read if ther points of view were in here."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"Not the most technically sound writing in publication but very far from the worst. For zombie fans, there really is no such thing as a bad zombie story, but David Moody's work really is something special. Its not your run of the mill flesh eating frenzy type of story and that's refreshing. The Autumn novel's power resides not in their ability to disgust or in the description of violence, but in the psychological despair and utter hopelessness that would be felt by the survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Very emotional, very disturbing, utterly wonderful."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"Love this series and this is a fitting installment in it. See my reviews of other books in the series If you need details."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"David Moody continues to go against the trend by writing zombie fiction (without the word 'zombie') and swapping gore for intelligent storytelling and deep character development. This is smart fiction, written with style and insight. Not for the gore-hounds who can't think past a pile of entrails, but the rest of the readers in the world (including the legion of zombie fans with working brains), this is a perfect next chapter in the wonderful AUTUMN series. Landmark."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"I've read all the books from the Autumn series. Really good stories, but at times it was hard for me to force myself to pick the books up. For more on this check my other review for the first book of the series, Autumn."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"I am embarrassed that I even bought this book. The first one was strangely compelling, and I found the second one on sale cheap, but I should have honestly stopped there.There is nothing really scary about these \\"bodies.\\" They are weak and decaying. A few well-placed molotov cocktails applied regularly would have finished this series at book two (or sooner). Presumably the bodies are not reproducing. Eventually, efforts at getting rid of them would pay off.There is nothing scary about this book, that is, except the hypnotic repetitiveness of the narration. If I read one more time the long, drawn-out explanation of why the bodies were amassing near the survivors, I think perhaps I might have turned into a zombie-like creature myself.I remain flabbergasted that so many people appear to have thought this book was worth 4+ stars."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"I just finished the third volume of David Moody's zombie series \\"AUTUMN\\". I must admit to being somewhat excited after reading the 1st book in the series, but ultimately this entire series was a complete disappoinment. Here's why: Somewhere about 3/4 of the way through the 1st book the author makes the disasterous decision to concentrate his book on character development of his \\"still-living\\" characters. That is fine, but unfortunately Moody totally abandons his \\"bread and butter\\" in the book: ZOMBIES! They are completely NON-threatening and really nothing more than topics of conversations for his characters. Can you say: BORING!!!Don't waste your time on this series of books."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"I have read and reviewed the first 2 \\"Autumn\\" books and I am probably sounding like a broken record. There is not enough of the over-the-top Zombie gore that I enjoy so much. There is however more action in this book than the first two in the series.The books are well written and interesting. The problem I have, besides the absence of extreme Zombie gore, is that the books focus mainly on the characters. The Zombies almost seem secondary to the story.I enjoyed all three books, but this was my favorite so far. The suspense is tight throughout almost the entire book. You get a possible explanation of what may have caused most of the world's population to die. The Zombies are more violent than ever, and the feeling of despair is at an all time high. Then the mood changes, there may be hope!These books wouldn't be my first choice in the Zombie genre, but they are entertaining. The story does lure you into wanting to know how it all ends. I have read the first three in the series and plan to read all five books."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"If you breath to loud, it will piss of the rotting bags of flesh, They are not anything you would want to mess with, Mr. Moody takes an idea of something you want, and punches you right in your face, These are not Zombie's, but more of a Viral Pandemic, A race for time, that just would not stop. Thank's! Because of this book, i sleep with one eye open and closer to the edge of insanity.On another note, it's a great read, But you should pick up the first one's and the last few...Do it, i dare you!"},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"David Moody, Autumn: Purification (Infected Books, 2004)The third entry in Moody's popular Autumn quartet, Purification picks up where The City left off, with the survivors being driven out of the military base by hordes of the (still not flesh-eating!) dead and scrambling to find some place more permanent to make their last stand.Simply by dint of the fact that Moody's not bouncing back and forth between two unrelated storylines, Purification starts off stronger than The City, and the momentum keeps up throughout the book. The undead continue to evolve, which keeps both the survivors and the reader guessing, and the human relationships between the main characters evolve, as they should. (The minor characters are, for the most part, still cardboard cutouts, however.) The ending does put one in mind of another novel whose ghost has shadowed the entire series, but I figured that was going to be the case.Quite enjoyable. ***"},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"Overall I recommend this series of books for those who like zombie stories. I've read all four and have enjoyed each one.However, I do have a few issues.1. David Moody should do a little more research on modern military technology. The military does possess protective suits like those used by the soldiers in his books. However, they protect only against a chemical attack. They do not filter out airborne biological agents. Bacteria is just too small. Viruses are even smaller. You would probably have to carry your own air supply. While it might be possible that the government anticipated this event and created suits customized for this particular bioligical agent, I just had a hard time buying it.It seems like the survivors are mostly idiots. I can think of a number of ways to fight the zombies that were never even tried in the book.1. Your in an airfield or some other enclosure and there are so many zombies around that it is difficult to get in an out without letting loads of them in. What do you do?a. Create a \\"zombie lock.\\" Think of an air lock on a space ship. You have an smaller enclosed area around the entrance to your large enclosed area. You can use fencing or just create a circle of cars. When you need to let someone in or out, have a crew of guys with baseball bats at the ready. You open the get and let your people out/in. When that happens many of the zombies are going to get in as well. Your bat boys jump in and start smashing skulls while you close the gate. Any zombies that get in are contained in the zombie lock. Then your bat boys kill them all. If there are really lots of them, get .22 rifles and pistols and start shooting them in the head to bring their numbers down.b. When the number of zombies surrounding your safe haven get too numerous, send out people in tough vehicles to simply do laps around the perimeter while mowing them down. Sure this will make a lot of noise, but I bet you could kill them faster then they could show up.c. Create a diversion. The zombies are attracted to noise and activity, so have a brave crew of people set up a noise maker at a location farther away but still within earshot. Put a CD player with fresh batteries on a roof top of a nearby building. Have the player loop so it will go on constantly. This will draw the zombies away from you and toward the distraction. Then you can get in your vehicle and start mowing them down.2. You want a safe haven where you can have food and water as well as the conveniences of the pre-catastrophe world without having to worry about getting trapped by too many zombies.a. How about a boat? Go to the coast, or even a large lake or a large river and get in a house boat. Go a short distance from shore and drop your anchor. You can stock the boat with all the food and water and fuel you will need for a long time. On board you will have electricity, running water, flush toilets and safety. If you are close to shore you can expect the zombies to gather at your launch point, but you can just travel to a different harbor to get resupplies. The only real worry is bad weather.b. Just keep moving. There is pleny of gas and vehicles. Do what Mike and Emma did and get a motor home and travel the country. Camp in remote locations and when there are too many zombies around, just step on the gas. Not as good as the boat idea because you will have to be very quiet whenever you stop for a while, but still workable."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"So much to like! real people in coping and caring situations, so different from the \\"Friends\\" mentality. from the beginning, we saw michael and emma...just...keep...going. ordinary people, not combat warriors, not horny teens, nor secret scientists (have i hit all the usual genre heroes?), who do their often pitiful best. this volume showed the hopeless longing for the past that dogs us all--and WE will have another orange, a new movie, chocolate. But they won't, and the \\"realistic\\" ending totally works for me. I'm picking up the other series NOW."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"This book continued exactly where \\"Autumn: The City\\" left off. I was afraid at first that the cast of survivors would be stuck in that underground bunker for the whole book. Thankfully, Moody has grown as a writer. The first \\"Autumn\\" I thought was awful - slow, repeated dialogue, etc. But this was really good. There was plenty of action, gore and suspense. I liked the irony of the soldier's dilemma outside of the bunker. The character development could have been expanded, but it was enough to keep me captivated. Overall, I enjoyed reading this and picked up the next book immediately."},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"I've been a Moody fan for some time now, and I must say that each book he writes gets better and better. This is definately NO EXCEPTION. I read this book in spurts in about a week, and it was aggravating because i DID NOT want to put it down. Bust schedule prevented me from finishing it in one sitting. Moody continues his brilliant epic tales of the survivors of the apocaylpse and creates a mood in the story so deep and creepy, it will leave you looking over your shoulder for days to come. I reccomend this book to ANYONE who can read and likes the crap scared out of you. Excellent job Mr. Moody, I look forward to your next ones!"},{"Title":"Autumn: Purification","review":"David Moody has become one of those authors who I can't get enough of. The third book in his Autumn series is no exception. It picks up with the Survivors safely inside an army bunker but of course, that doesn't last. After finding out there is another group of survivors and they are clearing an island so they can live without fear of the dead they make a break for it to join them in their efforts. I try my best not to give spoilers in my reviews so I'll just say the last 50 pages had my heart in my throat the whole time.

I went back to the store to see if he had any other books out that I might like and to my surprise there was not one but two sequels on the shelf, I bought them up write away!

As always, his sentences accelerate through unexpected turns, like one of his favorite old Cadillacs floating just off the ground, its steering wheel in the grasp of a proud owner who imagines the car new and himself rich. But these poems dare more than his earlier work, challenging the reader to ponder as well as see. Talking in the Dark is McNair's first book of new poems in five years. He is a New Hampshireman who has lived in Maine for 11 years. His poetry is deeply rooted in northern New England, but his voice is universally American. This has been his ambition since he published his first book, The Faces of Americans in 1853, 15 years ago. The new book's themes are loss, the struggle against life's limits and love. The love is sensual but sometimes unconventional. In &quot;Why We Need Poetry,&quot; the narrator wonders aloud at 3 a.m., after finishing a wallpapering job in his kitchen, why the cucumber sandwich he is eating tastes so good. The why is unimportant, he decides. What matters is that you're here in the pleasure of the tongue, which continues after you've finished your sandwich, for now you are savoring the talk alone -- how by staring at the band of fluorescent light over the sink or the pattern you hadn't noticed in the wallpaper, you can see where the sentence you've started, line by line, should go. Only love could lead you to think this way . . . And when the light itself grows larger, it's not the next day coming through the windows of that redone kitchen, but you, changed by the hunger for the words you listen to and speak, their taste which you can never get enough of. The sense of affirmation in these lines is the engine of McNair's poetry, the counterforce that lightens the clueless characters who inhabit many of his poems. He writes of lost people with their their ambitions collapsing and their dreams foundering and of old people with their faculties blinking out. He calls up the humiliations of his own dirt-poot childhood, events that eat into the present because they can never be buried or erased. Even the dogs in his poems often find themselves at the mercy of cruel owners. But McNair's characters are redeemed by their humanity. We readers see ourselves and our neighbors in them. We may pause at first to ask ourselves whether we are not captive to the same ironies and illusions that ensnare these characters, but the quesion soon turns into a resigned nod. We, too, crave what we can't have, fall for seven-day diets and lose our great thoughts in mid-sentence. McNair's poetry has always had three defining qualities: down-to-earth subject matter, accessibility and that saving grace, humor. He is a keen observer of the power of the popular American culture to overwhelm old values and a realist, not a sentimentalist, about the rural northern New England that is fading before our eyes. Talking in the Dark is McNair at his best."},{"Title":"Talking in the Dark: Poems","review":"Reading Talking in the Dark is like reading the inarticulate thoughts of your own heart. McNair writes with such eloquence and compassion about the inescapable realities of life that I cried as much with relief as with sadness as I read the poems. His very insistence on the embarrassing limits of our humanness points to what lies beyond it - a connection to ourselves and one another that defies our ability to understand it well enough to hold tightly to it for comfort, but which glimmers on the edge of consciousness, like headlights on the ice-coated telephone wires of &quot;Glass Night.&quot; The poems are written in the clear and simple language of everyday interactions - with an angry step-parent, an elderly relative who's abandoned the strain of an unacceptable reality, the neighbor who hopefully assembles old cars and appliances in the yard, the lover of many years whose very familiarity has a kind of strangeness in it. The mute testimonies of houses, cars, and clothes also appear, allies in the effort to make deals with our individual fates. These poems reveal the ordinary for what it is - an incomprehensible mystery. I highly recommend this book to everyone who struggles to make sense of the confounding mixture of passion, loss, humor, mortality, tedium, pain, and mute love that fills an average life."},{"Title":"Talking in the Dark: Poems","review":"I am searching for Mr. McNair's new book of essays called Mapping the Heart. Does anyone know if it has been published yet? Mr McNair Are you Out there?I missed the New Hampshire Association for Teachers of English conference in Portsmouth. Heard you were great.

It fills in where the Machinery's Handbook falls short. The text is basically (I am oversimplifying) an expanded version of the Shigley McGraw-Hill Machine Design Textbook. My only complaint is that the discussion on the strength of welded joints is missing."},{"Title":"Standard Handbook of Machine Design","review":"I own both Shigley's books on Machine Design, Mechanical Engineering Design (which I would rate 5/5) and this handbook. I find this handbook is very extensive in the topics it covers, just about everything pertaining to Machine Design, but fails to elaborate in many of the key areas. Furthermore, many formulas are presented, but there are not enough examples on their use. My greatest complaint though, has to do with the print, it seems as if I had in my hand a book written out in the 60s. Drawing are dirty and unclear in many situations, tables seem as if they were cutout from another book and pasted here, then photocopied (the first drawing in the book, a man, seems as if it was photocopied on a lousy photocopier from an old newspaper), and the typeface in the graphs is plainly outdated. I understand late J. Shigley is no longer among us, but Mischke should modernize the quality of presentation when deciding to launch new editions. Overall, I recommend Rothbart's handbook over this one."},{"Title":"Standard Handbook of Machine Design","review":"Standard Handbook of Machine Design, 3rd Edition edited by Joseph Shigley, Charles Mischke, Thomas H. Brown (Standard Handbook of Machine Design: McGraw-Hill Professional) The definitive machine design handbook for mechanical engineers, product designers, project engineers, design engineers, and manufacturing engineers covers every aspect of machine construction and operation. The 3rd edition of the Standard Handbook of Machine Design will be redesigned to meet the challenges of a new mechanical engineering age. In addition to adding chapters on structural plastics and adhesives, which are replacing the old nuts bolts and fasteners in design, the author will also update and streamline the remaining chapters.Excerpt: This Third Edition of the Standard Handbook of Machine Design has been completely reorganized as compared to its two previous editions. To bring into focus the needs of the machine design engineer, without the distractions of ancillary material, the number of chapters has been reduced from 50 in the Second Edition to 39. These 39 chapters have been carefully grouped into nine distinct sections, denoted as Parts 1 through 9. These chapter groupings were inspired primarily by a set of eight \\"Machine Design Workbooks,\\" containing much of the material in the First Edition, and published between the First and Second Editions.After a new introductory chapter, \\"Evolution of a Successful Design,\\" the first of nine sections, Part 1, \\"Machine Elements in Motion,\\" presents four chapters on the seemingly endless ways to achieve a desired motion. Kinematics, or the geometry of motion, is probably the most important step in the design process, as it sets the stage for many of the other decisions that will be made as a successful design evolves. Whether it's a self-locking latch you are looking for, a complex cam shape, or an entire gear assembly, the information you need is here in these chapters.Part 2, \\"Machine Elements that Absorb and Store Energy,\\" contains three chapters presenting the classic machine elements: springs, flywheels, clutches, and brakes. Not all designs will have a need for these energy-related devices, but, when appropriate, no other device will do the job.Part 3, \\"Gearing,\\" contains five chapters covering every possible gear type, from basic spur gears to complex hypoid bevel gears sets; the intricacies of worm gearing; and the very versatile and relatively modern power screw designs.Part 4, \\"Power Transmission,\\" contains four chapters directed at the requirements of transferring motion from one rotating axis to another, whether by time-honored belt or chain configurations, or the wide variety of couplings used to isolate and protect downstream machine elements. This is also where the design of shafts, from both a static and dynamic viewpoint, is included.Part 5, \\"Bearings and Lubrication,\\" pulls together in one place the design of many types of roller bearings as well as the design aspects of the classic journal bearing. Bearings could not do their job without lubrication, and lubrication would be lost from most bearings without the proper seals. Traditional and nontraditional designs are presented.Part 6, \\"Fastening, Joining, and Connecting,\\" covers every conceivable type of mechanical fastener. When disassembly is not required, or when maximum strength is needed, then the only solution is a welded connection. All aspects of a welded connection are presented. Many connections must prevent leakage or provide cushioning, so a discussion of seals and their effect on a bolted connection is provided. The mating of parts without prior preassembly can be an important design requirement; therefore, this is where a detailed discussion of fits and tolerances is included.Part 7, \\"Load Capability Considerations,\\" provides the designer with the rules for determining if a particular part will fail. This determination does not have to be a precise calculation, either under static or dynamic conditions, whether the part is acting as a beam or column, but to ignore these fundamental principles is to invitedisaster. This section seemed like the best place to discuss vibration and, just as important, its control.Part 8, \\"Performance of Engineering Materials,\\" brings to bear the science of material behavior, to include the changes that take place during the manufacturing process. Once in service, machine elements are subject to constant wear and the adverse effects of corrosion.Lastly, Part 9, \\"Classical Stress and Deformation Analysis,\\" provides the design engineer with the fundamental formulas for stress, deflection, and deformation, and includes special geometries such as curved elements and special loadings, which are found in cylinders under internal pressure when parts are press fitted.One of the chapters included in the First and Second Editions, \\"Sections and Shapes-Tabular Data,\\" has been provided in this Third Edition as an appendix."},{"Title":"Standard Handbook of Machine Design","review":"Shigley's Book has been in my personal library since I used it in college.I purchased the new edition for the office since my predecessor did not leave much of a reference library.

His quirky nature and that of his family come bubbling out of the pages at you, you'll find it hard not to at least crack a smile. I broke down and bought the hardcover of this book before getting on the plane, and instead of sleeping during an international flight, I was absorbed in Sedaris-world, much to my delight.As much as I enjoyed this, if you are only now beginning to read Sedaris, I would suggest my all-time favorite of his first, ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. This book will introduce you to the people who play a role in his life, plus, in my opinion, it is funnier.Also, if you have never heard him read, it is well worth it to get something of his on audio book. Hearing these stories in his voice is delightful."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"A funny read, good story telling of everyday people and the complexities within a family. The last couple of chapters were especially able to make me laugh stupidly in bed at 1 am."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris cannot write anything that is not anything but fabulous. I especially love his stories about his brother, who is his antithesis. If you read one Sedaris book, you must read them all."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"It's great, in this day and age, to see a book that has been proofread so well that I actually don't give any thought to the editing. That alone makes this book a breath of fresh air, but there's also an ease and purity in the storytelling. I hadn't had a book this size go by so quickly in quite some time.David Sedaris, I feel, is a great guy who hasn't yet found the wonderful life he ought to have. As such, he's easy to identify with--who hasn't thought, \\"If they only understood me and gave me a chance, I'd be able to get all the fabulous things I deserve\\"?Some of the language and imagery I saw while flipping through Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim for the first time troubled me, but I'm glad I read the book anyway. There may be unpleasant concepts in it, but the writing and the author's outlook are so pleasant that they more than override the discomfort a reader feels when experiencing those concepts."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"No. Really. Most \\"funny\\" books I read, just aren't. David Sedaris is the real thing. This is a deeply pleasurable book about family, life, homosexuality, cultural difference, and the incidental details that pass most of us by but in Sedaris' hands are grist to his humor mill.The finest parts of this memoir/cultural investigation concern his family. And Sedaris is cursed/blessed with a family that is stranger than most. His understated prose is delightful and his self-deprecating humor (he visits Ann Frank's house, suffers real-estate envy, and finds another stick with which to beat himself) saves him from accusations of fatuousness.This book made me laugh out loud and envy the lightness of touch that Sedaris brings to everyday tales of family dysfunction."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Although I must take into consideration what others say in that this is one of the more serious of his books, I cannot completely agree because this is the first one I have read in full. I have read parts of Holidays on Ice and Me Talk Pretty One Day, both of which what I have seen are very humorous. David Sedaris is a gifted writer who draws the reader in by expressing his insecurities as a gay man. Most of which who read his works no doubt have some sort of strange habit or lifestyle of which they feel ashamed. Sedaris makes this feel ok, because can anyone really be normal?Born the son of a middle-class \\"normal-looking\\" family, he humorously struggles to keep his sexuality a secret in the mid 1970's. When he finally comes out, he has to deal with not only judgement from others, but being cast away by his father who just could not come to terms with his son's choices. These are some of the things that differ from other of Sedaris' works that I have read. Yet to break the serious mood, the book is punctuated with several funny essays.I thought the strip poker incident was side-splitting as was the housekeeping/porn story. These sorts of essays are what I expected of this book. It is stories like these that make one question normalcy. Most people know of a childhood friend that grows up to be gay. Others might have remarkable run-ins with perverts. Then there are always those thrill-seekers who like to lay naked on animal skin rugs. Then there are still more that face obsessive compulsive disorder. (I have to admit, I am one of those.) No matter how weird your little quirks may be, Sedaris makes it clear that everyone has them, and that is what should be considered normal."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"When David Sedaris is writing about his family, there's not much else funnier. The kooky and wild, strange and bizarre Sedaris family through the eyes of David is utter fun. From childhood stories all the way to the present day, this brand new collection of essays is hilarious.I have both the Audio Book and the hardcover versions. Either edition is enjoyable, although there's something extra special about hearing David read his own stuff. Plus, his take on his brother and dad are great.The funniest essays in the collection are \\"6-8 Black Men\\", \\"Rooster and the Hitchin' Post\\", and \\"Baby Einstein\\". however, there is plenty of other material as well that's just as good. But the above three are the highlights for me.If you're a fan of David Sedaris -- what are you waiting for??? If you're just a casual NPR listener or have heard some of \\"This American Life\\", you should pick this up."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"A few years back, my ex-brother-in-law recommended that I read David Sedaris' \`Me Talk Pretty One Day'. I didn't get the chance, but only months after he recommended that title I came across a copy of \`Naked' so I read that. I don't remember very much from that book, but I do remember that I did like it and I've since listened to some of the chapters on \`This American Life'.Anyway, I just finished reading \`Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim' and I really liked it. I laughed out loud many times. While I mostly enjoy David's stories from his childhood that involve his family life, I liked all of them for the most part. My least favorite chapters, for some reason, were the ones involving Hugh. I don't know why, I guess I just think his other stories are more interesting.From reading other people's reviews on amazon.com I'm seeing that there is some controversy over the content of Dress Your Family. In \`Girl Next Door', David tells how he befriends the nine-year-old girl that lives in the apartment adjacent to his. Sure, he was a twenty-something-single gay man, and she was a little girl. Why does that have to mean that there's an underlying story line of pedophilia? When people, even fans, interpret this story in such a way, I think that is only proving what David expresses in one of the final chapters, \`Chicken in the Henhouse'.On that note, I will say that there was a portion of \`Chicken in the Henhouse' that did strike me the wrong way. I'm sure others noticed it and maybe feel the same way. Others can overlook it as David's natural OCD tendencies. As can I, which is why I'm still a fan of David's and why I really look forward to reading his future works.Of this collection, my favorite chapters had to be: Us and Them (hysterical!), Let it Snow (same!), Ship Shape, Full House (insightful!), Blood Work (ridiculous!), Six to Eight Black Men (insightful!), and Baby Einstein (makes me feel good about my own family!).Here's something else I found interesting. Recently, after watching the movie \`Elf', I went on IMDB.com and found that one of the characters in that movie (Deb) is David's sister, Amy. I also found that there were ties to David's \`Santaland Diaries' in the movie as well. When Buddy is thrown out of the Empire State Building, the security guards tell him to go back to \`Santaland', which he does by going to Gimbel's department store. Once there, he meets a female elf employee whom, not believing what she's seeing asks Buddy, \`Did Crumpet put you up to this?' Crumpet was David's elf name when he worked in Santaland at Macy's years ago. Finding these things out of course led me on a search to find this work, Santaland Diaries. I listened to David's reading of it on \`This American Life'. I highly recommend, if you've never heard this, you should! If you enter David Sedaris into your search engine, you should get a hit for a site called \`The Unofficial David Sedaris Internet Resource'. On it, there are links that allow you to hear David reading many of his works."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Probably the best book yet, which says a ton! Laughed out loud at work, on airplanes, and in the middle of the night while I read this. Pick it up for the holidays so YOUR family will feel normal!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Dress Your Family was the second of Sedaris' books that I read. I absolutely LOVE this book. The great thing about Sedaris' writing is that his stories are both laugh out loud funny as well as personal and touching.Some of my favorite stories from this book would have to be \\"Rooster at the Hitchin' Post\\" and \\"Baby Einstein\\". I think Sedaris is at his peak when he writes about his wacky family and I find those stories the most enjoyable. I think that the stand out story in this book, though is \\"6 to 8 Black Men\\". The first time I heard that story, I was in tears from laughing. No matter how many times I hear it, I still crack up every time.If you are a Sedaris fan, this is a definite MUST read. However, if you have not read any of Sedaris' books before, I suggest you start with Me Talk Pretty One Day, as I feel that book is a better introduction."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"\\"...Still I adopted my mother's attitude, as it allowed me to pretend that not making friends was a conscious choice.\\" So ends the first paragraph of David Sedaris' star achievement, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.Sedaris' writing is not linear, though while his books have no beginning, middle, or end; all of his essays revolve around a central point. Throughout Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, we see Sedaris really look at himself for the first time, realize that money is material, and find that even those who should love you most can turn on you for no appropriate reason. There is no specific setting in this book but Sedaris' life; the main characters are the people he encounters; and the obstacles that he faces are those anyone can relate to. Sedaris is able to connect with the average man because he is the average man, making this book that much more hilarious.Being told to pick your favorite moment out of Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is like being told that although you have a million dollars; you can only buy one thing, so you better make it count. There are just so many things to choose from- Sedaris and his siblings trying to get their youngest sister run over so that their mother will let them in out of the snow; a little misunderstanding between maid services; and even the birth of The Rooster. Despite all of the humor, I would have to choose a slightly more serious moment as the one that affected me most. When Sedaris left college he went back home to live with his parents. After a few months of bumming around and doing drugs, Sedaris' father called him into his office, and kicked him out. When his mother dropped him off at his new apartment, she began to cry. As Sedaris states, \\"I wouldn't know it until a few months later, but my father kicked me out of the house not because I was a bum, but because I was gay.\\"It was difficult to pull a theme from this book, and for a while I wasn't so sure that there was one. A few weeks after I finished the book, I began to think about how people always try to cover up anything ugly, like Sedaris' father kicking him out of the house; and there I had my theme. In the last essay included in this book, \\"Nuit of the Living Dead,\\" Sedaris finds a mouse in his house late at night, and proceeds to drown it in a bucket. Partway through killing it he is interrupted by a man looking for directions. He is, of course, worried about what the man will think of him. However, when the man gets up to the house and looks into the bucket, he does not seem shocked or surprised. After he left with directions, Sedaris walked back out onto his porch and looked at the lifeless animal in the water. As he stared at the floating body he felt the darkness around him, and later wrote: \\"When the sun came up I would bury my dead and fill the empty bucket with hydrangeas, a bit of life and color, so perfect for the table. So pleasing to the eye.\\" As usual, something ugly was being replaced with something beautiful, and once again the illusion that everything was okay was being put up for show.This book will make anyone who reads it laugh, yet due to the hilarity of Me Talk Pretty One Day, I did not find this to be his best humorous achievement. I did however find it to be the one that affected me the most. I have always believed that a book that means something to the author is better than a book that is meant to entertain, which is why I believe that Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is a must-read."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Similar to \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" \\"Dress Your Family...\\" delivers hilarious essays/stories by Sedaris. He has a special talent for storytelling that should tickle any reader or listener. The CD version allows the listener to hear Sedaris imitate family members and other characters making the stories even funnier than in print. I especially enjoyed the live performances and wish there were more. A couple times during the stories, Sedaris comes close to the point of being too explicit for my tastes, but he seems to draw back before ever crossing the line from my perspective. I think he is more self-revealing in these stories than in \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" which adds to the connection with the reader/listener. I don't think Sedaris needs to change what he is doing at all...just keep doing it, because it works superbly and does not get old."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Another collection of essays from a brilliant wit who you know you love to read. It's like I've said in my reviews before. There's no need to review each book when I can just give the author a blanket endorsement and guarantee you'll love whatever you find by the guy. I love it when that happens. I may have annoyed Jan by laughing out loud too often. Sedaris is like that."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is a fantastic book and enjoyable to read. The author does not eliminate nor deny any childhood embarrassing moments, such as playing strip poker. He first refuses to play strip poker knowing he'll be stripped butt naked. He settles in and turns the table and tricks the other boys pretending he knows how to play poker. The stories are so hilarious that you will definitely be amused. There's a chapter called, Auntie Monie who would come to visit a few times in a year. His mother tries to become more comfortable with Auntie Monie foreseeing some inheritance. Then his mother would kick the children outside one winter day locking them out. He's a brilliant comedian and shows it in this book. By the end of the chapter, there will be that one thought that will stick in your mind and make you giggle. Sedaris is a really good story teller and can draw you into his books like never before. The stories are non-stop; you won't be able to put your book down."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If you think your family is weird, or that they live to embarrass you, have faith; there ARE others with more problems than yours. Don't believe me? Listen to David Sedaris' Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim (audiobook) and you'll feel much, much better. Mr. Sedaris openly airs his family's dirty laundry, and does so with biting examples . . . mixed with a healthy helping of humor.This collection of nonfiction short stories starts out with \\"Us and Them\\", which focuses on David's early years growing up next door to a family that didn't own a television. \\"How weird are these people? I mean, where did they get their information from!\\" David exclaims.The narrative short stories go on and on, always about himself, his family, his friends/lovers, and always poignant, funny, or both.My favorite story was \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\", which recounts the history of Saint Nicholas as told in the Netherlands. Did you know that Santa doesn't have elves there? I didn't! Instead, for the past few centuries, he's had six to eight black men helping him out, \\"Which is kind of weird that it's six to eight, considering they've had plenty of time to nail down the exact number.\\" And Santa, according to them, doesn't live at the North Pole. Oh no. He lives in Spain and, if you're bad, is more likely to kick and beat you (or at least pretend to).Although David Sedaris takes swings at his own family and other countries, he's also apt to focus on himself and his native U.S.It is interesting to find out (again, in \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\") that the blind can legally hunt in Michigan and Texas. \\"And, while in Texas it's mandatory for the blind to have a guide, in Michigan they can go it alone. Which begs the question: if they actually kill something, how do they find it after they've shot it?\\"As for himself, Mr. Sedaris isn't afraid to show the reader his own compulsive disorder. He loves to touch people's heads, just as shoppers enjoy stroking suede or some other nice cloth. And with this comes the worry that the general population might find this offensive, especially coming from an openly gay man. This comes into terrible focus when the author helps a twelve-year-old boy carry hot coffee containers up to his room at a hotel, and really, really wants to touch his head.Like Garrison Keillor and his Prairie Home Companion, David Sedaris deserves a place on your bookshelves (or in your car on audiobook). But be warned, while Mr. Keillor's format is more family oriented, Mr. Sedaris holds back nothing - language included. To me, though, this audiobook was perfect."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is another fabulous collection of David Sedaris's inspired tales of the grotesqueries of his family and personal life. The tales touch on truly creepy moments of life -- trying to deal with an obsessive sister; befriending the lonely child next door whose behavior borders on the demonic; the ghoulishness of writing about the process of writing about one's own family; being kicked out of the house for being gay; being \\"Uncle Faggot\\" to the children of one's yahoo younger brother; the macabre turn of giving directions to lost travelers while one is trying to drown a mouse. As always, there is as much pain as there is laughter in Sedaris's writing; as much freakishness as frankness. Always, you often recognize your own story in the excesses of Sedaris's.Most of the stories on the CD were read in Sedaris's sad and tremulous voice. But several stories were taped before audiences. Sedaris perks ups when reading to others, giving his writing a hilarious, naughty edge that does not come across when he reads alone.A caution of sorts: Sedaris's homosexuality is a prominent and vital feature of his personality and his writing. If you don't appreciate that in people, you won't appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"At lunch today as I was finishing this book, my eyes were streaming tears of laughter, my body was shaking, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from whooping out loud. I wasn't entirely successful, and I was a little embarrassed when I literally had to put the book down I was laughing so much, to notice that my fellow diners in the Hong Kong McDonalds were getting almost as much amusement out of me as I got out of Sedaris's tales. I really don't want to give anything away--suffice it to say that although all of the book isn't this outrageously funny, every story has a moment that made me smile. Many of them had moments that made me sad, as well--Sedaris is a master of that little twist right at the end that makes you remember just how frail, how flawed, we all are. And Sedaris is the first to admit, he and his family are more flawed than most. He's willing to be truthful about his flaws, even when he is uncomfortably honest. The message is that none of us are perfect, but we're all worthy of a little attention, a little respect, at the minimum. There are definitely people who won't like this book--homophobes have already proven that with some of the reviews here, as have a few slightly less intellectually gifted people who haven't yet, after three other of Sedaris's books which are collections from other, earlier sources, realised that he doesn't present much if any new material in these books. But if you haven't read The New Yorker scrupulously, and you acknowledge that adults ought to have the right to love other consenting adults, you'll truly enjoy Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"At first I was disappointed at the slower pace of the some of the stories in this collection. By the time I worked my way through half the book, however, I decided it was Sedaris' best work yet. His prose does get stronger with each new book, but this latest one is more quietly introspective, more deeply reflective, and amazingly is so without losing the acid edge that is the hallmark of all his work."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"At first I was a little disappointed by the fact that the stories in this book didn't make me laugh out loud as much as past ones (my favorite is the first one that I read, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;). However, the more that I think about what happened in this book, the more I like it, and I realize that I have to read it again. He can only have so many crazy stories about his family and his life before he has to deal with what it all means. I was really touched by the story about his sister and her parrot, and I don't think &quot;touched&quot; is a word I've ever used in describing one of his stories! If you are a true Sedaris fan, you will enjoy this book; just be prepared that you might not pee your pants laughing this time."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Holy cow he's done it again. I literally need to stop and gather myself from my hysterics. David Sedaris makes my dysfunctional family look like the Brady Bunch! Don't even second guess this purchase."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I never read anything like this before. It's very funny as well. I wish to collect all of his publications."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The witty and dry humor of David Sedaris is once again present in this light hearted book. I was reading it on the plane and found myself going from a serious face, to a grin to bursting out in laughter while other passengers looked on wondering what was the reason behind it all. If only they knew... Great book!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Most of this audio version of Sedaris' book is recorded in a studio with only a few tracks recorded live (oxymoron, I know) in front of an audience. Sedaris does well in a sound booth reading his manuscript, better than most authors reading thier own work, but it lacks the energy, inflection, and comedic timing of his presentations in front of an audience.However, considering the relatively serious nature of these stories maybe a flat reading is more appropriate. (A \\"relatively serious\\" Sedaris story is still pretty kooky and funny.) The stories where he does his brothers voice are great just for the performance, but the story with his sister and the parrot is worth the price of admission.My wife has only read Sedaris, never heard him, and was horrified at the idea of hearing this audio book. \\"I don't wanna know what he sounds like.\\" I think Sedaris is one of those authors who sounds different from how his prose reads on the page, if that makes sense...The CD is slightly abridged, missing a few stories, where the audio cassettes have everything."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I wonder if my wife and I read the same book. It is a series of anecdotes from Mr. Sedaris' life. My wife found it funny and light and I found it weird and depressing. Overall, it is well written and draws you in. Whether you like what you see when you get there depends on your point of view."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Some of the stories in this book were a bit out of line. For example \\"Blood Work\\" was when a guy calls the wrong cleaning service, mistaking Sedaris's services for an erotic cleaning service. It is disgusting to even think about this obese sweaty man pleasuring himself in the company of Sedaris. My personal favorite story is \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\", basically a collection of interesting facts from all the places Sedaris has visited. For some of their traditions he sees no point in them, and recognizes the opportunity to poke fun. If you're looking for a humorous book, then this would be a good buy. It doesn't get too boring, and has a lot of variety since it has 22 different stories. This is a book that you can pick up 3 months after your first read and still laugh out loud at. Although I may have to warn you; the Sedaris family is far from normal."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"okay, i loved most of this book. sedaris is, in my opinion, the best essay writer of our era. what i loved about \\"DENIM\\" was how, as children, the author and his sisters knew the theraputic value of a good cry. hilarious. and the brother paul is just an all-too-familar slice of suburban life. but all the mention of sweat... ick... c'mon, just creepy. nonetheless, i will happily be passing this book on to a certain suburban mother of a ten year-old boy with vase full of cat tails (pg 165) in his room (and possibly scotchguarded drapes). maybe she'll finally get it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Dress Your Family In Corduroy And Denim is an audiobook anthology of personal essays on five CDs. Playwright and National Public Radio commentator David Sedaris offers glimpses into the absurd non sequitirs that abound in everyday life, just beneath the surface of what is considered respectable and proper. Read by the author with wit and charm, Dress Your Family In Corduroy And Denim elevates arguing to a higher art form and provokes serious contemplation on the mysteries of dailly existence. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim was an amazing novel written by David Sedaris. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. The humor was never ending. He took real life stories and told them bluntly with a humor that not many authors can match. The randomness of the novel was what made the novel unique. He talked about the little things in life rather than the big. He told about his family relationships, finding his sexuality, and growing up. The continuous culture shock that is David Sedaris's life was intriguing and hilarious. If you like roll on the floor comedy you will love Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris.By: Kassie Forman"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The Sedaris clan have easily transmorgified into the Glass family of the Post-ironic set. Between Amy's raucous television appearances and David's inimitable readings these two are quickly becoming the Franny and Zoe, the Ernie and Dodi, the Kukla and Ollie for the clued-in readers/viewers with a taste for the absurdly hilarious. ANY creation these two produce, either independently or in tandem, is sure to delight. Buy it all: read repeatedly."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is the first book I've read by Sedaris. Yes, it's very good, and I laughed out loud several times. But is it monumental? No. It's simply a good read. I found his essays of his childhood much more substantial and memorable than those of his adult life, maybe because I could relate events in his childhood to mine. I guess I need to read some of his earlier works to truly see where his avid following comes from."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The reason I give this audiobook 4 stars is that there are only 2 live performances, when 4 are advertised - 6 to 8 Black Men is live, as is Rooster at the Hitchin' Post, but neither Who's the Chef? nor Repeat After Me are live (the latter two are advertised as live in the copyright section on the back). Still, this audiobook is immensely worth it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have read Six to Eight Black Men again and again. I laugh every single time. Great wit, great for a rainy day. I just started Naked and feel the same!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I loved all of his earlier books, but this one struck a particular chord with me. It's not that it was funny -- it was. Hilarious, as usual. It's not that it was personal. Again, as always. It's that an already wonderful writer is improving -- before our very eyes. The ending scene in the parrot-sister story is about the best thing he's ever done. Funny and personal and, dare say, literary. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If you've never heard David Sedaris tell a story, you should go to thisamericanlife.com or npr.org and listen to some of his audio files, because they are so much more enjoyable to read when you can hear his voice in your head.My least favorite in this collection is Rooster at the Hitchin' Post, but even it is funny. It would be hard to pick a favorite, but if I had to, I might choose The End of the Affair - a funny and beautiful love story about long-term relationships.I found some of the reviewers' comments about Six to Eight Black Men interesting. A writer from Turkey was offended by this story because \\"(Sedaris) wouldn't want to believe that St. Nick is from Turkey and that we wouldn't appreciate him here.\\" But that is what makes the story funny - we are all prejudiced in favor of the ideas we grew up with. The stereotypical American tends to believe that the USA is the center of the universe, and Sedaris is poking fun of that very quality in himself - it's called satire, people!And when Sedaris writes that \\"the average white American ... would barricade the doors\\" against 6-8 black men, this is not a statement of prejudice against black people, rather it is a pointed criticism of the white people who feel this way.According to the dictionary, satire is \\"a literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn\\"; it is \\"used to expose and discredit vice or folly.\\" I guess this type of humor isn't for everybody, but for those who understand and enjoy it, David Sedaris is a master."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris has mentioned his family members in his previous books, but this one really puts the spotlight on his mother, father, sisters and brother. It's full of humor, pathos, and I dare to you read it and not be touched."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The next one is better than the last one... true humor, true insight, real life at its finest. Anyone who can not see SOMEONE they know in at least one of Sedaris' characters is obviously not aware of the world or the people around them. Once again, a pleasure to read... and re-read!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris broke into the big time with his bestseller Me Talk Pretty One Day, which does deliver more laugh-out-loud moments in a strictly quantitative sense, but Dress Your Family offers even more insight into the lives of the weird and wacky Sedaris clan. We're also treated to more time with David's boyfriend Hugh. No review can accurately portray the witticisms of a master humorist such as Sedaris, but allow me to provide one short quote: [p. 140] \\"Real love amounts to withholding the truth, even when you're offered the perfect opportunity to hurt someone's feelings.\\" Read this book now!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I came to this book never having read any previous Sedaris works, only having infrequently caught him on NPR and more frequently, in interviews. As I started it, I thought, hmmm, well-observed, another quirky baby boomer suburban childhood explored, lots of wry humor . . . . and then the aggregation of sketches began to sink in. In the end, DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM has the rich texture of a novel, with an identifiable exposition, climax and conclusion. It exercises metaphor and technique, draws the major \\"characters\\" and the \\"extras\\" who stray into his lens exquisitely. It works all the conventions of storytelling to deliver an original vision on the themes of family interrelationships, communication and what we mean when we talk about being \\"normal.\\" It delivers some laugh-out loud passages, though irony mostly rules the day. Often what he leaves unsaid is evocative as well.The pieces collected in DRESS YOUR FAMILY were published in various media in the past, though they flow as if continuously written just for this book. Sedaris may be writing from France these days, as a gay man who grew up in a large and not always conventional family, but he says volumes about American family dynamics and middle-class mores."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Having read several of his works in the past...I found this most disappointing. I was anticipating a climax that never occured..."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Another excellent collection of stories from David Sedaris. Every collection of his reminds me of how funny everyday life can be. Highly recomended for anyone with siblings, travels and has worked a minimum wage job. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've read half of this book and already know that I love it. It bothers me that everyone tries to label David Sedaris as a \\"humor writer\\" and then come to only expect him to churn out \\"humor books.\\" Sure the books are funny, but a lot of his writing is deeper and serves a more significant purpose than trying to make someone laugh. Also, I like how he is a \\"gay writer\\" who doesn't just fit into the cookie-cutter by writing \\"gay stories.\\" He branches out...and he loves to explore the psychological implications of situations from his past. Overall, buy this book, and buy Barrell Fever, and expect to laugh, a lot, but don't approach Sedaris's writing as you would, say, Bozo the Clown's work."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Not funny. Mildly entertaining, at best. I found myself just wanting to be done with the book already. Sedaris was a genius with &quot;Naked.&quot; Nothing else he has done compares--and &quot;Corduroy and Denim&quot; just takes him further away."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I loved most of Me Talk Pretty One Day, so after reading that, this has been a disappointment. I actually agree with one reviewer that a lot of the stories are &quot;icky.&quot; Maybe he's running out of subject matter, and so is straining to find humor in some unpleasant and/or bizarre memories. To call Anne Franks' family's hiding place &quot;adorable&quot;? Oh, please. I think the only LOL essay in the whole collection is &quot;Six to Eight Black Men.&quot; Sedaris has been very prolific, so maybe he just needs a long break to refill his creative well."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I am one of those serious David Sedaris fans. His other books including Me Talk Pretty One Day and Naked are the type of books that make you laugh out loud on a crowded bus. After anticipating this book for weeks, it was not the constant riot I was expecting. The last chapter was great but other than that I only had one chuckle and a few smiles, which compared to other books is great but compared to other David Sedaris books is a let down. Still a fan though."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Some excellent stories near the beginning of the book, but there was creepy/questionablecontent toward the end of the book that I guess we were supposed to think was funny?I was left wishing I hadn't bought the book and would not buy from this writer again."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I found this book disturbing and am grateful to have listened to my instinct and read it before giving as a gift to a niece."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Comic writer David Sedaris writes about his family, his neighbors, his village in France, trying to drown an unfortunate mouse, his gig as a house-cleaning professional, and much more. Memories that most of us would repress--too embarrassing, too horrific, too humuliating even to think about--become his material. Much of the book deals with his struggles about being gay, or dealing with his obsessional disorder. You can see the humor, and you can also feel what it cost the author.I was told that Sedaris would be side-splitting funny, and in fact there are a number of funny moments and a few really good laughs. Mostly though the tone of the book is sad, poignant, almost painful to read. Author David Sedaris writes extremely well and makes the most unbelievable episodes feel, well, believable.So, if you like outrageous humor with an undertone of deep sadness, you will probably enjoy Corduroy And Denim. I recommend it, but it's not for everyone. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"So. David Sedaris.Well, let's be clear. Nobody with a funnybone can hate David Sedaris. And neither do I. But it has to be said - this last book (\\"Dress your family in corduroy and denim\\") was a disappointment. Judging by the number of people showing up for his readings here in San Francisco, and its lengthy sojourn on The New York Times bestseller list, it obviously did pretty well commercially. And, based on the enormous amount of accumulated goodwill from his earlier books, I don't begrudge DS his commercial success. Not one bit.Well, OK. Maybe just a little bit. Because, for the first time, in this collection, we see clear indications that Sedaris is bumping up against his limitations. How so? I think it's because Sedaris is at his best when he writes from the point of view of slightly marginalized outsider. In his earlier stuff, he was poor, he's gay and he managed to achieve a tone of bemusement in reporting what went on around him that was completely hilarious. In the face of increasing commercial success, the edge that was conferred by his being poor became harder to maintain. But he and his boyfriend moved to France, thereby achieving automatic outsider status, and Sedaris was able to mine this for comedy gold. His accounts of misadventures while learning French are truly funny, and credit must be given for the way in which he makes the comedy seem so effortless. But that's his previous book \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\".Problem is, the whole 'marginalized outsider' position seems less and less tenable for an author whose books spend months on the best seller list. Similarly, after a few years in France, the forces of assimilation are bound to cut down on the number of amusing misunderstandings funny enough to be worth writing about. This leaves one other area which Sedaris has mined fruitfully in previous books - anecdotes about his family. Indeed, the majority of the stories in this latest collection are family-based anecdotes. However, the stories in this collection do not come close to matching the wit and poignancy of those in earlier books, suggesting that this vein of inspiration may be close to being tapped out. Hardly surprising - any author would lead with the funniest material; this collection has occasional flashes of wit, but never reaches the 'laugh-out-loud' quality of the earlier books. Several pieces in this collection (describing his brother's wedding, his job one summer at the State Fair) are downright pedestrian, and a couple of pieces just fall flat - ruminations about apartment-hunting while visiting the Anne Frank house, accounts of visits with two of his sisters, whose feelings about being featured as bit-players in this, or subsequent collections are decidedly mixed. It's to Sedaris's credit that he too is ambivalent on this point, but his soul-searching on the issue doesn't make for interesting reading.One of Yeats's later poems is called \\"The Circus Animals' Desertion\\"; in it, he bemoans the fact that the themes which inspired him early in his career have lost their inspirational power. \\"Dress your family in corduroy and denim\\" supports the notion that David Sedaris may be experiencing similar difficulties. But don't count him out yet. His previous books established Sedaris as a hilarious, extremely talented writer. Anyone can have one mediocre book. Let's hope he will leave it at that."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is probably one of my favorite writers. He manages to make situations that are just plain odd into wonderful stories that make me laugh every time I read any of them. There are times where certain events seem very unlikely but they only add to the hilarity and they aren't crazy enough to take away from the main idea. The poker game scene seems a bit embellished along with a few others although I absolutely loved reading every story. The little side notes he adds in about what's happening are wonderfully placed. The way he presents the material in the book always makes me want to read more. The only time I could make myself stop reading was after a story had ended. This story focuses a lot on his dysfunctional family and it is scary that he considers himself the normal one. I loved the variety of stories and situations he chooses to express such different people and events in his life. His use of subtext is flawless and makes the reader feel smart and like they're in on one of his secrets when they pick up on it. His story about the \\"popular crowd\\" and his dad was hysterical. No matter how awkward or risqu&eacute; a topic he's talking about might be, he always finds a way to mention it politely or add a funny spin on it. The story about not wanting to share his Halloween candy is something everyone who ever went trick-or-treating can relate to and that's why it was so funny. It was during that scene in which I received many glares from Starbucks patrons as I laughed out loud to myself. This book was absolutely fantastic and I would highly recommend reading it, especially if you enjoyed any of his other books."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris is a funny man!! The desription of him and his stories as laugh out loud funny is right on the mark. I would have appreciated a heads up on the graphic nature of some of his tellings, though. I bought two of hese books as gifts...I felt I needed to apologize to the one recipient who received the book before I read it myself...the other one was never given...I was too embarrassed by the the raw sexual nature of several of Sedaris' musings. So be ready to laugh out loud but keep ready, ready to hide your eyes...I would strongly suggest a read through BEFORE you decide to gift this one."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"While admittedly this book is not at absurdly hilarious as Mr. Sedaris' other works, I believe he more than compensates for that with a great deal of what one reviewer quite accurately called thoughtfulness. Each essay takes a look at one particular aspect of being a family, or maintaining a relationship, or trying to come to some sort of grips with another human mind in all its bizarre intricacies. The essay as a structure is particularly suited to Mr. Sedaris' intention in this regard: the shortness of the form allows him to illuminate something and delicately provoke an unusual thought -- for example, that Anne Frank's neighbor might have turned in her family to the Nazis to get their hands on her apartment -- and then, instead of bludgeoning said point to death, the book moves on to another, equally interesting, equally delicate revelation. Very refreshing reading."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is more introspective and thoughful than his others, at times it is sad. It still made me laugh, but also made me almost cry. He reminds me most of Lynda Barry, who also manages to show human cruelty and frailty with not only humor but also non-judgemental compassion and even love. Not everyone will be able to relate to essays and stories that lay bare the human heart in such a raw way. In particular \\"The Girl Next Door\\" was so moving and hard to read, I keep thinking of it and wondering what happend to that girl, and also reflecting on what is motherhood? His changing view of his own mother is so deep and real. It's hard to look at things that most people would rather not see. But this is precisely why he is an artist and not just your average funny guy. The ability to see below the surface, to look and not turn away, to be honest, to sit on that edge between funny and troubling, is what makes him great. I suspect it has something to do with the use of pot and other hallucinogens. :-) Anyway, David, don't be too hard on yourself. I love you, we love you, because, while you can make us laugh so hard we nearly pee our pants, your \\"meanest flowers\\" \\"give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.\\""},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book made me laugh and laugh.

It's not necessary to hear him in order to enjoy his books. But if you do hear him, you can read his stuff with the sound of his delivery echoing inside your head and laugh even more. A little 'rude' for sensitive folks, but certainly he is one of the best resources of humor in the last century--at least."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have read everything of David Sedaris's that I could lay my hands on.

Basically he commits to print many of the faults that we are all guilty of but too embarrassed to make public. He's a pain in the ass but knows it and that's why i love him."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris and his whole family are crazy in the most delightful way.

No surprises, just a product that is as you would expect."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I read this book for my book club. I read one of Sedaris' books years ago and didn't enjoy it very much, but decided that maybe that one was just maybe one that wasn't \\"me\\". Well, after this book, I've decided Sedaris and his stories and humor, just aren't \\"me\\".I listened to this as an audio book, read by Sedaris. He reads/speaks pretty monotone, which isn't that entertaining to me. Honestly, I probably would have given this book 2/5 stars except for the fact that the audio version had a few \\"chapters\\" that were live \\"performances\\" for Sedaris, and hearing the audiences reactions and applause let me know when things were supposed to be funny.Sedaris' stories just seem strange and odd to me. He does not seem like someone I would want to be around or talk with, let alone read about. Quite a few times, his stories were not even funny...it was just the way he delivered it in reading that was amusing. I'm not sure if I had read it in print if I would have found any of it funny."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I do not read porn. I do not want to read porn.

Another Sedaris classic filled with short stories that capture your attention."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is an absolutely hysterical writer and this book does not disappoint. His stories are always quirky but yet truthful and make me laugh out loud. The only thing better than reading a story he has written is listening to the audio version of it b.c there is just something about his slightly annoying voice that makes the stories sing."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I just finished this book and can not wait to get started with the next one.

Much appreciated!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The stories in this book will make you laugh out loud.

Maybe I was spoiled by the sidesplitting hilarity of the other two. While this one was good, it was not as good as the other two I mentioned. I laughed occasionally, but not the coughing, gagging, stomach cramp inducing laughter of the other two. Worth picking up, but do not expect the same laughs as the other two I mentioned. it also has a different feel than the other two. Slightly more mocking of some of his siblings and yet sometimes I sensed he was giving voice to a heretofore unexpressed love or admiration. Odd. I saw some readers seriously dislike his dad. I bet that is not what he was going for. I could be wrong."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I read that someone was on a plane and reading David Sedaris and she was laughing out loud.

Looking forward to reading more by him."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was a gift to my boyfriend who loves the work of David Sedaris. He didn't enjoy book as well as some of David's other works, but it was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris is great, as usual. I think he's also a one to two-trick pony and is ever so much more enjoyable on audio than on the printed page."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Most of the stories are well written, but most are introspective and not all that funny. I wanted to laugh like I did reading me talk pretty one day."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"There are parts of this book that are very funny in a way that only Sedaris is capable of.But some disturbing tendencies are starting to creep in to his writing. Some of these pieces have \\"a message\\" and Sedaris makes them very obvious -- and the spectre of self-importance is looming (a few times, instead of just saying \\"I was in a particular city...\\", he finds it necessary to make the unnecessary point that he is in a particular location to give a lecture, which, as it has nothing to do with the story most of the time, seems to be added just to try to impress us). Not a good sign, if it continues.But the book is enjoyable, although not as much as his previous works."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Why is this book on a best-sellers list? I had to literally force myself to finish it, and was gravely disappointed. The writing is poor, filled with metaphors that just don't work. The reviews on the back cover also claim that it is \\"hilarious\\"? I'm sure they didn't actually read the book. So for anyone who wants a good autobiographical book, read Augusten Burroughs, Running With Scissors, Dry, and Magical Thinking; David Sedaris doesn't even compare to Burroughs."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"how many autobiographies is david going to write??? It is getting to be pretty repetitive."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Again David Sedaris has written a book that is charming, funny, wry, and points out the frailty of the human condition. That aside, get this book to read about his brother, Paul. Who doesn't want to have a beer with the Rooster? I read to my boyfriend the story about the rooster getting married, and he couldn't stop laughing, and this morning asked the name of the &quot;disease&quot; Paul acquired when he gained weight, and then proceeded to laugh himself silly as he went to the car. My only disappointment is that I've seen David Sedaris read twice, and some of the stories I had already heard, so it wasn't all new material. Also, the 6-8 black men story is on the Carnegie Hall CD. I was hoping for all new material, because I enjoy it so much! Definitely worth getting. I'd bet a dollar the town near Manchester, NH, he went to is Plymouth, NH, but if I'm wrong, I'd love to be corrected!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I guess I expected humor. Instead, it was a downer. I made it thru about a third of the book and gave up."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"How very deceiving the other reviews have been! I wonder if the author or his friends posted them. I read them and bought the book thinking it might offer a humorous side on the everyday life of Americans...I was very disappointed. I could not even smile. Grotesque, in some parts ourtight disgusting...miserly low class American life...at its worst. No wonder the author moved to Paris, although I do not doubt that \\"the city will always follow him\\"... If he has read the Greeks, he will know whom I am referring to....Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I smell a winner with this one if i may say so myself, some really good stuuf here!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"After reading an essay by David Sedaris online and liking it, I checked out this book from the library. I was eagerly anticipating an enjoyable read. Unfortunately, while going through a few of the essays I found them to be-as I see others have pointed out-very vulgar; so I stopped. If it weren't for his inclusion of such lurid sexual and profane content-content that detracts from the author's talent-it's possible I would enjoy his work."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I enjoy David Sedaris's writing. It is smart, funny, and due to his radio appearances I can always hear his voice reading the essays. Not only are the tales of his family and his life with Hugh funny but they always contain kernels of truth that everyone can relate to.I was sorry I had to miss Sedaris's recent appearance in Madison, maybe next time."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"My first experience with David Sedaris was \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" I read it as a part of my book club. I loved it immediately. So next I bought \\"Naked,\\" which somehow surpassed \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" in hilarity! I was at the grocery store when I noticed a copy of \\"Dress Your Family in Denim and Corduroy\\" which I immediately bought. I loved it, loved it, loved it. It's every bit as funny as the others, but with a little bit of poignancy too. It was a fantastic read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Having read all of David Sedaris' previous books, when this one caught my eye I did the happy dance in the middle of Borders. I read it quickly and savored every bit of it. This book will make you laugh out loud, but does not compare to his previous books.Also, if you get the chance to see him read live, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I wanted to like this book. It is intelligently written, insightful, and humorous. The author's shrill, mean-spirited stories however, made me unable to recommend the book. I think we all know this guy from college. The smart, witty one who seemed like a lot of fun at first but grew so tiresome you wanted to run away from. Remember him? The one with those insightful comments about everyone. The negative comments about everyone that grew mean when he wouldn't stop. The guy who had something bad to say about everything and everyone. By second semester you would try to avoid being around this guy. By the second chapter, you'll want to avoid this book.Another theme that grated me was the \\"I'm a victim\\" theme. He's gay (so what), his mother was an alcoholic, his father distant, his childhood was unpleasant because he was a geek, etc .. etc... Join the club dude! Stop feeling sorry for yourself and move on.Finally, his insensitive portrayal of his sister who lives in squallier and collects trash for a living. It's not funny dude, she needs help. She is mentally ill, not colorful and silly. I would dread your visits too."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book has been on my stack of \\"to read\\" books for ages, and I finally got around to it. He's quirky and sarcastic, but overall I found the essays depressing and disturbing. I didn't find him or his family all that interesting. When he moved toward the more outwardly comedic, he also became more crude. It's certainly not at all flattering to his family or others who find their way into his stories. I'm sorry I bought it - wish I'd just borrowed it from the library!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Unfortunately, I am one of those readers who feels compelled to finish every book they start. I say unfortunately because I picked up \\"Dress Your Family...\\" and started reading it based on my experience with Mr. Sedaris' other novels. His wanderings through his childhood were less than engaging - possibly because they were no more or less interesting than most of my own. In fact I have a couple of friends with truly exciting childhoods whom I can recommend before he writes his next book. I believe Mr. Sedaris may have squeezed the last ounce of interest out of his family history in previous books."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book was a big disappointment. I became a huge fan of Sedaris' work after reading \\"Naked\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" Both those books were hilarious and, sometimes, even touching. After thoroughly enjoying his prior work, I anxiously awaited his next. Unfortunately, \\"Dress Your Family\\" does not even come close to the standard set by his earlier books.In this book, instead coming across as the witty, insightful goof that often says what most of us wish we could 1) actually think of to say; and 2) have the nerve to say, he now comes across as just negative, petty, and bitter. Unlike his prior books, I did not find myself agreeing with Sedaris' insights, but instead feeling more like I just wanted to shake him and tell him to stop being negative and such a jerk. In his earlier books Sedaris came across as a man who loves his family but is able to point out there various quirks. In this book, he is so negative about everything regarding his family, it really does not appear he likes them very much and that they do not like him.Moreover, whereas Sedaris previous gave us humorous insights into his family -- to such a degree the reader could actually feel as though he was a part of Sedaris' family or at least that he likes Sedaris' family -- in \\"Dress Your Family\\" Sedaris' focus on the negative becomes just depressing and provides none of the warm, fuzzy feelings about his family. When Sedaris writes about his mother's dying, his sister-in-law's inability to have additional children, his sister's inability to hold a job, the reader does not laugh along with his family, but instead just gets bummed out.A couple of the stories in the book are still quite funny -- \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" for example -- but as a whole, the book was not funny. I did actually laugh out loud several times while reading \\"Naked\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty.\\" Such was not the case with \\"Dress Your Family.\\" Perhaps Sedaris has already used up all his amusing life stories in his earlier works and all that are left are the downers.My advice, read his earlier work. THAT work you will enjoy. I doubt you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"What's it like for David Sedaris to carry a cup of coffee? You'll find the answer to this question and countless boring others in this labored book. I like Sedaris for his honesty and unique observations, but he reaches a bit with DYFCD. I mean, c'mon, writing about what's it's like to write about your family? He's become too self aware, a tad self-indulgent and actually a little pompous (&quot;Their accents were from Sweden, or maybe Denmark...&quot; -- Gimme a break.) There are a few fresh touches, especially the latest on his brother."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The last book I read had such a shoddy ending that when I completed the very last sentence I threw the book across the room and dwelled on it for two years, not reading a single book since. I am happy to report that David Sedaris's Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim has won me back to the world of reading. This collection of short essays about his family, neighbors, and total strangers is laugh-out-loud hysterical."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The theme behind David Sedaris's latest collection is brilliantly simple: everybody's family is wacked-out...but only he is ruthless/unfeeling/blunt enough to drag his family into the limelight, revealing their private weirdness for anyone to see (even when they beg, plead, and command him not to - and he writes about that, too). \\"Oh, the stories I could tell,\\" you say, rolling your eyes knowingly, in reference to a quirky family member - but you don't. David Sedaris does; that's why he's rich and famous, and you are not. It should be noted, however, that the author enjoys a hefty natural advantage: as it turns out, his family really is weirder than most.In \\"The Ship Shape,\\" Sedaris skewers his family's pretensions to summerhouse splendor - and how his father's legendary cheapness destroys their dream. After years of sun-worshiping vacations in rental houses, Sedaris's father proposes buying a beach house of their own. Though they should know better, the family believes him, and gets caught up in the whirlwind of beach house excitement. They practice nonchalantly dropping \\"my home - well, one of my homes\\" into conversation, and compile a list of whimsical, nautical beach house names. Ultimately, of course, they're crushed with disappointment, as their father rethinks the expense, and the imaginary summer home gets shaved down to a bar in the basement. (This is where my father would have said, \\"Don't get your hopes up, and you won't be disappointed.\\")\\"Full House\\" follows a young David Sedaris forced into attending his first all-boys sleepover. Well aware that traditional male pastimes (cars, sports, girls) are of no interest to him, the author correctly predicts that he's in for a night of misery. For hours, the host's dorky parents dominate the party, trying with pathetic enthusiasm to be cool. But once they retire, the evening takes on an even darker aspect, as cards are brought out and strip poker proposed. Terrified of, ahem, exposure in a roomful of handsome, scantily-clad teens, Sedaris is forced to take desperate measures to avoid a lifetime of persecution. Can he successfully masquerade as a regular guy for the duration of the sleepover? Well, of course not. But it's funny to watch him fail.\\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" starts off as a cursory examination of cultural differences, but quickly gets down to its real subject matter: the fact that in the Netherlands, Santa is accompanied, not by elves, but by a team of, yes, six to eight black men. This piece contains my favorite passage of the entire book: \\"The six to eight black men were characterized as personal slaves until the mid-1950s, when the political climate changed and it was decided that instead of being slaves they were just good friends. I think history has proved that something usually comes between slavery and friendship, a period of time marked not by cookies and quiet hours beside the fire but by bloodshed and mutual hostility.\\" Ho, ho, ho!\\"Blood Work\\" involves a situation we've all found ourselves in: unknowingly being summoned to perform erotic housecleaning in a stranger's apartment for money. As the homeowner's behavior becomes progressively weirder, Sedaris struggles to retain an air of normality (and finish cleaning the apartment); because the author is who he is, it doesn't even occur to him to either punch the guy in the face or simply walk out. Instead, he keeps his eyes on the countertop, and silently wishes for the inner strength of his family's stern-faced housekeeper. The explanation, when it comes, is one of those stranger-than-fiction things that defies probability - but also makes for one hell of a story.Many of the pieces have to do with the author's family: either humorous childhood tales or present-day musings on the siblings's often tense and awkward relationships. There are, however, a few stories about Sedaris's exploits in rural France with his partner Hugh. Although the title, as far as I can tell, is never explained, it's probably along the lines of a similar horrors-of-childhood story from fellow memoirist Augusten Burroughs. Perhaps, by leaving it to our imaginations, Sedaris is implying that there are even worse stories about his family - stories so terrible that even he can't bring himself to tell them. So let's not try. It's enough to be glad that the author survived both his childhood and the 1970s, and lived to tell the laugh-out-loud funny tale. I loved this book, but try it for yourself. Pick up a copy!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"An honest confession of quirks, neuroses and the little humors of life. I found this book refreshing for the soul."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is really one of the best writers of our time.

I love Sedaris' clear and concise writing and the humour and the way he conveys pieces of his life to readers. I listen to the audio version on long car rides - or if I am the passenger will create my own audio version by reading it aloud. In either form, it is one of the \\"musts\\" in my road-trip bag. Sedaris is king of the essays and this is one of my favorites of his collections - it includes some of my very favorites of his essays: \\"Six to Eight Black Men,\\" \\"Rooster at the Hitchin' Post,\\" \\"Possession,\\" and \\"Nuit of the Living Dead.\\" But really, the entire collection is quite strong. It makes for the perfect pick-me-up to read to guarantee that you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I was just recently made aware of David Sedaris via a comment by Johnny Depp. I have read several of his books since then and have laughed out loud on numerous occasions throughout each read. He has the ability to amuse me, which is not an easy task. Kudos DS."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"For self-deprecating laughs and family novelty, read this book. Sedaris is a master at it! You'll find yourself thinking of the funny things that have happened in your life and make comparisons."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Laughing at oneself is laudable, while laughing in general has been proven to increase overall health. After pulling funny-man David Sedaris' collection of 22 autobiographical short stories, \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" off my bookshelf after a two-year stay, I expected to laugh heartily. I hadn't considered the life events he would make funny would often be more disturbing and awkward versions of the self-deprecation that I'd been laughing off for years. As critic Shandy Casteel writes, \\"His stories, while always plausibly crafted, accentuate the absurdities that seem to transpire around him with every breath and every step\\" (\\"Dressing Before the Funhouse Mirror\\").As if he's sitting across from you at a dinner party, Sedaris' stories are told with natural simplicity and clarity. Each story, joke and punch line flows with an odd spontaneity, as if he hadn't given it much thought until writing it at that moment. With witty and punching prose, Sedaris is a master at his craft. He doesn't knock the reader out with fancy punctuation or big words when a diminutive one would do. He doesn't over assert his intelligence or writing ability. He writes clearly about the mundanity of life: hoarding Halloween candy as a child, house shopping, and being a house cleaner and having the man strip down before you. Yeah, OK, that last one has never happened to me, either, but he excels at knowing exactly how much to say on a topic and where to end for the optimal punch. It's universal truths he extracts from his quirky family, neighbors and situations, which often left me smiling and thinking, Why didn't I think of that?Spanning from his childhood in Raleigh, North Carolina, to present day in France with partner Hugh, the stories are placed in chronological order. One of the collection's first stories, \\"Us and Them,\\" is a brilliant view of family dynamics and childhood Halloween-candy greed. Pointing out one of the many odd truisms he extracts from his stories, Sedaris writes, \\"Asking for candy on Halloween was called trick-or-treating, but asking for candy on November first was called begging, and it made people uncomfortable. This was one of the things you were supposed to learn simply by being alive, and it angered me that the Tomkeys did not understand that\\" (8). In \\"The Ship Shape,\\" a story in which the Sedaris' consider purchasing a second home, young David and his mother spend the day repeating a woman's comment to a Korean dry cleaner, who \\"nodded, the way you do when you're a foreigner and understand that someone has finished a sentence\\" (17). Sedaris masterfully extracts the nuggets of truth in life, but sometimes he crosses the imaginary line.While the collection has received widespread acclaim for its humor, I crossed the threshold of page 200 before I really threw my head back in laughter. During most of the book, I found myself twisting my face, or at most, giving a gentle giggle at his always surprising wit. Many of Sedaris' stories are well intentioned, but often disturbing in their content. In \\"Full House,\\" young Sedaris, a budding adolescent and homosexual, is invited to an all-male sleepover. While winning Strip Poker, he makes a fully naked boy sit on his lap as further punishment: \\"'Hey,' I told him, \`I'm the one who's going to be suffering. I was just looking for something easy'\\" (40). In an equally awkward, yet more serious story, \\"The Girl Next Door,\\" Sedaris unwittingly becomes an unpaid babysitter for his neighbors' daughter until she begins to steal from him. The young girl retaliates to his tattle telling by writing slanderous comments on his stuff and calling him a \\"Faggot\\" when he walks by. Sedaris' mother urges him to move out, fearing false molestation charges. Remaining likeable as a writer and character, Sedaris sometimes wiggles into areas too serious to be funny, which causes the reader to squirm.\\"Blood Work,\\" the collections' most awkward disturbing story, recounts Sedaris' days of working as a house cleaner. When called by a man who unwittingly switched Sedaris' number for an erotic housecleaning service, the man undresses before him and performs tasteless acts, while Sedaris cleans the house. While his attempt to turn the awkward into amusing is laudable, it never came to fruition in my taste.The book's highlight characters are his family: his sister Amy, who asks if the passenger dog is OK when a car crashes, and his foul-mouth brother Paul, whose language is so explicit and shocking it's hilarious. I have an aversion to comedians who use cursing as a cheap cop-out for laughs, but Paul isn't a comedian. (Quoting him wouldn't be very family friendly, so I'll refrain.) On using his family as the memorable characters in his books, Sedaris writes, \\"In my mind, I'm like a friendly junkman, building things from the little pieces of scrap I find here and there, but my family's started to see things differently. Their personal lives are the so-called pieces of scrap I so casually pick up.\\" And how does his family feel about his use of their life, privacy and sorrow: \\"They're sick of it.\\" It's reasonable of them, but they're just too quirky too not to share.While I wasn't doubled over laughing throughout the book, I may have expected too much. On a second reflection of \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" I like smirking, or even just wincing, at other people's awkward moments. Maybe I'll read one of Sedaris' other books--for my health, of course."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"A Curious collection of stories and musing drawn from the life of David Sedaris. This book is equal parts biography, social commentary, and comedy. Each story is couched in Sedaris's dry, occasionally biting humor which make the book extremely readable and profoundly human at the same time. Funny, poignant, sarcastic, and contemplative; this book refuses to be categorized and never fails to entertain. I look forward to reading more from Sedaris in the future. A quick read...well worth the time."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris' take on life is just a little left of center. He is droll and entertaining in this collection of stories that mostly focus on his family's loony adventures and skewed sense of the world. I'm really glad he is not my brother because the man has no mercy in his depictions of his sisters, brother and parents. No one escape's unscathed, not his boyfriend Hugh or their eighty year old neighbor or David himself.Some of the stories are laugh out loud funny, others are more than a little gross, but like a bad accident you can't help but look (or read). I have to say that my first book by Sedaris was When You are Engulfed in Flames, and it was an audio. As much as I enjoyed reading this book, I realize that something is lost when reading this as opposed to listening, and it is Sedaris' inflections and pauses and dry tone that make him such a great storyteller. So I liked it a lot- but would have loved to listen to it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I chose this audio book to listen to in the car on a long road trip and was very satisfied. Although I have never read Sedaris' work before I have heard his essays on NPR and this audio book lived up to my expectations.As other reviewers have mentioned,Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denimis a collection of essays about the Sedaris family that range from touching to absolutely hilarious. They are not meant to form one continuous story and this actually works quite well in the audio book format because you can easily listen to the book over multiple car rides or workouts without feeling like you have to rewind in order to understand the story.While these stories are entertaining and captivating in their own right they are exponentially more interesting when read by Sedaris. His well timed dry delivery paired with the different voices he does for each character made for a very engaging read. My boyfriend and I were laughing so much at the different stories that the book did a great job of making the time pass and keeping us entertained on an otherwise dull car ride.This book really highlighted for me that Sedaris not just a talented wordsmith but also great at bringing energy and enthusiasm to his work. I would highly recommend this audio book and am planning on checking out more of Sedaris' work as a result."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have to admit that I am not a fan of short story books, because it seems that just as I am getting into the story it cuts to something entirely new. This was certainly true of Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. I did not find that the stories were particularly insightful or humorous, which are the two things I most look for in a novel.That said, Sedaris's candor lends credence to the kinds of stories we all might have if we just took time to chronicle them. Perhaps the saving grace of this book is that it tells the kinds of stories ordinary people would have in an extraordinary way. This book was worth reading through once, but it is not a book I foresee myself picking up anytime in the near future."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I don't like to read reviews and descriptions of a book prior to reading it because so very often they give away too much and spoil the book for me. This book was given to me as a gift and I just assumed it was fiction. I kept waiting for some sort of story to evolve, a plot, a direction. Took me many a chapter to even realize this was non-fiction and basically a collection of anecdotes. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the book more if I had realized that at the onset.Anyway, I thought it was a fairly weird grouping of stories. What a bizarre family! While mildly humorous I thought it was mostly weird and quirky (and sad) rather than funny."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've loved every one of Sedaris' books, and just fininshed re-reading this one. I felt like some good laughs, and his books really deliver. Sometimes a \\"yikes\\" rather than a laugh, but always an impact. I have yet to find anyone than has the wit and style and ability to fascinate as well as produce a belly laugh like David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is hysterical! Probably one of his best works if not the best.If you like Sedaris at all then you must read this (even though it's not his latest). It's even funny a second time around, the semi biographical short stories don't get dated."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I read the first chapter while I was still in the store, and I cried with laughter!!! David Sedaris is a GENIUS of comedy and wit. BUY IT, READ IT!!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If you like the dry wit of David Sedaris you will love this book. Even if you don't know who he is, once you have read the first page you will probably love this book.Seeing the world through the author's eyes for a while helps us to remember the little absurdities we experience every day and, somehow, cherish them for a moment rather than let them drive us stark, raving, looney.Thank you Mr. Sedaris, for reminding us to treasure even the stranger moments that make up the life of a human being."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"all stories are great. the stories pertaining to family are my favorite."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I am now beginning to realize that this fellow is making quite a living writing about nothing but random musings, some mostly rather inconsequencial events in his life and managing to keep the level of entertainment at a mildly amusing consistency. this is his style, this is his book, this is everything he writes. if you can take churning away the hours with pages and pages of particularly meaningless scratch, then this is the book for you. But if you would like to be enlightened by a sincere and elemental world of wonder, interest and order, then stay in that line of folks waiting for Dan Brown to autograph your copy of the \\"Code.\\" You know that line I'm talking about...that LONG line. Lucky for me that I'm the type of person who uses both legs to stand in TWO lines.That is to say, Sedaris is SO not for everyone. His books waste time. They lend no real insight toward bettering the mind or the world. All they do is depict what the world is like for a gay obsessive compulsive with too much of himself on his mind and, as I have mentioned before about today's white writers, a loving penchant for parading the n-word around like it's shakespeare prose. I've read two of his books and he hasn't failed with it yet. I plan on getting more of the same when I read more of what he has written.Because I will read more of his work. He tells a fine story about mundane things that never make you lose interest. One of my favorite pieces in \\"Dress Your Family...\\" is more or less about worms that didn't make it to space in the \\"Challenger\\" shuttle. There is also a funny story about the existence of Santa Claus in a remote country as he prances around towns giving presents to people with his six to eight black friends.My personal fortress of solitude is the bathroom. That is pretty much the one place, or should be the one place, anyone gets any real, personal time alone. I cherish the very existence of the bathroom, so saying that I kept Sedaris' novel in there for me to read during visits is by no means a stain, so to speak, on his work. It could actually be considered flattering. Some of it is toilet humor anyway."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I recently bought Sedaris' Carnegie Hall CD and thought it was hilarious. I am also an enthusiastic fan of This American Life and have loved his many contributions. This book proves that NPR highlights Sedaris' best work and leaves the rest. Unfortunately this is a book mostly of \\"the rest\\".I had a tough time finding any redeeming value in the story of his rickshaw hauling, trash picking sister and her ability to put out cigarettes with her bare feet. I was much more repulsed by the story of his budding homosexuality and the way he was able to coerce young, naked boys to sit on his lap.If I were to choose one word to describe this book it would be \\"icky\\". Skip the ickiness and buy the CD. Or, better yet skip the expense and listen to This American Life. It's free and it's his best material."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Hated it!Sedaris shows us his dark side and his family's dark side and it just isn't funny.The new stuff is a scream for help from a very depressed man. The old stuff is a scream, but I've heard it all before. That's what old means.Finally, it's a hodge-podge.I was so disappointed. Love Sedaris, but hated it!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris was a huge disappointment this time around (I quite liked his others). I found nothing remotely amusing. He seemed to ramble on most of his subjects without ever coming to a point. Just senseless babble. His whole family is clearly dysfunctional to the point that it's NOT funny. He needs Prozac the size of a grapefruit."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I absolutely LOVE Sedaris and his latest book did not dissapoint! I've heard a couple of these stories before on his Carnegie Hall CD (which I also recommend) and the other stories accompanying them were just as hilarious and wonderful.Sedaris writes the way every contemporary essayist should. He's hilarious, thought-provoking, clever, honest, and extremely talented.This book is a must-have!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I just read this book, and I have never read any of David Sedaris' other books. I noticed the buzz the book and the author was getting, and so I bought it. I was wondering why I wasn't laughing all the time, but I realized that these stories are however one decides to take them. And I think they are thoughtful and deep, and a few are very funny. Six to Eight Black Men had me laughing so hard I was punding my fists and kicking my legs, with tears streaming down my face. His brother, Paul, is so funny with his metaphors, a true Southerner. His sister's, the one's he included in the book, are earthy and identifiable. A really good read. I recommend it. Now I am off to buy &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;!!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have read Sedaris in Esquire and GQ, specifically, The Rooster at the Hitchin' Post and \\"Put a Lid on It\\", both of which I thought, and still do, to be quite well written and very funny....and this was the reason for purchasing the book. \\"Baby Einstein\\" and \\"Nuit of the Living Dead\\" were really good as well.That said, what the book did for me was make me feel fairly good about myself, even on a bad day. If I was half this ineffective in life, venal and flat out soft, I would have killed myself before reaching puberty. It isn't so much that Sedaris is pitiful, or that one wants to hate him, it is just that his existence seems like a waste....one that is recorded and categorized for history."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I don't know if Sedaris realized it at the time or not, but just below the surface of his humorous collection of essays in &quot;Dress Your Family...&quot; is a peek into a disturbing and wholly disfunctional family life. Absent father-figure, over-bearing mother and other elements mentioned within are exactly the sort of things some researchers say is behind homosexuality. It seems as if David himself gives credence to bebunking the widely-accepted myth that homosexuals are &quot;born that way&quot; rather than being raised that way.Regardless, &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim&quot; was a quirky and quick summer read. I found myself laughing out-loud several times. No doubt about it, Sedaris is a gifted wordsmith and I may pick up more of his writings. Still, I can't help but wonder if he isn't trying to use his humorous self-expression as a way of dealing with an inner torment."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"It had some funny moments...and I did laugh out loud on several occassions. He's one of my favorite authors"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"\\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" is a collection of typically hilarious essays from David Sedaris - one of the true modern masters of comic writing. Many of the stories chronicle his years growing up gay in North Carolina, with his wacky family featured prominently. Other stories are more contemporary, with glimpses of his current life in France with his boyfriend Hugh. For his fans, Sedaris and his family have become old friends: I relish every detail that provides insight into his writing much as I savor news about people I know.In addition, I was pleased by some of his stories that go a bit deeper. Instead of relying on unusual circumstances that he has experienced, Sedaris creates some funny situations through introspection; he's clearly growing as a comic writer. Some of his fans may worry that he will run out of childhood stories to tell - this collection suggests that he'll continue to put out great writing long after that happens. Overall, this collection is top-notch; it's incredibly funny and has a great deal of heart.Minor quibble: I was a bit disappointed that a few of the essays were familiar - many of them have been published elsewhere, such as Esquire. However, this complaint is minor compared to the pleasure I received from reading this book. A real winner sure to please his fans!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I am not obsessed but have read or own all Sedaris books and have gleefully converted friends and family members. This book was NOT disappointing, I read it in one big binge and laughed out loud SEVERAL times. I highly recommend it. I also don't get the title, and I want to know what Hejira means.This book is hilarious and odd and vaguely disturbing and yes, touching and sensitive. I wouldn't read it in public, for fear of laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I hate NPR.I hate NPR the way cats hate baths. The way Shaq hates Kobe. The way Michael Moore hates America.But I love NPR's own David Sedaris the way Joanie loves Chachi.Ok, well, maybe that's an exaggeration, but not much of one.This collection of ironic and laugh-till-you're-incontinent essays marks Sedaris' continuing claim on the title of &quot;funniest man in France&quot;. Sure, that's not much of an accomplishment these days, but if he'd move back in with his wonderfully-eccentric family, he'd surely be the &quot;funniest man in North Carolina&quot; too.Some of Sedaris' best and boldest work is in evidence here:- How his neighbors' celebrating Halloween a day late taught him the meaning of &quot;hate&quot;- His reminiscences of an all-male sleepover during which he briefly had ultimate power over his fellow teenage boys, power which he promptly abused (and relished abusing)- The tale of how his family came to be slumlords- His brother Rooster's redneck wedding- The funniest Christmas story ever told, entitled (I kid you not) &quot;Six to Eight Black Men&quot;How good is Sedaris?Good enough to make me listen to NPR just to hear a comedian at the top of his game."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The humor is good in general. He is not a very good writer, but most definitely a very talented story-teller. I loved each family-related story. (Unlike some people commented,they are by no means dysfunctional, they are most certainly interesting people and fun to read about. The book also has some good gay humor (particularly the part about making young boys sit on his lap)and replete with witty sarcasm and satire from the first page to the end.However, I found the essays about his Euorepan days a bit unintelligent. Particularly \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" offended me straight-out. (ok..I should say I can't be very objective here since I am from Turkey) because he wouldn't want to believe that St. Nick is from Turkey and that we wouldn't appreciate him here. Disturbing bias against a country about which he does not know anything. And if he likes Christmas so much he should have known where Santa is from anyway. (It is a good little story though. )Secondly, I couldn't entirely relate to the part about Anne Frank simply because Anne Frank is Anne Frank. I'm not in any way trying to say that he was making fun of the Holocaust but he does seem to be taking it a little bit less seriously than most people do (or should, in my opinion).Overall, I liked the book but I like that slef-depracating style in general. I had never read any Sedaris before and I think I might check out some of his other books whenever I feel like reading good humor."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sublty is lost on so many. God forbid if the \\"group\\" doesn't like something.Any fan of Sedaris will love this book as it lets us in closer to his (...) genius. The grace that can be found in such an awkward little man's life is astounding and should give us all hope for our own messed-up affairs. It illustrates, to those who care to listen carefully, that everything is important."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The final chapter in this book tells a story about Sedaris torturing an animal. Regardless of the circumstances involved, including such material in a comedic work is brutally stupid and insensitive to readers. This alone has turned me from a Sedaris fan to a non-Sedaris fan.Besides that, the rest of the book was rather dull, rambling, often mean-spirited and completely unremarkable. What a let down after reading his previous works."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris is good at what he does. His essays on personal life experience are witty and entertaining, to say the least. The stories have a very human touch, short witty and rounding out to come full circle by the end, they've always made me wish Sedaris were writing them for a sitcom.My only complaint with the author, and this is not limited to \\"Dress your family...\\", is that he's grown to be rather predictable to anyone who follows his work.All in all, as expected, another fine piece of work by David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I am unequivocally a Sedaris fan, but this book left me wondering if he really has much material left that worthy of being published. The strength of his first 2 or 3 books certainly earned him notoriety and a reputation for tongue-in-cheek prose, but the stories in \\"Corduroy\\" were simply dull and boring.I certainly can't recommend this book. Get \\"Me Talk Pretty..\\" or \\"Naked\\"."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I had to read this book for a book club and it was very difficult to get through. The story was all over the place and it just didn't have a flow and continuity to it. I enjoy Sedaris' work and was shocked that I had such a hard with this book. Try it for yourself and let's discuss."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I literally laughed out loud to the point of tears over and over again - and something has to be darn funny for me to laugh like that. I recently went on vacation with friends and implored all of them to read it. I must have made quite the impression because four of them are now reading it. This book is really one of the funniest, most well-written books I've ever come across - yes, ever! You will NOT REGRET buying this book, trust me. I really don't know who could possibly write a bad review of this book - someone who hates fun for sure. If you like fun or need a laugh, this book has your name written all over it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"After having read all of David Sedaris books, this one was just as funny, but it also made me very sad at times. There were alot of chapters (rather, short stories) where I read silently, having not laughed at all, but just engaged myself in them, and couldnt help but feel a little torn up afterwards.I know this isnt a very helpful review for most newcomers to Sedaris' work, but for those of you interested, I recommend starting with Me Talk Pretty One Day. Save Holidays On Ice for the holidays, even though it doesnt matter. I just think it fits better."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Imagine a writer who builds a house with materials he gathers from a mine beneath it. That is David Sedaris. So busy is he relaying the experiences of Lisa, Amy, Gretchen, Tiffany, and Paul \\"Rooster\\" Sedaris--all of whom we now know well--he has little to offer from his own life. And most of his own present day stories are anaemic in comparison to accounts of his family and upbringing. The secret of Sedaris' work has always been its odd mixture of humor, discomfort, and pathos. In this collection, the pathos often arises from Sedaris' method, the way he undermines his life to build his accounts of it. In a brilliant passage, he trains his sister Lisa's parrot to beg forgiveness for taking her stories. In this book, he begs us to forgive him as well, repeating--as a parrot does, as a person training a parrot does--the tried and true method he's used before to make us laugh, cringe, and cry. As much as I admire David Sedaris (and I do admire him immensely) I can't help hoping he finds a new vein. His talent is too great to waste on self-imitation, and that seems to be the direction he's heading."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"From such a strong writer, or at least one who had been steadily perfecting his craft, I expected the writing in Denim to be so much better than it is. The stories are often not that funny and often aren't even engaging. If you hadn't seen his previous work you would think he just wasn't capable of better than this, but weirdly, you know he is - or was. Even as a memoir the stories are hardly stories, more anecdotes that often just don't hold together properly. Many feel like sketches of stories that are not yet done. Sedaris has not always been an all hits author but this book, unlike his others, is more misses than hits. I'll still wait to see what his next book entails, but I won't strive to buy it in hardcover again."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Let me admit my bias from the beginning: I am a David Sedaris fan. Having read all his previous books, I would now pay to hear Mr. Sedaris recite names from the telephone book. Fortunately, this talented man keeps producing hilariously eccentric, yet oddly familiar, essays about everyday situations (noisy neighbors, rental property, housecleaning), and manages to leave us frothing at the mouth for the next collection. When reading a Sedaris work, you get the distinct impression you &quot;shouldn't&quot; be laughing at the author's misery. But at the same time, you are helpless to do anything else. One of my favorite essays in &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim&quot; depicts a housecleaning assignment gone wrong. I read it, alternately flinching then chuckling. You'll find yourself doing the same if you purchase this funny little book."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is by far David's funniest book ever. Started it Saturday afternoon and finished Sunday morning. My body hurts, seriously, as a result of hysterical laughing. From the strip poker rules he makes up, his cleaning experience with a gay diabetic, to his obsessive need to touch the head of an airline passenger and his experience with coffee boy, this man makes me laugh like no other. Mr. Sedaris, you are a treasure!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris has always been one of my favorite writers. He is by far the wittiest individual I have become &quot;aquainted with&quot;. I am so excited that he has suceeded in publishing another collection of autobiographical situations, circumstances, and events. I laugh out loud everytime I read his works and have found his book on CD an excellent complimentary masterpiece. Sedaris is smart, funny, and utterly honest. Someone once told me to write well, you must write about what you know. And David really knows!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I found this book to be nothing like Sedaris's previous work. There are funny essays, and I often laughed out loud. The usual crowd will chat about it and list it as &quot;one of my all-time favorite books.&quot; Beyond that, essays like &quot;Who's the Chef&quot; and &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; seem to me to be the real heavy-hitting ones in the book. I think Sedaris is getting a lot more interesting and complex. I look forward to his next book but am confident that if he continues to be more than just &quot;funny&quot; his rank on the sales list will drop rapidly. Too bad."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I just finished reading David Sedaris' new book, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. Like all of Sedaris' works, it was a super fast read. All of the essays exhibit Mr. Sedaris unique style and wit. This collection mostly focuses on his family - the same zany characters we've grown to love from his past work. Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is a must-read for any Sedaris fan and a good starting point for anyone unfamiliar with his work. I think Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is of the same caliber (if not better) than his acclaimed Me Talk Pretty One Day. However, this collection of essays examines some darker issues and most of the essays have a more serious underlying message. I was still laughing often throughout the book but Mr. Sedaris also left me with plenty to think about, too. Some of my favorites from this collection included The Ship Shape, 6 - 8 Black Men, Chicken in the Hen House, Put a Lid On It, Nuit of the Living Dead, and Baby Einstein. Needless to say, I highly recommend this book! Of course, you don't have to take my word for it, it is currently holding the number one spot on The New York Times Best-Seller List for Hardcover Nonfiction."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"&quot;Oh, please, please do not put my parrot in your movie,but if we are included will you have me played as fat?&quot; implores Lisa to her brother, David Sedaris. Thus goes the life of David Sedaris in his new book &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim&quot;.David Sedaris most often known for the stories he portrays on NPR's &quot;This American Life&quot; is a prolific writer and story teller.We laugh out loud at some of his antics or those he causes. In this new book, some of the stories have been heard before on NPR or in his CD or read in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; Some of the stories are gross- like his younger brother's wedding night where he shows David how he gets his larger bull dog to eat the smaller dog's poop. Yuckadew!Most of the stories are not ones I can really relate to, but I can understand. The chapter that focuses on Holland's Christmas night with Santa and the 7 or 8 black men ( no one really knows whether it is 7 or 8 black men who accompany Santa) is hilarious and one of the funniest stories in the book. David takes us to Paris where he and his roommate are looking for a new apartment. The one they have is beautiful, but the landlord cannot sell it to them, can only lease it for 26 years until his daughters are old enough to inhabit it. Or, the time his father kicked him out of the house. David thought it was because he slept all day, smoked pot all night and listened to one record over and over. But in reality it was for another reason that David was asked to leave. David brings us to Boston to visit his sister. She is a baker and lives in a house in Somerville. She has become by way of a rickshaw a deadbeat, a hippie, a collector of &quot;things&quot;. David's job is to clean the house although sister wants no part of that- it is David's obsessive cleaning behavior that makes him do it. One of the more outrageous stories takes place when he has a job as a house cleaner. David was mistakenly called instead of an S&amp;M cleaning outfit.On and on, David portrays himself and his family as a little loony, a little too obsessive. But, this is David's perspective and his writing style pulls you in. Mom seems to me to be the one that held the family together and as strange and funny as she is, I like her a lot. She kicks the kids out of the house on a snowy winter vacation day. They end up playing in the street, and she comes to rescue them as if nothing unusual has happened. She can cry, she can yell, and we see where the family might get their interesting personalites! She always wanted grandchildren and one of the stories centers on which child will have the first baby,and by gosh it does happen!I left the strangest story for last because it takes place in New Hampshire. It centers on a small hotel with few amenities and David carrying coffee with a small child to........I love David Sedaris and his writing. I buy his books eagerly and am not disappointed. This one is a doozy and will entertain you for hours. prisrob"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The cover art drew my attention to this book at my local public library many years ago. I am so glad I checked it out that day, because David Sedaris became one of my favorite authors quickly after opening this book! I read his other books working backwards after I finished this one, but \\"Dress Your Family...\\" remains my favorite! Recommend Highly!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"While not as sidesplitting in its entirety as &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; this was an excellent book. Some of the pieces were still very funny, but there were some pieces that were just touching recollections. What I like is that even when DS is mocking some horrible traits shown by his family members, he also clearly loves them and that love shows through. He knows that you can love someone and not like everything that they do.There are some clearly funny places though. The author's account of his brother's cooking habits and dog training techniques made me laugh so hard I dropped the book - then I immediately took it to my friend's house so she could read it, but made her read it aloud instead of doing it myself because I know I wouldn't have been able to speak aloud for the last few pages due to the gasping for air.I also found it interesting that one of his sisters lives in my town - but my neighbor tells me this is not news, she'll introduce herself to you in the local library :)God forbid we ever have a smoking prohibition, or DS will be in Tourette hell. I believe him utterly when he says that for him, smoking is a good thing.If you like reading about imperfect people who care about each other but can be quite ludicrous, and observations of human oddity in general, this book is for you. (As are all his other books.) I found the second half of the book to be funnier than the first half."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is my second book by David Sedaris after finishing Holidays on Ice (one of the funniest books, ever). Unlike Holidays, Dress Your Family consists of 22 short stories that are all autobiographical in nature.Dress Your Family doesn't quite have the belly laughs of Holidays, but it is comical nonetheless. One funny story is about his brother's wedding on the beach with his dogs as attendants (the flower girl was in heat). In another, he plays strip poker with his friends and makes up the rules in order to keep his clothes. Sedaris' self-deprecating humor is also amusing. The author had an unusual childhood, and while most boys were picking up footballs and hockey sticks, Sedaris was picking out wallpaper samples. But Dress Your Family is also filled with the angst of childhood, and most of us will identify with many of these stories. Some are downright heartbreaking. After dropping out of college, his father asks him to move out of the house. Only later does Sedaris learn the real reason: his father disapproves of his homosexuality.Still, the Sedaris family has center stage here. With mom, dad, four sisters, and a very masculine brother, each one is quirkier than the next. It's hard to tell how much is Sedaris' very keen powers of observation, and how much is exaggeration. In any case, it's no wonder that when odd things happen to his sisters, they all scream at him \\"and I don't want to see this in one of your books!\\" Sedaris always promises to keep their secrets, but everyone knows they will appear sometime soon. Sedaris is an amazing writer and storyteller, and it is appropriate that he has such a rich source of material. I'm sure it will keep him going ad infinitum."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"They come in droves, no, in battalions. They're sometimes called Sedaristas or fans of the record breaking best-selling author David Sedaris. He's the fellow who has made a fortune out of relating his life as an outsider, a down-and-outer, and a gay man in a straight world. He's done it with truth, wicked humor, and an uncanny perception allowing him to turn the ordinary into over-the-top.His latest collection of short stories is now available on CD. They're read, of course, by Sedaris as only he can read them - in the voice familiar to millions on NPR. Whether he's a kid, a mom, or himself, he's in one word terrific.Many of the selections offered here were taped during live performances. &quot;Who's The Chef?&quot; and &quot;Six to Eight Black Men&quot; were taped during his sell-out appearance at Carnegie Hall, and may also be heard on &quot;David Sedaris Live At Carnegie Hall.&quot;If you haven't heard Sedaris yet, don't waste another minute. He's an original, and he's incredibly entertaining. Laugh out loud funny, you say? That and then some.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I love David Sedaris for the ease at which he can have you in side splitting hysterics. The anticipation of a new collection of essays means at least an hour or two of annoying loved ones and co-workers with, &quot;one more section to read aloud&quot;.However upon finishing this I only mustered up some hearty chuckles. Success hasn't spoiled Sedaris, it's just stripped him of his anonymity. Consequently placing himself in situations where he can silently observe are becoming obsolete.Most of the stories revolve around his family; a melancholic and unflattering collection of portraits that frankly I felt depressed more than amused. There are some very funny moments, but generally the absurd wit that runs through his previous essays was replaced by a sadder, softer tone. Still, fans of his work will find at least some things to giggle over, and that's more than alot of writers can say."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is jampacked with what David Sedaris is famous for...great and interesting stories about himself and his quirky family. With marvelous wit and a somewhat sarcastic tone, Sedaris makes you believe you know his family as well as he does.A fun, quick read that can be picked up and put down at a later date, if youre able. Just alot of fun...though prudish readers may be put off at some parts.David Sedaris is someone Id love to meet just to hear his stories about his offbeat family in person."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The essays in this new book manage to avoid both pat conclusions and unattractive self-pity that the subject matter could make for the author so easy to slide into. Many writers have taken as their subject matter oddball upbringings, eccentric family, and the feeling of being a perennial outsider, but most come across, at least part of the time, as too self-deprecating and too unaware that they aren't the only ones with these problems. Not so here.In one essay, Sedaris writes about wanting to emulate a cool boy in his grade, even though that kid bullied him, and ends by admitting that he continued to wonder about him long after they parted ways. Most writers would try to end on some note that they've learned their \\"lesson\\" but Sedaris effortlessly avoids such pat conclusions. Because of this, even the most personal of the pieces can never be labeled as \\"naval gazing.\\"If anything, some of the pieces have enough emotional wallop that their shortness is frustrating. Particularly, I wanted to know if and how he ever reconciled with his father, who threw him out of the house (without explicitly saying so) for being gay. But then, I'm not the writer here.I found this book to be more mature than the previous two. There is still plenty of almost-too-unbelievable family anecdotes and gross-out descriptions, but for reasons I can't fully explain, the essays seemed to move beyond just mugging for laughs.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Ok, cutting to the chase: yes it's worth it, and no, he's not losing his touch -- but like anyone else with a working brain, the particulars will change over time.David Sedaris is still the intelligent person's acid humorist, but he is growing to be able to play in two keys at once. The sharp-tongued &quot;what was she thinking??&quot; materialist, and the thoughtful guy who understands the source of his inspiration (mainly family), and honestly gets what they were thinking after all. And get this! Admits it!If you read The New Yorker and Esquire and some other Lit mags you may have seen much of this material before (hey, a guy's gotta eat between hardcover releases) but much is gained in the compilation. Seriously. I swear you will still suppress an evil snort at regular intervals!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've been anticipating this book after buying the Live at Carnegie Hall CD, as he previewed some works from this new book.Overall the stories still have the same tone and subject matter of his previous work. Some parts were laugh out loud funny, but not as much as Me Talk Pretty One Day. It's funnier at least for me to hear him read it out loud than it is to read the book. His voice lends a lot of expression into the pieces than just his words can. If you can get the books on tape or CD, I recommend that out of personal bias, but DS in any media is well worth it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I just finished Mr. Sedaris' new book and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I simply love reading his work. His writing is simple, detailed, hysterically funny, sad, moving, loving...the list goes on and on.One minute you will be laughing out loud to the point where you have to put the book down for a minute (I know I did) and in the next you will undoubtedly feel his writing tugging at your heart (it definitely tugged at mine).Mr. Sedaris moves from the absurd to the self-deprecating to the hysterically funny to the sad to the inspired to the poignant with such thoughtful nuance that it's difficult not to fall under his spell.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have always been skeptical of using the phrase 'laugh out loud' funny when it comes to describing books, however if any book deserves to be described as such, it is this book.I was sitting poolside, on vacation, when the women sitting in the chair beside me, kept laughing out loud while she was reading. I couldn't help but wonder what book had her laughing so hard, and peeked over to discover this was the book she was reading.She chuckled to herself for over an hour while reading this book, and as I walked away from the pool, I knew I had to read it too.My only advice: think twice before you decide to read this in public. You WILL laugh out loud. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"While this book was entertaining, some of the situations Sedaris described bordered on the creepy. I don't necessarily fault him for this - he is, after all, describing American life in all its glory - but the average reader will spend a lot more time creasing his or her brow while reading this book than they might while reading \\"Naked\\" or \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" - in other words, I recommend this book, but read the others first."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I read it in about a day. I'm a married, thirty-odd, mother of two and I still found myself relating in multiple ways to this gay male perspective on life. Some of the funniest scenes are described so well that they almost transfer into your memory banks and one day when you're 90, you're gonna go tell people that you lived in France and one night you were trying to drown a mouse in a bucket when a vanload of Dutch people pulled up and asked you directions.And why not?The stories Sedaris shares become your stories and your memories. A writer can only hope to write this well. I enjoyed every bit of it and found myself snickering in places and laughing in others.You'll enjoy it, too."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've never read a David Sedaris book that I didn't like. Me Talk Pretty One day has to be the funniest book ever written, followed by Naked and then Barrel Fever. But Dress Your Family is also very good. The problem for me is that it seemed to be in a totally different category from those other books. Sure, it's funny, hilarious even, but there's a dark undercurrent to this latest work and while it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment, it does place this book on a different level. I actually enjoyed Dress Your Family more I think, than Me Talk Pretty, simply because it went somewhere I wasn't expecting. As with all of Sedaris's works, you can't go wrong. While they guy is definitely appreciated now, I think that in ten or twenty years we're really going to see his status elevated to genius."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Thank you Mr. Sedaris for an immensely entertaining book. Your look at Christmas traditions in your chapter entitled Six to Eight Black Men was side-splitting and made the rounds in our house. Family members from 14 to 80 could not stop laughing."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"As I read \\"Dress Your Family in Cuordoroy and Denim,\\" I found that over and over I was relating to what Sedaris was saying. I could tell that had I been in similar situations, I would be thinking the same things, as bizarre as some of his thoughts are.His writing is superb. His wit is razor-sharp. His anecdotes are wildly entertaining. It wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as previous works, but I enjoyed it just as much. I feel like I got a better sense of the person David Sedaris instead of the extremely clever comedian David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Yeah, this book is a bit more sensitive. In fact, I found myself &quot;sighing&quot; after a couple of the chapters and thinking, wow that was a really tender moment or the people had some profound self revelations on that one. But most of the chapters are in the same wacky tradition of David Sedaris's earlier work. Secretly, I wanted more insanity though... The poker story with his childhood friends make up for this--it's my favorite one, I fell out of bed laughing."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have been an avid David Sedaris fan for many years, and he just keeps getting better and better. This recent collection of essays has the usual Sedaris wit and dark humor, but what makes this particular collection unique is the focus on the various members of the Sedaris family. He takes risks in both his storytelling and style, and I appreciate this sort of honesty in a writer. Read this book and you'll be shocked, delighted, sad, and ultimately, wanting more. David Sedaris is an absolute genius! Read absolutely everything he's ever written."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I first discovered Sedaris with a recommendation here at Amazon(Naked). It was a great book, one of my all time favorites. I've read all of his books and listened to most of the audio CDs, and while they were all solid, \\"Dress Your Family...\\" is his second-best work. Others have commented on the increased \\"ick\\" factor, but I think Sedaris is actually more involving here than in some of his funnier stories. The story of his brother Rooster's wedding is one the best, most hilarious works I've ever read. But he also get serious talking about the strained relationship he has with his most-unconventional sister (and that's pretty out there). I could really relate to what he, and his sister, were going through. He also gets a bit heavy talking about being an openly gay man and how he's always paranoid of molestation accusations. Funny, serious, whatever. No one can write like DS!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I love David Sedaris. I think his writing is very funny, very touching and very entertaining. I go to see Sedaris speak when he's on tour and I read short pieces he's written for The New Yorker and Esquire online. In fact, I've already read many of the stories in this book (which was somewhat disappointing). &quot;Rooster at the Hitching Post&quot; and several other have been printed elsewhere and you can read them online if you don't want to buy this book. I will say, though, there are plenty of new stories in here that make the book well worth it. Just don't be too surprised if you come across something you've read before."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Very good, but different than his other work. I think Me Talk Pretty one day is funnier, but the essays in this book are very good, but explore darker subject matter. I had tears welling up at the end of several of these stories, and it seems he's looking at his life and family with a more serious outlook. I don't want to make this book sound depressing though - it's very, very funny, and I would absolutely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Having just finished this book, I have to say that I enjoyed it. Quoting the inside-front flap of the book:\\"David Sedaris plays in the snow with his sisters.He goes on vacation with his family.He gets a job selling drinks.He attends his brother's wedding.He mops his sister's floor.He gives directions to a lost traveler.He eats a hamburger.He has his blood sugar tested.It all sounds so normal, doesn't it?\\"Normal, it is not. At least not in the way that Sedaris writes his stories. The candor in which he expresses his thoughts, almost random like at times, is what makes this book (and his others) so amusing, and easy to read. The chapter about his brother's wedding is memorable for the moment the \\"men of the family\\" have together (in silence); the story about the prospect of zombies attacking his home is funny, especially his story on how he tried to help the mouse escape the trap (only maiming it beyond repair); and the moments he talks about his mother is particularly enjoyable, as you sense this is where he gets his ability to cope with life."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris' account of various situations and scenarios will have you laughing throughout the entire book! The book is filled with poignant and humorous essays that relay the joy and pain of growing up and living in middle America with family. Filled with great stories, I HIGHLY recommend this read!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris delivers again with a funny, thoughtful collection of short stories. Initially, I thought I was picking up a fiction collection but these are true stories, most of them reflections on the author's younger years and on time spent with family.Sedaris creates accounts about other people that we can all relate to. He writes about his sister's paranoid tendencies in his piece \\"Repeat After Me\\":\\"My sister's the type who religiously watches the fear segments of her local Eyewitness News broadcasts, retaining nothing but the headline. She remembers that applesauce can kill you but forgets that in order to die, you have to inject directly into your bloodstream . . . everything is dangerous all of the time, and if it's not yet been pulled off the shelves, then it's certainly under investigation - so there.\\"I wouldn't want to know what family reunions are really like at the Sedaris household, but the author paints a picture so human and recognizable that we all laugh. Who doesn't know someone like that?This is the first non-fiction work that I've seen of his. I was swept away by his frank tone, even when matters such as his sexuality, his relationships and his obsessions are discussed. It's impressive that a book can be so honest and so funny, all at the same time."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Many of the pieces have to do with the author's family: either humorous childhood tales or present-day musings on the siblings's often tense and awkward relationships. There are, however, a few stories about Sedaris's exploits in rural France with his partner Hugh. Although the title, as far as I can tell, is never explained, it's probably along the lines of a similar horrors-of-childhood story from fellow memoirist Augusten Burroughs. Perhaps, by leaving it to our imaginations, Sedaris is implying that there are even worse stories about his family - stories so terrible that even he can't bring himself to tell them. So let's not try. It's enough to be glad that the author survived both his childhood and the 1970s, and lived to tell the laugh-out-loud funny tale. Bottom line: it's certainly worth picking up."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"All in all, this is excellent material - highly entertaining, a bit edgy, and sometimes dark while maintaining a sense of humor. My only issue is that once you have read some of Sedaris' work, it can be difficult to find fresh new stuff. I'm not certain if the stories in Corduroy and Denim are exact replicas of those released in his previous books, but they sure seem very familiar. If you have read \\"Naked,\\" \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" and \\"Holidays on Ice,\\" save yourself some money and just borrow this one from the library. If you are new to Sedaris, by all means, get this book, his work is not to be skipped."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was totally funny, and it was typical Sedaris. \\"Dress Your Family...\\" was all about his family, including entire chapters devoted to each of his siblings and his parents. On one hand, he points out all of his family's quirks with humor, but on the other hand, he sweetly sums it up by saying that is why he loves them. If I were his sister, I don't know how I would react to his totally honest observations. However, I am just a grateful reader that loves his humor. This is definately worth the money!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Bruce Springsteen once wished that he could sing like Roy Orbinson. I confess, I wish I could write like David Sedaris. After \\"Naked\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty..\\" you'd think his work would be stale by now. How many funny, introspective, family based stories can one man get away with? An awful lot if your David Sedaris.I think Sedaris stays fresh because he is a good writer, he takes everyday common occerances and makes us laugh at him, his family, and ourselves. In \\"Dress Your Family...\\" he also seems to take a harder if not slightly darker look at himself.\\"Dress Your Family...\\", much like his other books, is a collection of short stories based on Sedaris' life, some stories are from his childhood, others might be from two summers ago. There is no order. In fact Sedaris' style is based on writings from his diary. And that what this book feels like...cracking open a diary, guilt free, and devoring the funny secrets of man, his life, and his family."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Much anticipated and well worth the wait! My mother introduced me to Sedaris a few years ago when she gave me \\"Naked\\" for my birthday. I've recently taken to reading more of his books. I recommend for new and old fans."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"While this book is still humorous in its own right, it doesn't quite parallel his previous work Me Talk Pretty One Day. His childhood antics, though sometimes disturbing, give insight into the world of non-conventional nuclear families. Dave Sedaris's coming-of-age is expressed in such a way that makes even the most liberal family shocked at some of his family's daily routines. This shows the America that you don't see on TV: what goes wrong with vacation homes, what happens when you're nice to your neighbor, the kind of respect received by elderly family members, and why kids are uncomfortable at sleepovers. All of this non-conventional upbringing culminates in Sedaris's moving to France, and what his new countrymen think of him. While Sedaris tries desperately not to be like any of his family members, he learns he is inevitably bound by blood to be crazy like the rest of them. What makes this collection of vignettes fun to read is the humor we're glad we can't relate to."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is true to form. Sedaris' poignant essays are nearly as outstanding as those in Me Talk Pretty One Day. Recommended for an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book reminds you that it is not only your family that is crazy. It's fun to laugh at others and then think of your own insane family functions."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris seems have grown even more comfortable in his skin. This collection stands out compared to his previous ones as being more from the heart. You get a much more detailed understanding of him and his family than from his other collections. My previous favorite was Me Talk Pretty One Day, which I think perhaps had funnier parts, but Dress just seems more real."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this semi-autobiography . . . I read it for my book club, and it is not something that would have normally caught my eye. However, it became apparent soon after reading the first couple of pages that David Sedaris has a great talent for writing and a quick wit. He transformed the mundane, basic and usually nondescript inner workings of a dysfunctional family and his everyday life into something that made me laugh out loud on many occasions. The book is a compilation of 22 separate essays that span over his life from childhood through recent adulthood.Through his series of essays, Sedaris' talent is evident in the way in which he describes his siblings, his parents, his friends and his life experiences. For instance, he describes his parents' attempts in the 1970's to be great landlords in a chapter entitled Slumus Lordicus. After Sedaris' father felt sorry for an \\"odd looking\\" but allegedly hard working couple . . . (the wife was, as Sedaris' mother described, \\"unfortunate looking\\". . . ) Sedaris begins to slowly unfold for the reader the manner in which these seemingly great tenants (Lance and Belinda Taylor) become the tenants from hell. An excerpt is below:_________________When they first moved in, the Taylors were polite and gung ho. Could they plant a vegetable garden? Certainly! Paint the living room? Why not? But the garden was never sown, and the paint cans sat untouched. They fought often, and loudly . . . The first time Lance fell behind in his rent, Lance called the house, demanding that my father distribute pebbles over his driveway. \\"I'm not paying $300 a month to walk over crushed oyster shells,\\" he said. \\"It's bad for my tires and for my shoes, and before you get any more of my money, I want something done.\\"Distributing pebbles over Lance's driveway meant distributing pebbles over everyone's driveway, and it surprised us all when my father agreed.\\"I'm not talking cheap pebbles, either,\\" Lance said. \\"I want the nice kind.\\"\\"You mean gravel,\\" my father said.\\"Yeah. That.\\" . . .A dump truck was sent . . . Lance paid his rent and called a few months later, complaining that birds were congregating in the tree outside his bedroom window. Had they been vultures, we may have seen his point, but these were songbirds, whose only crime was happiness . . ._________________________Sedaris' dry wit and humor make his series of essays very engaging. Some of the essays were troubling because they dealt with very serious subject matter and dysfunction beyond belief. However, he has managed to bring to life all of the things we experience in everyday life, but with a twist, has made them laugh-out-loud funny by describing them in a way that you may not have looked at them before.I would highly recommend this book to lift your spirits!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The saga of the eccentric Sedaris family continues in David Sedaris's next book, \\"Dress Your Family in Denim and Corderoy\\". Here we meet a few characters glossed over in previous stories and the continuation of his established ones. His sister Tiffany, only mentioned as window dressing in past stories, is reveiled as the perhaps the oddest of them all. A reformed runaway who tried to remove her braces with pilers, she makes her living as a junk scavenger and sometimes chef. And his brother The Rooster. How could you not laugh your head off at his antics? His home was the home of a confused clown equiped with barking dogs, mechanical farting sounds, and even a rooster embeded into the floor. The Rooster preforms his most daring feat yet, getting married and having a baby! Suddenly we see a kinder, gentler Rooster, still cursing like a drunken sailor but now in a much softer voice due to his newly aquired fatherhood. We also find out that Lou, his widower father, is still puttering around becoming weird and paranoid, saving money by taking the pet medication rather than his own.We also explore more of his relationship with Hugh, his long time boyfriend, and his continued adjustment to living in France. What a culture shock. He and Hugh have been together for ten years and while there aren't a whole lot of surprises left, their love for each other is obvious despite their banter.One thing that David mentioned was the trials of being a writer and having people act strange around him. That is most certainly true, I have experienced this as well. You write about people, and some get so bent out of shape about it even if your intention was anything but humorous and/or friendly. Hey, let the world beware. It's our art, not yours. And we make you famous, something you always wanted right?A wonderful, hilarious collection of stories and trains of thought. Dive in head first and you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I totally enjoyed this Sedaris book than Me Talk Pretty One Day. I felt that as a writer he became more mature and addressed his humor and sarcasm at the right moment, drawing laugh out loud conclusions and hilarious observations. It is so clever to be able to acknowledge your mistakes and way of life and make fun of yourself and Sedaris does amazingly well!The book is a collection of stories from his childhood and his life as a writer. Each story has its own glow and message, reading along you wonder if his family is the reason behind this comedian or that he sees life from a different prospect!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Loved this book! I laughed out loud in so many places, and by the time I was done I practically wanted to flip it over and read it again! Sure, it's an oddball book, but that's why I loved it. People who are easily offended or uptight probably aren't going to like this book. However, his sense of humor is so similar to mine that I'll be sure to pick up the rest of his books. VERY soon."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I was introduced to David Sedaris two years ago when my friend gave me a copy of Naked. Since then I have purchased all his books for myself and some of my friends. This book is halarious, entertaining, captivating. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was my first David Sedaris collection to read, but it won't be my last.I've worked in bookstores for a number of years, and have been told repeatedly, from people on either side of the counter, that I MUST read David Sedaris.He's so funny! I would often hear. Or, his essays are like chocolates that you just can't stop eating. He writes so truthfully about families. Everyone can relate.I respected the opinions of most of the people who were telling me these things, but I think I went so long without reading David Sedaris, with the knowledge that I SHOULD be reading him that I started to construct my own little defenses for why I hadn't gotten around to him.How could a large group of people all find the same thing funny without it necessarily being a watered-down least-common-denominator kind of funny, that despite people laughting at it, isn't actually funny at all?But I decided to finally confront my troubling preconceptions and put them in a brown paper bag with Sedaris's latest book itself, shake them up hard and see what came out.Well, see here's the thing...if you haven't read David Sedaris yet, you have to. He's so funny! His essays are like chocolates...I feel like a character in Invasion of the Body Snatchers after I've been taken out to the shed.But here it's David Sedaris, who may or may not be a space alien from a planet of born storytellers, who did the bewitching himself.Yes, he's funny. He's very funny. He manages it, by being truthful, incisive, witty, and by being himself.He does write well about the family, and it's something that everyone will relate to, and will find some different authentic way to laugh at.David Sedaris is a gifted writer, well worth your time and more than equal to any seemingly superlative hype heaped upon him."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If one is familiar with any of David Sedaris' previous works (\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", \\"Naked\\"), then there really are no surprises with \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.\\" That doesn't mean this novel cannot be enjoyed, because the novel is inherently engaging, inherently insane and comedic. That's what's not surprising - Sedaris' ability to connect with his readers into his pleasurably dysfunctional family. He maintains this consistently with all of his novels; thus, more of his short-story narratives are certainly welcome.I don't know how to explain it plainly enough...It's like a diary of anyone else's family, only brutally honest...and possibly on LSD.\\"Dress Your Family\\" is well written, yet a fast read that can be tackled in a few hours. Despite his famed appearances on NPR, Sedaris keeps the family wardrobe politically uncharged with an arguable exception of \\"Chicken in the Henhouse,\\" although his opinions are more than subtle. Loved by many, despised by congregations of Baptists, persons suffering from homophobia, and those who hold a sincere disdain for idiosyncrasy, the book is worth paging through, even if your friends and family cringe as they stare confusedly at Barbie doll cover."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The new collection by David Sedaris, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, is a return to the high level Sedaris achieved in his first two collections, Barrell Fever and Naked.Dress Your Family is mostly focused on Sedaris's family - primarily his youth spent with his alcoholic mother, sisters, brother, and very Greek father. The passages about this time in his life are a brilliant mix of comedy and poignancy. There are also essays about his current life in France with his partner Hugh and visits he makes as an adult with his now grown siblings.There are not very many points in the collection that are laugh-out-loud-funny, but that serves the material very well. There are inevitable comparisons made between Sedaris and our other prominent gay memoirist, Augusten Burroughs. While Burroughs's work is of the laugh out loud variety, I would prefer to read Sedaris any day of the week. The writing here is very elegant and never ventures into the absurd. Sedaris has a much drier sense of humor which I personally find much more engaging. These stories also have a depth that we don't see in Burroughs.Altogether, an excellent collection. Recommended."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If you enjoyed &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; then you will like this book. Although it is a little more serious... with personal stories from Sedars' struggles in life. But it still has laugh out loud situations.I listened to both books, read by the author, which made the stories feel even more personal."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I was laughing out loud at the first several chapters. The author writes with a natural and flowing style that brings to life a childhood filled with the kind of everyday bumps and spills that are both hopeful and sad at the same time.This is a book that goes everywhere and nowhere. While the family and situations are depicted with a harsh reality that grabs the reader, and hooks you into the emotion, by the end of the book you are simply glad it is not your life. I found it ultimately to be just depressing. The childhood scenes are wonderful, but the promise of the future contained within is never fulfilled. Realistic I suppose, but not a lot of fun to read about.No question that David is a talented writer, and has a great style, but I guess I missed the point here. 5 stars for a wonderfully written book, but minus a few for the fact that the book really doesn't go anywhere except to jab at anything doesn't fully embrace the lost and meaningless lifestyle depicted here."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"From great anticipation comes greater disappointment. I don't even think that Sedaris was trying to pull together another set of unbearably funny stories. The settings and characters are certainly familiar, but here they are morbid, tepid, and even a bit contrived. His snaggletoothed humor is almost entirely absent; I didn't even crack a smile. In fact, I found myself cringing a few times. Oy.Will I unhesitatingly read David Sedaris again? Absolutely. I just won't suffer from the wait this time."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day was much more interesting. This was a little dry and drawn out. Had to retire it halfway through do to boredom."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"A huge fan has been let down. I found most of the stories sad - pathetic - depressing - and kept getting the creeping feeling that Mr. Sedaris is mining for gold in a place where all the nuggets have already been removed. One HUGE laugh in the chapter about snow in the Carolinas (his name for muddy snowmen); the chapter on his brother's wedding was also hilarious. The rest were odd, creepy, and left me feeling somewhat dirty."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is my favorite modern author by far. This book of short stories is outstanding. So far my favorite story is The Girl Next Door, I'm taking my time reading this book, it's too good to use up in one night."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I quote this book more than I quote seinfield. I have become addicted to it, to David's twisted use of the English language. I have read all of his other books, and I highly recommend his cds."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Loved the book - love the author. Don't read this book in bed with anyone else - your laughter will keep them awake."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Belly laughs and somber thoughts resonate in this quilted family history of Sedaris and his numerable siblings.Growing up with eccentric parents would be an understatement. Having numerous children, whose personalities appear to have little in common, results from this unique situation. Some are neatniks, some are slobs, some are homosexual, some are homophobic, some are rednecks, some are francophiles, . . .Being his sister or brother, we learn, is no laughing matter in some of these often too revealing stories: his sister is thrust into a reform school where her punishments include lying belly down for hours on the ground with mouth open to facilitate an extremely warped warden who putts golf balls into the open orifice. One sibling said life as his sister is most traumatic when horrified to hear there may be a movie about his family revelations -- and she knows many more people watch movies than would ever read his books.At times, the stories read like stand up comic routines, viewing different people in a different person's perspective.Mr. Sedaris, as different as he sometimes can be, has visions similar to a child. Often focusing slowly on the matter which exists strikingly before him, he clears his perspective and describes the crystal vision he conceives -- something which we would never see, even in a blur.If you want easy reading which gives you easy laughs, buy and read this book. It may not be a classic, but it is a barrel of laughs."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Being the first David Sedaris book I've ever picked up, I didn't quite know what to think when I first checked it out from the library. But after hearing it raved about by my friends and being highly allured by the cover, I decided to give it a try. Reading this book turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in a very long time. I found myself cracking up at stories like \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\", \\"Baby Einstein\\" and \\"Monie Changes Everything.\\" I often laughed so hard I received very curious stares from those around me.David Sedaris is not only hilarious and entertaining, but also a very talented writer who knows how to weave a story unlike any others.

Sedaris is talented to a degree but can't seem to control his racism. His disrespect for people of color seems to seep out in other works and of course in this one it tends to come out sooner or later. The comments about how shocked he is to see \\"white servants\\", how the snow fall in a town he lived in was so light that he and his sisters would try to make snow men but they would turn to mud so they &#8220;would name them snow negros&#8221; or how (in his other CD live at Carnegie Hall) he mentions while telling the Dutch myth about Santa Clause that \\"most white Americans would barricade their homes and arm themselves with everything they had if they thought '6-8 black men&#8217; with or without Santa Clause would be entering their houses&#8221;.Other comments in his book include nonchalant remarks like, \\"De-segregation seemed to drive all of the cool kids to go to the private schools.\\"He reminds me a bit of Dave Savage, another gay man who makes racist or at the very least racially insensitive comments on a consistent basis.Yet these same individuals want acceptance and non-prejudice shown towards themselves...humph. Sad but true and unbelievable.My humble advice--avoid these types of hypocrites in print, film and your daily lives at ALL COSTS. If you must check out their so-called \\"work\\" &#8211; do what I did...check it out at your local library so you won't be giving these hypercritical creeps one red cent of your hard earned money."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"...but couldn't bear to read another word. I've neverread any other Sedaris work, and was a bit disapointedby this book. Too much talk about his sexuality for itto be funny (unless he's trying to use his sexuality ashumor; are we supposed to think the fact that he's gayis funny?? I think not).I left my copy in a hotel room, perhaps the maidthere will see the humor in David's cleaning servicestory - I sure didn't (utterly gross!)I will try Me Talk Pretty...since most people herespeak highly of it. I have heard from other folksthis guy is hilarious...that remains to be seen."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The wittiest parts are in the first 3 chapters. Other than that, don't bother. This is the sad story of the product of a dysfunctional, estranged family who has many opportunities through gifts, trusts and other money sources to find his potential, get an education and make his contribution to society. Instead, through drugs, homosexuality and extreme self-absorbtion, he descends into a sad, wasted life. I regret buying this book. Again, don't bother."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is simply awful. With the exception of a funny bit about his redneck brother that shows up on disc 4, this is just a sad story of a twisted individual. He goes on about his dyfunctional family, how he has urges to touch little boys on the head, playing strip poker with his naked and unsuspecting pre-pubescent friends, lying to his family, and all sorts of other wierdness. I thought this was supposed to be funny.... instead it just made me sick. Save your money."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The only good thing I can say about this book is that it gave me a lot of strange and scary things to ponder. The author rambles for several chapters, then takes the reader along for his silly interpretation of 'family' life. If only the world were like him, he imagines that everything would be okay. Sedaris is flagrantly self-absorbed and immature. A truly disappointing read."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The book arrived with a slip jacket that looked dirty and there was a slit on the spine of it - it looked as though it had been cut with an exacto knife. Other than that it was in good condition."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David. If you're reading this, I just want to say to take a day off for yourself without trying to contrive a story. Take a few. We as your fans won't mind because we know that if you took these days off you might actually come across one of those situations that really are funny without it seeming contrived. I like the stories about your youth, but then it makes me think you're living in the past. I like the stories about Europe and Hugh... try to focus on that - the stuff you're doing right now, more. Get out more... have some fun and talk to the little people. It would be good material.Everyone who says your latest book was absolutely fantastic is just trying to either get in your pants or flatter you. Or both. I paid full price for this book and I am unemployed.... you can't imagine the disappointment I felt upon reading this silly story about ignoring Hugh so you could listen to some idiots talk about a can of worms who survived an explosion but if only they could talk about it. Or the one where you got kicked of your house and didn't know it was because y our father disapproved of your sexuality. Save that for the after school special, babe. This is so far below your ability. I only laughed a few times because this book contained a serious depletion of humor in comparison to your previous books. ANd I thought you were progressing, that you had made the breakthrough and it was all uphill from here. Nope. This is far below what you're capability. Take those days off, man!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I and my friends have never got this type of writing. Maybe we are aliens, or maybe you have to be from New York or something. It alls seems very unconvincing from a human perspective. No one we know acts or feels this way. It's like a Hollywood movie script where there are no parameters in reality. Surely humor is funny because it is based on actual human experience. Sedaris seems like he made the whole thing up. No one could have a family with this much dysfunction. I don't understand the adulation and even Carnegie Hall readings. As I say, maybe it's a New York thing."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The author's latest work is not his funniest to date(that honor still goes to \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\"), it is however a wry, absurd, laugh out loud look at the bizarre world that is the life of David Sedaris. My favorite by far was \\"Put a Lid on It\\". David's description of his sister's apartment was so funny it left me howling, and the book is worth reading for this story alone. \\"Baby Einstein\\" and \\"Repeat After Me\\" are also priceless in their hilarity. If you love David Sedaris, this work will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I absolutely teared up in amusement while reading, and re-reading Sedaris' \\"Me talk Pretty One Day\\" and highly anticipated DYFIC&D, however it did not live up to his previous work.

Sedaris is such a talent"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris, playwright and NPR commentator, returns with another collection of short stories for grownups. Sedaris creates childhood scenes of rebellion, love, misunderstanding, and more among families and friends. Through description, witty dialogue, and dry humor, the author reveals a distinctive view of growing up in middle class America. Some may consider it a literary version of TV's \\"Malcom in the Middle\\" -- childhood dilemmas and a child's lucid observations about immature grownups.Three stories stand out to me. In \\"Let it Snow,\\" a mom locks the rowdy kids out during a snow day. \\"The Ship Shape\\" shows kids watching the promise of a summer home shrink day by day. And the dad in \\"Full House\\" forces his son to join a slumber party, and the son realizes just how different he really is from the neighborhood jocks.David Sedaris reads the audio version of his book. The added inflections, especially those of the mother, are priceless."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I had my idependent bookstore rush an order of Dress Your Family. I couldn't wait until I got a copy..NOW, I wish I had waited. It simply doesn't pack the punch of David's other books. Its routine. Its been done before. David is in danger of taking advantage of his many readers. He is clearly talented, but this book simply doesn't take chances. I know he can do better than this."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I always enjoy listening to Mr. Sedaris, usually when I'm driving and catch him on some public radio station. Here he has a new book with a terribly clever title as well as a hooty photograph of a mannequin on the jacket cover. Mr. Sedaris then proceeds to dress his family. We can only hope that he is being hyperbolic in some of his outrageous descriptions of his parents and siblings or he may not get invited back to a Thanksgiving dinner any time soon. If one of his sisters indeed is actually named \\"Tiffany\\", then of course she'll never make it in a world outside of a trailer park. Surely no heterosexual brother, even on his worst day, can be as big a pig as Sedaris' brother Paul who makes sure that his bride-to-be's dogs are a part of his wedding. She comes down the aisle in silence-- the DJ is stuck in traffic so there is no Wagner or Cat Stevens or whoever to serenade her-- followed by a pack of dogs.Mr. Sedaris can go from the humorous to the achingly painful in short order. His description of being moved out of his parents' home by his father at the age of twenty-two, not because he was a bum but because he was gay, will break your heart--as it did his mother's. His gentle reveries of his life with his lover Henry and their patterns of dullness will make you smile. Sedaris' father's wanting him to punch out a school bully when the writer spends his weekends making banana nut muffins instead of excelling the \\"art of hand-to-hand combat\\" will amuse you. His description of his playing strip poker at a slumber party for him and his friends in the sixth grade is hilarious.What is not funny-- not funny at all-- is Mr. Sedaris' account of his visit to the home of Anne Frank in Amsterdam. He opines that he has found the perfect apartment and would love to move in and redecorate. \\"The entire building would have been impractical. . . but the part where Anne Frank and her family had lived. . . was exactly the right size and adorable. . .\\" The writer couldn't be more wrong. When I visited this home, I was taken aback at how small the Frank family's hiding quarters were and how so many people survived there for so long.I have no trouble with gallows humor-- if that's what Mr. Sedaris is striving for in the Anne Frank fiasco-- but he falls flat on his face here in what is otherwise for the most part an amusing book. To compare him to Mark Twain and Nathanael West, as someone in \\"The New Yorker\\" does, is a bit of a stretch too. On the other hand some commentator recently compared Johnny Cash to Mark Twain as well. Perhaps I'm the one who is out of step here."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I wish I could have given this book three and one-half stars instead of three. Barring that, I couldn't bring myself to round up to the nearest star and give it four. This is a quick read, as are most of Mr. Sedaris's works, but it definitely is not as edgy as some of his earlier efforts. However, the author seems to have matured in some respects: he is more willing to delve into darker topics without making them a vehicle for sarcasm, and more willing to view people and situations with ambiguity. Both of these qualities work to blunt the incisive wit one expects from David Sedaris. This book was less laugh-out-loud, but you may come away appreciating the depth of feeling and hints of genuine frustration with his family that are all-so-real. On that note I must add that his brother, Paul, comes off as one of the most wretched, annoying, and crass individuals I have ever had the misfortune to meet on paper. The bit with the dogs was especially nasty - too much information - and, given what any semi-educated person living in the Western World with a pulse should know about how disease is spread, and the decency with which we should always aspire to treat animals, particulary our pets, Paul does not seem like the idiot-savant the author would humorously have us believe, but a man who lacks any redeeming qualities and is genuinely worth not getting to know."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have heard David Sedaris on National Public Radio and always really liked his stuff. He's funny and clever, and I was really looking forward reading one of his books.But Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is terrible. Most of the time it feels like he is confessing things he knows are reprehensible, but with a contemptuous adolescent, remorseless tone. It is perverse, really. As the narrator of the book, he says cruel, racist, petty things about just about everyone else he mentions in the book with no trace of humor or irony. I hate to say it, but he seems like just an ugly person.The book made me uncomfortable to read, and at the second reference to how surprised he was at seeing \\"white servants\\", I took it back to the store. There are too many inspiring, challenging books in the world to waste time reading something like this. I can't speak for his other books, and I still like him on NPR, but pass on this one, friends."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Received the book as a gift from my mother. I echo the concerns of other disappointed readers. Only &quot;6 to 8 Black Men&quot; made me laugh out loud. He paints his family in an unusually unflattering light - I grew weary of reading about how much coffee and wine his mother drank. The story about Anne Frank's apartment seemed out of place.Still, I recognize and respect what went into the book, and, like another reviewer, find it provocative. I'm not willing to abandon Sedaris based on one book. And I hope to experience the audio version."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris has always been a favorite of mine and like his other books, this one is just as funny and entertaining. Love it!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is the first David Sedaris book I ever read, and after reading his other books, this is still my favorite. The best story is \\"six to eight black men\\". I can't even tell people about that story without laughing so hard that I have tears in my eyes. I was often reading this book while in a public place, and it caused the awkward situation of laughing out loud in public!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book was a good read. At times I was bored with the writer, but over all it was a great book!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've enjoyed Dave Sedaris's work since I first heard an abridged reading of SantaLand Diaries on NPR several years ago. I loved the unabridged and somewhat edgier version even more. I have enjoyed every one of his essay collections. His delivery, written and spoken, is unique.On the other hand, I am no Sedarista. While some of his pieces are funny or touching or thoughtful or odd, others are a bit creepy. I first read The Girl Next Door in The New Yorker and it was disturbing, not only because of the strange family he describes, but because of his own behavior. It was no less disturbing a second time around.All but one of the essays in this collection have appeared before, in magazines or on radio. The single essay that seems to be newly published here is Chicken in the Henhouse, funny in places, but it left me uneasy in the same way that The Girl Next Door did.These essays have Sedaris's family as their theme. Apparently the family member who is most comfortable in his own skin is his younger brother, Paul, a Southern redneck who surrounds himself with clutter and dogs. Sedaris never mentions that his sister Amy is also a writer. There are funny lines and conversations, but I wouldn't categorize this as a humor collection. His previous collections have included mainstream funny essays with more serious and unsettling pieces. This collection contains nothing like SantaLand Diaries or Me Talk Pretty One Day and Jesus Shaves, two fabulous essays about the trials of learning French, and trying to explain, with limited vocabulary, why an egg-laying bunny is the symbol of Easter in America. The pieces in Dress Your Family are a little too honest and revealing to be comfortably funny.But I read every word. Sedaris's writing is clean and spare. He doesn't waste any words. These essays, as effortless as they read, must have required merciless editing on Sedaris's part to remove every unnecessary word, and to make every phrase just the right one.Which is why I am still puzzling over the title. There is no essay called Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, nor is there any reference to corduroy or denim. Perhaps it has to do with the French origin of the words? Maybe the reason is so obvious that when someone tells me what it means, I'll smack my forehead and feel like a dope. But meanwhile, I'm stumped."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"A naked Barbie Doll adorns the cover, yet this autobiographical bestseller is about a boy growing up with a Greek background and a mismatched family, all while dealing with his homosexuality. The chapters express only a few memorable stories, yet have distinctively affected Sedaris' life. The stories include embarrassing moments where his father confronts the most popular guy's dad about a rock throwing incident, and also anecdotes of his redneck brother on a quest to buy all the baby paraphernalia he can buy, even before his wife goes to the doctor. The seasons of Sedaris' life are all accounted for, from childhood to drug addiction to life in France with his boyfriend. Overall, Sedaris is able to capture the reader with undeniable wit and true to life tales.In the very first chapter of the book, Sedaris introduces the reader to his humor with a bit of childhood innocence. A family who \\"doesn't believe in T.V.\\" trick-or-treats at the Sedaris Household on the day after Halloween. Sedaris' mother insists that the children produce pieces of their own \\"earned\\" candy. When much time elapses, his mother enters his room and begins to snatch Necco wafers, \\"\\"Not those,\\" [he] pleaded, but rather than words, [his] mouth expelled chocolate, which fell onto the sleeve of her sweater. She shook her arm, and the mound of chocolate dropped like a horrible turd upon [his] bedspread\\". The crude humor and inclusion of \\"turd\\" appeals to many readers, mainly because it comes from a real child's thoughts. This scene is the first hint of madness in Sedaris' life. The story, including the humor, makes him contemplate the family who doesn't watch T.V. for months, and in turn learns that television is a way to distract himself from his own issues and problems with his family.The humor continues throughout the book in the seventeenth chapter when his crazed sister finds a turkey in the trash, then cooks and eats it. Sedaris must learn to balance his high-class integrity with his connection to his sister who eats out of the trash. The reader learns about what type of man he has become through his sister's sarcastic comment, \\"Listen to you. If it didn't come from Balduccci's, if it wasn't raised on polenta and wild baby acorns, it has to be dangerous\\". The reader understands how his obsessive compulsive personality has affected his relationships with his family. He also grows more and more into the homosexual stereotype. The obvious comedy found in eating a turkey that has been thrown away for a reason is a signature of Sedaris. While his book is nonfiction, the bluntness of his writing makes for more humor in these types of situations.In every chapter, Sedaris takes real life accounts and formulates them into a good read. Laughing out loud while reading each chapter is quite common and this bestseller is very promising. It can change a bad mood into a good one. Sedaris really will strike your funny bone."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris opens up his family album to allow us to wander through the pages of someone else's history. I appreciate my own family more, now that I've read David Sedaris' musings. Wisdom comes in many disguises, in this case it came decked out in corduroy and denim. I ended up asking myself, \\"What is normal life? \\" after reading this book. Surely the aim of any writer is to inspire their readers to ask questions. Sadly, I haven't found the asnswer, but I continue to ask."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is the first book I've read by David Sedaris, and I am stupid for that. He is hilarious. This collection of short stories detail small moments in his life, ranging from childhood to present, all engaging and funny. Watch as his redneck brother applies bacon to his face (the grease holds it on there) in order to fake having huge sideburns shortly before his wedding. Read as his mother gives a dead-on but sometimes brutal running commentary on David's early 20's apartment life, and his dad drags 11 year old David to the most popular guy in school's house to demand payment on dental work done after the popular guy threw rocks at David and messed up his teeth. David always feels like he doesn't belong, doesn't feel comfortable, doesn't know what to say, but really he does all three. Witty, secretly insightful, and amazingly able to zing you with tiny, short sentences and segments that add up to a greater whole."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris is at his best in this book. More semi-autobiographical tales with his trademark dry humor will leave you wanting more. A good book for someone who doesn't have time to read long stories, the chapters are relatively short. As I am in several classes where I have to read over 100 pages a day, this is kind of like a snack for me, something that's not British and from the 1800s to enjoy."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I'm not saying I blame him for doing it, because I don't, but I do feel bad for his poor family. In this book David Sedaris takes them through the ringer and the byproduct is a collection of hilarious, insightful, fascinating stories that I could recommend to anyone. What better source material than our families do any of us have, and he knows this better than anyone as nearly everyone of the stories has them in the starring role. Early on the tone is light as his childhood basks in something of a golden glow, he doesn't get along with his parents, per se, but of course they are right and he is wrong because they are the parent and he is the kid. However, as the book progresses and we dig deeper into his life I was jarred by the dark turns the tales began to take. His disagreements with his parents suddenly have a nasty edge to them. His mom might mean well, but she is judgmental and just a tool of his dad. His dad, on the other hand, is outright aggressive, spitting on everything about him; his homosexuality, his place of residence, his lifestyle choices in general. And while his dad's anti-gay rants make him look bad, Sedaris is also exposing himself to us through them. This is what his dad truly thinks and here is an example of his family not approving of him.My two favorite stories were \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Six to Eight Black Men.\\" \\"Us and Them\\" is the opener and involves his crazy neighbors who, get this, don't have a TV. The wit in the story was making me envious, and the fact that I didn't see my life in the same humorous light was making me feel silly. \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" is Sedaris getting back in touch with his roots as he tells a Christmas story with some cultural misunderstandings thrown in for good measure. A lot of the jokes seemed somewhat obvious but I didn't mind, I just went along for the ride. I also liked how he doesn't shy away from racial humor here. Racial jokes have survived the test of time because racial jokes are funny, and for Sedaris to turn his back on a funny joke would be doing a disservice to his readers.As I read through I started to notice how much control he had over each story structure and the prose within. The tone he takes may be conversational, but the way the exposition is laid down perfectly and the foreshadowing boomerangs back around makes you realize that they have all been well thought out. I whipped through the entire book in just a few days which says two things to me: it is kind of fluffy and it is a ton of fun. To Sedaris the world doesn't really reach much further than his domestic situation at any given point so don't look for any real social or political humor. And to me that says that he at least content with his life, sure he lives in Paris for some reason, but good for him. The book is more of the same from Sedaris, but I think you will agree that that is a good thing. My only concern now is what happens when he inevitably runs out of new stories to tell? How many more occurrences from his childhood can there be left that he can take and construct comic gold out of? Oh well, for now enjoy this book which I highly recommend. ***3/4"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I read this book while driving from southern cali to central cali. It was so hilarious that I ended up reading chapters out loud to my husband. I love Sedaris' sense of humor about his family and was also able to put the pieces together about his family from other memoirs he's written. He is a gem."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"First of all, I don't see why Amazon would print a reveiw by someone like David Smith who admittingly only read 4 pages of the book. I'm a big David Sedaris fan from way back. My favorite book of his is \\"Barrell Fever.\\" That book had me not only laughing out loud, but calling friends and reading them entire essays. His childhood recollections in this book are funny, particularly when they involve his sisters, but this one, for me, wasn't as entertaining as the other books. And this one felt too short, as well. Regardless, David Sedaris is a great writer and a great performer. I saw him live once and got the change to meet him afterwards and he lives up to his talent. As for Mr Smith who called him a young pretentious writer, David is at least in early 40's. Trust me there are much younger and more pretentious writers out there. And had he taken the time to read the book he would find out, that unlike many memiors, this book does not ask for any pity or sympathy even in his worst of times. He's simply showing you how he and his family have always been able to find the humor in even the darkest of moments. There's nothing pretentious abou that."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I am open minded enough to see where some people would enjoy this. I'm a fan of dark comedy, but I need a little more kindness and a little less indifference and a little more depth and humanity than the Sedaris family exhibits. Fans of the movies \\"Happiness\\"and \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse,\\" would probably enjoy Sedaris. I find him interesting, but depressing. I did laugh hysterically at the 6-8 black men story. That was a big relief after the selfish, sad lives I kept reading about before that story came up about 2/3 of the way into the book."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Rehash. A few fun moments, but we've been here before. I wish Sedaris would apply his wit to new material. This just seems like a scheme by publishers to squeeze a few more dollars out of a very profitable franchise. Damn shame. We fans deserved better."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I see that there are some mixed reviews of this new book - 'Corduroy and Denim' and I come down on the critical side. I must qualify this by saying that David Sedaris' other books are the funniest that I have ever read. 'Me Talk Pretty' had me in stitches, belly-laughing the whole time. The new book is more depressing than funny. Also, it seems to me that David has gone from integrating his homosexuality (and sexuality in general) into the stories as a contextual element to using it as graphic focus that is not particularly funny. With that said, I wonder if gay readers find more humor in the more explicit style - maybe I am just not the target audience for this book...Anyhow, I love Sedaris and hope that his next book goes back to the laugh-out-loud style."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris is the type of person who I find both amusing and creepy. His cause has been taken up by the Eastern literary establishment (New Yorker, Esquire, etc.), so I guess we are stuck with him forever. His humor is based on his willingness to reveal himself as selfish, self-absorbed, shallow, lacking in any human decency. We laugh at his chutzpah. He visits the Ann Frank museum and lusts to turn it into a an apartment for himself, completely dismissing its historical importance to so many (who cares about Ann Frank when he could turn it into a townhouse that would make his friends jealous?). A wealthy, elderly aunt is written about as being nothing more than a grotesque but potentially important source of $$$. This is funny stuff - in small doses. But there is a Howard Stern-like creepiness to the guy. He has a compulsion (that is so intense that it makes him sweat) to touch the heads of strangers - even small boys. He seems to think that his shallowness and selfishness are forgiveable because he admits to them (in other words, \\"the only sins not forgiven are those that are hidden\\" - the rationale of trash tv talk shows). He has an unwholesome and manipulative friendship with a lonely young girl. I began to wonder: what if he really IS as materialistic, self-centered, creepy, and vulgar as he makes out? I suspect that this might be true. In that case, Sedaris isn't so much a funny send-up as he is a pathetic, stunted person."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I can't quite catch where this book came from or where it was going - unlike other Sedaris books - this book is more like a collection of short stories and thoughts than a theme explored.His mother is clearly a focus throughout the book - and the ways in which Sedaris related to his mother while she was alive. More, he seems to explore his understanding of her now that she is dead. Other books have allowed his father to lead as the &quot;character&quot; that was being studied. Sedaris seems to be looking at himself and seeing the things in him that are distinctly from his mother.There is, as expected, that dry, almost painful humor that had me chuckling as I read along. It is the kind of humor that you just can't pass along to someone in a line, should someone ask, &quot;What's so funny?&quot;That person really needs to follow Sedaris from the beginning of each story and ... well, maybe have an awareness that there's a little of this life in each of us.One thing: this book is much more painful and self-revealing than much of Sedaris's previous work. The humor is sometimes overwhelmed by this tone."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Less laugh-out-loud funny than his previous efforts, but somehow more satisfying in its examination of family and the ties that bind. Sedaris is an amazing wit and his ability to pare down a situation - none of which are all that significant in and of themselves, but all of which any reader can relate to - into its essential elements for the purposes of commentary and observation, is second to none.A superb collection from a master."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Another winner by David Sedaris. I am so enjoying getting to know this writer. In this book, we learn a bit more about his family. His mother sounds like an absolutely fabulous woman, someone I probably would have gotten along with very well. (In the hilarious \\"Let it Snow\\" essay, she efficiently kicks the children out of her house during a snow day, desperate for some peace and quiet. And in \\"The Girl Next Door,\\" she casually mocks her son's correction of her own Chinese menu interpretations. \\"Oh, he speaks Chinese now! Tell me, Charlie Chan, what's the word for six straight hours of vomiting and diarrhea?\\") The details of his siblings' lives are also recounted, and Sedaris guiltily acknowledges his own vulture-like tendencies to turn private family moments into public reading material. Funny, funny, funny."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I had read the Barrel essays and loved them. I bought the audio CD for this book, and was nervous that someone speaking out loud was not going to be as entertaining as reading the essays myself. Turns out they are even funnier when Sedaris reads them!Not every story is funny, and I agree some are a bit graphic and/or boring, but there are some hysterical, laugh out loud pieces in here, and I suspect you will find some stories you can play over and over again during future car trips. My favorite was the one about the family that had no idea how to behave in society because they did not watch televison. Another favorite was the woman with two houses.Note for Dave Sedaris fans: This audio CD contains many, many stories that are not on the Dave Sedaris compilation audio CD set. I think that one runs $50 dollars or so these days. I bought that and was disappointed to discover that the compilation CD is definitely one which must be a \\"best of\\" set from his other audio CD books. In retrospect, I would buy each audio CD book separately to ensure I get all the stories."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is a great book. My one complaint is that I've noticed a slight change in tone this time. He can be a little smug. I'll explain...In Sedaris' earlier books, he presents stories about the pre-famous David Sedaris. The description of his struggles as a writer/artist/son/brother were hilarious and bittersweet. The newer material from him feels like he is more aware of himself as an accomplished writer. It still works, just not quite as well. I understand that he writes non-fiction about his life, and we can't fault him for being successful. This new tone is most evident in his story about visiting the Anne Frank house. He writes about his obsession with finding the perfect place to live, and how this place would be really great. Not funny.This didn't ruin the whole book for me. I enjoyed the story about his brother's wedding the most. The stories about his brother, \\"Rooster,\\" are always hysterically funny.Check out \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" \\"Naked,\\" and \\"Holidays on Ice\\" before picking this one up. If that doesn't give you your full Sedaris fix, order \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.\\""},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"In the stories found here there seems to be a bittersweet element that was not as prevalent in Sedaris's previous collections. The last lines in \\"Repeat After Me\\" are \\"Forgive me.\\" The confused guy saved by his mother from the machinations of a disturbed \\"Girl Next door\\" is not the Sedaris that we're used to seeing. Don't get me wrong there are some extremely funny pieces here, not the least of which is the odd assignment he undertakes in \\"Blood Work,\\" or the mouse drowning, lost tourist tale of \\"Nuit of the Living Dead.\\" But it is the softer, more personal pieces that stick with you; stories of his that end with lines like,\\"Instead I pulled my chair a few inches closer, and we sat silently at our little table on the square, looking for all the world like two people in love.\\""},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"My sister really enjoys David Sedaris' books. I gave her this book for xmas. While not as laugh out loud funny as her fave book Naked, she told me she still recommends it to anyone who enjoys laughing at themselves and their family."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I started reading this book on the train home from work one evening and got to a part where I just could not stop laughing that I was almost crying. But since I was on the train and sitting next to strangers who were sleeping, I was trying really hard not to laugh too loud... So imagine, I'm about to pee my pants from laughing and at the same time trying to hold back the tears, one hand over my mouth... I looked crazy. Best Sedaris I've read so far (out of 4), looking forward to all the rest."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I seem to love the Sedaris sense of humour. Once again David Sedaris makes me laugh-out-loud with his observations on life. This book is a collection of short stories of David recalling his life and family as he was growing up.I really enjoyed this book about the happenings of the Sedaris family."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I just reread this at my dad's over the holidays and laughed all over again. I think I enjoyed it more the second time around. As many have mentioned, not as many belly laughs in this one compared to his earlier books, but still plenty to smile about."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The book is awesome. I will definitely be ordering more from this autheor and his sister. I will also be sharing with friends."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris's gift is the uncanny ability to turn ordinary events into loosely strung together, laugh-out-loud prose. There is no overarching theme.Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denimis merely a collection of very short stories, semi-autobiographical. The goal is neither accuracy nor moralism. Themes include family, homosexuality, neurosis, prejudice, and long-term relationships, among others. Even the title itself has no discernible relation to the contents.The amazing thing is that Sedaris has a half-dozen or more books in almost identical formats and with similar themes. Still, there is enough material for each to be worth reading and laughing over. It's almost impossible to review his work without extensive quotation. How can a story about a compulsion to touch people's heads be summarized, except in the author's own unique voice. The most memorable chapter is titled \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" in reference to Dutch Christmas imagery.Below is a short excerpt of that chapter, where he also discusses small talk in a new town:\\"What really interests me are the local gun laws. Can I carry a concealed weapon and, if so, under what circumstances? What's the waiting period for a tommy gun? Could I buy a Glock 17 if I were recently divorced or fired from my job? I've learned from experience that it's best to lead people into this subject as delicately as possible, especially if you and the local citizen are alone and enclosed in a relatively small area.\\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denimis a versatile, hilarious effort worth taking on the plane, the beach, or to the couch just before bedtime."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"It was a great book.....laugh out loud funny!Im looking for other books written by David Sedaris..."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book will help you look at your own family and smile because, if nothing else, they are yours. Sedaris finds humor with grace and ease in the sometimes painful quirks of his American family."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris did it again by writing down some of the funnier parts of our everyday lives that most of us wouldn't capture. Now Sedaris pulls from a strange set of family years, but I think most of us can relate to the stories which make them that much funnier!One of the best chapters is called \\"Six to Eight Black Men. I will have to Google this to see if it is true, but there couldn't have been a funnier Christmas Story. I'm pretty sure it is in another one of his books, or maybe I've read this one before and remember it, but none-the-less my side was hurting from the laughter!You will love the stories as they twist and turn so that you have a splitting side from Sedaris' views on life. The details of being kicked out of his family house, how his education was paid for from 'Aunt Monie, his secret crush on a boy that hit him with a rock resulting in the need for a root canal, to the vocabulary of a parrot, a mother who locked her children out of the house for some peace and quiet and much more. Each story will keep you turning the pages.I recommend this book fully, but the only thing you will be left wanting from this book is more; it goes quickly so checking it out from a library may save you some bucks."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I'm only giving this book three stars based on the fact that it in no way comes close to \\"Naked\\" or \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\". I love David's books and I will read anything this guy publishes. But based on my past experiences with Sedaris literature, this one lags far behind it's predecessors. Unfortunately for David Sedaris, he set the bar so high with \\"Naked\\" that it's so hard to top it. And that's a good thing.You won't be disappointed by this book at all. You just might not love it as much as his other work."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is no doubt one of the more enjoyable writers out there today, even if this book is more or less a continuation of his past works. The fourth time around (or is it fifth?) it just doesn't seem as fresh and sharp witted. But I'll still take this book over Dan Brown's anyday."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris has written yet another great book. When I heard that he had written it, I knew I had to get it. I won't say that it was disapointing though- because it certainly wasn't- but it wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as his previous works either. Still, if you are a David Sedaris fan, this is one that you need to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I didn't know anything about the author or the subject matter for this book when I began reading it. I liked the writing but didn't really laugh for the first third of the book. I guess that's because I identified with his family and the time period he grew up in. Although his family is not normal (whose is?) I didn't think they were outlandish. But as the book progressed I found it very funny and at the end, I was howling. I was reading in bed and was laughing so hard I couldn't even tell my husband what was so funny. I'm now looking forward to reading his other books, it is rare to find someone who can write humor in this way, it's substantial, touching, and funny."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was Sedaris's best book by far, which is saying a lot since his other ones were great too. I laughed out loud at least every few pages. One story even made me misty-eyed. I haven't enjoyed a book this much for a long time."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Holds insights into many of our hidden emotions. Very funny too."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I love David Sedaris' work, and this new book is no exception. Its focus is more on his family and their dynamics than previous books. This is a wonderful read, marked by humor and a graceful exploration of why we love each other in spite of the differences."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If you think you have a weird family, do yourself a favor and read this author's books. You'll never complain again. This is a genuine poster family for dysFUNctional. I've read all Mr. Sedaris' books and never fail to be amazed that his family still talks to him."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I can't believe how many people on here thought &quot;Me Talk Pretty One day&quot; was his best work. That was horrendous.It may be because I've gone to so many readings of Sedaris that I could hear his intonation, and that made it funny, but I thought this was hilarious. The Rooster as a father? The beach house that never was? If you've known the various charachters in Sedaris' family (and I do mean charachters) this is some quality reading-but I would not suggest it as an intro to his work. I really enjoyed this."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"DYFICAD is classic Sedaris, though with a bit more commentary on society and dark humor rather than his own personal family trevails. &quot;Six or Eight Black Men&quot; is classic--straight out of &quot;Me Talk Pretty...&quot;-- but some of the other stories leave a bit to be desired in terms of laugh out loud humor.I'd still highly recommend it to anyone who has the ability to read about an unfair, and often very, very disturbing society, with a calm and collected mind."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have every piece of anything David Sedaris has ever done , contributed to, or spoken. I rejoice in his funny, gross and down right morbid sense of the world and the people around him. I will walk through glass to hear him read. I first heard him on This American Life with Ira Glass years ago, and will support this book and every thing he has yet to come. His child hood experiences are really something that I can relate to. You take fear and the uncomfortable and make it somehow funny.He was once asked what it took to be a great writer, and his response was &quot; I like to think of myself as a great typist if any thing..)Enough said."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I was under the impression from just about every review of this book, that it was humorous in many ways, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was WAY off. Its not funny at all, and its more like an autobiography of the difficulties the author had growing up as a homosexual. There were few instances where I could even chuckle at the writting and although I will admit the author has some talent, the book should not be marketed as a funny bunch of essays, it is a straightforward, somewhat depressing, look at a difficult life."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Like many fans of his essays, I eagerly awaited the arrival of \\"Dress Your Family\\" in print. However, this anthology has proven a series of disappointments.The first disappointment was in realizing about one-third of the essays had already been published in \\"Esquire\\" or \\"Gentleman's Quarterly.\\" As I subscribe to both magazines, it was a blow to see the same essays on offer. In essence, Sedaris gets paid twice for the same effort if one buys this volume.The second blow came in the length of the essays. Most could be read in ten to fifteen minutes, hardly enough time to engage me as a reader and fully draw me into his idiosyncratic family.The death knell for this volume came in the few essays where Sedaris takes the spotlight off the doings of his family and focuses on himself. It's not endearing or quirky or cute to read of Sedaris's inner turmoil as a grown man to touch the back of the head (or any part, for that matter) of a small boy. Such an admission is very shaming to read. His alleged ruminations during a tour of Anne Frank's hiding place are lamentable.It may be assumed that I did not spend money on \\"Dress Your Family.\\" If I had, the waste would have been my fourth -- and largest -- disappointment.Sedaris can do better. Or, as some have proposed, perhaps the well of family anecdotes is running dry."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"My first exposure to David Sedaris was Barrel Fever, which I must have read nearly six or seven years ago. To this day, the imagery still springs immediately to mind of the middle class woman whose place in the household is usurped by the Asian housekeeper but still manages a cheery tone in the ubiquitous yearly holiday greeting letter; the bitter suicide who includes paperweights as mementos at her funeral and admonishes the attendees to use them to smite her ex- and his new girlfriend; and the little \\"o\\" that people's mouths make when they're told that their Christmas pictures with Santa will arrive in October of the next year.Similar hilarity ensued in Naked and Me Talk Pretty One Day. As a fellow French student, the idea that Mr. Sedaris bought everything in quantities of more than one to avoid learning the gender of nouns just kills me. In fact, in reading that story on the metro, I almost suffocated from laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. I can imagine Hugh's face as he scans the rotting produce on their kitchen counter because of Mr. Sedaris' avoidance of the singular.Thus, I eagerly opened DYFICAD, only to find that many of the stories I had already read in other publications--they were simply recycled material. Even if he is the \\"laziest man in showbiz\\", he shouldn't hoard his talent. He is truly the master of the dysfunctional when I consider the comparisons I could make between the wacky escapades of my family and those of his. C'mon, Fairy Poppins! Let your genius shine in your next offering."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Much of David Sedaris' collection, Dress Your Family in Denim and Corduroy, will be familiar to the reader, even those, like myself, who have not encountered the pieces in this volume as they originally appeared in print and on NPR. His two previous collections brought to life his family and the essays in this volume will not have any surprises for the reader where the Sedaris' family are concerned but one still feels the sharp humour and painfully sweet nostalgia on encountering them all over again, along with the further adventures of little David Sedaris. This volume does also include other types of stories and, for me, they worked generally as well as the more usual family and life in France essays. It is hard not to swallow this up in one sitting and that is not a bad thing."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"there's a matter of delivery. when i read mr. sedaris' writing, i can't help myself feeling that i'm missing a certain essence of the story. when i listen to him read, i get the 3-D stereo surround effect. he's a wicked writer, love the book as i loved other books of his, but it's just that he's a whole lot better when he reads. and he's even 100 miles better when he's on live, when you get the full effect of the interaction. he's one very rare author that i rather listen on CD than read, funny that, ain't it?"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have waited anxiously for any new work from this usually-hilarious author and made the mistake of buying his newest book as soon as it came out. It seems Mr. Sedaris may be going through a midlife crisis as the majority of the stories were very introspective and not at all funny. I was left with a feeling of sadness instead of the usual uplifting I recieve from the view of his unusual family and love lives. I would NOT recommend this to anyone looking for an amusement."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"There couldn't possibly be a funnier man on the planet. Wait, I love Stephen Colbert!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Why? Because you'll be laughing so hard that people will stare at you. This is one of the funniest books ever. I read it while I ate lunch at a restaurant and laughed so hard I cried!A Must-Read!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I fell in love with this book just a couple of pages in, which is usually a good sign. I really identify with Sedaris' style of writing in general, so I found this an incredibly easy-read. There are several parts where you will snicker out loud, and then maybe later you'll go back and re-read those spots just to giggle again.I keep this book out for a quick pick-me-up whenever the mood suits me."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I had never read something like this before.In my opinion, David Sedaris is a very talented man, he has such a creativity and imagination to narrate things and events in such a brutal, honest and unique way that just make it hilarious.It suprised me how peculiar his family is, and how different they all are from one another. But again, the way he tells the stories are just funny.I do recommend it if you want to get a few laughs out of it. ^_^"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sometimes the enjoyment of a book is increased or decreased by what was read before it. Much like a good bottle of wine compliments a meal, one book can compliment another. In this case I'd just finished a densely written, slow moving, character driven novel: Louis De Bernieres \\"Birds Without Wings.\\" So reading the light humorous fluff of David Sedaris right afterward was perfect. Sedaris is a funny guy with an excentric family. Or maybe they're all normal and he's eccentric. Either way he has a slanted point of view that is off-beat. The stories are short, as is the book, so it goes down like a tasty dessert. But his insights are spot on. In the story The End of the Affair he nails lasting relationships by writing, \\"Real love amounts to withholding the truth, even when you're offered the perfect opportunity to hurt someone's feelings.\\" This the second book of stories I've read by him but I look forward to the day when he really stretches himself and tackles a novel."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I can't say which book made me laugh out loud more - this one or Me Talk Pretty One Day. They are both hilarious. Dress Your Family... tends to tackle a few more serious topics - the death of his mother, drugs; and his adult relationships with both his family and his lover, as they attempt to build a life together in Paris.One of the things I love is: there are no boundaries for what Sedaris will write. Like his sister asking him not to make her \\"fat\\" in the book. He didn't necessarily have to - he found a loophole; he just quoted her.Sedaris captures the thoughts that - I'm sure - we've all had about our families, and he does so in a voice that never really seems to intentionally mock his loved ones. He's simply re-telling everyday events as they occurred; but with a sardonic, captivating perspective not easily articulated by the everyday man."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I loved Holiday on Ice so much that I had to read another short fiction collection by David Sedaris. Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, though not as dark or as hilarious as Holiday on Ice, is one clever collection that is somewhat autobiographical (based on his own family) that makes you laugh with what seems to be the author's signature quirks. Several of the stories have some amusing tales centered on family members, while others touch on some serious subject matter, and the ones that I enjoyed the most were \\"The Change in Me,\\" \\"The End of the Affair,\\" \\"Six to Eight Black Men,\\" \\"A Can of Worms,\\" \\"Rooster at the Hitchin' Post,\\" and \\"Monie Changes Everything.\\" Each story contains a great dosage of Sedaris's sharp humor and quirky language, which is what makes this collection such an enjoyable read. Again, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim isn't quite as hilarious as Holiday on Ice, but it is an amazing read in its own right and I cannot recommend this collection enough."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"What Sedaris does so well is to show his audience pictures. He doesn't just tell you about his family and the way he views them, he describes them so well that I found myself added to the story. I'm not actually in the book, but I felt ghostly close to the events that took place. I watched from the basement as he tells the other boys \\"It's against my religion to play poker.\\" I find myself in the backseat of the car as his mother asked \\"Do you want me to give you a ride back to your little shantytown?\\" Sedaris's humor is dry and sarcastic. He preys on the ignorance of others and himself, finding no person to sacred that they avoid his story pictures.The book is separated into 22 different short stories, ranging from his childhood to his midlife. The stories have no particular unifying theme, just glimpses into the David Sedaris experience, many which include his family. Most of the book's situations are treated light heartedly, with a dysfunctional undertone. What Sedaris does so well is to keep the reader interested. I wanted to find out why the man in \\"Blood Work\\" feels the need to masturbate on the couch while Sedaris vacuums the man's living room. Who wouldn't want to keep reading when a story starts of with \\"I was on the front porch, drowning a mouse in a bucket when this van pulled up, which was strange.\\" Sedaris's writing style is one where he passes off abnormal situations as typical and changes ordinary ones to insane.The downside to his writing is that sometimes he is too hard on himself and the reader gets the feeling that he just may not like himself very much. If only Sedaris could see himself as I do, a true artist, who paints pictures in the minds of the readers that will last a lifetime."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"You wonder what David Sedaris will do for material once he's finished excavating his own biography. But he's so merciless in his self-deprecating navel-gazing that he can probably always wring something out of whatever happens to him tomorrow. The anecdote about the mouse, which I first heard on the radio, alone qualifies this book as a memorably discomforting read."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've read all of his work, and love them all. In this book, Sedaris is a little toned down, perhaps rueful, but still cuts to the quick. Such biting observational humor and satire! He has no equal, only follow-on imitators."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've enjoyed Dave Sedaris's work since I first heard an abridged reading of SantaLand Diaries on NPR several years ago. I loved the unabridged and somewhat edgier version even more. I have enjoyed every one of his essay collections. His delivery, written and spoken, is unique.On the other hand, I am no Sedarista. While some of his pieces are funny or touching or thoughtful or odd, others are a bit creepy. I first read The Girl Next Door in The New Yorker and it was disturbing, not only because of the strange family he describes, but because of his own behavior. It was no less disturbing a second time around.All but one of the essays in this collection have appeared before, in magazines or on radio. The single essay that seems to be newly published here is Chicken in the Henhouse, funny in places, but it left me uneasy in the same way that The Girl Next Door did.These essays have Sedaris's family as their theme. Apparently the family member who is most comfortable in his own skin is his younger brother, Paul, a Southern redneck who surrounds himself with clutter and dogs. Sedaris never mentions that his sister Amy is also a writer. There are funny lines and conversations, but I wouldn't categorize this as a humor collection. His previous collections have included mainstream funny essays with more serious and unsettling pieces. This collection contains nothing like SantaLand Diaries or Me Talk Pretty One Day and Jesus Shaves, two fabulous essays about the trials of learning French, and trying to explain, with limited vocabulary, why an egg-laying bunny is the symbol of Easter in America. The pieces in Dress Your Family are a little too honest and revealing to be comfortably funny.But I read every word. Sedaris's writing is clean and spare. He doesn't waste any words. These essays, as effortless as they read, must have required merciless editing on Sedaris's part to remove every unnecessary word, and to make every phrase just the right one.Which is why I am still puzzling over the title. There is no essay called Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, nor is there any reference to corduroy or denim. Perhaps it has to do with the French origin of the words? Maybe the reason is so obvious that when someone tells me what it means, I'll smack my forehead and feel like a dope. But meanwhile, I'm stumped."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"It's tough to describe this book, because it is not really a story, not really short stories, and not really essays. In reality it is just some excerpts of various points in David Sedaris's life. But it is very funny with remarkable wit. It's not as good as his other books, actually. In fact I'd like to make a recommendation to read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" which I found much funnier and even slightly better written. But I still believe this book deserves 5 stars because there is nothing I found wrong with it, aesthetically or in its humor. He starts off at his childhood and you thoroughly grow with him as he ages, and the descriptions of him and his family age with him. The book is also a very fast read, I started and finished it in one day and I am by no means a fast reader. It is worth the purchase and worth the time."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Hearfelt essays on David Sedaris' life growing up gay in middle America. Always full of astute observations of American life, you will laugh out loud many times while reading this collection of essays."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I laughed out loud several times while reading it. David's brother is at hoot! If your looking for a few laughs this is a good one."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is thought of more as a humorist than an essayist. Despite that, his stories have often had a poignancy to them, especially in \\"Naked\\". A lot of people discovered David Sedaris through \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", the bulk of which was just flat out put-you-in-stitches funny. Pity the poor person who played the audio version while driving.I expect that this offering will disappoint a fair number of these latecomers; David Sedaris is more than some gay, ex-pat Dave Barry. He finds humor as well as the sadness beneath it everywhere from childhood to adulthood. Part of the laughter that \\"Santaland Diaries\\" evoked was rooted in the sadness in the way parents treated their children and other adults.On the other hand, \\"Dress Your Family\\" doesn't have the same thematic coherence as \\"Naked\\", which centered on his mother. It's more collected stories than a collection of stories, if you catch my meaning.As a result, I don't find it as strong as David's last two books, but it certainly has its moments. \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\" is one of the funniest stories he's ever written and the new Rooster stories are great. The poignant moments on their own are often sad and well framed. Put side by side, however, without much sense of thematic organization, the two counteract each other to some degree.\\"Dress Your Family\\" is a good book with great moments. If you haven't seen David Sedaris read live, you're missing out."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I thought long and hard about how to rate this book. To me, it wasn't as great as 'Me Talk Pretty', but it's still pretty funny. He's about the only author that can make me almost lose it and fall out of the chair laughing, and this book had a couple of those moments as well lots of moments of general laughter.This is a collection of essays, and I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't 'flow' as well as it could. Sedaris is clearly at his peak when writing about his dysfunctional family. While some of his France stories are charming, people expect humor from Sedaris now, and you can tell he's trying to hard to deliver it sometimes even when the situation may not be all that funny. There was an excellent New York Times interview with Sedaris recently where he speaks of the pressures he is under to deliver under his newfound fame, and I think this book shows some of that. It's a bit rushed, probably because he's under enormous pressure to produce.That said, David Sedaris is still *very* funny, and moreso than most writers out there today. This book made me laugh, and for that it gets four stars, maybe four and a half if it was allowed. If for no other reason, there are two stories about 'The Rooster' that are sure to entertain. You will be well satisfied with this book unless you follow Sedaris and are familiar with this material already, and even then you might like to have it collected in one place and to read it again."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I bought this book on Friday night. Couldn't stand to wait any longer. When I got home, I read my weekly tabloid magazines first (People, US, Entertainment Weekly) and suffered through the delicious anticipation of having a brand new, unread David Sedaris book at at the ready. I managed to get through all of Friday night without cracking the cover. Made it through most of Saturday due to family obligations and a fussy baby. But, at 11pm, I gave in. I finally closed the cover at 3am, satisfied and disappointed at the same time. I'm appalled at my lack of willpower. Why can't I make his books last at least 24 hours? Oh well, this book will not disappoint you. It is not as wonderously sarcastic as his others in that the essays in this book have more depth and feeling. Because the essays aren't so biting, it's almost as if he's apologizing to his family and at the same time, showing his fans a different facet of his feelings toward them. I especially enjoyed the pieces on Tiffany and Paul (both of whom seem like people I know because of Sedaris's style of writing). Unfortunately, with the new stories on Tiffany and Paul and the additional writing on Lisa and Gretchen, I am more curious than ever to find out who used the towels as toilet paper (previous book). Buy this book, you won't be disappointed. Actually, my best advice is to buy them all."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"One of the things I just don't get about David Sedaris is his uncanny ability to recycle. Must be a greek thing.You will have definately read at least half of these stories somewhere else if you are at all familiar with Sedaris.It's resissued, repackaged Sedaris.Me Talk Pretty One Day, is a much better read."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris's Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is a reading experience much more than it is a book. The reason for this is that it is not a novel, nor a memoir, nor a work of non-fiction or much of any other genre that one simply thinks up when the word \\"book\\" is mentioned. Sedaris's newest work is rather the prose writer's version of a collection of poems: a collection of separate autobiographical essays mostly having the purpose of entertaining the reader. Entertaining as they are, the problem with the book is that it seems Sedaris could have simply spit out hundreds of essays and picked at random the best ones and released them as a book. The essays only share the common thread that they are all about Sedaris. They seem to have no unified purpose or theme that they are trying to communicate. The book may have been better released as a weekly newspaper column rather than a single volume that deceives the consumer into thinking that it is a single comprehensive volume with a single purpose.The organization of the essays trick the reader into thinking that they may be reading a kind of choppy memoir, perhaps even excerpts from a larger memoir. Each essay stands alone as a separate entity. The essays as a result span a wide range of time and consequently, also span a wide range of topics. Sedaris writes about everything fromHalloween episodes, snow storms, sleep-over parties, his life as a homosexual, being in the land lord business, his life in France and the birth of his brother's daughter. Granted, these subjects don't have much in common with the page-turning, suspense filled subject matter of writers like Dan Brown and Michael Chricton. Nevertheless, Sedaris finds a way to make his stories incredibly interesting. He often incorporates his witty sense of humor into his stories. I personally nearly embarrassed myself reading in public places because I would usually laugh out loud upon reading one of Sedaris's clever phrases. Though the book lacked a sense of completeness, each individual essay was very well constructed and surprisingly entertaining.Sedaris distinguishes himself from other writers in that he is not shy in the least. The greatest thing about him is that he will say anything without the fear of being politically incorrect, too rash or up front. One of my favorite examples of this kind of writing was when Sedaris describes the normal winter conditions while growing up in North Carolina. \\"What little snow there was would usually melt an hour or two after hitting the ground and there you'd be in your windbreaker and unconvincing mittens, forming a lumpy figure made mostly of mud, Snow Negroes, we called them.\\" The root of Sedaris's humor lies in saying the unexpected. Rarely is his writing overly offensive or bawdy, but it does have a certain provocative quality that often catches the reader off guard.However there are some instances where Sedaris goes perhaps a little too far, usually when writing about his brother, Paul, who seems to be depicted as a rashly offensive person. Paul's crude sense of humor provides such an extreme contrast to Sedaris's dry, witty humor that it almost seems out of place in the collection of essays. Especially because Paul only appears in two or three of the book's two dozen or so essays, it almost seems like Sedaris turns to the dirty and offensive as an unfair substitute for his legitimate, clever humor.The most disappointing aspect of the book is the conclusion. It is almost upsetting because the final essay ends on a similar note as the others. The only reason it is placed at the end of the book seems simply because it is the most recent chronologically. Throughout the entire book, it seems as though the reader is trying to figure out why these particular essays were presented together rather than separately. Instead the book simply just ends.Sedaris has nevertheless created an interesting and entertaining collection of autobiographical material. His zany cleverness, crisp writing and engaging voice come together to extract majesty from the mundane. Perhaps writing essays of everyday incidents makes the collection even stronger, giving the average audience member much more to relate to and connect with on a personal level. Though the essays don't seem to mesh together very well, Sedaris seems to conquer the lack of cohesion to make for a very enjoyable read filled with many laughs and life lessons."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris knows how to make his readers laugh. Over the years, he has used his family and his childhood to make us laugh, laugh out loud. When I read Sedaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" I could not read it fast enough. I laughed out loud the whole time, and I could not put the book down.. Sedaris had me in stitches, belly laughing the whole time. I have read it several times and I have over the years bought that book to at least five or six of my friends, which is how much I loved the book. So, when I found \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" I got all excited and couldn't wait to start reading it.\\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" is a collection of essays, and I agree with other reviewers that it does not flow as well as it could have done. The stories are more touching than hilarious, which is not bad, but just was not what I was expecting. However, there are a couple of great stories about 'The Rooster' that will make you laugh for sure. And the one where a young Sedaris and his friends are playing strip poker is pretty funny too.Rating this book was hard. It was an entertaining read and I won't say that it was disappointing, because it wasn't. It just wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as his previous books."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have read/recommended every book that Sedaris has written. &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; started my love affair with him, and I haven't been disappointed with &quot;Naked&quot; or &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; either. The thing I love most about his writing technique is that you can go from laughing out loud one minute to feeling really touched by the end of the chapter. I LOVED his personal experiences growing up. I was born and raised in North Carolina, and to hear about growing up there from a transplant's perspective was hysterical. It also never ceases to amaze me that when you're sitting on a beach or by a pool and have someone spot you reading one of his book's an immediate conversation will begin about how wonderful he is and a recommendation will inevitably come your way about anyone who has read his series. I haven't met an author that could inspire any of that before."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I am a huge Sedaris fan but was very disappointed in this book. First off, as a fan, I had already read half the stories put together here in magazines. Secondly, they just aren't as funny as his earlier works. Sedaris needs to broaden his horizons or if he insists on sticking to the same subjects over and over, work harder to make the stories funny. It's sad when you see great writers getting lazy."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I am a HUGE Sedaris fan. Can say he is my favorite author. Have paid to see him speak any chance I can get. This book disappointed me. Not as funny as the others and the only &quot;laugh out loud&quot; moments I had were reading the two chapters I had already read. &quot;The Ship Shape&quot; I heard him read over a year ago in Redwood City, CA, and another chapter - Paul's wedding chapter - I had also read somewhere but can't remember where. I was very disappointed. Looks like he's lost his touch."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I enjoyed \\"Dress Your Family...\\". It delves more into his family and personal relationships than the others have and while funny - it is occasionally funny in a disturbing way. You can't help but wonder how much is true and how much is sort of maybe true but somewhat embellished. You find yourself hoping there is in fact embellishment because we're talking serious dysfunction otherwise - particularly when he discusses one of his sisters and his brother.His writing is as usual quick and biting and witty. He is self-deprecating, but compared to a couple of his siblings, and maybe his father (as he describes them) - he is the *less messed up*, which is scary.Although I didn't like it as much as \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", I still recommend it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Hilariously insightful. I found myself relating to his family. Events in my life that were sad suddenly became hilariously funny when seen through the \\"Sedaris\\" lense. I usually dont read non fiction but this a welcome cool long drink on a Florida hot summer day. Read it if your need to laugh quietly for a month or two."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This latest collection of essays about David Sedaris' life has many laugh-out-loud funny moments, as Me Talk Pretty does. But it also seems to delve deeper. He eloquently relates how he feels about the love of a good man, the way society judges people, the way he judges himself, and the fact that he exposes his family's dark secrets every time he pulls out his notebook.Sedaris' writing is wickedly on-target, all the time. You'll laugh, you'll join with him in making fun of his various targets, but you'll also feel his pain and his joy and the love he has for all the flawed but decent people in his life."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I own every Sedaris book thus far, but I have to say, this book does not portray David's full ability as an entertaining writer. I felt that this book was forced, maybe on a pending deadline. I found myself putting the book down on several occassions, all the other books I have reread. Overall, I found it bland and and definately not his best work."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"On a really good day, I get into my car and turn on NPR only to hear David Sedaris's deadpan delivery of yet another family tale.I have to either prolong my drive or sit in my car in my driveway to be able to listen to it all. Family life, Sedaris family life, is fair game. Whether it is trying to extricate himself from the complexities of living next to a 9 year old klepto, being mistaken for an employee of a gay nude housecleaning service, or watching as his parents navigate thetreacherous waters of being landlords,he is ready with wit thatskewers. Sometimes it is too close to the truth for comfort. Visiting his sister Tiffany he is struck by not only her complete lack of caring about housecleaning,but by her disdain for his opinion and advice as well. She refers to him as \\"you people\\" , \\"I don't like you people\\" and calls hin \\"Fairy Poppins\\" when she talks to their siblings.I'll admit I prefer hearing Sedaris to reading Sedaris. While still funny and insightful, somehow his words don't translate to paper as well as I hoped. I need the deadpan voice, the quirky delivery, the wry smiles and rolling eyes that accompany his stories. Still very funny,but without his \\"what are you going to do\\" shrug they are more bitter."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The first story sets the tone - Sedaris is an observant but rather selfish child afraid that some undeserving neighbors might get his hard-earned Halloween candy (when they have the nerve to trick or treat on November 1st). Every essay has its own message - some sad, some funny, but Mr. Sedaris conveys his truthfulness throughout - even though it may make him look \\"icky\\" to some. Of course he also gets his family members into the act and some of their foibles are amusing but in most cases understandable: the sister whose parrot tells her she's great, another sister, trained as a chef, who finds and sells castoff furniture and has a tarpaper kitchen floor, the brother who trains one dog to eat the feces of a smaller dog (YUCK - not understable), the mother who came to his rescue and tried to teach him some common sense, and the father who refuses to see the truth about tenants who rip him off and steal appliances out of his rent houses. At least we know those infomercials really do work...I highly recommend this collection of essays."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"The main negative criticism of this book that I have heard is that Sedaris covers no new ground. While, in a certain sense, that may be true but any fan of Sedaris's will enjoy more stories about the misadventures of the Sedaris family. I love when he writes about his brother and \\"Rooster at the Hitchin' Post\\" is one of the best essays here. Also included in this volume is one of his best essays ever - \\"6 to 8 Black Men.\\"I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book and I HIGHLY recommend it. Some of the tracks are recycled from his live album. Of course, all of these essays have been published before, in one form or another, but I don't want to track down every article in Esquire over the past few years.Sedaris is still writing at the top of his form. Any fan of his other works will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Another excellent book by David Sedaris. I couldn't put it down until I finished. Anyone who truly understands his humor could in no way be dissapointed by this book. The hilarious stories of his family give you a more personal look into his life. While the stories are amusing, at the same time you're able to see how much he truly cares for his family--despite all their visible flaws. The humor in his writing is matched by few. Definitely an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I'm a fan of David Sedaris and an avid reader of this genre--collections of essays. While I agree with many reviewers that this book is not his \\"funniest,\\" it does provide some laughs since humor is embedded in his writing style and view of the world. I don't believe that each piece; however, is meant to be funny and as a result, it is rich on many levels and, I feel, a worthwhile collection.Sedaris reveals so many intimate details about his family members, it left me wondering if he had their blessings?!\\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" by the way, was no where near as disturbing to me as Augusten Buurroughs' \\"Running With Scissors.\\" But I understand how one cannot help compare the two.If you haven't already, please read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" It's one of the funniest books I've ever read.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"When I read Sedaris' \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" I laughed harder than I have before or since. I also found Sedaris' \\"Santaland Diaries\\" to be hysterical. What happened here? I don't think I even smiled while reading \\"Dress Your Family.\\" It is a sad and painful book to read. If that's what you like, you'll enjoy this book. If you're looking for another Me Talk Pretty, keep looking."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris knows how to make his readers laugh. Over the years, he has used his family to discuss everything that seems to disturb him about the world he lives him. He's able to see the small peculiarities of life and transfer them to the page into laugh-out-loud marathons.True, Dress Your Family in Curduroy isn't as funny as Sedaris's previous essay collections. In fact, this collection has more heart and is much more poignant. But once again, he holds no barrel when it comes down to discussing his family; Sedaris talks about his brother's wedding, his niece's birth, their family vacations to various places and his relationship with his partner without hiding much from the reader. One essay even discuss his siblings's dislike in being discusses in Sedaris's writing.I love when Sedaris discusses his childhood. If you thought your family was strange or dysfunctional, one quick look at Sedaris's memories is enough to comfort you into believing that your own family might not be as odd as you believe them to be.I had read many of these essays before in various magazines. But reading them all over again only makes you discover even more laughs and smiles. Sedaris is a master at hiding small jokes that will only be found with repeated readings. The expression 'reading between the lines' always applies when it comes to Sedaris.Sweet, touching, funny, sometimes even a bit shocking (as one essay concerning his fear of touching a young boy in a hotel room and another about murdering a mouse) are elements that are all very present in this collection. Sedaris never disappoints. I'm sure you'll want to read this gem of a collection more than once."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Before heading off to America I wanted to read something entertaining and not so heavy , so I picked up David Sedaris' Dress Your Family In Denim and Corduroy. I think as many as 12 stories had been published n Esquire, GQ, and The New Yorker-so I had read several of them before. However, that did not make them any less funny or enjoyable the second time around. In fact, I enjoyed the collection so much that I basically finished reading it in one day, forcing me to pick another book for the journey. Sedaris never fails to come through with biting, savage, satirical, accurate, and uproariously funny stories. There's a lot to relate to since he writes about families and the petty concerns of the human condition: greed, jealous, envy, pride, vanity, etc...I think there's something that everyone can relate to or at least laugh at."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I took this book with me to work to read between customers and it had me laughing so hard people passing by were giving me odd looks. This is a great book. I would NOT say it characterizes \\"normal American life\\" -- but what is normal, anyway? (Who knows?)Sedaris is brilliant. I can't wait to read the other books he's written."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I'm a huge fan of David Sedaris. Any writer who makes me almost pee my pants every ten minutes always holds a special place in my heart. So when I saw he was coming out with a new book, I was totally excited.Although he doesn't disappoint when describing his extremely weird idiosyncracies, I found it wasn't as rolling on the floor funny as his previous books. There are moments though. My particular favorite is when he tries to stick his sister in the middle of the road to exact revenge on his mother. You just can't find stuff like this normally!If you have read Sedaris before, definetely buy this (at least to support his smoking habit). If you haven't, then try picking up one of his other books first. Sedaris is borderline insane, and his bluntness is refreshing to say the least. And you thought your family was nuts..."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris's witty reminiscences concern some of the most difficult human predicaments. He has explored, and continues to explore in this collection, the problems of the gay teenager trying to find a place in society.Two of these stories are about gay men worried about being accused of pedophilia. (In fact statistics show that the least likely man to sexually molest a child is an adult gay in a stable relationship with another male).In \\"The Girl Next Door\\" a man stops helping a neglected and abused child because of fear of this accusation. In other hands it would have been a grim tearjerker. Some tears are jerked here but they come through laughter as the episode is recounted with utter believability and absence of sentimentality.In other stories he tries to help a mentally ill sister, and gets thrown out of his family home because of being homosexual - again told realistically, told for laughs, and told without self-pity."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris will never cease to amaze me. Whether he's using his wit to embarrass one of any of his many sisters or to describe drowning vermin, \\"Dress Your Family in Cordouroy and Denim\\" is beyond funny. When it's 4 a.m. and you look up at the clock unaware of anything but your throat hurting from laughing out loud, you know you have been entertained by a master. If you read \\"Esquire\\" have heard or have seen \\"Live at Carnegie Hall\\" some of the material may seem repititious, so be forewarned that he refers to himself as \\"the laziest man in showbiz.\\""},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"By now most people know who Sedaris is, or isn't. Unless you've been living under a rock, you've either heard him on NPR or read something of his in Esquire or in paperback. &quot;Dress your family&quot; is great, but not his best effort. &quot;Me Talk Pretty&quot; is, with &quot;Naked&quot; not far behind. But even with that said, this is still one funny book. My only real hesitation/complaint was that I had read many of these stories/essays in Esquire and some place else--can't think of where. Then again, most authors present their work first in a magazine if they can, and later put their efforts into a book, so why shouldn't Mr. Sedaris? There's not a bad story in the bunch. The cover threw me off a bit, though. Great summer fun."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"All of David's books are compltely hilarious and this one is no exception. I love this book! Everyone should read it because it's incredibly hilarious. It's defitnely one of his best, perhaps even close to &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot;. Yay David! Totally read it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is my first David Sedaris book. I purchased it for reading on my commuter train ride to and from work. I selected it based on strong recommendations related to several other books I enjoyed (\\"RUNNING WITH SCISSORS\\" by Augusten Burroughs, \\"NIGHTMARES ECHO\\" by Katlyn Stewart, and \\"MY FRACTURED LIFE\\" by Rikki Lee Travolta). It was an excellent recommendation and an excellent purchase. I found myself laughing outloud on the train. People looked at me funny for laughing out loud all seemed to understand once they saw what book I was reading. It really is that funny. The humor is very similar to Travolta's 'FRACTURED LIFE'. The way he attacks family absurdities is very similar to 'NIGHTMARES' and 'SCISSORS.\\" It's a great book. I am looking forward to sampling some of his other books too."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is perhaps the most celebrated humorist writing in America today. All the praise --- the comparisons to Mark Twain, for example --- is well deserved, leaving little for the reviewer to do but acknowledge that Sedaris is one extremely funny guy. DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM may not be quite as good as the hugely popular ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY, but it's awfully close --- and at its best, it is positively laugh-out-loud hysterical.Like ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY, DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM is made up of essays (all of which have appeared in various periodicals, including Esquire, GQ and The New Yorker), many of them involving the various members of Sedaris's quirky, dysfunctional family. And also, like ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY, the new collection eschews the one thing for which Sedaris might be criticized: his fiction. While his short stories, such as those that appear in addition to the essays in BARREL FEVER and HOLIDAYS ON ICE, are often quite humorous, they tend to suffer in comparison to his personal accounts of his various adventures as a child, a housecleaner, or an apartment hunter in Europe.With all of that being said, the book's funniest essay, \\"Six to Eight Black Men,\\" is only tangentially about Sedaris, dealing instead with Christmas traditions in the Netherlands. The writing absolutely sparkles, easily surpassing the author's more famous holiday offering, \\"Santaland Diaries,\\" in terms of laugh inducement. Other highlights include \\"Blood Work,\\" in which our hero attempts to clean the earth's hottest apartment for the earth's oddest man; \\"Possession,\\" in which he falls in love with the apartment of one of Amsterdam's more famous former residents; and \\"Repeat After Me,\\" in which he faces off with a parrot and faces the uncomfortable realities of mining his family members' lives for material.Though always funny, portions of Sedaris's material may be off-putting to some readers. Masturbation, adolescent strip poker and a feces-eating dog are all part of the mix, as is the author's foul-mouthed brother Pete, a.k.a. \\"The Rooster.\\" Sedaris, however, seldom uses such material for a cheap laugh, as even at its most shocking, his writing is all of a piece, elucidating a crazy world with a sharp wit he wields as skillfully as a surgeon's scalpel.--- Reviewed by Rob Cline"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"of people you might not even find so intersting. Maybe I just overdosed on his family stories in the much funnier first two books. I feel his well has run dry. I would classify Sedaris as a writer of Books for people who dont really like reading...Or only like easy stuff but are too hip or think they are too hip to read Bridget Jones type of books. Even Alain de Botton is much more creative..Time would be better and more satisfingly spent by reading Julian Barnes, Michael Cunningham, Anne Tyler, Jane Smiley, and Chekhov's, John Cheever's or John Updikes stories."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"When one first finds David Sedaris' writing it's like a delicious guilty gem, something so quirky and full of left field that you chuckle and chuckle again. And the things he captures in his writing, encountered in his life, is borderline absurd and through his clever observations, you somehow feel better about the craziness of your own life and friends and families. But I think underlying it all, is the notion that if you find a way to observe and retell with humor, you can laugh through just about anything.With that said, I've read \\"Naked\\" and heard a few things on NPR and really enjoyed the first read through. So I picked up \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" when searching for a book club pick that my brother, mother, and her childhood friend participate in. I have a knack for almost picking semi-controversial subject matter of which some of Sedaris' writing would fall into just to see how it would play out among my family. And \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" is a collection of non-fiction humor writing about Sedaris' own wacky zany left-of-center family. What better way to get good familial discussions going? Well, I ended up picking Donna Tartt'sThe Secret Historyand was quite glad I did. Great read. Sedaris' book was entertaining in places, in places poignant, other places slightly racy so an enjoyable read but I used it as filler to pace myself with the other books. It's great for that.So I'd say if you are considering diving into one of Sedaris' books, you may find it quite witty on first read but if you go on to read subsequent works, the new discovery-ness of it I found wore off to some degree. One of the best moments of the book I thought was his observations of his Brother's new-found role as a Father. Mind you, his brother does use one of his daughter's toys to try to spell out MF and get it to repeat back the cussing. Alas, the toy is too smart. Then in the end, he envisions the niece's future of success having shunned all his Dad's gutter values to do so...and ponders what his daughter will think of his father then. Will she reject him and his gutter ways? Or will she see that there was love there, strong love, that left her Dad up all hours of the night to take care of her and falling asleep on the floor underneath her crib. That's a powerful observation to any parent out there full of love for their children.So if you take Sedaris' title to heart and try to really dress your family up in certain clothing material, I'd say stray away from denim and corduroy and try to lean towards spandex and pleather. It will be much more entertaining. As if you'll find this book equally entertaining is up to you. I'd say you'll like it if you have a healthy sense of humor, a little open-mindedness and haven't read all of Sedaris' other books. Other than that you may want to look elsewhere. --mmw"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I actually listened to the audio version of this book. Sedaris reads it himself which makes it so much funnier than just reading the book. His delivery is so dry, I loved it."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book, and I assume the rest of the author's work, is enjoyable primarily for it's informal style, and seemingly obvious although rare deducation that focus on heroism or tragedy isn't necessary for interesting memoir writing.

And sometimes he tells polite, but amusing tales too. What insight."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was the first title I have read from the author and after seeing all of the reviews, I somewhat expected this to be one of the those laugh out loud books. With a few exceptions, it wasn't. I was still entertained by the accounts of this very unique family and was able to relate to various pieces of the different stories. I dont regret picking up this book up but I I think I was expecting more."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This is the first book I've read by the author after many recommendations from people. The book was so-so...the only time I laughed out loud was in the \\"Girl Next Door\\" when he finds out the little girl's hick grandmother is nicknamed \\"Rascal.\\" That was brilliant. The reason the stories lacked a lot of humor for me is because they were so banal and commonplace. This guy does not have a unique family--everyone I know has a family just as crazy, but in different ways. My family is twice as nutty as his, though nobody drinks. I just didn't feel like this guy had any experiences worth writing about. As another reviewer pointed out, the book read like some random dude's mildly amusing, though ultimately pointless, blog."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris is a talented master of the short (autobiographical) story. This collection of pieces spans various eras of his life, but I found the pieces dealing with his childhood (which were the bulk of the pieces) the most enjoyable. These are the pieces where the Sedaris family comes full-fore.One thing to note about Sedaris is that he has been accused of his family (and independently documented by a piece in \\"The New Republic\\") of some exaggeration of events that has occurred. So I wouldn't take the events here as gospel truth.Still, even with a bit of fiction thrown in, these are wonderful essays and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Over the past few months, I read David Sedaris' books in order of their publications. Upon completing Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim, I feel that Sedaris has come to an impasse. While I certainly enjoyed a few of the essays here, I also feel rather numbed to the Sedaris style. Between Barrel Fever and Naked, there is a tremendous jump in maturity as Sedaris decides to write essays instead of stories. Me Talk Pretty One Day solidifies Sedaris' command of his comic voice. Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim feels like an extension of Me Talk Pretty One Day instead of a continuation of the writing process.While I don't agree that Sedaris is a pretentious writer, I do think that he needs to advance the quality of his next book. Doing the same thing over and over will appeal to fans, but I may lose interest if I see another book where he is the star. I wonder what a third-person point of view Sedaris essay would sound like? Could it freshen his funny? Would fans even let him change?"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This one was a little more poignant than the others, but not remotely lacking the great humor we all love in David Sedaris.

It's not that the writing is worse, it's actually better.I had read a number of these essays in other pieces (i.e. New Yorker, etc), so there was some familiarity with this work. For all of his painfully funny stories, he shows more depth to his work.Though he never says it outright, he clearly misses and identifies with his mother (&quot;Being mocked by the untalented was easy to brush off, but my mother was really good at imitating people.&quot;)and comes slightly closer to being his father. In the essay &quot;Put A Lid On It&quot; I found it a poignant moment he has with his sister who states about the entire family, &quot;Don't you get it? I don't *like* you people.&quot;But I do. I love his family stories. Especially the ones that include his mother or another sister, Amy (which there are none in this book) and Rooster, his brother.The book is about half as long as I would like it, but you take what you can get."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"While you might not laugh as hard as you did while reading &quot;Me talk Pretty One Day&quot;, guaranteed you will at the very least have a good laugh with yourself over the pages of Dress your Fam.Sedaris is back!

In Dress Your Family, he tackles personal issues relating to his family. I appreciated the courage this took, and within the pages I felt that he carried a bit of guilt for turning the lives of his brothers, sisters, and parents into something as public as a book. As I moved through the book, it read at a very monotone level. Rarely did a surprise catch me off guard, but there were moments when I cackled from a silly situation.Sedaris' writing and style is evolving, and some may say maturing. Here with Dress Your Family, I believe we're witnessing a turning point. I'm very curious to see what he delivers next."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Let me start out by saying David Sedaris is one of my favourite writers. I had been anticipating this new book for quite some time, and sadly to say, I was terribly disappointed. Previous efforts ('Naked', 'Me Talk Pretty..' et al) have caused me to laugh out loud in inappropriate places. Often. Even on repeated readings. With the exception of \\"six to eight black men\\" (about christmas in another country) which is very funny, the most I could muster was a smile for about half the essays. Several stories were downright unappealing, Especially \\"chicken in the henhouse\\" and \\"the girl next door\\". Both had an underlying theme relating to fear of being accused of pedophila. Both left me feeling kind of creepy. If this was a first effort, perhaps I would be more forgiving. All in all it's not a bad book. I just expected better. I'm still a fan, for now...."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have only read parts of Me Talk Pretty One Day, and a friend of mine has read parts of Naked to me, so I had to get this one all on my own!Jumping out at you from the shelves with a naked Barbie doll on the cover, I read this book in about two days or so. His essays range from interesting to hilariously funny. He has a way with words that cannot be duplicated.\\"Us and Them\\" had to do with his neighbor and family who did not own a TV, and how David used to spy on them and wonder how they lived and learned about life, if they didn't have a television. These neighbors went trick or treating the day after Halloween, (as they were on vacation the day before) and David was forced to go upstairs and fetch some candy to give to the kids. Instead, his mom found him in his room, mouth dripping with chocolate. One of my favorites.\\"Full House\\" had to do with sleepovers and the fact that their parents don't go to bed at a normal time, so the children didn't either. I laughed out loud when he talked about his mother, who falls asleep anywhere, and didn't understand why they gave her a nightgown for Christmas, \\"...she'd look at us strangely, as if, like the moment of one's death, the occasion of sleep was too incalculable to involve any real preparation.\\" You find out more about his mother in this story as well. In the last story, she locked the children out of the house and they threw snowballs at her window. In this essay, she gossips about the neighbor's mom. \\"'What is she on?' my mother would whisper whenever we passed Mrs. Winters waving gaily from her front yard.\\" I found her to be more of a friend to the kids than a mother, maybe a little dysfunctional.\\"Blood Work\\" was probably my favorite. David starts cleaning houses, and goes to an apartment where a very sweaty man resides, who is not in favor of air conditioning. He continually talks about FIRE ISLAND in a very loud voice, \\"...as if it were a prearranged code, the watchwords signaling me to hand over the microfilm.\\" As David starts to find gay pornography piled about the apartment, and wonders why the guy asks if he is coming to clean at 2PM or 2AM, he slowly catches onto the fact that this guy didn't just want any housecleaner. He watches a \\"movie\\" and pleases himself in David's presence, then proceeds to pay David $230 dollars for his services, even though he didn't \\"service\\" him, as this was a mixup in cleaning services.A previous reviewer stated that she had a bad feeling about a couple of the stories, because she thought that there was some underlying pedophilia going on. She didn't go into detail, but mentioned what stories she was suspicious about. In \\"The Girl Next Door,\\" a neglected 9 year old girl hangs out with 26 year old David much like the character Marcus hangs out with Will, in Nick Hornby's \\"About a Boy.\\" I didn't see any problem in that book, and I don't see any problem here.In \\"Chicken in the Henhouse,\\" David discussed how a young boy was in a hotel getting coffee for his parents, and naively asks David for help, as any child might do. David then worries about how people might \\"think\\" it looks, mixed with the fact that sometimes he has a need to touch people's heads. (It sounds more like an obsessive compulsive disorder than closet pedophila, but that's just my opinion.) I just think that if he was, he wouldn't be publicly announcing it in a book. It just bothered me that this reviewer made him look like something bad because of her own suspicions. I don't agree.All in all, it was a quick read. David Sedaris has a way of looking at the world differently than others do, and finding the humor in everyday life."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I have long delighted in David Sedaris's pieces in The New Yorker and on \\"This American Life.\\" His humor is edgy, but--and granted this will seem contradictory--there is something familiar and down-to-earth to it. Perhaps this is because it's like the aphorism popularized by Homer Simpson: \\"It's funny 'cause it's true.\\"Sedaris's stories mostly revolve around his family, now and when growing up, as well as his partner, Hugh. His family's interrelationships often seem disfunctional, but like the Simpson family, the abuse they heap upon one another is just another way of saying \\"I love you.\\" It's sometimes painful to watch, even if one is also amused by their interaction.Wouldn't anyone be just a little uncomfortable reading how (in \\"Let It Snow\\") the Sedaris children, locked out of their house by their mother, decided to sacrifice their youngest sibling by having her lie down in the middle of the road--all for the ultimate purpose of making their mom feel bad? And yet, Sedaris makes this funny: \\"Poor Tiffany: She'd do just about anything in return for a little affection.... When we asked her to lie in the middle of the street, her only question was 'Where?'\\" (Don't worry, Tiffany lives--to become the stuff of another story.)Aside from the humor, one reads Sedaris because he's just so literate, so good at story telling. He has a real gift with capturing a moment, particularly in the dialogue. His reminiscences of his mother are particularly touching and funny. I'm reminded of the line in the play/movie \\"Same Time Next Year\\" when Doris says that she has fallen in love with Helen, the wife of her lover, George: We hear these wonderful stories about her and fall in love with her.Sedaris at times takes a labyrinthine route in tracing a course of events. \\"Nuit of the Living Dead\\" is a good example of this. You sort of wonder where the story's going (zombies? rats? burglars starving to death in chimneys? ungrateful children?), but you don't really mind because you're amused all along the way. Another example is the first story, \\"Us and Them,\\" which originally appeared in The New Yorker. It's a hilarious story which, though focused at first on the strangeness of a family that doesn't watch TV but actually talks at the dinner table (Mon Dieu!), turns on one particular encounter with this family: having been away at camp, they show up at the Sedaris door trick-or-treating the day *after* Halloween. This is one of the laugh-out-loud moments of the book, when Sedaris, ordered by his mom to get some piece of candy from his previous night's stash, sequesters himself in his room to gorge himself on sweets, sitting on his bed with chocolate oozing from his mouth while he develops a headache (because he's allergic to chocolate), all to deny the silly twits from across the street his candy.Sedaris's stories might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy fresh writing, bizarre situations, and a good, warm laugh, Sedaris will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Dress Your Family is enjoyable, but not nearly as good as Me Talk Pretty One Day. Again, David Sedaris entertains the reader with humerous short stories about his life, family, and encounters with strangers. His unique perspective and thoughts regarding these topics are entertaining and enjoyable. He writes of his sister's affinity for animals and her preference for them over most humans. David's parent's experience with renting apartments to tenants that qualify for subsidised housing is an comical narrative that portrays the stark differences between himself and his father. The funniest short story is probably the recounting of how his mother shut the children out in the snow because she wanted time to herself. And as before, the stories span his entire life, with some recounting childhood and others contemporary.With Me Talk Pretty, I had tears streaming down my face and I was holding my stomach laughing to the point that I needed to put the book down in order to recover enough to read the next page. Dress Your Family only ever got light chuckles. The writing is still enjoyable and the stories pleasurable, but this book just does not compare to his other work. Hopefully, this is only a temporary setback and readers will be able to find boastful laughter in future work."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I thought \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was definitive Sedaris, and I am constantly amazed how he can mine his life with each succeeding book for more nuggets of comic revelation. It's funny how his books remind me of all things, \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\", where Mary succinctly explained to Rhoda once in the midst of preparing for an inevitably bad date that she has spent her whole life trying to avoid humiliation. Obviously she didn't succeed, and neither does Sedaris. The difference with Sedaris though is that he honestly embraces the way life embarrasses him. For that viewpoint, I am grateful and in certain ways empowered by the 22 brief essays on display here.For sure, Sedaris does not disappoint as he finds more material in his North Carolina childhood, for instance, the TV-less Tomkeys whom Sedaris likes to observe for anthropological reasons since \\"friendship would have taken away their mystery and interfered with the good feeling I got from pitying them\\". In fact, writing about his family is also a way of simultaneously expressing his affection and getting even with them, though he's not quite ready to admit it to himself or to his sister Lisa, who is justifiably worried that everything she says will be fodder for his next book. In the chapter \\"Repeat After Me\\", he debates with a parrot and faces the uncomfortable realities of using his family members' lives for material. Even more bittersweet is \\"Put a Lid On It\\", about a visit to his sister Tiffany, whom unrescued by her family, struggles to get by as an adult after an adolescence spent in reform school. She's the one who calls him the politically incorrect yet dead-on moniker of \\"Fairy Poppins\\" over the phone to their brother.These remembrances no matter how funny and skewed show Sedaris is getting more introspective and achieving more emotional resonance this time around. In one of my favorite stories, \\"The Ship Shape\\", he wistfully recalls a childhood visit to a summer house that his father had promised to buy but could not. In the most honest way, he clings onto the vivid memory that they were once a happy family. In a seemingly odd non-sequitur called \\"Possession\\", he captures the typical American obsession for prime real estate when he visits Anne Frank's house in Amsterdam in the midst of his own apartment-hunting. He does not memorialize the memory of the Holocaust but rather unapologetically goes on about what a great place she and her family had during the war from a realtor's perspective. It's a risky move, but he pulls it off because he knows we all have inappropriate thoughts during life's most solemn moments.But lest you worry that he is on a self-help bender, the key elements of all his other books are still here - the confusion of childhood and the embarrassments of adolescence, the difficulties of connecting, the sense of being a perpetual outsider, the pervasive biting humor. As his family grows to become mine, and as his adventures produce more than just laughs but an oddly tingling sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, I look forward to what Sedaris will remember next."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Overall, I didn't find it as funny as &quot;Me Talk...&quot;, however, I found that it was more solid. The stories overall seemed tighter. Sedaris has a talent for being blatantly honest and portraying himself with a harsh honesty that would make some people wince. He often portrays himself in a negative way which makes the reader feel an underdog sense of loyalty. My favorite essay in &quot;Me Talk...&quot; was &quot;You Can't Kill The Rooster&quot;. His &quot;Rooster&quot; essays in this book did not disappoint! This book really gave you a strong sense of his family. His writing is so relatable that you feel his family could be your own with all the idiosyncrises, drama and humor. You will most definitely enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I know people may not agree, but I found this book to be the best one yet. I know it isn't as light and fluffy or as sitcom-ish as the previous ones, but I felt there's more gravitas here. I suspected there was a certain amount of filler in Naked, Me Talk...etc. If this one veers off slightly, I think that's because the author just effortlessly veers off also.What I like most about this book is that it's the most intelligent and least \\"goofy\\". \\"Full House\\" is the most subversive story I have EVER read! And I MEAN this. And I still busted out laughing. \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is chilling, scarier than that movie \\"The Ring.\\" His essay on his sister Tiffany is alarming. Is he writing this in case something unpleasant happens with her or is it just another family portrait? He's too smart to just let this out there. He also has an uncanny knack for picking out the obscure: parrots. I'd never given much thought before to birds that can repeat words, but he's picked up on it. Classic David.Is the writing really THAT painstaking? What I think happened is that he has been studying French for so long that he has become finer with his use of words and pays more attention to structure and meaning. You can't write one essay after the next without being able to KNOW how to do this. I suspect this is all rather easy for him.Everyone seems to be whining about how \\"sad\\" it is. I think this is somewhat homophobic. Before he would only politely mention Hugh, like he was some whimsical pet; now there are more chapters and insights into their relationship. Where's the Norman Rockwell painting that depicts two men in a gay adult relationship that he can somehow refer to? But, honestly, there is something THERE though. You somehow suspect he's going to hell for some reason or is it just getting older or is it just that he's a literary celebrity in a foreign culture when his schtick is all about upper-middle WASP/Greek kitsch, basically amusing Americana. I know I shouldn't say this, but there seems to be some kind of void that he's been sucked into. You sense it as the book progresses. He's achieved mainstream acceptance, but is he holding himself back? Is he allowing himself to get too gay or political? Does he have his own internalized homophobia that's become a self fulfilling prophecy for his adult relationship or is the relationship just doomed in and of itself? I still like reading all this more than the other fluff because it's unflinching.It's fun to review a book that's number 6 on the bestseller list (there, I've had my David Sedaris moment)."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was \\"BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY.\\" guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I didn't find this book too interesting. It felt like I was reading a random stranger's blog. If that's the type of thing you enjoy, then read *real* blogs - they're free. It's hard to connect with Sedaris, even after reading the short stories."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I read the book in one night, laughing outloud throughout...a bit darker/more graphic than &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;, but just as funny."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Clearly, he is out of material. The essays in this book can be only a few pages long; that would be forgivable if they were funny. He's lost his edge, I guess. Maybe he should've waited a little longer before he came out with this one. However, all his other books so far are hysterical - especially Holidays on Ice."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Readers who appreciate a bit of the absurd when laughing at one's own foibles and that of family and neighbors should try the humor of David Sedaris. He hits sacred cows (or turnkeys) with deprecating accuracy and also makes target practice of his parents, especially mom, and his sibling even as he skewers himself the most. The author is irreverent and clearly a poster boy for obsessive-compulsiveness. Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is a delightful series of essays that are fun to read especially since it is someone else's family under the microscope. Fans of something completely different will laugh at the antics of the Sedaris brood and their neighbors, but also realize that for the will of God (and writing talent) that could be their family exposed to the sublime.While laughing with Mr. Sedaris' wit, I pictured my spouse's cherished description of his preadolescent meals prepared by his beloved mother renowned for her kosher seven-course dinner. Vegetable 1, vegetable 2, potato, meat, gravy, dessert, and a drink all lined up in a queue for no two items were ever ready at the same time or when \\"my mom said eat it people are starving in India\\" so I gave her a box with a stamp and the address of the American Embassy in New Delhi. Those were the good old days, which are what this author coaxes readers lovingly and amusingly to reflect back on just as he has done with this intelligent series of essays.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I was recently in Seattle to read from my collection of short stories, WORLD FAMOUS LOVE ACTS, and everywhere I turned there were displays for David Sedaris' new book. This in conjunction with the fact that friends often ask me to \\"write like David Sedaris\\" might give me the right for pause. But, far from being jealous, I bought a copy of DYCD while in Seattle and read it straight through, though admittedly, I was high on Seattle coffee. The gift Sedaris gives us is a willingness to be concisely funny, yes, but also vulnerable. This is not a book to recommend to gay friends only. This is a book for anyone who's not a test-tube baby, and maybe some of them too."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I despised the essay/story called \\"Possession\\" and felt that Sedaris has dropped to a disgraceful level of insensitivity. I can't find anything even remotely humorous about the Holocaust. I'm not at all saying he thinks the Holocaust is funny but I don't joke about it like I don't joke about slavery, wars or other examples of man's ability to become sadisic monsters. Who knows, maybe Anne Frank finds it funny from somewhere beyond the grave but I can't. I, too, have been to Anne's secret annex in Amsterdam. It was a place to mourn and a reminder to not be hateful in our own lives. I loved \\"me talk pretty\\" and even liked the quirky, selfish character he portrays himself to be but the stories in this book are bland and that single story made me feel immensely sad."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is hilarious in a &quot;Wonder Years&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;That 70's Show&quot; sort of way. Some reviews have called it &quot;predictable&quot;, etc., blah, blah. but the reviewers are the same people who would slog through a 1,000 page boring piece of crap just to prove they're smarter than us when they're not. The book's one flaw is the author's constant harping on his gayness. Except for it's relevance to growing up in 1960's North Carolina, it's a tired theme that the book doesn't need to be funny."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was the first Sedaris book I've ever read (actually, I listened to the CD), and I was impressed. I thought his word play and way of describing normal situations so abnormally really separtes him from most humorists. As a writer, I loved the way he could use the English language. Overall, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.That said, the structure of this book is very difficult to follow, and the unifying theme is difficult to nail down. For all of his linguistic success, Sedarisdid not organize this book very well, and I often had difficulty understanding what the point was in the first place. This was not helped by the fact that some stories seemed completely random and out of place in this book. Another complaint I have is about his voice. While I don't fault him for this (he obviously can't help it), I found his monotone, nasally somewhat annoying. This could have been a much more entertaining Audio CD if it had been read by someone with a more appropriate voice. I admit, however, that others love his voice and probably will love the way he reads the book, so take it for what it's worth."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris is brilliant. I read this book a few weeks ago on a short international flight. It was the perfect anecdote to my usual restlessness.I think everyone should read some Sedaris. He probably won't appeal to some because his personal writing style requires that readers share some of his world views. That said, when he does resonate with you, he makes magic. A truly spectacular storyteller in my opinion."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This installment of the Sedaris family saga is not nearly as good as \\"Naked\\" or \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", which are both absolutely brilliant. The book has its moments, but some of the essays are actually dull. And the ones involving his disgusting (sorry, David) brother Paul are simply gross. Some of the graphic descriptions and language go a bit overboard."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I used to wonder what all the hype was about. Now I know. Not much. David Sedaris has had a not atypical suburban kid life - he grew up alienated from his parents and family, he went to college and didn't do as well as he might have hoped, he started using and then recreationally selling drugs, he cleaned up his act, and he moved on to bigger things. He's got family members with quirks, and he's gay. And he tells you about them.Before you get this book or any of his others, go get David Rakoff's Fraud. I think Rakoff is superior to Sedaris here - Rakoff is a journalist so his subject matter is intrinsically interesting. Sedaris, if you don't want to hear about his family, or you think he just sounds whiny, you're out of luck. I wasn't bored out of my mind so 2 stars seems appropriate, but that's still 5 hours of my life I'm never getting back."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"A copy of Dress Your Family etc was given to me by a friend, with an enthusiastic recommendation, and served a my intro to humorist Sedaris. A collection of family and daily life-based stories, some are LOL funny, some are poignant, and a few are merely snide. Among my favorites are the hilarious Dutch Christmas essay and final vignette, a tale about a carload of European tourist who stop at the Sedaris house in his French \\"willage\\", and David sees the contents of his home through their eyes. The other members of the Sedaris family, with the exception of his witty mom, could not be more different from David, and not only because he is gay. His knack for nail-on-the-head characterizations is outstanding, but he does not allow the comic aspects to obscure the human ones. Witty and wise without being preachy."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is good, but not as good as \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" There was too much space between laughs, but when I did laugh, I laughed A LOT, especially during the last story when he describes the serial-killerish nature of his house. The essays were keenly observant and analytical and people who think he is \\"an ugly person\\" do not understand the masterful irony of his bluntness. Sometimes the essays are too obviously used as vehicles for him to explain and justify his eccentricity and a few others are a bit ill-conceived and un-noteworthy, like the one about the rubber hand, but overall, it's a pretty good read. There's also a grossness factor that I didn't particularly appreciate. Finally, and I'm not really using this against the book, I don't understand the full significance of the title. I was expecting it to show up in one of the essays like in \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" but it didn't. Maybe it's just me who doesn't get it though."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I've never read anything by David Sedaris, but this book was getting a huge amount of play on tv (saw him on David Letterman last night!) and in a lot of magazines. So I bought the book and I wasn't disappointed. The stories of his childhood and life are very funny and brought back memories of my own experiences growing up in the burbs (though my life had nothing on his!). I guess I just expected hilarity due to all the exposure he has been getting. Give it a few hours and it will give you a few laughs."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"First off, I'm a fan. I joined Audible just to get the This American Life episodes Sedaris stars in, went to see him read at my local theatre, have all his books and consider Me Talk Pretty One Day to be one of the funniest collections of stories on self-loathing and misanthropy ever committed to paper. Suffice to say, I've been looking forward to this book for a fair while...Almost every story here will make you laugh in some way. And if you're particularly susceptible to black humour, some will make you choke on your food. Here I'm thinking, among others, of the story where he's house hunting in Europe and finds the perfect location for him and his partner- the Anne Frank museum in Amsterdam. His family, as usual, comes in for some of the harshest scrutiny and makes for hilarious subject matter though there's a section on how they have all become more guarded, only too aware that their smallest action could prove to be fodder for a new best-selling novel. Somehow his love for them still shines through.Still a great book, and I'd give it 4 and a half if Amazon could deal with non-integers, but it's not quite as good as Me Talk Pretty. The observations and anecdotes have not quite gelled together in the same way; they are a little episodic in nature and some stories feel forced in trying to contain the disparate elements within one theme; like he has a whole notebook full of entries and has tried to shoehorn them in where they don't necessarily fit. Something that, from a comedic angle, makes not an iota of difference, but does detract from the book's stylistic whole.I get the feeling that with a little more rumination some of the stories could have been even funnier still. But then I'd have had to wait longer to read this, and the instant-gratification-seeking now ingrained in me from 4 years living in the US means that's not an option. If you're new to Sedaris, Me Talk Pretty One Day is the place to start, but long-term fans will not be disappointed with Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is true David Sedaris, funny, a little somber at times, but always thought-provoking. While none of his other works will compare to the outstanding &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; this book is a good, entertaining summer read. Rarely do I see the world the way I do than after a David Sedaris book, and it's a happy experience when I can look at my surroundings in the seemingly normal, yet insanely comical way that he does. &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Demin&quot; made me want to go back and re-read the full Sedaris collection, and I will, with great pleasure."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Sedaris's newest collection, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, is an odd mix of tales from a witty personality. The most humorous of this selection are the stories where he describes events from his youth. The main source of the hiliarity comes from his ability to create and to tell of scenarioswhich the reader can relate to their own life. He tells of picking on the youngest sibling in order to get revenge against an angry mother during a snow day. This is just one example of his tales.One major downfall of this collection is his later stories seem to drag on and carry no true point. They lack the wit and character of that makes Sedaris such a loveable author. Also, some of his commentary on his own thoughts and sexuality leave the reader feeling that he may be dealing with some deep insecurities. Yet, all in all, it is a good collection of stories to keep around the house and read in small doses."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I really enjoyed reading Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim. David Sedaris writes so well and honestly about the people, experiences, and events that have influenced him, you can't help but love this book. I enjoyed the lighter subjects of this book like where David Sedaris talks about his family dreaming of living in a beach house as a child or about how proud he is of his younger Paul getting married and becoming a father. Sedaris also shares his experiences of helping his parents manage and maintain apartments. I liked how Sedaris and his father worked together to stand up to an unhappy tenant who cut down a tree that he was not supposed to.I loved the part of the book where Sedaris talks about his dysfunctional relationship he has with his sister Tiffany. Everything about his sister's life bothers him from the way she cleans her house, and her inability to find a steady job and also her disgusting eating habits like eating food from the garbage. I think everyone knows somebody who is resistant to change. I could really relate to this essay, and it is one of my favorite ones in this book.There are some very touching and personal essays in this book. Sedaris talks about how he learned to make peace and feel sympathy for a boyhood bully. Sedaris reaches out to everyone in need even as an adult. I loved the essay The Girl Next Door in which talks about his friendship with a neighbor.Sedaris talks about his adventures working as house cleaner and his job as a teenager selling popcorn in a sports arena. These essays are so funny The funny part about working as a cleaner are the weird clients he worked for. The funny part about selling popcorn and sodas is the way he casually asked total strangers for their loose change.David Sedaris is a very funny writer, but he can very serious and honest. I found this book to be very entertaining, and I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If your first introduction to David Sedaris was hearing him live (or at least live on radio), you might have found him 4 parts hilarious to 1 part breathtakingly sad. Live, the audience responds quickest to the funny bits but might easily leave the auditorium a little unsettled at the underlying bitterness of his previous escapades as, say, a Santaland elf at Macy's.In \\"Dress Your Family\\" the recipe is reversed - it seems more sad than funny - but as a result you can more easily hear what a fine writer Sedaris really is. The stories here are nothing short of tragic in several cases - the one moment of family happiness while shopping for a 2nd home (before the family falls apart behind his mother's alcoholic stupors), the unspoken but apparent mental illness of his sister, the terrible life of the little girl in the apartment next door who takes a liking to her neighbor David.This allows us to see that Sedaris-the-writer is even more expert at description and character than he is at making us laugh. Personally, I value this ability more, but if you are looking for your life to be made lighter by something light and humorous, this is not the book for you.The most touching stories are those involving his brother, Paul, who seems to be the token regular guy in the Sedaris family (like that blond chick on the Addams family). David Sedaris uses the occasion of Paul's wedding and the subsequent birth of Paul's daughter to demonstrate both his own fierce love of his family and his total alienation from this ordinary, straight world.On audio this comes through even stronger (Sedaris' imitation of his brother's Carolina accent and irony-free straight-guy behavior enhances it), but it's still at its core a message both totally peculiar to Sedaris and totally universal - the way we love our families and can yet feel totally, even existentially apart from them.It's much deeper than you probably knew, or perhaps even wanted, from Sedaris, but it's worth a try."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Many writers can achieve comedic results with sardonic phrasing, and others can skewer and ridicule with poison pen, but Mr. Sedaris' rare wit has grown into a literary power of maturity, intelligence, pathos and bravery. He is earning his place beside Dorothy Parker and Oscar Wilde with his new book &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim&quot;.Sedaris is writing about the absurdity and the frailty of human existence, tackling serious universal themes with his famous humor. But now the laughs melt into tears of quiet epiphany.Yes, perhaps some of the superficial readers, witnessed in some vitriolic reviews here, will misunderstand the profundity of Sedaris' deft craft, but as an artist he is proving his genius. Popularity in this celebrity-blinded media world has damaging effect. The public will stomp on each other's fingers to be the first to drag Sedaris off the New Yorker/GQ/Esquire/ bestseller pedestal. I sincerely hope he pays them no heed.This book made me laugh out loud and cry a little. I work as a librarian and have been recommending David Sedaris' books for years. He is one of the few truly authentic voices writing today."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Only Sedaris could come up with some of this stuff. While I wouldn't say this is his best yet, they're all awfully close to each other and all awfully great reads."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This might be one of my favourites! If not the top, it's up there with Holiday's on Ice.The focus of this collection was his interactions with his family. While the stories from his childhood were hilarious, the stories of Mr. Sedaris relating with his adult siblings were the best for me. There is just something so real about the people he writes about, and the situations he has found himself in. My family can be a bit odd, and I was thinking of a few family get-together's when he described his own familial gatherings. This might not be the best endorsement for my family, but, then again, we have yet to be accused of being boring."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"If you don't know who David Sedaris is, you should.Known for his idiosyncratic wit and tales of his eccentric family, Sedaris contributes frequently to NPR and This American Life, writes for The New Yorker, and has published tons of books.Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim begins with a story about Halloween. A young David becomes slightly obsessed with a neighboring family that doesn't own a TV and eats together every night. He studies them like a different species, because to him they are. His family doesn't do \\"family\\" things.This family goes on vacation and misses Halloween, but a day later they trick-or-treat in the neighborhood. David's mom orders him and his siblings to give up some of their own hard-earned candy when the family comes to their door. Struck by the injustice of them asking for candy on a day that it isn't socially acceptable to ask for candy, David Sedaris recounts his hilarious, semi-crazed reaction.The subsequent stories are all about his family and his partner. Often asking himself \\"why do I do these things?\\", his recounts of his nephew's birth, apartment hunting in a foreign country, drowning a mouse in sympathy, and befriending a young psychopath are riotously funny.The stories are written simply and matter-of-factly, but with poignant dialogue. His conversations with his siblings, especially his brother (no two blood relatives could be so different!), are oddly irrational and adolescent.David Sedaris is a totally loveable total weirdo and makes me feel shockingly normal."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I brought this book along on my recent trip -- great book to read while traveling. Lots of laugh out loud moments. Also highly recommend hearing David Sedaris narrating the stories."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I was introduced to David Sedaris by NPR and always looked forward to his stories on This American Life. I decided to check out some of his books.I finished this book within the span of about 36 hours. It's a quick read and each story keeps you interested. I laughed out loud a few times but wouldn't say the book is hilarious, more poignant than anything. I was a little disappointed that there are a few repeat stories from \\"Holidays on Ice,\\" which I read first. Overall, I would recommend for anyone with a good sense of humor."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"What a different perspective David Sedaris has on life! I was repeated drop-jawed, giggling, or bursting in laughter! What a fun book!"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I found this book on a bargain shelf for $2, and I snatched it up immediately. I had previously read \`Holidays on Ice,' so I had a rudimentary idea as to what to expect.Sedaris's writing style seems reminiscent of that found in Jean Sheppard's \`In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash'; acerbic wit, irreverence, and hyperbolic familial relationships, glossed over with an occasional touch of tenderness and self-deprecation.One of the criticisms of this book that has been repeated in numerous reviews is that it isn't as funny as some of Sedaris's previous works. However, life isn't always funny - So, why should Sedaris's memoir-style writing focus solely on that single dimension? In fact, I would argue that by balancing his writing with darker, disturbing, or more serious anecdotes, he not only accentuates the humorous portions of this book (e.g., his brother Paul \\"the Rooster\\"), he also presents a more holistic, well-rounded view of his world to the reader (for better or for worse).I've thoroughly enjoyed reading about the over-blown caricatures known as the Sedaris family. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Sedaris's material."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"David Sedaris' writing and sense of humor is not for everyone. I think he's great, one of my adult children (the girl) thinks he is hillarious, my son, who has a dark sense of humor, not so much, my wife is picky- likes some things, not others. \\"Dress Your Family..\\" is a great collection of stories and for Sedaris' fans you won't be disappointed. On the other hand, if you are one of those people who don't appreciate his wry take on life, don't expect this book to win you over."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was darker than Me Talk Pretty One Day, yet still hilarious at moments, making the whole thing seem more honest and introspective. Be prepared for some stories to make you somewhat uncomfortable, and not every story has a funny ending, but it is still one his best books.That said, Six to Eight Black Men made me cry I was laughing so hard."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"Certainly these stories are an exaggeration, but I don't mind.

While reading this book, all I could think was that he was pouring his heart out about some very painful events in his life and about painful observations about humanity (the chapter about TV, for instance) but had to throw in some comedy for those who expect it from him. I read this book and laughed out loud a number of times, but I also cried a few times. This book was very well written and is funny but also painful at times."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book is my Fav. of Sedaris. You feel like you are part of the family while reading this book. There are some very funny parts that had me laughing out loud. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This book stood out on the shelf. At the time i purchased it i knew nothing of David's works and boy was I in for a surprise! Reading David's collections is one of those guilty pleasures you just cant describe to people. This book is by far one of my all time favorites. I look forward to his new title \\"when you are engulfed in flames\\"."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was my first Sedaris book. I didn't quite know what to make of it when I started reading it, but it grew on me. Sedaris has to grow on you. His books seem to be a compilation of short stories about his life...a strange life. Anything he writes is entertaining and he's a comfortable, easy-to-read writer. Recommend."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I'm between 4 and 5 stars on this one... There are a couple of stories that don't \\"do it\\" for me, stories that I more/less regard as filler for the binding. And then there are the rest of the stories in here which are (all of them) blisteringly, timelessly, laugh-out-loud funny.Maybe it helps that before this came out, we saw him read several selections from the collection. For that, I'll err on the side of five starts.\\"Yes, I am talking about boat trailers. But also, I am dying.\\""},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was the first David Sedaris book I ever read. After reading this book I bought and read three other books of his. This one has turned out to be my most favorite. Once you start reading you won't want to put down. Sedaris will have you laughing over and over again with his bizarre and intriguing memoir. If you read only one Sedaris book ever, choose Corduroy and Denim."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"This was the first book of David's which I read. It came as a recommendation from a friend. I found myself unable to put it down. Most people will easily relate to the stories of his childhood. I highly recommend this as a first book if you have never had the privilege of experiencing David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"I'm a huge fan of David Sedaris. He's not only hysterical, but also inspirational. I was surprised when i spoke about his book to my friends and co workers, that many of them have already read his books. \\"Me talk pretty one day\\" is highly recommended as well."},{"Title":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim","review":"A collection of essays about his life and family, David Sedaris once again entertains and tickles with his intelligent wit, sarcasm and his humorous but admirably perceptive outlook on everyday things the rest of us absorb, not file away for future reference. I truly wouldn't want to be around David though. I would feel like I'd unwittingly make it into one of his books."},{"Title":"Peasants, And Other Stories","review":"There are innumerable, many incoherent collections of Chekhov's short fiction: such is the bane of an author being in the public domain. What makes this collection superior is that Edmund Wilson, the greatest critic of the 20th Century, assembled it, and there is at last a logic applied to its assemblage beyond the crude dictates of chronology.Wilson realized that Chekhov seems spotty if not incomprehensible when his short caricatures and romances are interleaved with brooding tales of peasant lives. Think of a Twain compilation where &quot;The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg&quot; and &quot;Punch Brothers Punch&quot; are sandwiched together.So Wilson's collection takes the best of Chekhov's &quot;social&quot; tales of his last decade, stories that focus on groups of Russians, whether it be the bourgeois, the peasants, the workers, or the decaying aristocracy. In these stories, Chekhov is on Tolstoyean grounds, and holds his own remarkably.However, this strategy means sacrifice: the beautiful, sparkling &quot;Lady with the Dog&quot; would not sit well in this grim company, so it is excluded."},{"Title":"The season of silence","review":"The novel begins in March, when Susie Spinner, a seventh grader comes down with strep throat and must stay in bed for more than a month. After recovering, she finds that everything around her has changed--her sister is angry and decides to leave home, and her best friend is now dating the school bully, Trevor, who's determined to make Susie's life miserable. Realizing the loneliness of her situation, one day Susie decides to take a walk in the Clary meadow, where she finds a secret grove, so faerie-like, that she makes a vow of silence. However, an angry boy, who's also quite lonely, happens upon her, and thinking she is not able to speak, tells her many of the troubling things going on in his life. The situations that all the characters in this novel go through are so painful and realistic that the reader really empathizes with them. A wonderful children's novel, which is best read in the spring, &quot;The Season of Silence&quot; should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Collected Poems of A. E. Housman","review":"A.E. Housman is sometimes spoken of as one of the \\"war poets,\\" of the same period as Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, Joyce Kilmer and others who wrote of the First World War. In point of fact, he was of the previous generation and published his most famous work, A Shropshire Lad, in 1896. Subsequent smaller volumes of his work, Last Poems, More Poems and Additional Poems, were published decades later, the latter two posthumously. All four sets of poems are contained in this volume.Housman led a rather reclusive life, active in scholarly pursuits and teaching at several universities. Despite being known by close associates to have a sense of humor and being a skilled raconteur, he was considered even by his family to be rather stoic and cold. When Shropshire Lad first appeared, many were astounded by the passion with which he wrote of the seeming futility of life, the hearbreak of love and loss, and the utterly senseless waste of countless young lives lost in wars of empire.Housman is, in this writer's opinion, one of the greatest of lyric poets writing in English. The rythms, alliteration, mythological allusions and romantic imagey that elicit an almost painful pathos, are rarely equaled.If you're not familiar with Housman's work, this book is as good as it gets, including as it does all of his published work, with helpful introductory notes and indexing at the back. If you enjoy lyric poetry, don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Y2K: Three Scenarios","review":"I'm a huge fan of The Truth Machine and The First Immortal, and this book was unlike Halperin's novels in some ways. For one thing, I don't think he rewrote it as many times. It's much less intricate and maybe not as polished, yet he displays the same ability to put you right into an imaginary situation and convey an astonishingly logical, believable future. The three stories present a benign, moderate, and terrible outcome of the Y2K bug (not necessarily in that order). My only complaint is that they were too short -- I finished this book in three hours, and it felt more like 30 minutes. Anyway, it's very easy to read, and now I really think I have a more balanced view of the risks of the Millennium Bug. Maybe I'll read it again tonight to see if I missed anything. And even though I'm not as scared of Y2K as I was before I read the book, I'll probably still stock up on bottled water and canned goods, and maybe buy a few gold coins and a generator, too, just in case..."},{"Title":"Y2K: Three Scenarios","review":"3 stories of potential Y2K problems, ranging from the mild to the severe.

For future ref though on the part of sellers I think putting in the edition is a good idea. I would happily deal with this trader again."},{"Title":"Instructing Beginners in Faith (The Augustine Series) (v. 5)","review":"St. Augustine wrote this model instruction for teachers guiding seekers in the first step toward joining the Church. That step consisted of an introduction to the central points of the faith that gives us our identify as Christians. It followed the seeker's stated desire to become a Christian \\"because of the rest that is hoped for after this life.\\" The introduction consisted of an exposition of historical events from creation to the \\"present day\\" (the early 400s), the commandment of love, and the coming of Christ.In addition, Augustine offers suggestions for the teachers on how to avoid discouragement in a number of different situations, which will ring true with today's catechists. He acknowledges, for example, that repeating simplified explanations may become boring to the instructor. If we find it difficult to repeat familiar phrases suited to the ears of small children, he writes, \\"we should draw close to these small children with a brother's love...and as a result of our empathy with them, the oft-repeated phrases will sound new to us also.\\"Today's catechists will also rally to Augustine's instruction on dealing with scandals within the Church. The beginners are to be cautioned about not imitating those in the Church \\"whom you see to be living evil lives...of greed and pride, or those who engage in any other form of life that the law condemns and punishes.\\"This work, written more than 1600 years ago, has practical and historical value, and would be of special interest to those involved in instructing beginners in faith today."},{"Title":"The Complete Poetical Works of Edmund Spenser.","review":"This book has in it many hard to find poems including the Faerie Queene and many other poems. The Faerie Queene includes all six books, in an unedited version for those who want to read the original. While hard to come by (it is out of print) it does make for interesting if somewhat challenging reading, when you find a copy. However, you are left to own resources for any questions, as it does not give complete notes as many other versions of his poetry might. Language is in original version (except for a few changes in spelling to make a bit more comprehensible), giving the original feeling of the poems. A good find worth the trouble, for those who love poetry, and are willing to wade through the flowery, old style phrases and wording."},{"Title":"Compost, By Gosh!","review":"Michelle Eva Portman has created a story filled with learning and mystery.

I went through the 28 days program actually looking forward to it each day and really improved my eyesight a lot.

(MacBraveHeart, May 1999)"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Tranter succeeds in bringing to life all the characters from this crucial period of Scottish history. His portrayal of Robert the Bruce presents a hero of the greatest magnitude - a man every great leader of the modern world should be familiar with.Our hero, Robert Bruce, is introduced as a young dandy in British high society - a protege of his future nemesis, Edward the first of England. His struggles to gain freedom from the oppressive English monarchy for the Scottish people make for a marvelous tail of adventure, romance and heroism, well ended with the tale of Sir James Douglas and the Brave Heart.The historical accuracy of this story makes it an important read for any fan of the medieval British history."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I had much pleasure reading &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; and &quot;The Wallace&quot; both by Nigel Tranter, and both at the same time, as events were concurrent. I have read nearly all of this author's books and these are two of my favorites. Not the most favorite but perhaps 3rd and 4th.The film director of &quot;Braveheart&quot; should have done a little more research as he would have discovered that Robert the Bruce would have, according to the legend, been the true Braveheart. When you read the book, witness what it was that Jamie Douglas cried out as he made his fatal charge against all odds, and find out why........here is the Brave Heart."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Containing three books originally published under separate titles, this trilogy tells the story of Robert the Bruce, who became King Robert I of Scotland. It begins with THE STEPS TO THE EMPTY THRONE, which portrays an impetuous strong-willed young man who agrees to co-govern the country with his personal enemy in an attempt to win its independence from England. The effort soon fails and Bruce steps down, but then he makes a separate move to unite Scotland under his sole leadership. Amongst much internal fighting, he makes great strides.The second book, THE PATH OF THE HERO KING, reveals a passionate, courageous leader who has learned to win over some of those who would oppose him through a mix of diplomacy and cunning. The winning doesn't come easily, though. Bruce is excommunicated as well as harassed by Edward I's efforts to keep Scotland under England's control. This story culminates in the Battle of Bannockburn, which was an amazing win for the Scots.THE PRICE OF THE KING'S PEACE, the third book, tells of the years of struggle to obtain a peace treaty from England after Bannockburn. During this time, Bruce's brother takes Scotland's fight into Ireland in a blatant ploy for power. Bruce's dealings in this treachery reveal a savvy leader, whose goals ever are to strengthen Scotland's independence. The story ends with his death.All told, the trilogy covers about 1296 to 1328. Tranter is at his best when describing the history while the interaction between characters is sometimes stilted. Nonetheless, lovers of historical fiction will enjoy the action and adventure as well as a story that sticks close to the facts. I enjoyed books 2 and 3 the most."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I, being of Scottish descent, found this book to be especially informative and compelling. Tranter gives such life to all the characters and such detail regarding the progression of conflict between the Scots and the English that the book is a real treasure. Just as many North American tribes learned they had to unite so the different tribal organizations within Scotland itself had to learn to co-operate with each other to have any chance at defeat King Edward's armies. One understands what is at stake for Scotland...it's people and culture destroyed by the English for England's own gain or win the right through suffering and bloodshed to live as Scots in a country of their own design. I devoured this book."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I have owned this book for years. I've read it six times. End up with tears in my eyes every time when the King and the Primate look back over their lives together, fighting for the freedom of their beloved country.A HUGE story that will totally engulf you in the lives of the characters. If my house were burning down, I would return to rescue this one!!"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"This is the third book in a trilogy on the life and times of Robert the Bruce, King Robert I of Scotland. It tells of the years of struggle to obtain a peace treaty from England after Scotland's amazing win at Bannockburn. During this time, Bruce's brother takes Scotland's fight into Ireland in a blatant ploy for power. (He briefly becomes king there.) Bruce's dealings in this treachery reveal a savvy leader, whose goals ever are to strengthen Scotland's independence. The story ends with his death.The first book in the trilogy is THE STEPS TO THE EMPTY THRONE. The second is THE PATH OF THE HERO KING."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I really enjoyed reading Tranter's Trilogy, his English is very good and his writing style is not cumbersome. The first two books are absolutely great, the third one is a little bit slow but has a great ending, if you enjoy books about the middle ages or about knights then read The Bruce Trilogy."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"This is an outstanding book, perfect for anyone interestedin Scottish history or history in general. Nigel Tranter is (was) an awesome author, great attention to factual historic details. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Hi again, friends;THis little review is to let you all know,( not that you really care) what i am reading, now. I have purchased about 20 books the last half-year, and have read approximately 11 of them. From Dostoevsky (2), Dumas(3), Tolstoy (1),Joel C. Rosenberg (2) Margaret George (1), B. Cornwell (1) now N. Tranter's \\"Bruce Trilogy\\"( is that 1 or 3 ??). I am 2/3 of the way through it and it is very exciting. The Battle of Bannockburn at the end of Book 2 was so real, it seemed Mr. Tranter was actually there. The characters are well-drawn and come in and out of the story at just the right times. Robert the Bruce comes across as a truly very human person who was humble and wise. Yes he did terrible things that we could not stand for in our time, but they couldn't be helped. The King Edwards' ( pere & fils ) were vicious to the extreme in regards to there Scottish subjects( ahem ).If there is a flaw in the book it's the archaic Scottish dialect that grates on our modern ears. some of the terminology of the landscapes were hard to figure out, at first, but I think ive got the meaning of them If someone does a new edition of this work in the future, maybe a glossory of terms or footnotes would be helpful to those not familiar with the Scottish dialect.In the future, I may look into Diana Galbaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series and the \\"Outlandish Companion\\" to get some of these straight in my mind.I'm going to try and finish the 3rd book of the Trilogy by the weekend, then I think I'll tackle the \\"Tales of Genji\\" or \\" A Suitable Boy\\" ( or maybe something heavier, heh, heh ).Keep reading, everyone and enjoy your favorite authors and books.I recommend this book, highly!"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"This book is an in-depth, detailed dramatization of the life of Robert the Bruce. No stone is left unturned. You will need to be REALLY interested in the subject, because the book is long. However, it is well-written. Robert strikes you as a real man of flesh and blood; not just a name from history books. His wife, Elizabeth de Burgh, is a feisty match for him and their love story adds spice to the tale."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"After seeing Braveheart in the theatres 4 years ago, and seeing it over and over again on video, the flame that this movie has sparked in me still has not abated. That is one of the reasons why I went searching for a book to read about Sir William Wallace. Am I glad that I did a little research ahead of time and chose to read about Robert the Bruce instead! The man was so admirable, I can't even begin to express my esteem for him!Based on the reviews that I read on this page, I decided to buy Nigel Tranter's account of The Bruce's life versus all the other readily available biographies. I couldn't have made a better decision!My life was put on hold while reading this book! I just could not put it down! I would read a little of it in the morning, go to work, and come home and read it some more in the evening until the wee hours of the morning! That's how consuming this book was!This book was so good, and the man revealed was so nobel, that I almost wished they had portrayed him more accurately in the movie. Just almost...since Braveheart is my most favorite movie of all time. If they had made it any differently, I might not have been so inspired, might never have gone searching, might never have read this book....Well, whether it is sad to say or not, my life is back to normal now, since I have just finished this book this past weekend. But my spirit will never be the same again. Thank you King Robert, for the inspiring life that you lived. Thank you Mr. Tranter, for putting it into words."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"The saga of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, contaporary of William Wallace, is enthralling in its vivid imagery and detail.

Both trilogies are outstanding, and after having read both Robert the Bruce has left a deeper impression upon me than William Wallace, something I would have never believed. A movie of Robert the Bruce should be made which does him justice. His portrayal in Braveheart (although I like Angus McFadden's character) doesn't do him justice after reading this. The Bruce of this trilogy is a character I will remember a long time. I read on the internet Mel Gibson bought the rights to Steps to the Empty Throne. Make the movie Mel!!"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I read this a few months ago. I was recovering from a back injury and thankfully I had this book with me. There aren't many books that pull this level of detail and numerous character introductions without overwhelming the reader. It engages you from the beginning and gets better and better as you read. I let out a long breath when I was done,and I actually felt as if I had accomplished the deed of freeing Scotland myself. Spectacular!"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I wanted to know more about the Scottish war for independence. There are a lot of romance novels featuring handsome Scottish warriors but frankly I wanted to try to understand the actual history behind it without having to wade through dry details. I do not know how true to historical record this collection of 3 novels are but it feels very realist. It is horrifying what the Scottish people had to endure at the hands of the English. It was a very brutal period of history (\\"Braveheart\\"). The problems that Robert Bruce and his people faced were enormous.Bruce was a young man when he got caught up in the struggle. He could only guess what actions to take. The author does an excellent job in fictional form trying to interpret what it must have been like for him. There are cautionary lessons here for current times. This collection is for anyone intrigued by the choices made by rulers and the ruled. As this is three novels in one, it is a huge book. It is not something easily carried around but very worth reading."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I do not read many books but I was introduced to Robert the Bruce through another book called \\"The Great Scot\\". I searched for another book on the subject and came across this one. For any person who does not read that often, the book is extremely long but the author kept is so interesting that it didn't require any work to read. Everything flowed together neatly and sufficient amount of details were added to give your imagination enough data to create the whole scenario in your head. Very good job by the author!"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Tranter has written so many excellent books about midieval Scotland - the Bruce Triology is my alltime favourite!!!"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"The Brue Trilogy is without a doubt the finest book to be written for a very long time.It is as exact and detailed as it is well written with flair and passion.Mr Tranter has given this fool great pleasure by bringing such an amazing and near perfect book to print.I refuse to say even the remotest thing about the book...just incase i do spoil it for any of you...But to let you all know...this is where the true Black Douglas comes from...simply breath taking!...and for the record....im English...and it made even me feel bad and good at times...All that remains to be said is....Thank you for sharing your talants Mr Tranter."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I received the book ordered promptly and on time.

Thanks for sending the book so quickly."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"After quickly plowing through this book in 3 weeks, because it was due back to the Library, I decided to read it again, taking copious notes and locating the places mentioned on a map of 13th century Scotland. I am now a proud owner of my very own copy of this magnificent book. I have added this book to my most favorite books of all time and it sits along side other 1000 page tomes like: \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" \\"World without end,\\" \\"Shogun,\\" \\"The Agony and the Ecstasy\\", and several others that are my constant companions. The Bruce trilogy will take you to the depths of despair and then elevate you to new heights as you live with Robert the Bruce from his brash beginnings, growing into a man and winning Scotland. This book allows you to do what truly great books should do; transport you to the time and allows you to live as a companion with Robert, William Wallace and Edward \\"Longshanks\\".

I had read a 'similar' book by Sharon Kay Penman, which was excellent also by the way, and had hoped to find books of similar quality by other authors. Nigel Tranter met my hopes and I thoroughly enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"All Scots and ALL English should be required to read this book."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Great historical fiction is my specialty and discovering Nigel Tranter has been a real treat. This the first thing I have read by this author and for me it was also a fine introduction to a crucial period of Scottish history. This 3 part series covers the life of Robert Bruce, a truly dashing and gallant hero if there ever was one, and it is a true rags to riches story. The whole series is well written and though lengthy is a pleasure to read with a medieval feel to it. There are many battle scenes throughout the book, and detailed strategies described, the Scots being so outnumbered by the English had to be very clever to win.Book 1 - Opens with Bruce in his 20's, a spoiled young nobleman, forced like all the other Scottish nobles to pay homage to Edward of England and be his lackey. Later his meeting with Elizabeth de Burgh, and finally the birth of his ambition.Book 2 - Hitting rock bottom with the capture and executions of his brothers, the imprisonment of his wife, and his other female relatives kept in cages, he is finally driven into the wilderness to live as a hermit. Eventually, he rises again and is able to unite the many clans and tribes from the northern Highlands with the Norman/Celt mixed nobles from the south to fight together for the common cause of Scotland. Part 2 finishes with the Battle of Bannockburn.Book 3 - Finally the undisputed King in Scotland though there is still the ongoing struggle to have England recognize Bruce as King of Scotland.A novel I will enjoy reading again, especially loved the parts about Christina MacRuarie, ruling woman of the isles, also the Highland chiefs and sea captains. So much historical detail with never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I have now read this book 3 times and enjoyed more each time. The book starts with the Scottish throne sitting empty and Edward of England ruling Scotland. The young Earl of Carrick, Robert Bruce and his younger brothers are enjoying the attentions of Edward and living a care free life.Two events change all this, the Battle of Stirling Bridge, which unites the common Scots people behind a commoner called William Wallace, and the slaying of the Red Comyn at Berwick, on holy church ground. Robert immediately declares himself King of Scots.What follows is a marvellous account and insight into a remarkable period of Scottish history. The way Tranter protrays Bruce's internal turmoil, of being excomincated from Mother church, worrying over his diseased body and the consist struggle to free Scotland ; the obsession that Edward Plantagent has with crushing Scotland and the hounding of Bruce, keeps the reader's fullest attention.This book is a must. Superb, excellent, buy it."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I first was introduced to Nigel Tranter when I bought this book in a castle gift shop on a visit to Scotland. On my next visit, I bought every Tranter book I could find as this book was so fabulous! In fact, after reading many, I think it's his best work, and I continually read it again and again. No other book can bring Scotland to life as this does. It allows you to get into the heads of Robert the Bruce and William Wallace like no other book does. You HAVE to read this book! A 10 is not praise enough."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"There are many great writers in the field of historical fiction. But there are few storytellers. Storytellers are so much more than a writer. In the Gaelic, they are called seanchaidh and they were the keepers of stories, lore and history of the Clans, the historian, the recorder. When the seanchaidh wove his tales of magick, Auld Gods or warrior-kings of Scotland, he was not recanting something created from his mind; he was passing on oral heritage that was handed down through the ages.Nigel Tranter was a seanchaidh, and he is sadly missed. Yes, he was a highly successful writer, but he was so much more, and in the tradition of old, he wove many tales of Ancient Scotland as few historians could.And THE BRUCE TRILOGY is Tranter at his best (a wee bit redundant since Tranter was always at his best). Tranter created the three books of the Trilogy to bring forth the tale of Robert Earl of Carrick who went on to become Robert the King, but he does not just tells the story, he brings Bruce alive for you to meet, to understand. He was a young man caught at the centre of Scotland's struggles. It was a separate country from England, having its own kings since the dawn of time, but Edward Plantagenet - called Edward Longshanks because of his great height and long legs - was determined to unite all of Britain. Two men stood in his way: William Wallace and Robert Bruce. Wallace (see Tranter's THE WALLACE) was a shooting star that lit the conscious mind, giving cry to a national identity Scotland often lacked, since Clan ties and oaths were generally put before homage to the King. Wallace created the spark, in common man and noble alike, that Scotland was a country and would never bow down to the English King. By very nature of whom he was, a commoner, Wallace drew Edward's wrath as no noble ever would, so Wallace's pivotal roll in Scotland's struggle to remain free was cut short. It then fell to Bruce save Scotland, a man in his twenties, who not only had to fight his family's role for him, Edward's attempt to bend him and control him while at English court, but ultimately saw him fighting 2/3 of his own Country due the mighty Clan Comyn's determination to put one of their own on the throne. You feel for Bruce, his loss of his family, the imprisonment of his wife, sister and daughter, jealousy of his brother, and maybe will understand him more as man after reading this. So much power and force behind the man and the story as only Tranter could deliver.This is a complex history, since Bruce often was seen as serving himself more than Scotland, witnessing him making homage to Edward on four separate occasions. But you learn why Bruce bought his time, played both ends against the middle, and succeeded where Wallace failed. Tranter does not just tell you these events happened, he make you see Bruce the man, not the man who would be king. Tranter opens a door into Scotland's past, and permits you to walk with him, walk with Bruce, not as a historical figure, not a King, but as a man, faults, fears and all.This is a magick that transcends being a writer, even a very good writer. This is a tale told with wonder, passion and awe by fireside by a seanchaidh.If you have never read Tranter, I cannot image a better introduction to Scotland's Seanchaidh. Once you read him, you will hungrily devour the rest of his works.WISE WRITERS AND READERS Recommended Read"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I purchased &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; from the Gift Shop at the National Wallace Monument in Stirling, Scotland during a recent visit. I was already learning a tremendous amount about Sir William Wallace but wished to learn more about the complex, mysterious Monarch known as Robert the Bruce. I could not have asked for a better resource. Nigel Tranter's narrative prose takes you from Bruce's early day's as a young Earl still on courting terms with Edward I of England through his transformation into Scotland's Savior and Liberator. I also enjoyed learing about the historical innacuracies surrounding other resources such as the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; of which there were so very many. But most of all, &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot; leaves one with a deep appreciation of what the Scots went through and survived as a people and a nation in the face of a level of adversity and aganist odds that could scarcely be imagined--even by today's standard's. Nigel Tranter is truly a gift to the realm of Scotland and the realm of literature alike. A marvelous piece of work."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Although the film Braveheart is tremendously entertaining, it suffers as history. Part of the problem is that it is based on Randall Wallace's book rather than Nigel Tranter's. Nigel Tranter was the pre-eminent historical novelist of Scotland, and although William Wallace's tale is epic, it pales in comparison to the life of Robert the Bruce. Bruce's life is so full of adventure, tragedy, heroism, intrigue, and statesmanship, that any author of fiction would be hard pressed to just imagine the story line ... but this is based on factual events. A must read."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Nigel Tranter is an amazing author. He has brought all Scottish history to life with his series of Scottish historical novels. You can tell his research is incredible and he keeps things historically correct down to the detail. He just adds emotion and dialogue the way he thinks it happened. These are more history than fiction. It is History that breathes. This is the story of Robert the Bruce and how he went through amazing times of hardship and despair to claim the throne of Scotland and free them from English rule. This was my first Tranter book. I will not rest until I have read them all. Anyone of Scottish blood or even just interested in Scottish history should read this book. There is no dry factual text here. It is pure life, emotion and thought. Robert the Bruce lives again through Nigel Tranter."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I can't add any more to the other reviews except to say it's the best novel I've ever read. After reading it I acquired dozens of Tranter's other works, including many from the Bannockburn gift shop, and have been absorbed in nearly all, but none are as good as The Bruce Trilogy."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"This book is well writtten from beginng to end, very accurate despite the book being fiction. I had real problems putting the book down because of the drama that was Scotland.This book is a must for history lovers everywhere with romance, murder,wars,backstabbing and man's greed for money above their country.The bruce shows what live was like in Scotland in the early 13th centuary as brutal and short. It is a reminder of what a major achevement Scotland had against hugely overwhelming odds.This man put up with every indignities imagineable, including his sister and wife being caged outside for many years.This is a great read for me as I live near many of places in the book, Melrose Abbey being the main one.I highly reccomend this book to anyone intrested in war and romance novels. Brillant !!!"},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Nigel Tranter is one of those exceptional authors that can bring a half remembered (or half forgotten?) legend to life. The depth of his research is apparent as is the feel of and for his country and social conditions prevailing at the time of the story. His coverage of the obvious gaps in history, (caused by Edward's desire to destroy the culture as well as later events that destroyed the records) pass unnoticed. He truly is a master of the genre.Tranter's story of the Bruce is told with depth, passion and a style that can transport the reader so that they live the story as it unfolds. The characters are superb as are the depictions of the events (political, military and otherwise) leading to the re-establishment of the King of Scots. In all highly commendable."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I am nearly 52 years of age and not much given to callow enthusiasm but after reading the story of King Robert I can say that the Scots are very fortunate to have Mr. Tranter. If only our own country were so blessed. On a scale of 1 to 10 I say 1000."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"I first read this book about four years ago. I am a sasanach Englishman and it made me ashamed to be English. The book instilled in me a passion for Scotland which has not diminished even to the point of calling my two sons: Robert Bruce and Jamie Douglas, though I have to say my Jamie is much sweeter than the Black Douglas portrayed. Nige Tranters book is a passionate account of the fight for Scotland's freedom from the English invaders but also a contest between the warring faction Scots tribes. It has all the hallmarks of a Shakespeare tragedy including Politics, Love, Backstabbing, Murder, Duplicity etc. It is for all of this that I am purchassing this book again. My last one has been worn out."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"The Bruce Trilogy is actually a set of three separate novels written by Tranter about Robert the Bruce of Scotland, and I think enough previous reviewers have stated the basic outline of the novels that I don't need to restate it again. This was a fascinating story of an honorable, courageous man and an incredible military tactician, and his battle for freedom and peace for Scotland from the English, and most especially Edward I and II. The author did a marvelous job bringing not only Robert to life, but the secondary characters as well. I did find the third book, The Price of the King's Peace to be a bit slower than the first two, but in the end culminating into a spectacular finish as Scotland and Robert find peace at last.Well worth taking the time to read this for anyone interested in this period in history, I found it both fascinating and educational at the same time, and isn't that what historical fiction is for after all? And I loved the epilogue with James Douglas as he made his final battle cry, \\"Lead on Brave Heart\\". Although I am probably the only person on the face of the planet who hasn't seen the movie. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"A quality read without question. I was with The Bruce. I struggled right along with him.. My my, I cried at the end, and at some parts in between.. Mr. Tranter was a talented man who knew his country and its history well. Whoever said that Tranter cannot write like Penman, I say, read it again. To love your country, to give up everything and everyone for the good of it.. Wow, Im off to read Wallace, for he is in this novel as well, and just makes it enough that I am happy that he has his own tale to tell."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"The Bruce Triology is an oustanding work detailing the life and times of Robert the Bruce. Fictionalized or not, it creates for the reader a real place in time and the reader shares the atmosphere of time and place. The terrain, the battles, the people, all come alive in this book. A great book that leaves several of the other books by Tranter lacking. If this book is truly based on historical facts and events, then the movie Braveheart is an interesting tool to compare and contrast for they have little in common."},{"Title":"Robert The Bruce The Price Of The Kings Peace","review":"Another excellent novel from Nigel Tranter which vividly brings the period of Scottish history &quot;The Wars of Independence&quot; too life. Mr. Tranter masterfully weaves his story &amp; set it out on a template of people &amp; places that you almost feel you can relate too. His characterisation of &quot;The Bruce&quot; is excellent as well, shown almost as a man torn between ambition &amp; a duty to his people. I wish I could give this book more marks than 10, that's how much an impression it made on me.

By the title I expected information on the visual genetic differences of many wildflowers. Instead what I received was a course in the internal biological genetics of plant cells: cross breeding, genetic variation, function of genes, and whatnot. The book has some black and white illustrations to help identify some flowers but is NOT a 'field guide.' In my opinion it contains some very heavy reading to be considered a field guide. It looks to contain a lot of information and is probably a good book for a professor of genetics but not your average weekend hiker. If you're looking for a good wildflower field guide I'd suggest you skip this book."},{"Title":"Annie Pitts, Burger Kid","review":"I have not received this book in the mail yet, but I started to read it to my kids last year when it was in the base library and we never got to finish.

But far from the title implies, The class has no relationship with knowledge economy which is the buzzword in the business community. But this book was used to make us to be familiar with the concept of &iexcl;social capital.&iexcl; Indeed this book tells less about knowledge but much more about social capital. Part I of this book contains introductory articles on the conception of the social capital and Part II lists real world application of the concept. 5 Articles of Part I voices cacophony, however. Reading through the articles only gives confusion to us. Nonetheless, it&iexcl;s inevitable and intentional for there is no consensus about the very basic conception. So editor deliberately put those conflicting perspectives in one volume. In turn, this way of editing reveals the fact that this book is not suitable to beginners. If you are already known to the word, social capital, reading through competing perspective doesn&iexcl;t baffle your nerves. But if you haven&iexcl;t heard the word at all, this book should not be recommended. Overall, the quality of articles is good enough. Indeed those are well-known ones. But if you want to see what the word, social capital at all, this is not your choice. If so, I recommend Nan Lin&iexcl;s &iexcl;Social Capital: A Theory of Social Structure and Action&iexcl;. This book does not only overview the various conflicting positions comprehensively, but also systematically define the concept from the network approach. In fact, Nan Lin is a eminent figure in the social network theory."},{"Title":"The Four Immeasurables: Cultivating a Boundless Heart","review":"This book focuses on cultivating the brahma-viharas: loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. Wallace offers incisive insights on these topics, as well as a nice summary of the meditation practice of samatha. Samatha is geared towards sharpening one's attention, which on the surface may not seem to have much in common with the four positive emotions that are the core of this book. Wallace demonstrates however that they are inextricably linked, and cultivation of attention serves as a foundation for achieving greater emotional virtue. He gives several examples for deepening understanding and practicing guided meditation.Wallace trained in the east but he is a westerner and also a scholar. Nonetheless, his writing is very articulate and reader-friendly. As such he is very qualified to bring these practices to the west. If these types of practices were made widely available, my guess is that many psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, anger-related problems, and ADHD would significantly diminish.P.S. I meant to give this 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Four Immeasurables: Cultivating a Boundless Heart","review":"Knowledgeably written by an instructor in Tibetan Buddhist theory and practice who trained for many years in monasteries in India and Switzerland, The Four Immeasurables: Cultivating A Boundless Heart is an inspirational collection of guided meditations, and reflections upon the &quot;Four Immeasurables&quot; (cultivation of loving kind-ness, compassion, equanimity, and empathic joy) that touch upon the lives of readers of all faiths.

Thus my most favorite book, ever, begins! In Katherine, Barbara Trapido created a beautiful, funny, neurotic character who is only ever capable of speaking the truth, even when it does her in. Terribly romantic, terribly hilarious, and occasionally so very sad that you weep into the pages...her phrasing so wise and eloquent and lovely in its complexity that you can only shake your head in wonder...GOD, I LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"A rollicking good read! Girl meets gay boy, meets bohemian family, meets boy, loves boy, is rejected by boy, goes to Italy, comes home to England, meets boy's younger brother (of the more famous Jack) and settles happily in an Irish stone cottage, with the blessings of all family members. A sweet story, littered with profanity and taboo-busting bad taste, very light but dealing with sad events, too, funny and sexy. A wonderful read, and, for the more discerning, some very sharp social observations."},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"I have read this book at least a dozen times. Despite the humor, the book deepens with each reading. Once you've enjoyed the characterizations and laughed at all the witticisms there are all the literary allusions to digest. Then there are the references to other parts of the book to map. Truly a gem. The best book Barbara Trapido has ever written. I am so glad that this book is back in print. I've given many copies of this book as gifts and previously I've had to scour used-book stores to find it. Buy it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"What a marvelous little novel. This is a complex and sophisticated story that feels much longer than its actual length of a couple hundred pages. The story of Katherine and her intimate involvement with a large bohemian family is touching, hilarious and at times down right raunchy. The author has a wonderful way with words, she says so much with her sparse prose. I would highly recommend seeking out this book, and I look forward to reading other work by this author."},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"This slender epic is by way of being the prequel to _The Travelling Hornplayer,_ which I unknowingly read first. This one centers on Katherine Browne and her affair with the entire Goldman family: Jake, the Jewish cockney philosophy professor and semi-radical Bohemian; Jane, his wife and supporter of his soul; Roger, the older son, his mother's favorite, and a neurotic math genius; and Jonathan, his father's favorite, all-round bloke and decent sort. Katherine, a very naive and very sweet young girl, first meets Jacob when he interviews her for a university fellowship and later the same afternoon falls under the sway of John Millet, a bisexual aesthete to whom she loses her virginity. John takes her to visit his old friends in the country, who turn out to be the Goldmans. She falls for the beautiful Roger, who turns out to be something of a ...; when he dumps her four years later during graduation week, she departs for Italy and doesn't return for ten years, having had and lost a baby. Then she rediscovers Jonathan. The book divides neatly into two parts, separated by the Italian interlude: Young-and-Vulnerable Katherine and Older-and-Sometimes-Wiser Katherine. The Goldmans have changed a lot during her decade away, but in the essentials they haven't really changed at all. This is a lovely book and it's amazing Trapido could cram so much story into only 218 pages. The scintilating dialogue makes me want to see and hear it on the stage. And the characters, as in _Hornplayer,_ are absolutely believeable."},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"Barbara Trapido writes beautifully.

The characters are real and loveable"},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"The experience of readingBrother of the More Famous Jacksuffers enormously if one has, as I had, already readThe Travelling Hornplayer, a better book, which is set chronologically later. So many of the characters are repeated, but knowing the later developments ofThe Travelling Hornplayermakes this prequel excruciating, without a sense of suspense.Redeemingly, Trapido's acerbic style - based as it is on emotional reserve, fascinating conversations, British slang, and intellectual banter - gives depth and wit to what is an unintentional back story to the sequel. This is not so much a book about narrator Katherine Browne as it is a celebration of the Goldman family, its feisty, lusty patriarch Jacob, its Madonna-esque matriarch Jane, and their slew of children, especially the two older boys and their conflicted relationships with their opinionated parents. Deliberate mention is made of Virginia Woolf and her artist sister Vanessa Bell, and I understood Jane to be Trapido's rendering of the constrained artist mother, a Vanessa Bell living through and appreciating her children while simultaneously resenting them.I strongly recommend reading this book first. Then go on toThe Travelling Hornplayer- a superior tale, with all the strengths and few of the liabilities. But if you're only going to read one of them, make itThe Travelling Hornplayer."},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"This is the most wonderful book I've read in a long time. This story takes place over a long span of years, and chronicles the love between a lonely girl/woman and an eccentric English family. Part love story, part coming of age, part learning life through hard knocks, this book caught me by surprise with its blend of straight honesty and bold tenderness.I read a lot of books, but there are very few that I love enough to recommend. _Brother of the More Famous Jack_ is one of them. I can't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"Even a man can be thoroughly captivated by this look into the female experience. I'm guessing Barbara Trapido's audience is women, but I found it a pleasure to read.I admit I was a little confused by all the characters at first, but I soon got to know who was who. I'm sure Trapido's female readers are much more quick on the uptake when it comes to how people relate to each other. I haven't read anything else by her, but the way she sets up the ending looks to me like trouble is afoot.I first became aware of this book via a book programme on BBC Radio 4 online. The discussion-panel participants were positively gushing. I had to find out for myself. It was not my normal fare, and therefore a pleasant discovery."},{"Title":"Brother of the More Famous Jack","review":"What a discovery this book is! Can't believe it took me almost 3 decades to find it. Written in 1982, it's her first novel and one that should be read out loud. Funny, excruciatingly poignant, a delight from beginning to end. Can't wait to read all her books now."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"First, before I pour on the star shine the reader has to adopt a sense of stereoscopic vision. Best to don your movie shades. Should this be a screen play? No doubt. Is it a commentary. I certainly hope so. Do you have to be a rich middle aged stock trader to believe in this book? Never the matter. Never the mind. What Holmes does here is intertwine everyday characters with an exteremely likable protagonist, Richard Novak.The opening of the book with the dual scene; Richard working out and watching the swimmer condensed with the normal trappings of the day, not normal for most people, housekeepers, nutritionists, movie stars next door; but something really clicks here. Holmes expertly sets up shop in Richards soul and leads the reader patiently through the heartache that he has experienced, and been forced to push asunder in search of ....life really. If Richard hadn't been able to closet his emotion he would have been a destroyed man and wouldn't have lived to get where he is today. That he remained detached throughout the years was merely his best survival tool. Anyone who has experienced a marriage falling apart, choosing to sink or swim, or losing a son or daughter to another parent will appreciate this book. It is a wise book. The rest of the characters, Cynthia, Anhil, Nic, Tad, and even Judy all take a back seat to the real story champions Ben and Richard. Its a book about a father who lost a son to a bad marriage partner, a cold selfish woman who couldn't see past her own needs and wants to give more to a man she had pledged her life to, and its about a father who realized he was drowning and in order to survive needed to get out; and then we have Ben the son who was lost at sea. Ben goes on of course, as is not always the case, to be a successful son and who is surrounded by loving family, still, losing a father carries the force of running aground an ice berg. The two come together later in such a bittersweet confrontation, and Richard finally breaks through to Ben. This book is about the goodness of strangers, its about everyday people coming together. Its about reunion in the truest sense of the word. Reunion with society, with family, with self.IF this isn't a movie, it should be a movie. I say this only because then more people would experience the beauty of this tale, which I personally feel is something everyone could learn at least a little something from. Richards life unfolds true, in a grand fashion of someone who has been insulated from society and suddenly realizes that he is a part of it too and needs to take part; however, one need not be rich in order to gain insight from this novel. This book WILL save your life if you have been distracted with the mundane, if you have looked away from the reality in order to just move on through the easier, the less painful, this book will affect you, if you let it. Let it.The ending paragraph is without eclipse, and my heart began to beat anew.Read it. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This book will save your life? Were I a book club, I'd say instead, welcome this author when she cruises your way, but don't necessarily trawl the Amazon to find her.Homes has ticked the right boxes on her resume. She attended Iowa Writers' Workshop, belongs to Yaddo artists' community, and teaches at Columbia University and the New School in New York. Her first novel, Jack, came at age 19. Her story collection, The Safety of Objects, inspired Rose Troche's film of 2001.Adopted at birth, Homes recently documented the disappointing discovery of her biological parents. Maybe that resolved the personal trauma, but what of the national trauma? Twin towers still loom as the pachyderm in the parlour of American fiction, the gatecrasher that American writers struggle to overcome.The previous Homes novel dates from 1999. This one distances the setting to Los Angeles. It subverts the unspeakable, via the menacing sinkholes, wildcats, wildfires and earthquakes known to monster that city. It introduces the rich but disconnected Richard Novak, jolted by an \\"incredible pain\\" he cannot identify.Show, don't tell, harp the sages of fiction. On the first two pages Homes tells us twice. \\"Everything today is not the same, and yet it is exactly the same and can never be the same again.\\" Followed hard by, \\"After years of making sure that he is left alone, he is suddenly afraid to be alone, afraid not to feel, not to notice.\\"Surviving his opening bout of incredible pain, Novak rapidly makes the acquaintance of an immigrant doughnut man, a helpful quack doctor, a \\"crying woman in the produce section\\", a personable movie star who lives up the road, and a famous author gone to ground. The 911-emergency operator recognises his voice after the reporting of his incidentally showy good deeds. During which time, his semi-estranged New York son is driving closer and closer to Los Angeles.Such a concatenation of threats and disasters, among the economically and racially diverse citizens of Los Angeles, echoes the disguised feel-good of the Academy-awarded movie Crash. There is in Novak's accidental-tourist wanderings a refreshing undercurrent of making it right, a healing serendipity. Once again, things tend to be underlined. When our Good Samaritan shames the doctor's waiting room into helping an old lady, Homes wills him to lecture the group, \\"That's the point, isn't it?\\"The endpapers acknowledge another Amy H., long-time Homes supporter Amy Hempel. She is a mordant miniaturist whose seemingly innocuous stories sometimes conceal a black undertow. Meanwhile, Homes makes benign observations like \\"Driving a Bentley to Target-only in L.A. does this make perfect sense,\\" and, \\"America has two kinds of politician-one has sex, the other has war\\".To make something great out of her good material, Homes maybe needed to stretch out and suffer more. If not quite up for that level of literary sacrifice and rebirth, she does offer something intriguing.(Canberra Times, September 9 2006)"},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I've been reading this book for a week and I am not done yet but I wanna say as a college student this book has really touched to me. I think everyone should read this book to understand how could affect a mid-age crisis to a person."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Here's the message of A. M. Homes' novel-get your head out of your woo woo and look around. Protagonist Richard Novak represents that unfortunate trend of people who are so impressed with their own self-importance that they have edited nearly everyone out of their lives. Richard has done just that, so when he is overwhelmed by mysterious and extraordinary pain there is no one to pick him up from the hospital. Shaken by how he has cut himself off from everyone save those whose services he pays for, he sees the importance of change. When he starts to pay attention to someone other than himself, things begin to happen.Homes has set her novel in Los Angeles, which is an easy shot. Bustling with immigrants from places ranging from Oman to Omaha and subject to a shifting landscape that seems mysterious to outsiders, it's an easy place to pick for such crises of being. In fact, \\"This Book Will Save Your Life\\" should be made up of harder choices. It's charming, it goes down, yes, easily, and its message of open your eyes is a good one. But what of it were set in another city or even a town that doesn't have the built-in joke factor of LA? Richard is so rich and has filled his life with so much macrobiotic kitsch that it is hard to recognize him our regular lives-even in the guy whose cell call is so important that he can't be bothered to greet the barrista at Starbucks.And then, once he does try to connect with other people, they are an exceptionally colorful crew. No one is as dismissive of him as the old Richard would have been to them. Even the crankiest-the woman he meets sobbing in a supermarket-gives him a chink to get in.This is a warmhearted, enjoyable novel, but I want to see a darker, deeper treatment of how we got to be in this fix. This Book may Save Your Life, but don't expect the journey to be like Rchard's."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Picture the love child of Forrest Gump + \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" + that recent Jim Carrey movie \\"Yes\\" - about a guy who decides to say yes to everything - and you pretty much get this book in a nutshell.Wanted to find value in this book because Homes has such a good rep. But either there's something I'm not getting, or the emporer really is naked. This was way too gentle to be satire (even the wacky LA health camp is treated respectfully), way too silly to be taken seriously (hard to get more over-the-top than feral chihuahuas), way too psychologically preposterous to be psychologically credible (are we really supposed to believe stereotypes like \\"the beatnick author\\" and \\"the movie star\\"?), and way too simplistic to offer realistic advice - go ahead, try saying \\"yes\\" to everything and see if you get heroism and movie stars ... or creeps & trouble!I get the moral - that living means more than just existing - and don't dispute that it's a worthwhile message. But I'm going to stick with books like Dandelion Wine that preach the same message a lot more effectively and a whole lot more sincerely."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"A decent book that could have been great, Homes's novel came off underbaked. Too many implausible plot lines that are hastily tossed in, incomplete, cookie-cutter characters, and a seeming desire on the part of the author to recreate the Los Angeles of \\"L.A. Story\\" sabotage an otherwise compelling story of a man who is trying to find his life again.Were this story focused on its characters more and their actual issues instead of attempting to impress readers with the flash and bang of its irrelevant events, this would have been a much more interesting book. Even the book's title suggests that Homes did not have a clear grasp on the point of this novel, and she spends 384 pages wandering around the desert trying to find it."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"A long and involved book about a dull and boring man, Richard, who questions life, but allows himself to fall into one \\"sinkhole\\" after the other. He is surrounded by upbeat people in the least likeliest of places - like Cecilia, and especially Anhil - but learns little or nothing from their example. Anhil, who has far less materially than Richard, is a master at carving out slices of life like a pie, and savoring every bit of it.I read the first half of the book, then skimmed through the rest. Richard's dull and boring life and attitude was getting to me."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Richard, the main character, is a person who has the means (financial, emotional, and resourceful) to do good. He has the uncanny knack of being in a place or situation that requires innovative intervention, and he steps into the metaphorical phone booth, changes to his Superman uniform, and performs the good deed.I just wish I crossed paths with him and was the bedificiary of his largess. I like the guy, and thought the book was an easy, most enjoyable read."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This book is the story of Richard Novak, now a divorced father of a 17 year old boy. He left his wife and son in New York when he moved to LA (where he still lives) about 10 or 12 years previously. He lives a reclusive life, trading in currencies or stocks and rarely leaving his house.One day he has intense pain, and doesn't know if it just started or if he just became aware of it.The book is a story of his journey to opening up to his life. Along the way he encounters a woman crying in the produce section, an Arab donut store owner, his neighbor the movie star, his other neighbor the screenwriter, his brother, and has some adventures rescuing various people and animals. Simultaneously, his son is taking a cross-country trip to LA with the son's cousin to see Richard.This is an entertaining book with some good messages. There are some scenes that had me laughing out loud, and some other scenes that I dog-eared to reflect on later.I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"A.M. Homes's latest novel takes you on a roller coaster ride through the life of her protagonist, Richard Novack, as he undertakes a redemptive battle to, in effect, save his own life. Lost and without a connection to the world, he reaches out to the people around him whose lives he changes and is changed by. He ends up creating a network of individuals who represent the many facets of his life and hold the promise of a better future."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This chapterless marathon through one mans isolated existance in modern Los Angeles is brimming with optimism and hope. Richard Novak is a wealthy day trader living in the Hollywood Hills with a sink hole in his back yard, and a famous actor next door. When he calls 911 while experiencing what he believes is a soon to be fatal heart attack, the course of his life radically begins to change. For me, the book was almost fable like in it's telling with events transpiring that are both fantastic and nearly unbelievable. Yet the underlying message of making a simple connection with your fellow man sustains successfully without slipping into Hallmark sentimentality. On a side note, being an Angelino, the book captures the city and it's inhabitants with razor sharp precision."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"A friend who also has read this book said it was Cheever as if written by Bill Hicks: savage, funny assault on suburban life. (If he stole that line from someone else then he's now double damned.)Still, it may not be as cynical and savage as Bill Hicks would have it. Hicks wanted LA to fall in the ocean so he could live oceanside in Arizona Bay. Though that does come close to happening here, no one is laughing manically about it. In fact, there are no villains in This Book Will Save Your Life. (At least not among the main characters). There is no one out to destroy another person to make their own life better, and there is no one who cares nothing about other people.There is however an abundance of surreality that does not seem far removed from life in Los Angeles. The possiblity that a saber-tooth tiger is loose somewhere in the Hollywood Hills doesn't seem as far-fetched as it could, when coupled with the rest of the book's car wrecks, kidnappings, artisan donuts and kindness of strangers.It's a book about helping other people, trying not to be selfish, and seeing what's going on around you. And despite my decription and the book's title, it's not mushy feel-goody pablum. It is not chicken soup for anyone's soul. It's a good read though."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"The title might be a bit presumptuous, but this novel, in the most captivating way, makes you think about stopping to smell the roses. In a way, it does throw out a lifeline. The book is charming, funny, outrageous, and just might be a long, modern day parable for good living.When Richard feels incredible, real pain, he seems to \\"wake up\\" from his repetitive, meaningless life. By opening up, he allows himself to meet, and befriend, a cast of intriguing, genuine, although slightly eccentric, characters. From the donut maker, the crying housewife, the movie star, and my favorite, Nic the writer, Richard's eyes are opened to life as it could be, maybe should be. As Richard starts remembering who he is, and what really matters, the most incredible things are going on around him.I tried to read this book straight through, although my life kept getting in the way (school, sleeping, family) but believe me, once I started, I didn't want to put it down. Now I'm going to lay it down, recommend it to my friends, and go love on my cat, call my kids, and do something nice for someone."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Read the reviews by the people who read the book and ignore the critics. They are so full of themselves that they can't just enjoy a good read."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This book belongs to a wider and worn out end of the century postmodern literature.The plot is full of generally known situations, such as nutrition obsessed wealthy people, often ridiculous. The characters are interesting but numerous and sometimes irrelevant to the story.I also found the book poorly balanced, the first part is nearly insignificant. The slightly humorous book has its climax towards the end.Often the narration is tasteless, a bit thick and lacks originality.However, this book is well written and succeeds to deliver a message of redemption and change."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I have always been a big fan of Homes writing. It's funny and sly and filled with the unexpected. She is wildly satirical and her renditions of modern life are right on the mark and, despite the characters' numerous oddities, very believable.So what happened here? I liked \\"This Book\\" but not as much as I have liked her writing in the past and not nearly as much as I wanted to. There were some brilliant moments, especially in the first hundred pages. But it seemed tamer that anything Homes has written in the past, like a TV version of the A.M. Homes I like so much. I felt she cleaned things up so that it would be accessible to a wider audience, which left me feeling like I was reading Homes Lite. Even the title set me off somewhat, since I was constantly changing my mind while reading the novel wondering if Homes seriously meant it or whether it was goofing on itself. There was not nearly enough of the ironic, sarcastic rule breaking Homes present in this book, so I kept thinking, Homes must actually mean that she wants people to think this book will change their life or her publisher did. Don't get me wrong, it is enjoyable and fun, but there is much less of an edge than you may be used to.The novel was a parabola, with the last half being pulled earthward by gravity. I have no idea why Homes decided not to slash some of the later passages. It would have been a leaner, meaner novel, with some of the old ambiguity we all loved so much. The desire to resolve all the sub plots is not a bad thing, nothing wrong with it. It's just not the A.M. Homes I know. I was hoping for more with less."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I loved this book. It was just incredibly fun and very entertaining. That is not to say it did not have serious moments, because it did. I am usually not a fan of Hollywood/L.A. scene books, but enjoyed this one. I did not find it that bogged down in stereotypes as other reviewers did. Sure, some were there, but often the stereotype would surprise you and do something very \\"unstereotypical.\\" I read this book in a day. I loved Richard's journey and all his friends, Nic, Anhil, Cynthia, Ben, Malibu and The Actor, Tad, even the sink hole investigator guys; and the 911 receptionist. It was kind, hopeful, made me laugh and on more than one occasion made me celebrate life and the people in it, quirks and all. It also made me laugh at some of the ridiculous things people are into, and why. The book pokes fun at a lot of new-agey L.A. stuff, but in a way that is not dark ~ just seemed to see the humor in it all. If you want a fun, entertaining time, this book is great for that. It may not be Pulizter material, but you'll probably enjoy yourself. I was truly bummed when it ended. Everyone I've recommended it to has thanked me."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This book really surprised me. I had a tough time getting into it--it has a pretty decent start but then when the protagonist begins accepting nuggets of wisdom from the loquacious ethnic donut store owner, I started getting a bit turned off. Basically, the book is always walking a very fine line between sincere and satiric (or stupid and clever, as Spinal Tap would say). Often I read it as a very arch, bizarre version on the weirdest sitcom you've ever read. Other times, I saw Holmes as a warmer, more humanistic Don DeLillo. But basically, around the time that the protagonist is using the help of a Hollywood movie star and a helicopter to rescue a horse out of a sinkhole in his backyard, I was just totally won over.A book with this title is deliberately setting the bar high for itself. It's kind of daring you to reject it. Stick with it and see what you think. The book's not for everyone, but for the few that it's very weird tone and sense of humor registers with, you will be delighted. You'll recall it like it was a movie, the situations drawn are so vivid. Also, I think this is the kind of book you keep reading not because of some kind of suspense about the plot, but because you are so invested with the characters.AM Holmes has attempted something very difficult here--a satire with a heart and soul and a face. I've read her other books and enjoyed them, but this is a singular achievement. Check it out for a truly out of the ordinary reading experience. Five stars."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"when i have nothing to do, I like to re-read old books of mine. And something about this book... it is my most read one.

As an L.A. resident, I often think about the collapse of the city - all these people and their money crumbling from an earthquake or burned by one of our enormous fires - but in Homes' book, the destruction is more than physical (geological?). Richard, the protagonist, takes the falling apart of his house to be a call to change his life. And so he does with a cast of quirky characters who provide him with the human touch he'd been avoiding for so long. What I enjoyed about this novel besides its unpredictability was how redemptive a story it really was. In an age of irony and cynicism, it was refreshing to read about a character who really does change for the better, who really does redeem himself in many ways.

But most importantly, he manages to start rebuilding connections to his family, connections he lost because of his own neglect. Ultimately, and messily, he manages to start reconnecting with his son.I didn't really connect with the main character because he was clearly wealthy enough to live a fantasy type of live, spending money with abandon.

What he doesn't have is a life. He has no friends, no relationship with his family, and spends weeks at a time without leaving his home. One morning he wakes up in pain. The next morning he spots a sinkhole outside his home and suddenly everything changes. He is forced to reconsider everything he's lived for the past fifteen years and what he finds transforms him.When you dig deeper into the story though, it's less about just one man then about life itself. It's about change, transformation, living. It was a really amazing story, written with incredibe depth. While some of what happens might seem preposterous and over the top, within the context of the story it is completely believable.My only complaint was how abruptly the novel came to an end. It feels like there should be more to the story. Sometimes this effect work well. I'm still not sure if this book falls into that camp or if it needs more of closure. Regardless of my feelings about the ending, I still rate this a five star book.Homes has quite a way with words. She draws you into the story completely. I found it nearly impossible to put the book down and frequently reading passages aloud to my husand or rereading them to myself. Even more surprising was that my husand who rarely reads anything that isn't non-fiction or fantasy has stated that he will probably read this book. I will definitely be picking up Homes' other novels and will be recommending this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This was my first book of A.M.Homes'. I will definitely be looking for her other books now. I enjoyed this is a quiet and reflective way. People talk about how she builds the peripheral characters and their influences on the main character's life, but what emerges for me was more about the liberation of Richard - his finding permission to live through the (strange) reonciliation with his son, Ben. I liked how all of the characters had a purity to them, and the hilarious moment when Dr Lusardi turns out to be a fake! As a mental health professional myself, I wonder how much people are actually inspired by the image rather than the reality of what one says, and this book is very much about a subtle shift in perspective which liberates Richard to finally connect with people. I found the ending simultaneously tragic but beautiful, and I think Richard's journey will stay with me for some time."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"When I read the synopsis again, I cannot help but think that it doesn't do this incredible book justice. I am so glad that this was my last book of 2009 because it was the \`grand finale!' The honest manner through which Homes examines mid-life, not only by way of Richard Novak, but also in the other characters, including the females, is outstanding. Thematically it moved me, the humor kept me interested, and the content inspired self-examination. The story is set in the hills above LA and begins when Richard Novak notices a sink hole in his yard. At the same time he feels pain and thinks, 'this is IT.' He calls 911 and the fantastical awakening that ensues is a humorous journey that will make you both cry and laugh at the same time. I don't want to say too much more and give anything away, but this book is truly a MUST read. Please, if you must pick up a book in 2010, make it this one!I can't find any flaws in the content or story, which leads me to break one of my own rules-to comment on format and marketing. The only downfall of this book that I see is the cover and synopsis. I don't think it attracts the wide audience that I know this story can appeal to. The title alone should be enough to spark attention, but I'm afraid it will not be, and because of this, so many people will miss out on reading a fabulous novel. Also, the synopsis refers to Richard Novak, who is the main character, but there is one other very important female character in the story that deserves mention and by doing so, might draw in female readers. She is an under appreciated mother and wife who is driven to the extreme in order to regain back her life. I think she is worth mentioning because she is a likable, flawed and attractive character that greatly contributes to the story's memorable experience."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Richard's life Vesuviouses.

It is about the unexplainable pain engulfing the urban species who, in their loneliness, behind their computer screen and fancy gadgets, have detached from their past, present, surrounding, and might just end up in the pit unless,...The awkward natural phenomena and the sweetness of Anhil's donuts and his words - his dreams, his passion, and his sheer enjoyment of what the luxurious life of an LA suburb has to offer, come in contrast with the numbness and the disinterest that prevails with the \\"native\\".For some, it takes no less than a landslide to bring one to complete grips of the true meaning of life.A good interesting read."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This Book Will Save your Life by A.M.

The idea of a self-absorbed stock trader being shaken out of his rutted life and finding the joy and satisfaction in helping others is certainly promising. However, I just felt that I was watching a movie that allowed me no insight into the mind or motivations of the characters. As Richard (don't call me Dick) Novak goes through his life, interacting with a movie star, a crying woman, a reclusive writer, a kidnapped woman, and various city functionaries concerning his sinkhole, we never find out how he feels about any of the odd events happening to him!When Ben, his son, enters the story, the emotions improve, but not to a satisfactory level, in my opinion. In addition, I have trouble sympathizing with a character who can simply buy what he wants to give to people, from cars to donut shops. Where's the angst in dropping down a wad of dough to console a broken heart?"},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"One more example of ther importance of connections to success. While there are some amusing things in this book, if you or I wrote it, it would never be published."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. The last thing I want to immerse myself in is the life style of the super rich and clueless in modern Los Angeles, complete with a staff to provide special \\"health\\" diets, a personal trainer, meaningless meditation retreats, $100K cars, and an all-white sex palace on the Malibu coast. The addition of walk-on parts for Bob Dylan and Gerald Ford only makes it more unreal. Nor to I need an unbelievable series of disasters, from sink holes to collapsing houses to freeway kidnaps to a Los Angeles firestorm to try to inject some plot into this unfocused story. As a straight novel, it is a failure. Some reviewers call it a satire, and perhaps that is a redeeming perspective, but the cover blurbs take this weird tale with amazing solemnity."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I loved Music for Torching; however, the ending of this book was a let-down. As always, Homes' prose is terse with no extraneous and unnecessary details, but here I didn't quite understand the ending.

Not quite sure what message Homes was trying to convey though."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"The plot for this book - an old man improbably bumping into strange circumstances - is so thin and tiring that I suspect it was birthed by a four o' clock a.m. game of slug charades. You should only read this book to:- stop you from looking at sleeping, drooling people- remind yourself that there are worse things than being trapped with your own thoughts- trick someone you hate into reading it (convince them to wait until the end)The book has: boring dialogue, tired ideas, meaningless randomness. And it lacks any sort of entertainment value. It would be a real pity if the author's other books are any good, because I'll be avoiding them as if they are socially stupid relatives."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Stephen King was right, a great novel, destine to be remembered. A classic."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Why do you have a review from Publishers Weekly that uses the wrong name of the author? Seems someone is confused."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"The audio book version of This Book Will Save Your Life (by A.M. Homes) benefits from the fine reading given it by Scott Brick. That Brick manages to give so many eccentric characters a distinctly recognizable tone of voice is, in fact, remarkable. And, because these characters are the best thing the novel has going for it, Brick's contribution is particularly important to one's overall perception of the novel.The book opens just as Richard Novak is suffering through a life-changing experience. He is on the phone with a rather blas&eacute; 911 operator who insists on methodically interviewing him about the pain he his experiencing rather than taking his word that he needs immediate help. The pain, so bad that Richard is even unsure precisely where he hurts, does ultimately land him in a Los Angeles emergency room. The Richard Novak that emerges from that emergency room will not be the same man who entered it.Prior to his painful reawakening, Richard was content with his life of relative ease and isolation. He lived alone, working the stock market from his expensive home, totally dependent upon the services of a daily housekeeper/cook and personal trainer to keep him going. The problem, as he sees it now, is that he is close to no one, including the teenage son he barely knows.Richard's need to reconnect with humanity will lead him to a series of bizarre experiences involving those he encounters over the next few days. Among Richard's new intimates are: a Hollywood star who seems to need a new friend as badly as Richard; a young mother whose family completely takes her for granted; a cheerful donut-shop owner/philosopher; and the J.D. Salinger-type writer who happens to live next door to Richard's Malibu beach house rental. As he reaches out to help whatever strays he encounters along the way, Richard suffers through the turbulence of trying to reclaim a relationship with his son just when his house begins to slide into a hillside sinkhole.This Book Will Save Your Life works well as a tongue-in-cheek satire of the modern California lifestyle. Richard's sincere attempt to change his life for the better makes him an easily likable character, as are many of the characters to whom he attaches himself. My one quarrel with the book's plot is the ambiguous ending that comes before the book resolves its most climactic scene. I am not one who is amused by the task of creating his own ending for a novel, instead believing that to be the author's job. This Book Will Save Your Life had me right up to the book's last page - where it lost my affection and caused me to lower its rating."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"It took a while for me to get drawn in to this book. At first, the main character seemed shallow and all the crazy things that happened to him weren't believable. But little by little, the story grew on me and by the end I did care about what happened.It is the story of an older man (Richard) who suddenly suffers an attack of severe pain. No medical cause can be identified, but the incident forces him to take stock of his life and to try to make it more meaningful. He signs up for a meditation retreat and contacts his estranged son.Random things begin happening to him which cause him to connect more with other people. Some of them make him famous as \\"The Good Samaritan,\\" a hero who saves the lives of other people and rescues animals in distress.I didn't like Richard's son. I realize that his distress and acting-out was due to his father's abandonment, and I think he was intended to be a sympathetic character. But one of the things he did was so revolting that I could not like him or forgive him as a character. Many of the other characters were delightful, though: such as an immigrant doughnut shop owner; and a full-time mom distressed by the 24/7 demands, boredom, and lack of appreciation for her career.By the time the book ends, Richard's life has become rich with meaning and he has built a network of significant relationships.The ending is great: short, but unexpected and very dramatic, it \\"makes\\" the book. I didn't really get the title, though. I guess it refers to making something of your life, but it's too vague for me. It's a great title, but just didn't relate to the book as much as I would like.(372 pages)Quote from This Book Will Save Your Life:\\"Whether you know it or not, you carry the past with you everywhere. It's better to know.\\""},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I am not even sure how I came across this book. As is so often the case, I pick up a thread of a conversation or catch a reference in a footnote and the next thing I know I am reading yet another book that is unrelated to anything I am involved with in my daily routine. I am not a big follower of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous or any of the other typical shows that show us just how hard it is to be rich and famous, so I am somewhat amused that I was captured by this story-line.To briefly state my attraction, I think it goes back to the need I have as a human to be in community with other humans. The person of this book, Richard Novak, had created a life for himself that was void of meaningful relationships. In his isolated world he controlled everything and limited his interactions to a minimum. But unfortunately he could control the most basic thing, his own body and its ability to force him out of his cocoon existence. All it took was one health scare to take him out of his \\"bubble-boy\\" existence into the real world.It is at this point that I felt as though the book took on a \\"Forrest Gump-ish\\" style. He finds himself in situations that are interesting, funny and improbable. I also felt as though i was watching a version of the movie CRASH and the inter-relationships we have within the community of humans.It would be easy to have this book be of interest if you were a person who has devoted your life to a career at the expense of relationship and possibly have it serve as a wake up to rethink that strategy. But I think the book serves a purpose beyond just a wake up call to the overworked business executive. If I allow myself to get beyond the wealth and lifestyles of the rich and famous vehicle employed in the story, I am challenged to experience community with others beyond the nonphysical touch of online social networks, text messages and the thousands of other ways that I may simulate the human touch.Online connectedness allows me to maintain relationships even when I am not able to be physically with the people I consider my friends. However, if I am not careful I could easily find myself, like Richard Novak, without the lavish lifestyle, touching through technology, regulating my interactions, avoiding the messiness of relationship and community. If this book serves the purpose of encouraging us to get out among people and engage as an active participant in community then it has served the reader well. If on the other hand, just as one might watch Forrest Gump and come away wanting to go on extended runs or eating more shrimp, well I suppose that is fine as well."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I read this book as part of my book club, and it is now one of my all-time favorite books. Just a lovely book on what happens if we open ourselves up to others and living. And hilarious."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Probably the best book I have read in at least a year, for it's unpretentious characters, entertainment value, authenticity, sheer nostalgia (particularly if you have spent any time in LA), and frank laugh out loud writing. Richard's bittersweet awakening to himself and the world around him echos off the overstimulated walls of LA's finest: from which emerge the endearing doughnut man, Anhil, full of hope, and the lady from the produce section who brings a sense of connection to Richard. The story revolves around connection with Richard's son, ex-wife, and the variety of characters that emerge to populate his day giving him purpose through bizarre and unexpected incidences. Adrift as we all are in the great sea of life (in reference of course to the book, as you will see) small connections, reaching out, eventually provide the meaning and peace for which we long."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"This book is extremely engrossing. Richard Novak is a character that would be easy not to like in another author's hands, but in this story, despite some very clear wrongdoings on his part, his is likable and you start rooting for him. It was especially compelling because I know people like him, who will do for others, but not treat themselves well or make sure their own needs are met. Or who trip up as parents and try to make grand gestures to others to compromise for parental shortcomings. This book was excellent, my only problem was a bit of a slow pace. I am going to check out other books by AM Homes though and you should definitely read this one!"},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I could relate to some of this man's pain, but in some ways he is hard to understand. Still, the book had good moments, yet I am not sure of the ending. What really happened? I don't want to give it away, yet Iam not certain myself. I think the story had the potential for greatness, but just misses the mark. Some of the characters seem self-centered and shallow. Then, there is the feeling that this is a case oftoo little, too late. In spite of everything, I have to say I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"A.M. Homes has been a favorite since \\"Music for Torching\\". She has a gift for satyrizing stereotypical characters confronted with atypical situations, while keeping it all on the precipice of believability. \\"This Book...\\" opens with Richard (don't call me Dick) Novack - divorced, middle-aged and financially free - experiencing an epiphany after a scare with a mystery illness. Richard has spent his past several years glued to his computer screen managing his investments, while his housekeeper, nutritionist, and personal trainer manage his personal needs. He is as removed from social intercourse as anyone in LA could manage to be, until the illness and an emerging sink-hole on his property change his life. A chance meeting with a woman crying in the produce department at Ralph's, the rescue of a horse from the sink-hole, a stop at an out-of-the way donut shop, a trespassing trash-picker, and a stray dog all lead to funny and lasting relationships which Richard greedily invites into his empty life. Offstage, Richard's estranged teenage son Ben is en route for a visit with the father he despises for his neglect. The book plays in your mind like the multilayered movies about LA life - Crash, Laurel Canyon, for example - and could easily be adapted to screen. But enjoy it in your mind - it's a trip worth taking."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Gives you an exuberant rush for the first half and a bit of a deep-breathing, near-angynic fit of panic for the second. Wonderfully realised, as someone might say. Enjoyed it quite a bit."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I devoured this book. It is wise, compassionate, funny, moving, and as good as any novel every written about LA. As a transplanted New Yorker, I am amazed at how well Ms. Homes understands life here. She has captured its insanity as well as its poetry. And she conjures its most magical quality -- that on any given day virtually anything is possible. I heartily recommend it, and then when you are finished, go read The End of Alice, and then tell me that AM Homes is not one of the best living American writers."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"I'm not sure how to go about reviewing this book considering the fact that what Homes intends to do is incredibly ambitious - trying to satirize the life of a middle-aged wealthy financier undergoing a physical and spiritual crisis - yet the finished product can be described as luke warm at best. Many writers have done an admirable job delving into the mindset of this particular subset of individuals, but few have done it in a modern setting (the closest I can think of is Delillo in \\"Cosmopolis,\\" an equally luke warm novel). The novel follows the life of Richard Novak, a wealthy trader who \\"plays\\" with money while being isolated from the world, and the events directly after a pain and/or panic attack he has in his large L.A. home. He comes out of the hospital realizing how alone he is and goes ahead and tries to reforge relationships with his estranged son and make new ones with an unlikely cast of characters - a wife who feels trapped in her marriage and goes to the supermarket to get away from it all, a do-it-all actor, a J.D. Salinger type writer who happens to be friends with Bob Dylan, a coffee shop owner who is a source of wisdom to all who come to him...the list goes on. Many of the episodes are funny and entertaining, yet at no point do you ever see through this thin and somewhat weak attempt at looking at the pain isolation brings on those around you and inevitably to yourself. In many respects, the novel reminds me of some of Bret Easton Ellis's early work - especially the Informers - because of the money and the drug/Hollywood lifestyle Homes writes about. There is something extravagant in the way the characters live, yet in many instances, they don't notice at all. This may be the only fully successful part of the novel in that you can describe all of the characters as tragic in some way. Unfortunately, although they have interesting attributes and designations, they're all kind of cookie-cutter in their own way. You almost get bored reading about them and go ahead and wait for a resolution that is so unsatisfying that it overshadows the strength of Homes's prose, one thing that is a carryover from her short fiction (where, incidentally, I think she should remain). All in all, this is the kind of book that makes you sad because you may very well have wasted a few days that could have been spent on something better."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"What a talent we have here. Breathtaking in its audacity and full of ideas Homes never puts a foot wrong. And with something new happening in literally every sentence I was amazed how she kept it all up. But she does, and with what freshness and confidence!Cliche or no, these are characters to fall in love with (even the iffy ones) and Richard Novak is truly a hero for our times. He rises to every occasion and often in satisfyingly unpredictable ways (and if you ever enjoyed Scorcese's 'After Hours' you'll adore this).And this is also the definitive L.A. novel (yes, the place is nuts), especially so on account of the author being a New Yorker. As the plot proceeds on its completely irresistible and helter-skelter course no detail of L.A life is spared by Homes's mordant eye and I think it's this that ultimately lifts the novel to the very highest plane. And that's on top of the author's compassion, her warmth, the sheer boldness and inventiveness of it all.I read this book in a few days while holidaying on a Greek island (okay, okay, so it was a 'beach read' but so what, my other book was Stendhal). My experience there was enriched no end by this book and it's hard for me to imagine anything better. And, long after my return, I still can't get adorable Cynthia out of my mind . . .Finally, amidst all the customary literary sneering at this book having been selected for Richard and Judy's Book Club, I'd like instead to add my pointed congratulations on their having had the high intelligence to have chosen it. They also chose George Hagen's stupendous 'The Laments' a while back and that book, along with this one, remains the finest American novel I've read in some years. I've never watched the show (I work), and I don't really know who Richard and Judy are, but once again I'm truly indebted to them for bringing to this marvellous book the every ounce of publicity that it deserves."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Why isn't Homes a bigger name? Don't understand it. The circle begins with Saunders, but she's surely the next ring. Anyway, this book. It's intimate, huge, focused, sweeping, and packed with treasures that are never obscured, but cross-referenced, accessible, and plain fun to encounter. You want realism or logic? Look elsewhere. This story is wound up by the novelist, put in motion, and it asks you to ride along. Buy the ticket. There are some too-convenient plot devices here and a couple of stock feature-film advancement techniques, but they all work together. I loved this book. I hated saying good-bye to these characters, and by a quick count, there are ten that mattered to me. How about a sequel, A.M.? They're rarely good, but you might have a chance with this one."},{"Title":"This Book Will Save Your Life","review":"Turkey a future where they are kicking the best piece of all time.

So Homes' prose is not the problem, though I felt it drew too much attention to itself. So why not 5 stars? Because I could not believe the protagonist as real. That may be my failing, I'm not sure. It just seems to me that a person who has been able to amass wealth would not be so naive. For that matter, I believed none of the characters, though I liked them. I believed none of the circumstances, such as the sinkhole and the people Novak meets, such as the overwhelmed mom who, by conveniently running away from her family for a while becomes his sidekick..This Book Will Save Your Life seemed to me like a Bildungsroman in which the author forces the actions, motivations, and happenings to support her message. On some level, dare I say, that is bad writing. At one point, the morning after having read a good chunk, I even contemplated not finishing. I skipped ahead a little to see if things were going to get better. Not so, yet inexplicably, I was drawn in again, so much so that I went back to where I'd left off and continued to read the rest till late into the night. I wanted it to be over because I couldn't stop reading it. Weird. There's something there when a book makes a reader do that. So then why even 4 stars? That's why, I could't stop.There's something that makes me not want to dismiss this book. So, reader, as far as I'm concerned, your on your own.

The sort of book you'll read (perhaps \\"devour\\" is a better word) and instantly start recommending it to friends (at least the rare ones that still read books), and end up reading it again yourself. In fact, you will rave about this book so much that people might start giving you wide space or avoiding you altogether. This novel is that special, that different. In this age of economic calamity, wars, poverty, and other depressing situations, it's rare to read a book like that this has such a \\"nice\\" and \\"positive\\" message. This is definitely not a book for pessimistics or jaded types who think they know it all. Then again, maybe it's those types that NEED to read this book. This is a very fun book, with a positive thread running through it. You might even say it's an \\"up with people\\" sort of message. But don't go thinking it's some sort of self-help tripe or \\"The Secret\\" to anything cosmic. It's as profound as you let it. Despite the happy vibe of this novel, there is also an edge and a bite to the story --- thanks to the deft writing skills of Homes. The characters she writes about are complex and charming creations, and the reader can't help but become attached to them. Some may find this story inplausible or ridiculous, but Homes dares the reader to become a believer. Like the rollercoaster of life, this novel also has some funny situations, some sad and heartbreaking incidents, some love and compassion, and moments of sheer bliss. Maybe this book won't save your life, but it might make you think about caring for other people in a whole different way."},{"Title":"How to say your prayers: A comprehensive guidance to salat-offering","review":"How To Say Your Prayers: a comprehensive guide to salat-offering.

This book begins by examining Calhoun's youth and how his father Patrick instilled his virtues in his son. Calhoun went to Yale and later law school in Connecticut. Calhoun was then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives at the time of the 1812 disagreements with Britain. Calhoun was to remain in politics until his death almost 40 years later. Calhoun served as a Representative, Vice-president, Senator, and Secretary of War and State. The book is at its best when it details Calhoun attacking the status quo, something he did often. In fact, with todays sell-outs that we call politicians, it's nice to see that someone once stood up for what he believed in. Bartlett spends some time pointing out Calhoun's ironies--one of which was that as great a man as he was, his kids were spoiled brats. Only one of his children was up to his immense intellect, and that was his daughter Anna. Since women didn't have careers in the 19th century, she couldn't follow him into politics. Try and find this book at the library if Amazon doesn't get it in stock."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun: A Biography","review":"After reading this biography of John Calhoun, I had completed reading about the lives of the &quot;Great Triumvirate&quot; of Webster, Clay and Calhoun who, as Representatives, Senators and Secretaries of State were the most dominant non-Presidents in early-19th Century America.Each of the Triumvirate had their assets and their flaws. As this biography illustrates, Calhoun's great assets were his integrity and his intellect; his great flaws included his inflexibility and his adherence to promoting and continuing slavery.As a biography goes, this one is good but not great. It is a generally well-written work, but Bartlett has a tendency to speculate as to what Calhoun and others were thinking at particular moments and let a pro-Calhoun bias sometimes remove the objectivity from his work. Despite this, I still did not feel I could really relate to Calhoun, who comes off kind of remote.Overall, there is more good than bad in this book, however, and as an introduction to an important historical figure, this is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"John C. Calhoun: A Biography","review":"First, let me say that I have a pro-Calhoun bias, not because of his stance of slavery, but rather because through sheer strength and tenacity he was able to elevate himself to a place in government and history. Calhoun started by working hard at Yale to succeed in spite of his disadvantages. Once he did, he would then work hard to make a name for himself in politics, as Secretary of War, Vice-President, and Senator. He did this through hard work, a brilliant intellect, and unending commitment to his identity and lifestyle. The commitment to his identity and lifestyle is what I admire in the man, and Bartlett captures that with a great zest. All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the era leading tot he Civil War, or men of principle."},{"Title":"The war of the dots","review":"Robert B.

First of all, it was clogged with characters from Paquet's former novels--none of which I have read. I found it very distracting. Secondly, I didn't really like the heroine. I thought Lucinda was overly critical of Stephen. If someone made so many shameless suggestions about MY work, I wouldn't want to have anything to do with them. 1 1/2 stars (the extra half-star being for the sprinkling of wit)Overall, a decent read.

I agree with several other reviewers in that I noticed that the infamous Elizabeth Bathory had her name mutilated by the author as Bathroy and not just a typo! Even though the Bathory issue was NOT a typo, I found several of those as well. Another thing that was in error was with the Susan Smith excerpt...the author states that she drove her children into a river. I live in SC and know for a fact that Susan Smith drove her children into a lake. Horribly written with a lot of the word &quot;um&quot; in the pages (which I find very irritating) and what appears to be a lot of &quot;fluff&quot; that just isn't necessary.

Too many typos (Countesss Elizabeth Bathory, the &quot;Blood Countess,&quot; is listed as having the last name of &quot;Bathroy,&quot; just as one example), showing that the book was not proofread very well . The author also uses web sites and magazines for sources, many of which have erroneous information about these women.Better research techniques, and a decent editor would have helped immensely. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"Mistresses of Mayhem: The Book of Women Criminals","review":"This is a decent guide for those who are unfamiliar with various female criminals, though more serious students of crime may find it wanting. My quibbles: 1) some of the entries, e.g., Lizzie Borden, are too brief to do their subjects justice; 2) though there is a general bibliography, one really has no way of knowing what sources she used for individual cases, which would be helpful for the controversial ones; 3) some of her facts are wrong, e.g., she repeatedly refers to Elizabeth Bathory as Elizabeth Bathroy; 4) there are occasional stupid errors, e.g., &quot;had their fingers pulled off with hot pinschers&quot; (pg. 15); 5) the writing is sometimes awkward, e.g. &quot;[the police] were lucky enough to come by some great DNA samples.&quot; (pg. 118). On the plus side, I can't think of any females that were not included. Verdict: a mixed bag."},{"Title":"Mistresses of Mayhem: The Book of Women Criminals","review":"I thought this was a very interesting book. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down! The author has a very interesting and entertaining writing style. The book is full of great information, but it isn't dry like an encyclopedia. Also, the the crimes of the women are talked about, but within the context of their lives. The author doesn't make excuses for the women, but she does flesh the women out--they are more than women who did bad things. The two scariest women were probably The Blood Countess and Kate Webster. I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about women criminals and people who are interested in women's life stories as well."},{"Title":"Mistresses of Mayhem: The Book of Women Criminals","review":"No one is perfect but a non-fiction is no use if you cannot trust the accuracy of the information in it. In Mistresses of Mayhem, Ms. Hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question. One wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the Court Tv Website. She misnames Countess Elizabeth Bathory (the so-called female Dracula) as Bathroy. (No it is not a typo. It is spelled that way all through the book.) In the famous Diane Downs case already well documented by Ann Rule in Small Sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many, she misidentifies the daughter who died as Christie who might be surprised by this since Christie not only survived but testified against her mother. (Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial.) Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes. Good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary."},{"Title":"Mistresses of Mayhem: The Book of Women Criminals","review":"I read this book and was sorely disappointed. As an avid true crime fan, I was very disappointed. This author had witnesses's names wrong as well as pertinent facts about the case.

A quick check verified my conclusion that the letters \\"rn\\" must have appeared like an \\"m\\" so we have two variations of the same name, which is Hornberger in other booksellers' Web sites. This is not a review as I did not read it. I subscribe to Zooba and had selected this title, based on its description alone, as one of the books on my list, but Zooba e-mailed me to let me know the book was no longer available. I then went to Amazon's Web site to look into their price, but after reading these reviews I think I will not order it. That error in which of Diane's daughters survived was particularly bad. Thank you all for taking the time to write your reviews and warnings. One thing I checked on the internet was Elizabeth's last name and found Bathroy used in a number of sites, though more for the fictional character (such as in the movie Daughter of Darkness) based on the real person. One site mentioned the Brie family and included the name Lady Hera Bathroy, changling sister to Elizabeth, followed by Lady Elizabeth Bathroy Creed (my mother). I do own Dracula Was a Woman: In Search of the Blood Countess of Transylvania, by Raymond T.

Caterino's latest creation, She.By the end of the first chapter, She was all that mattered to me as well. Finding out who She was, who She is, who She will be. Sound confusing? Try intriguing.If David Cronenberg were to make a film starring Scarlett Johansson and Colin Farrell, taking his own Videodrome to an entirely new dimension, then She would be his script. Caterino has obviously done his homework. He takes the tightly wound story of a man in search of his long lost would be lover and savior, (and doesn't love always save us?) then he methodically unravels it against a voyeuristic film and internet backdrop.Caterino jettisons the testosterone-fueled hyperbole that drove Gunner Star and switches into erotic obsession gear, then turns up the fun to 11. She is filled with beautiful women, shady villains, and spectacular chases. It owes as much to the film noir movement of the forties as it does to Harlan Ellisonesque science fiction. To call it an erotic thriller would be a disservice. It's that, and so much more.JC Pezzini is a man so obsessed, so intent on finding She, that in the hands of a lesser novelist, he would be just another scummy Peeping Tom. But everyone has had a she or a he that they wanted to find, and Caterino hones in on those emotions deep inside all of us to turn what should be an unsympathetic protagonist into just another human being looking for happiness.She never loses steam as JC travels deep into his own memories and ultimately through time itself to answer the questions that have haunted him his entire adult life. She delivers. Caterino has created a unique vision of desire and what it means to look into the face of destiny. I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next."},{"Title":"She: A Novel","review":"Exploring the dark and hidden secrets of one's own past, righting a wrong, maybe finding a way to avert a past tragedy; these are things that most of us have fantasized about at one time or another. Such is the setup scenario for \\"She\\", the riveting thriller by James J Caterino.Part erotic thriller, part science fiction noir, \\"She\\" is the story of JC Pezzini, a filmmaker who is haunted by a tragedy in his past, and by the mysterious woman who rescued him and brought him back from the brink of death.\\"She\\" reminded me of the new wave science fiction pulps of the 1960's, but it also has a very unique texture and feel.

Sometimes, I'll have to put the book down to write for a few minutes before picking it up again... but that's only if the book is insanely good - such as \\"She\\" by James Caterino. Seriously, people, I cannot recommend this book enough. I almost didn't want it to end it was so good, and it inspired so much creative writing I did.Though I have read a lot of books, this one really stood out. The plot line is unbeatable, unpredictable, and overall outstanding. The sentence structure is amazing - I wanted to write down every other sentence in this book because it was that good. And don't even get me started on the dialogue - talk about realistic! I could hear the conversations in my head so perfectly, I knew exactly who was speaking and how they were saying it... I could even picture the body language.This book, this incredible book, has set a new standard for my writing. It's made me look ahead to how I want to be, look back at what I need improvement on, and if I need a motivation boost, I just read a paragraph or two and suddenly my story comes out just how I want it to sound. I look up to James Caterino with great awe and amazement. If you haven't read his books, I highly suggest putting them at the top of your \\"to read\\" list. Action packed, with characters that literally come to life and befriend you. I only wish I could thank the author profusely in person for writing, and tell him to never, ever, ever, ever stop."},{"Title":"She: A Novel","review":"When I started \\"She\\" I wasn't sure what to expect. The story is one of voyerourism, obsession and time travel (of a sorts). JC is trying to find the woman who saved his life, 20 years ago after a horrific accident. This search has become his life's work and while he see's parts of his \\"She\\" in other women, there is always something missing.I found myself TOTALLY sucked into the world that Mr. Caterino created. JC was a character that intrigued me, even though a great deal of his attempts to find \\"She\\" were downright odd. Without giving the ending away, I loved how the story came full circle, what JC was willing to do and give up in order to try and find \\"She\\" as well as how, I feel, he found himself too.For me, I found it fascinating to be inside the head of a man who was obsessing, it was a breath of fresh air when it comes to characterization and development of a story line.With hints of the paranormal, romance, mystery and intrigue, this book took me pleasantly by surprise and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a well written, intriguing story.Looking foward to Mr. Caterino's other works. :-)Video NoirAction Figure"},{"Title":"Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland 1919-1939 (New Babylon: Studies in the Social Sciences)","review":"Jewish scholar Joseph Marcus eschews the knee-jerk anti-Polish generalizations that typify material on this subject in favor of a thorough examination of the Jewish situation prior to Polish independence (1870-1918) and in preWWII Poland (1918-1939). It soon becomes obvious that all the indignities and injustices that Polish Jews experienced occurred within the broader context of overall Polish tolerance in the face of considerable development of Jewish economic life. Ironically, Polish anti-Semitism festered and grew primarily because Polish Jews had been so successful in the first place-actually and perceptively at Polish expense.Marcus notes that Poland, under foreign rule, had missed the Industrial Revolution. He claims that what little industrial infrastructure Poland had acquired by the late 19th century had been almost entirely established and owned by Jews. Pointedly, Marcus (p. 94) recognizes its slight benefits for Poland right up to WWI. Jewish entrepreneurship tended to stay within extended families (pp. 92-93), thus reinforcing its self-perpetuating, Pole-disenfranchising, monopolistic character. Early industrialization tended to be very exploitive of working people, so there were minimal \\"trickle down\\" benefits for individual Poles. The sugar industry had been almost entirely Jewish until 1914 (p. 87). Jews, who constituted only 10% of Poland's population, accounted for 70% of licenses (p. 327) to perform business in industry and commerce (early 1920's, central Poland). Jews controlled about 40% of industry and commerce (p. 327) in the Polish urban economy (1926-1934). In 1935, most of Warsaw's 48 banks were Jewish (p. 109). Just before the outbreak of WWII (1938-1939), 55% of the Poland's chemical industry was Jewish-owned (p. 115), as were 70% of the textile and food industries (p. 113, 116). The garment and shoe industries remained entirely Jewish. In Polish universities (1929), Jews constituted 42% of its graduates (p. 67). Finally, although there was wide disparity between rich and poor Jews, the overall Jewish per capita income was more than 40% greater than that of Poles (1929; p. 41).One can comprehend how Poles came to think that \\"Jews are the real rulers of Poland\\" and that \\"Jews are getting rich on the backs of Poles\\". Moreover, the bulk of preWWI manufactured products went to Russia (p. 13, 100) and other foreign rulers, contributing to the impression of a Jewish-foreign bond acting against Polish interests. The rather tepid Jewish support for Polish independence in 1918, a fact not mentioned by Markus, further reinforced this notion. However, Polish anti-Semitism was more words than substance, as it NEVER developed to the point of seriously challenging the Jews' dominant status. (For example, most Polish consumers disregarded calls to boycott Jewish traders; p. 245).The Jews have a long history of commercial activity, and undoubtedly the entrepreneurial spirit had developed much earlier and more strongly among Jews than Poles. However, Marcus' portrayal of Jewish economic dominance as the default outcome of Polish ineptitude (\\"a static, feudal society disinterested in modernization\\", p. 95, 97) overlooks essential facts. The most active members of Polish society, those most capable of rivaling the pioneering Jewish entrepreneurs, had been killed, imprisoned, and exiled in the wake of the failed insurrections of 1830 and 1863 against Russian rule. (In fact, exiled Poles played a significant role in the early industrialization of parts of Siberia, the New World, etc.) Marcus' quotations of Poles hostile to progress ignore the fact that such attitudes were also common in societies that no one would consider stagnant. For instance, Victorian England, the very leader of the Industrial Revolution, had its own \\"nostalgic medievalism\\" as well as the Luddite and similar movements. The dislike of railroads by Polish farmers paralleled that of cowboys and ranchers in the American West. Marcus states that Polish aristocrats despised economic activity, but often became very successful businessmen after emigration (p. 6). Polish petty traders, \\"disdainful of trade\\", actually increased in numbers in the 1930's at a rate greater than the disappearance of Jewish ones (pp. 62-63). Clearly, the mythical \\"Polish distaste for commerce\\" had largely been a displaced hostility actually directed at the overwhelming preoccupation of Poland's economical niche by Jews.Unlike the US, Poland never claimed to be a pluralistic society, and the needs of the majority took precedence over that of minorities in the event of conflicting interests. Having just recovered their independence after 123 years, the Poles were especially sensitive to such conflicts. The positions of Dmowski and the Endeks, professedly upholding Polish interests rather than resisting minorities' rights per se, must be understood in this light.In the US, affirmative action is framed in terms of the expansion of opportunities for nonwhites rather than racist discrimination against whites. In Poland, affirmative action (using modern parlance) was likewise framed in terms of the expansion of opportunities for Poles in Jewish-dominated institutions rather than anti-Semitic discrimination against Jews. Interestingly, some influential Jews (Grunbaum, Jabotinsky; p. 230) accepted this nuance. Poland's affirmative action took several forms, including taxation, hiring of Polish government workers, and the much-maligned numerus clausus at universities. Significantly, in the 1920's, there were no pogroms (p. 355), and there was no political pressure for Jews to emigrate (p. 391). All this changed in the 1930's, in the wake of the Great Depression. It is patently incorrect to speak of economic growth equalizing opportunities for Poles, as the Jews, owing to their previously acquired advantages, got the lion's share of further economic growth. Furthermore, after the Great Depression, the \\"economic pie\\" actually shrunk, reversing earlier economic growth.Marcus finds fault in both sides: \\"The Poles refused to accept the Jews, but the Jews did not want to be fully accepted (p. 327)\\" He criticizes Jewish leaders for deepening Polish-Jewish conflicts (p. 302), and for not forging a closer relationship with the philosemitic Pilsudski regime (p. 327). He faults American Jews for not even minimally supporting Polish Jews, notably in regards to significant emigration to Palestine. The \\"fantastic\\" Beck-Jabotinsky plan, for this reason, had no change of even a minimal degree if success (pp. 398-401)."},{"Title":"Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland 1919-1939 (New Babylon: Studies in the Social Sciences)","review":"With friends like Jan Peczkis, Marcus doesn't need enemies.It is largely because of people like Peczkis that Marcus's book is undeservedly neglected. Once it became a source of right-wing nationalist propaganda, it was tarred with the brush of \\"Polish apologetics\\" and people lost interest in it. Nevertheless, it is the best book available on the situation of the Jews in interwar Poland. It is not intended as a commentary on the Poles.Peczkis demonstrates his ignorance at the outset by praising \\"overall Polish tolerance in the face of considerable development of Jewish economic life\\". Jewish economic life was the engine of economic development in prewar Poland, bringing growth and prosperity to everyone, but blinkered nationalists could not get past their medieval view of society as a static entity, where a post held by one was necessarily withheld from another.It is no longer the Middle Ages: modern economies are dynamic, and growth for one generates growth for all. This was grasped by Aleksander Swietochowski, one of the \\"Warsaw positivists\\" of the late 19th c., who argued that Jewish investment, productivity and expertise were the key to the modernization of Polish society.An enlightened minority of Poles, fortunately including the dictator Jozef Pilsudski, grasped Swietochowski's point and encouraged Jewish (and German) industry. The right-wing National Party, on the other hand, organized boycotts of Jewish businesses, with the support of the Catholic Church and post-Pilsudki governments: these boycotts were harmful both to the Polish economy and to Poland's image abroad. Marcus points out, however, that most Poles paid little attention to politics and simply bought wherever they could get the best price. They swallowed the ideology of antisemitism, but like most people, were more moved by their own self-interest than by abstract ideas. Until they formed a mob; and then there were pogroms.It was the nationalist intellectuals, particularly students, who avidly promoted antisemitic ideas. Most of the anti-Jewish violence that followed the death of Pilsudski took place at universities, and student gangs roamed the streets beating up Jews and sometimes killing them. They of course were not in the least antisemitic by their own lights: they were simply defending their country against the evil Jews. Modern intellectuals of the same bent indignantly deny that there is any reality to claims of antisemitism in Poland: it is all a plot to defame the good name of Poland, organized by an international conspiracy of the same evil Jews.Freud said that the tragedy of psychosis was that the patient did not know he was sick.Peczkis's remark that the Jews grew \\"actually and perceptively at Polish expense\\" further demonstrates that he is one of those nationalist economic troglodytes. Apparently, he also publishes articles on evolution under a pseudonym so that he can attack them from a creationist perspective under his own name. I don't need to comment further.Peczkis has also similarly embraced my own book, Secret City: I wish he would go bother someone else. My book is also about Jewish experience, and most certainly not a defence of the Poles as the nationalist Polish Right,through selective quotations, makes it out to be. I therefore sympathize with Marcus: we have both been tainted by the kiss of death.In any case, I urge thoughtful people to ignore the babblings of Peczkis and his like and read Marcus's book, which is an honest, scholarly dissection of Jewish life in inter-war Poland. I tried to do the same for the Holocaust, and I have three international prizes to show that perhaps I did a reasonable job. I would share one of them with Marcus if I could."},{"Title":"Kept Women Can't Quit (Donald Lam-Bertha Cool Mystery)","review":"Kept Women Can't Quit, by A A Fair (Erle Stanley Gardner)The 'Foreword' is dedicated to Preston G.

Some passages make for interesting reading but a number of others are quite tedious because of the amount of detail author Erle Stanley Gardner insists on cramming in.Fast paced, interesting in places, but ultimately a rather mediocre read."},{"Title":"Kept Women Can't Quit (Donald Lam-Bertha Cool Mystery)","review":"Sgt.

When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about when I would be able to again. It was so suspensful it had me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.Liam Armstong is the ... hero who will stop at nothing to find his missing daughter. He feels he's all alone in his search until he begins to trust and ultimately love the detective assigned to the case. Together, through their strength and courage they make quite a team and help each other through a very sensative situation.Jenna Mills has done a brillant job of bringing to life the horror of having a child kidnaped while at the same time showing us love, strenth and compassion. It is difficult to combine the two but Jenna Mills has done an outstanding job. She is an author to watch because she is incredibly talented and awe inspiring."},{"Title":"When Night Falls (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"When Night Falls by Jenna MillsSilhouette Intimate Moments # 1170 - August 2002Liam's been under suspicion for murdering his daughter's mother for the past 15 years.

Jessica is the detective assigned to finding the missing teenager, but she's also the daughter of the detective who handled the original investigation of Emily's missing mother. Liam has a hard time trusting Jess but her unfailing loyalty and belief that Liam is innocent wins him over. Slowly Jess erodes the walls that Liam has built around his heart and he finds himself loathing himself for wanting her while his daughter is missing. Jess has issues as well from growing up with an obsessive father, who refused to give up his search for the evidence to put Liam in prison.I liked both of these characters. However, Ms. Mills failed to hold my attention in places and I found myself skimming forward in the story. The wound issues in Liam are played well when first introduced, but sadly are repeated again and again. I would have preferred more of a story of the search for Emily and less of Liam's wounded psyche. This was a very early work for Ms. Mills. I have three later works on my TBR pile; I'm hoping that the rough edges will have been worked out."},{"Title":"When Night Falls (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"When Night Falls is a fast-paced read that delivers top-notch entertainment.

The authors calls Liam Armstrong &quot;granite man.&quot; And he is. Through the ordeal of looking for his daughter, we're given glimpses of the tender father beneath the hard exterior. The author expertly pairs this tortured father, living every parent's worst nightmare, with Jessica Clark, the daughter of Liam's old nemisis. He has no reason to trust her because he is the prime suspect.Despite Liam's reputation, Jessica believes him, and she follows the evidence even though she's thwarted at every turn by her well-meaning fellow police officers who are sure they have their man.The ending has a wonderful twist that is completely unexpected. And, the progression from distrust to trust to love with these two characters pulls at the heart-strings. This is a wonderful romantic suspense where the story would fall apart if any thread were pulled out of the story.I'm looking forward to reading more of this author, and I can't wait to get my hands on her next book."},{"Title":"When Night Falls (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"When his daughter Emily disappears, William Armstrong's past returns with a vengeance. Seventeen years ago his girlfriend disappeared without a trace, leaving a legacy of speculation and rumor. Based on circumstances, speculation, and political alliance, police chief Wallace Clark was determined to prove murder but never successful. Now his daughter investigates the disappearance of Liam's daughter, ever aware of possible connections to the past.Like any good cop, Detective Jessica Clark knows emotional involvement equates with disaster in an investigation. Seventeen years of hearing her father rant about Armstrong made it difficult to separate Liam from his past. Now Jessica suddenly finds herself confronted by another side of the man - the father convinced his daughter has been kidnapped. She also feels an odd kinship for the seventeen-year-old she has never met. Soon she realizes that compassion mixed with attraction can be dangerous with danger lurking ever nearer.Author Jenna Mills pens an outstanding tale of intrigue in love in WHEN NIGHT FALLS. With consummate skill, she weaves a tightly woven plot that will keep readers guessing until the last page. In addition, these vividly created characters come alive. On one hand, Liam lives a life that is driven, isolated, and dangerous, softened only by his love for his daughter. His carefully guarded heart, however, is defenseless against the beauty with a badge. On the other hand, Jessica struggles to reconcile rumors of the past with the father she sees in front of her. Further, Jessica lives her father's shadow until Liam forces her to follow her instinct and her heart. Add this one to your keeper shelf!

But one look at the distraught man's face tells her that he doesn't know what happened to Emily. However, Liam is determined to believe that she won't really help him because she is the daughter of the man who tried so desperately to put him behind bars. When a taunting message about Emily is delivered to Jessica's house rather than Liam's, Jess knows that someone is out to play games with both of them.Liam doesn't want to fall for the detective looking for Emily, but her determination and strength ease the pain in his soul.

And the only person willing and able to help him is Detective Jessica Clarke, the daughter of the man whose mission it was to see him behind bars. Liam is strong, dangerous and very sexy. But Jessica is not someone to give up or back down.

Now I know why Romantic Times gave it 4-1/2 Stars and a Top Pick. The story grabbed me from the moment I started reading and it didn't let go. I'm still thinking about it, long after closing the book. If you like riveting, fast-paced stories with strong, sexy heros and spunky heroines, then you'll love WNF. Liam Armstrong is a man who's been under suspicion for the disappearance of his girlfriend (his daughter's mother) for many years. A successful businessman, he's created an insular life for himself and his teenaged daughter, Emily. But that existence is shattered when Emily disappears without a trace. Detective Jessica Clark is called in on the case, and is forced to work with the same man whom her policeman father investigated for possible murder those years ago. Even though they never found enough evidence against Liam Armstrong, those on the police force have always considered him guilty. Liam is hardened, embittered man, except with his daughter, and Jessica has her work cut out for her. She has to force herself to remain objective, while she battles years of prejudice against Liam Armstrong, as well as her startling attraction to him. Liam must learn to let down the defenses he's built, and to trust again. Jenna Mills does a fantastic job of showing the growing relationship between Liam and Jessica, entwined with wonderful suspense and heartwrenching emotion as they search for Emily.

Unlike most of the bio related books you can read on Lawrence, this one is dedicated to how he waged war (and written by an expert in warfare). Lawrence's methods were so advanced that they resonate to this day. For example, he developed methods of system disruption that incapactitated a \\"modern\\" army and threw an empire into disorder. You can see these methods in play today in modern Iraq. Well worth the time you spend."},{"Title":"Lawrence of Arabia","review":"While not the best biography on the subject (that honor would go to John Mack's A Prince of Our Disorder), this account, while laudatory in the extreme, has the advantage of having been written by someone who actually knew Lawrence, and who had his subject's input. If it sound at times like a Boy's Own Adventure volume, it also has the immediacy which many other accounts lack, and one gets the feeling that Liddell Hart harbored a deep admiration for his subject."},{"Title":"Lawrence of Arabia","review":"Liddell's book is enjoyable and well-written. However, it was written prior before a lot of relavent material on T.E. Lawrence was made public. Mack's biography of Lawrence (PRINCE OF OUR DISORDER) is much more comprehensive. All in all, however, it is a book well-worth reading for anyone interested in tracing the entire evolution of T.E. Lawrence's legend/story."},{"Title":"Lawrence of Arabia","review":"Sir Liddel-Hart knew TE personally and admired him greatly. Liddel-Hart began this work as a general work on the Arab revolt but ended up waxing poetic about his longtime friend and hero. At times it may be a bit too gushing but the fact that TE was an incredible individual is without dispute and Sir Liddel Hart would not be the first to succumb to hero-worship. TE Lawrence's story is one with many lessons about a people who have grown weary with being ignored by the world. TE Lawrence saw himself as a savior of sorts for such peoples in the Arab world. His contributions to irregular warfare are numerous and Sir Liddel Hart is the perfect choice to bring those lessons to us in describing the life of Lawrence. The language is grand and sweeping making it an easy and enjoyable read while telling us much about the life and campaigns of TE Lawrence. A great resource for anyone interested in his life or in his contributions to military history."},{"Title":"Lawrence of Arabia","review":"This is a great analysis of the Lawrence's career in battle. It explains the military significance of Lawrence's actions, places those actions in historical context, and gives the reader a bigger picture of the campaign by detailing the other forces' actions. Of course, Liddell Hart is an excellent writer and the prose is great. Further, Liddell Hart's background as a strategist is very prominent in his analysis of Lawrence. If you are a Liddell Hart fan, you should read (or reread)Strategy: Second Revised Edition (Meridian)- it's very interesting to see how Liddell Hart's views of irregular warfare changed as he had the perspective of time to analyze the effects of Lawrence's actions in the Middle East.With due respect to the other reviewers (and I mean that, since obviously we have some common interests!), I think the comparison toA Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T. E. Lawrenceis misplaced. Prince is, at it's heart, a psychological analysis of Lawrence, which Arabia does not try to be or claim to be. True, there are 50 pages in the beginning giving the reader background on Lawrence, but when this was written there wasn't a great biography. And, while there are 50-60 pages at the end on Liddell Hart's personal interactions with Lawrence, I viewed this more as a great first hand account of what it was like to know him, rather than an attempt at a comprehensive biography.If you've readSeven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph: The Complete 1922 Textand thought, \\"Lawrence is an interesting fellow and I'd like to know more about the man\\" then I suggest you read Prince first, then this book. If, on the other hand, you were more interested in the military action, I'd read this and then Prince. Either way, however, no study of Lawrence would be complete without this book for his military career and Prince for his personal life.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in military matters or T.E. Lawrence."},{"Title":"Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People","review":"Despite the fact that I have lived in Japan for more than fifteen years, my visit to the Smithsonian's fabulous &quot;Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People&quot; exhibit last year provided my first meaningful look at this long overlooked or misunderstood part of East Asian cultural heritage. I ordered a softcover copy of the (at the time yet to be released) book right away and have since poured through it time and again. Written largely by anthropologists, as a layman I feared that it might well be too scientific to appreciate; happily such is not the case. The book is beautifully written, edited, and illustrated. Anyone with an interest in Japan's northern culture and/or the animist nature of the nation as a whole will find this book profoundly enlightening. I regret that a hardcover edition was not available sooner."},{"Title":"Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People","review":"Often scholarly volumes have excellent content but are poorly produced and edited while musem volumes are often well produced and edited but lack serious and contemporary scholarly material--they become catalogues of artifacts without real contextualizing material.Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People manages to overcome both of these problems. As a scholarly volume it has excellent content (much of which has not been previously available to non-Japanese speakers) and is well-produced and beautifully laid out.Aside from some small quibbles I have with some other articles seeming truncated for space concerns and others for not presenting enough information (notably the articles dealing with Ainu language/linguistics), I find little to find fault with. Even my concerns about some aspects of the volume are only a request for more, not a complaint with what is in the volume.Overall this volume does a wonderful job of making contemporary Ainu research accessible to the lay reader while also presenting enough scholarly material to make it worth-while reading for those with a deeper interest in the Ainu. Even though the volume does not deal directly with the area of my research, the amount of knowledge it conveys has foced me to rethink aspects of my own work."},{"Title":"Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People","review":"In addition to what the other readers have written I would also add that this book is truly a \\"must-have\\" for anyone having an interest either in the Ainu specifically, or native peoples such as the Aleuts, the Inuits, the Polynesians, the Moari, etc. This, in part, because anyone interested in the Ainu will be hard-pressed to find a great deal of books in print regarding this topic, in any case in English. Photographs or Ainu artifacts are perfect and highly details, and there are a great deal of reproductions of \\"Ainu-e\\", or paintings done by the Japanese when they were slowly but surely in the process of taking over what is today Hokkaido. These are invaluable because they are rich in detail and depict a way of life that no longer exists, much in the same way that Edward Curtis' photographs of the Native Indians in the US are. I would personally recommend the hard-cover version though more pricy is a much better book to own in one's collection."},{"Title":"Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People","review":"Excellent collection of essays- some repetitive, all comprehensive, accompanied by extremely good illustrations and photographs."},{"Title":"Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People","review":"The title of my review is 'a fundamentally dishonest book'...and it is.This book is a collection of articles by various authors on the subject of the Ainu people.There is a political orientation to this book.The editors,and many of the authors,make much effort to debunk 'the Caucasoid theory'.While there are a great many photographs of Caucasian looking Ainu people in existence from a century ago,there are very few such photos in this book,and I believe that is a very deliberate choice by the editors.Many of the authors make reference to the Ainu as having Caucasian appearance and yet the reader is left wondering what they are referring to when in the book nearly all of the pictures of Ainu are of Mongoloid appearance (these Ainu are obviously mixed with Japanese)."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"One thing I have definitely learned from reading The Other Boleyn Girl is that there is no difference between love and death while trying to satisfy a king of his needs. The main character is Mary Boleyn and during the book, she searches for true love but also to escape the royal court and live a simpler life. The way Philippa Gregory created her characters makes it to where they have such depth it is impossible to describe. Mary's feelings are the highlight of her character: betrayed by Anne, her ruthless sister, betraying others, anger, and love. Some other characters are Anne Boleyn, Mary's evil sister willing to sacrifice anything to receive what she wants; George Boleyn, Mary's close brother and a good servant to the king; and King Henry VIII, a king who courts both Boleyn girls but does not care about the fate of his own country as long as he can get his hands on one other whores. The Other Boleyn Girl is also the prequel to The Queen's Fool.A basic outline of the plot: the country of England is in trouble when King Henry VIII cannot stick with one woman after discovering how much power he truly holds. This historical fiction's theme is to serve your royalty (king and queen) is betrayal towards yourself while doing what is right is treason to the king (while in a dictatorship). Philippa Gregory's writing style is similar to J.K. Rowling's due to the fact they have both written stories that take place in England.I loved the book because there was always something disturbing or hysterical, and once I started furthering my position in the book, I could not put it down. I felt happy, sad, revengeful, and satisfied during The Other Boleyn Girl. A recommendation for other readers interested: make sure a mature reader comes to understand the book and ignore the disturbing parts. Philippa Gregory wrote such a great story that I often had to stop reading because I actually felt and thought I was right there as Mary, also the narrator of the tale. Gregory has written other great novels such as the Wideacre trilogy: Wideacre, The Favored Child, and Meridon. Something to remember from The Other Boleyn Girl- rebels are not always as bad as they seem and once in awhile, try taking it from their view of the story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Absolutely inspiring! Greggory's brilliant novel captures the imagination and sets in alight, she carries you on a fantstic jorney with the Boleyn girls and never lets your exitement waver.This wonderful novel has inspired me (a 23 yr old Drama student) to conduct a lot of research in to Henry VIII and his wives. If you liked 'The Other Boleyn Girl' try Gregory's other novels of the period, 'The Queens Fool' and 'The Constant Princess' both very good, perhaps a little lacking in pace at times, but most certainly worth enjoying."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is an absolutely brilliant read. What a page turner, I could not put this book down till it was finished and even then I drove everyone I spoke to crazy because all I did was talk about it. Philippa Gregory did such a wonderful job of telling this story from a non-conventional point of view so that it appeals to both fictional and non-fictional readers. I totally recommend it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Greggory is an extremely talented writer. This book is amazing how it portrays life in Tudor England from a less known woman, the infamous Anne Boleyn's sister Mary Boleyn. The fact that it is written from her sister's point of view is hat makes this book even more special. I think she described Anne better then if Anne had narrated the book. I literally could not put this book down! It was too good. She made an extremely creative and wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had great expectations while opening this book and I was not disappointed. I have often wondered what Mary Boleyn thought during her sister, Anne's, rise and downfall. This book provided Philippa Gregory's account of what she may have thought and done.It was interesting to find a novel about Henry VIII or Anne Boleyn told by another character. And I have to say it was great to get a not so sympathetic account of Anne Boleyn. She comes across as scheming and manipulative and not very nice. So it's probably not a good book for die-hard Anne Boleyn fans. By telling the story from the point of view of Mary, we can see this different (perhaps more realistic) view of Anne.I was disappointed, however, that the ending did not include more details on how she felt about Anne's death (and that of her brother, George). I would have like to see more introspection from Mary and thoughts about whether she could have ended the same way.The book was very well researched and it also gives some rare glimpses into the court of Henry VIII.A wonderful book that kept me reading all day. I was sad to reach the end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Historical fiction is an art. To write a great piece, you must have not only engaging characters, but a vivid painting of the times, and a focus on the events of the time instead of just the characters itself.The Other Boleyn Girl is just this. I have always been fascinated with Tudor England, and am always looking for new books to read. I have read good and bad, but this is truly one of the best.One of the most unique things is that the perspective is not told from Anne, but her sister Mary. In all of the other books, Mary is just a characature with no real place in the story. In this, she is placed front and center as she tells of her reign as King Henry VIII mistress, her fierce rivalry between her sister, and the illusion of the court, where everything looks perfect, but scandal and backstabbing reign. As a result of this, a compelling and very likable character is created.The writing is so vivid in this work, that you can see the court in your mind. You can picture the palaces, the intricate dresses, and the chess game that the Tudor court always was.I love how the court was portrayed as an illusion in this work, and how it was indeed a chess game, where you could be the queen one day, and not even a pawn the next, depending on how you played your move. Also greatly addressed are the difficulties of being a woman in the times, and how they were simply pawns in a man's kingdom.Above all though, I greatly enjoyed how the the whole Boleyn family was given life. I won't give it all away here, but you are given such a different perspective and a longing to know more.While this seems like a long book at six hundred plus pages, it is also a fast read that is very entertaining to pass the time with, while learning even more about Tudor England. Phillipa Gregory is a fantastic story teller, where the words come to life, and you are transported to an entirely different world. Now that, is historical fiction!Also a great book for reading groups, and anyone who is interested in, or wants to know more about this compelling and fragile time in history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was the book that turned me on to Philippa Gregory, and I have since followed all of the books in this series. I immediatly made all of my friends read it, all of whom also became hooked. This book painted a picture of the Royal Court that I had never imagined in my wildest dreams. At the time, the birth of a girl was a dissapointment. Ironically for these families however, its the girls who are used as pawns in the royal game to advance their families and make them rich. This book brings all of this to life as well as tells the story of the little-known Mary Boleyn, sister to the infamous Anne. Mary accepted her role as a pawn reluctantly, and only to obey her father and uncle. Anne embraced this role with open arms and exceeded her families expectations, as she tirelessly schemed for her place on the throne and in history. This is a wonderful twist on what you thought you knew about the tudor court and will undoubtedly make you want more. This book will be fascinating to anyone with an interest in Women's studies, The Tudors, and british history. Although some liberties are taken, just roll with them and take this as a peice of entertainment -- you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm always interested in the daily life of the medieval era, but it's so hard to find. This book has a colorful plot - some historical, some obviously not - and amazing imagery of the daily life of the royal court. Reality, power, boredom, ecstasy, all in a day. You're in charge or you're a pawn, sometimes both. Long read, but well worth it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really liked this book. I thought it was intriguing, fastpaced, and it really pulls you in right from the very beginning. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was just because there was some sexual stuff in there I thought Gregory could have left out; although sex and bearing children is one of the major themes in this book, some of the content was unnecessary. Apart from the unnecessary sex content, the story was great and gave an exciting glimpse into the Tudor world."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book takes you back in time, and I love that. I love Historical Fiction! It's fun and you can just escape into their world thanks to Miss Gregory. The second half of the book was better than the first, so hang in there! It's worth it. Yes, facts are very intertwined with fiction, but that's what makes it so fun. If I wanted nothing but the facts, I would get a biography. So, enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I would not recommend Phillipa Gregory's much-hyped The Other Boleyn Girl. I'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that doesn't make a good first impression, hoping it'll improve. Some six-hundred pages later, I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good. Please don't waste your time!Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as \\"He was executed the next day.\\" Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader! It's extraordinary. It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course, it's a matter of opinion. I simply found it to be void of anything of substance. I wasn't made to care about the characters or how the events played out. And only sex carried the plot along!Also, I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory's imagination, not historical facts. I'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she didn't have a sister or anything of the sort. And I know in this genre much is left to the author's imagination and interpretation; it has to be. It's not as though there's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history. But Gregory herself, when asked how she researches for her books, said she first goes to secondary sources. She never mentioned using primary sources. Yes, they can be biased (if they're from someone's perspective they're going to be), but they're first-hand accounts. Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it, witnessing it?In addition, her dialogue is inconsistent. It's ridiculously modern at some points, then flowery at others. I know it can't be written Shakespeare-style; it has to be readable and understandable. But I think we could be a little more sophisticated! No one said \\"stuff\\" back then, for example, as in, \\"All this stuff is making me mad.\\" She couldn't work a little harder than that??If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses, sex, and scandal, this soap-opera mimic is perfect. If you're like me and want to learn something in the process, however...As I've made obvious, I was sorely disappointed. Just thought I'd pass my warning along. I don't want anyone else wasting his time!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's \\"Cry To Heaven.\\" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" falls miles short."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As an enthusiast of this period in English history and of Henry VIII, I found this book thoroughly enjoyable. It's very readable, accessible style allows the reader to easily dive into early 16th century England. But, what is truly special about this book which is obviously fiction, is that it encompasses a great amount of accurate historical fact, and that it offers a rare glimpse of what it was probably like for the Boleyn women in Kings Henry's life. It's rich in luscious detail that evokes the spirit, controversiality and excesses of life in the Court of Henry VIII. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone who loves historical fiction and is fascinated with Henry and his reign."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was the biggest crock of terrible historical fiction I've even had the misfortune to read. A friend lent it to me, knowing of my love for all things Tudor. A waste of paper and time--with each terrible page my blood pressure increased notch by notch. It wasn't even well written! By weaving her mis-information into this story, Ms. Gregory will only keep people whom are unfamiliar with Anne Boleyn's life even more ignorant of the facts. Historical fiction doesn't mean \\"change the story around to whatever you want.\\" I've read some really great historical fiction where the author RESEARCHES the FACTS to try and tell a possible version of the truth. Not so here. So don't waste your money. Why do authors find it necessary to write for the lowest common denominator? It should have no stars."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I did not begin reading this novel expecting anything other than an easy weekend read, but was more disappointed than I could have imagined. An educated reader knows that in historical fiction, real characters are blended with fictional ones, and events are created or recreated to advance the plot. If the plot and writing are good, then the reader may suspend the facts momentarily for the sake of the work. In this novel, however, the historical inaccuracy and writing are so far-fetched as to cause the reader to pause frequently, thus interrupting the flow of the story.If the book is about Mary (older sister, younger sister - historians in dispute), we are not given a very accurate picture of her true nature. There are established facts about Mary, such as that she was considered loose and had affairs with several men (including King Francis I of France, who called her \\"a great whore, the most infamous of all\\") which led to her dismissal from the French court. She was not the simpering dolt portrayed in the book.The other interuption for me was the language. In places the dialogue represented the crisp, well-versed language one would expect of courtiers, while in others I felt like I was overhearing 21st century teenagers at the mall. One pet peeve of mine is the overuse of a word or phrase throughout a work. I feel that the writer simply could not bother to think of other descriptors or was unable to. For example, Gregory uses the word 'sulk' (not a bad word if used a time or two) and every other variant of the verb...'sulky' (adj - not very good word choice), and the worst...'sulkily' (adv. - I wasn't even sure these last two were real words - they are- but she uses this adverb form over and over. I actually wanted to go back and count how many times she used it.) Another instance of questionable usage was \\"D'you?\\" This was always used in dialogue, and I don't know if it was intended to be the recreation of a commonly used diction of the time. If it is not, it doesn't seem to fit in with the otherwise learned, courtly, formal speech used in every other case. In actual speech the pronunciation of \\"D'you\\" is probably much the same as \\"Do you.\\" No where else is diction implied, so this contraction seems unnecessary and anachronistic.At best the reading of this novel may inspire readers to become more informed about the Tudor period and the actual historical effects of the events in the book, which reduces the history to a mere backdrop for the unseemly behavior of a greedy and two-dimensional family. There are some excellent websites devoted to this period. You may find the portraits of the actual participants quite interesting as well.Worse books have, of course, been written. For that reason only, perhaps this one deserves two stars - one and a half. Judging by sales, many people like Harlequin Romances. This book is probably a fair success on that level.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this book as anything other than a Harlequin Romance, complete with heaving bosoms, soap-opera dialogue, and predictable, static characters."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love books! I buy them, I read them, I have difficulty loaning them out let alone giving them away. This book I will burn, if for no other reason than to spare another who might be tempted by the title (as I was) to expect a readable, historical, novel. I could forgive the historical inaccuracies if Ms Gregory had given some thought as to how they could propel the story, or if the characters were more than cardboard.Too bad there is not a rating below one star."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am astonished that this was published...it's truly awful, historically inaccurate. It reads like the author read a couple of books about the period, took notes and then forgot all the facts on record. Anne was the younger sister, for example. There is no record that she ever committed incest with her brother George. The early years at the French court are omitted, which provide an insite as to why the Boleyns began their rise to power."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you approach this book as being almost purely fiction, you'll be fine - because that's what it is. Phillipa Gregory has taken enormous liberties with what few facts there are about Mary Boleyn, including her place in the birth order of the Boleyn family and her age when she returned to the Tudor court after being raised in the French court. Most likely Mary Boleyn was not married at thirteen and did not become Henry's mistress at fourteen, and her reputation as a woman of loose morals while she lived at the French court is well documented. It is possible that her first child was Henry's (though there is considerable doubt about this), but her second child most probably was not. Her second marriage, traditionally thought to be for love alone, might also have been a shrewd attempt on Mary's (and possibly her family's) part to get her out of the picture at the time when Anne Boleyn had obviously begun to fall from grace and was likely to take members of her wildly ambitious family with her.One frustrating aspect of all historical fiction is the application of modern thought and modern philosophy to the characters of people who lived at other times in history. Mary's frequent feminist musings about the \\"plight\\" of women in the Tudor era is probably entirely Gregory's imagination. Such thoughts and ideas simply did not exist in Tudor times. Girls in Mary Boleyn's position were raised from the cradle with not so much as a notion that there was any life possible for them other than arranged marriage, and their sole purpose in that marriage was to produce children, preferably male, and to advance their families in any way that they could. There was no remote possibility of self-determination - they were strictly the instruments of their fathers before marriage and their husbands after marriage. When authors attribute modern feministic thought to Anne and Mary Boleyn (Gregory is not the only author to have done this by a long shot), they are taking the wildest liberty of all with history and the social mores and practices of the time.Most historical fiction tends to lose me when modern words, like \\"sexy\\" are added into the thought processes or speech of characters living in times like the Tudor era. This is simply sloppy writing and thinking on the part of the author - a blatant attempt to \\"update\\" things for the modern reader. The word didn't exist then. Sure, there were probably words that meant the same thing during the 1500's, but \\"sexy\\" is a modern invention. It sets the teeth on edge if the reader has much knowledge of the era the book is purportedly set in.If you approach this as strictly fiction, based loosely on rather spurious historical fact (almost nothing is really known of Mary Boleyn, and since Henry had most images and belongings of Anne Boleyn destroyed after her execution, information about Anne, including her real birthdate and her actual appearance, is vague as well), it's an interesting read. Just don't think it's any kind of accurate portrayal of Tudor women or life in Tudor times - or even of the historical records that do exist. Much manipulation has been applied to the facts to make Mary younger than she probably was at the time, and to \\"justify\\" her actions (her supposed devotion to Katherine of Aragon in the book is a case in point). Mary Boleyn would have had no will of her own - if her father had directed her to attract the attention of Henry VIII (and there is no proof that this was the case) or if the King had decided that she would be his mistress, that was what would happen - period. She would have had absolutely no say in the matter, and likely would not have even considered her position as royal mistress in any way wrong or harmful to Katherine of Aragon.Take the book with a grain of salt, and enjoy it as fiction. Perhaps it will make you curious and ready to read more about the real lives and times of the people involved."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I would like to join other readers who have identified this novel for what it is: tawdry, sensationalistic, and grossly inaccurate.First, I should say that as a college literature professor I appreciate the challenges of rendering history as fiction. The historical novelist has to use her or his imagination to convey the inner life of historical characters, not to mention inventing some purely fictional ones. Also, streamlining and changes in the historical record are inevitable when forcing actual events into the tight structure of fiction.Still, how would one feel if one read a historical novel about Anne Frank that represented her as surviving into old age? Wouldn't that be a gross distortion of the historical record? A historical novelist has responsibilities as well as rights.Other irate reviewers of The Other Boleyn Girl have pointed out the novel's egregious inaccuracies and distortions. Just a note on this subject before moving on: I knew we were in trouble from the first scene, which shows us an execution on Tower Green (and later in the novel the men accused of adultery with Anne are executed there too). Almost all executions of the period took place on Tower Hill, not Tower Green. Tower Green was reserved for a handful of executions, mostly of victims with links to the royal family (Anne herself, Katherine Howard, Lady Jane Grey). OK, it's a small thing, compared to the more horrific errors Gregory makes, but it says something that she couldn't even be bothered to research a fairly basic and well-known fact. Not a good sign.(By the way, I will not address the even more ghastly historical distortions of the movie, except to say that the film makes Gregory's story even more cartoonish.)Actually, what I'd like to focus on here is the novel's disturbing misogyny. It's bad enough to reduce such a significant moment in English history to a catfight. Even worse, though, are the sexist stereotypes that structure the narrative. There's the sweet young thing whose sole desire is true love; then there's the rapacious shrew with political ambition. Guess who we're supposed to prefer? This novel's about as subtle in its ideological bias as the movie Fatal Attraction. Needless to say, the Bad Powerful Woman gets her comeuppance while the Good Unambitious Girl is rewarded with romantic love. Is anyone gagging as violently as I am?And, yes, how offensive to show Anne actually committing incest. As my husband pointed out, this is like portraying the victims of Stalin's show trials as really guilty. No self-respecting historian believes any of the dirt thrown at Anne; as the Lord Mayor of London remarked after her trial, he could see nothing in any of it but that they were out to get rid of her. Anne was accused of having sex with men who weren't actually anywhere in the palaces she was staying; she was accused of having sex right after Elizabeth's birth, when that wouldn't have been physically possible, etc. The incest and witchcraft accusations were cooked up to vilify her so completely that people wouldn't protest the shabby way in which a crowned Queen of England was murdered so that her husband could marry another woman already waiting in the wings.Anne was no saint, but she doesn't deserve this gratuitous vilification. But Gregory wanted to throw in lots of kinky sex and shock value that would sell, hence the peculiar sensation of wading through sewage one gets when reading this novel .Again, though, the sleaze is inextricably linked to the misogyny. As a feminist scholar I was particularly revolted at the hypocrisy of Gregory's claim that she was inspired by Retha Warnicke's The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn. Warnicke--a feminist Renaissance historian--argues that Anne's death must have been linked to rumors stemming from her miscarriage in early 1536; Warnicke thinks Anne's fetus must have appeared deformed to spawn the witchcraft accusations. Now Warnicke is a very fine scholar in a lot of ways, but this theory unfortunately has no evidence to support it. For instance, the one actual reference to the miscarried fetus describes it as having the appearance of a male; if it were deformed, wouldn't that have been noted? Still, Warnicke came up with her theory, unsubstantiated as it was, because she thought it reflected the kind of misogyny that, in that era, would define a powerful woman as a witch. What outrages me about Gregory's manipulation of Warnicke's theory is that she uses it in order to propagate the kind of misogyny Warnicke is criticizing. In the novel, Anne is a monster and of course (especially after incest with her brother) she spawns monster babies.Honestly, I wish this site had a no-star rating available; one star for this novel seems overly generous."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am surprised at so many positive reviews. The prose in this book is very poor quality, it's simplistic, repeptitive and many times plain silly. It reads like a quick amateur effort.

Well, it was a rather long book for me to get through, only because my reading time is limited; still though, the story became very interesting soon after I started; i confess I was not able to finish the book in time for the book club review, (which I did miss) but soon after I made sure to take the book with me on a week vacation, if only to see how the story unfolded. i have got to say that once I was able to read without interuption I could not put it down........not at all like I had first imagined. This story had me hooked with the different characters of the two sisters and the writing was supurb. You could just imagine the difference in personalities between the two women, and how Mary cared deeply for her sister even though Anne totally used and took advantage of her loyality. I really loved it, but it is long, and at times I did wonder how many more scenes were needed to wrap things up. Still a great beach read, and i am anxious to watch the movie (although i hear it is different........why??). I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a good adventourous-romance type story that you can really get into and look forward to every page!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I've read quite a few books that I've really enjoyed recently, but this was one of my favorites! I don't have any issue separating and appreciating the difference between the real story (like the wonderful, \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" by Alison Weir) and the fictional adaptations like this and the movie (which are very different stories). I think it's really great when you're fascinated with an era to take on a real event that happened and try to discover what might have happened if the characters were a little different than they really were. 'What if we made it seem more possible that this happened (even if it didn't really)?' 'How would the characters react if we threw this into the mix?' 'How about if we exaggerate this character or make them more like this, just to serve this fictional story a little better?' I thought it was a great read! I particularly liked this version of Mary and her interactions with the other characters. It was terrific!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I did not want to put this book down. It is not a real page turner because you want to find out what happens in the story (the story of Henry VIII is well known), but you immediately empathize with Mary Boleyn and want her to find her own way in a world where women are not valued except for their ability to further the family's ambitions for wealth and power or create a son for Henry VIII.The Other Boleyn Girl is narrated first person by Mary Boleyn. The characters are well developed for the three Bolyen siblings - Mary, Ann and George. Although all three of them are thrust into the crazy inner workings of the court of Henry VIII, they all have different challenges and reactions to their own family's ambitions as well as the greed, corruption, immorality and narcissism of the court of Henry VIII.It's interesting to see the story of Anne Boleyn from a different perspective and the author does a great job of telling the story through the eyes of the less infamous sister. This book is of course fiction, but it brings this time in history to life in a very entertaining way.This is the first book I have ready by Philippa Gregory, but I am now a fan. I am looking forward to reading other books written by her."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Who doesn't love a good drama? I mean really?

Thats what this book is like, without the \\"this is stupid why am I reading this?\\" part. Fans of the movie (which sucked by the way) beware the book is about Mary, not the \\"other\\" in the title. I am a giant fan of that time period anyway-history geek- but the book will appeal to none history geeks. The book is Anne Boleyn's story told through Mary-who was the much smarter sister- Anne's best friend and rival. King Henry VIII is married to Katherine a princess of Spain, but he wants the Boleyns.

However, I was pleasantly surprised. I wish that more professors in college would have required us to read books like this for our history classes...it would have made class so much more exciting.The Other Boleyn Girl tells the story of Mary Boleyn, the often forgotten sister of the much talked about Queen Anne Boleyn, Henry the VIII's second wife (just one of six!!). The story begins with Mary's family pushing her into the King's bed, even though she is a married woman. While many so that Mary was a whore and she gladly went after the King, Gregory instead portrays a woman dealing with a constant inner struggle between what she feels for her husband and for herself and what she feels for the King. In the end, family pressures get the best of her and she finds herself in an intense and oddly satisfying affair with the King.However, soon Mary's sister, Anne returns to the court and catches the eye of the King. The second half of the book centers around Anne's relationship with the King and with Mary. Mary is suddenly pushed aside as her sister quickly climbs the social Tudor ladder faster and faster eventually being crowned Queen.Upon finishing this novel, I immediately started investigating King Henry and Anne Boleyn myself. This piece of literature made a time period that I had often thought to be dull and boring, exciting and interesting to me. I recommend that anyone interested in history pick up this book and give it a try. I promise you won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am appalled by how many people thought this was a good book. If you are looking for fiction, fine, but this book should not be called historical if it is referring to Anne Boleyn. As I read the reviewers who rated this book four or five stars I realized that few of them knew anything at all about Anne Boleyn, Henry the VIII, the Tudor era, or even how to write a decent novel. Many other reviewers have delineated this book's shortcomings (look for Carol's review from August 2004) so I won't go into it all, but there is one thing I do want to say. If you are a person who has read a book called historical fiction, I would caution you against reviewing that book unless you actually know something about the subject. It makes you - especially the reviewer who said she was a teacher! - look like an idiot.There is nothing historical about this story except in a very broad way. If you want to know the true story and don't want to read real history, then check out the BBC miniseries - \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" or the Richard Burton movie - \\"Anne of a Thousand Days\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Today there are still jokes about how Anne Boleyn lost her head, but life as a wife of Henry VIII was no laughing matter. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Philippa Gregory gives a fictional account of Henry's most famous queen from the perspective of her sister, Mary. Gregory tries to capture a sisterly dynamic understandable to contemporary readers. Anne and Mary are opposites in appearance and temperament; loyal to one another out of obligation, not love; and, we are told, lifelong rivals. Oddly, that rivalry never quite materializes here other than in spiteful and venomous words and feelings. While Anne seethes with ambition and resentment, Mary is too passive a personality to be a match for Anne, nor does she try to be. As portrayed, the conflict between the sisters is more petty than powerful.Gregory's choice for Mary to serve as narrator, as though it were her memoir, detracts from the sense of history. A Tudor-era aristocrat like Mary does not seem likely to set her story down in such detail after the events have passed. It might have been more effective to frame the story as a researcher's discovery of Mary's journals and letters. When handled adroitly, this type of framing device can make the characters and story more immediate and less obviously fictional. Another alternative would have been the omniscient third person, which might have been more convincing. As it is, I could not suspend my disbelief in Mary's voice, with its anachronistic nuances and sensibilities. She sounds more like a modern author than a 16th-century woman remembering the recent and difficult past.Therein lies another problem--Mary never explains why she wrote all of this down, why she delves into such detail, or who she expects the reader to be. It might have made more sense if she had said she wanted her legacy to be the true story of her and her family's role in Anne's rise and fall, that she wanted her own name to be remembered, or that she was writing for her children and Anne's daughter, the Princess Elizabeth. We never know her purpose, which is strange because we learn from her that the Boleyn family does nothing without a reason. Given how poorly Mary's memories reflect on all the Boleyns and Howards, including herself, it become even more of a mystery why Gregory chose this format.The Other Boleyn Girl draws readers in the same way that 1980s night-time dramas drew in viewers. Never particular about morals and influenced by time and events, Anne becomes as ruthless and desperate for power as any soap villainess, with her family's encouragement and support. Mary, once favored by king and family, is tossed aside when she proves to lack the will and desire to usurp the queen's place. She chooses her own path, never losing sight of her rivalry with Anne and never envious of Anne's sacrifices and sufferings.Historical inaccuracies aside, including details about Mary and her children, Gregory fails to capture the larger world in which the Boleyn drama was enacted. She refers to France and Spain and their rulers, and the pope, but the complexity of the world outside Henry VIII's court and its politics is relegated to the background, brought forward in snippets only as needed. Henry himself is portrayed as hunting, gaming, and dancing from morning until night, with only an occasional concern for the kingdom's business or for the intrigues of his enemies and allies. The world here seems narrow and confined because it is only the world Mary sees--Mary, the other Boleyn girl who pretends to remain naive and who tries to focus on her own life, only to be drawn again and again into Anne's drama.Gregory tries to use the story of the Boleyn girls to illustrate women's issues during the 16th century. As Mary notes, women are only pawns in the marriage game, played to achieve position, power, and wealth. It's clear, however, that men who lack power are pawns as well; George Boleyn and Henry Percy are forced into miserable marriages. The lesson here is less about the vulnerability of women to the whims of men than about how people of both gender were played for power.Despite Gregory's comments about the charges against the Boleyns, found in the book's end matter, Mary witnesses (and, significantly, remembers in detail) enough clues to know whether Anne and George were guilty of the crimes for which they were beheaded. This is disappointing, because Gregory's hints, if not her stance of ambiguity, ignore the logic and the politics behind the charges.Even at the end, Gregory misses an opportunity. Mary does not hear Anne's last words and does not include them in her work. This makes no sense, as they were recorded and can be read today. Gregory fails to weave in the available documented details that would have added real-life drama and interest to the story. Why would Mary not reflect on the final message of \\"the other Boleyn girl,\\" given her inside knowledge of Anne and her willingness to write about her and the other Boleyns?With its compelling historical setting, The Other Boleyn Girl had the potential to be an engaging if inadequate and flawed historical fiction. Don't rely on it, as I have heard some do, for your knowledge and understanding of Henry VIII, his court, or the Boleyns."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I picked this book up thinking I would want to put it down in disgust, but I ended up reading it cover-to-cover. Sure, at times Gregory slips a little in her rendering of Henry VIII's court, but her details create an entire and believable world of histoical fiction. Told from the point of view of Mary Boleyn, Henry VIII's mistress before he took up with Anne Boleyn, the book chronicles her rise and fall as royal favorite. Her fall, however, is neither disastrous nor over-dramatized, and her fate is kinder than that of her sister. I was most impressed with the dialogue, which was NOT littered with useless \\"Thee\\"s and \\"Thou\\"s, but which carried the illusion of Renaissance speech while being, in actuality, quite modern. O.K., this isn't great literature, and it isn't great history, but it IS a great read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Wow! What a stunning book! Phillippa Gregory has managed to pull off a nearly impossible feat - weaving a tapestry of Tudor England, the struggles of Henry the VIII to sire an heir with the tempestuous Anne Boleyn, and the long-ignored sister of history, Mary Boleyn - in a way that is fresh, immediate, fascinating, and amazingly contemporary. Gregory gives us an utterly real cast of characters, with foibles and failings aplenty, but for all their flaws, we still feel, care and love them as we would difficult siblings. The machinations of the Tudor court and Henry's obsession with fathering a son (no matter the cost) combined with the ruthless ambition of the Howard/Boleyn clan makes for a riveting, bawdy ride through some lesser known rooms of Tudor history. Gregory is equally effective at painting (with a gossamer touch) the lot of highborn ladies at that time; often no better than cattle to the market of Royal ambition, we feel deeply for their lot, and cheer when Mary Boleyn - obedient daughter sent to bed the king - ultimately rejects everything for love. It is greatly to Gregory's credit that I quickly forgot I was reading about historical figures, they seemed so real and utterly human that even as I was hating some of them, I worried for their (foregone) fate. This is a splendid read, lucid, passionate, and deeply moving. Brava, Phillippa Gregory!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While indisposed for a few days, I have never considered myself luckier than to come upon a book so engrossing, intellectual and enjoyable. This book is an incredible telling of the rivalry (and often hatred) between the two Boleyn girls, Anne and Mary. This book contained such vivid detail and fabulous imagery I couldn't put it down! It is a fairy tale in setting and a horrorific battle, involving one of the most powerful families in Tudor England. The character profiles were flawless: I was entirely able to imagine Mary, Henry, William and Anne sitting by my side. As an avid fan of Elizabethan, Tudor and other English historical fiction, Philippa Gregory enchanted my mind. I continue to turn to the book and re-read passages. The wonderful literary style that Gregory drew into this book is unmatched and unequaled. Very few books I have read can rival this wonderful account of love, passion, anger, betrayl and feeling. Kudos to Gregory!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I enjoy reading historical fiction and the Tudor/Stuart period of English history is one of my favorite settings. It was for that reason that I purchased this book without really knowing anything about the author.Soon after ordering the book, I looked at some of Philippa Gregory's other works and I became concerned that I might have bought a Harlequin romance. I was somewhat pleasantly surprised therefore when the book turned out to be a very pleasant and entertaining read.Despite the fact that it exceeded my lowered expectations, however, I can safely say that I've read better treatments of the subject matter, most notably by Margaret George. And for those that rave that this is the best historical fiction they've ever read, I can only say two things: 1) There is no accounting for personal taste, and 2) broaden your horizons and take on such authors as Michener, Clavell, McCollough and even the aforementioned Margaret George.That having been said, I did learn a little about this brief phase of Tudor history, told through the eyes and ears of the older sister of Anne Boleyn. I was not familiar with Mary Boleyn or their brother George and the suspicions regarding his homosexuality and incestuous relationship with the Queen. I suspect that the author took great liberties with the facts in this regard. Again, a pleasant but somewhat average read overall."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought this book in an airport Powell's Books, so I was in a bit of a hurry. I was intrigued by the theme and the book had good shelftop reviews. I guess I need to be more aware of the line between historical fiction and popular history, since I prefer the latter muchly. Being a student of language and language use, I was especially disappointed by the dialog and even the internal thoughts of the characters in this book. I still read it rapidly for the narrative line, but I kept feeling I was getting the Disney version of the story. As a student of literature (albeit 18th century) I would have thought Philippa Gregory would be more attentive to style than she was. Some people will love this book, but if you require at least a semblance of authenticity, it isn't for you."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Many other reviewers have mentioned the historical innacuracies found in _The Other Boleyn Girl_. I noticed them as well. The changes in the Boleyn girls' birth order did not trouble me as much as the disputed parentage of Mary Boleyn's children (why would Henry, whose first illegitimate son he made a Duke, ignore his son by Mary Boleyn?) I also found it odd that the author seemed to give creedence not only to the charges of witchcraft against Ann Boleyn, but to the charge of incest between Ann and her brother George. These charges, which were ostensibly the reasons why Ann was beheaded, have been generally dismissed by every historian since they occurred.So why, then, did Phillipa Gregory treat them as, if not fact, then at least possibilities?This would not have bothered me at all had she included an author's note that explained her reasoning. I understand that the hints of Dark Doings and intrasibling sex make for a much more intriguing read, and if that was Ms. Gregory's intention, good for her.But why, then, would you not include something to tell your readers what liberties you've taken with the facts, and why?The fact that she did not do so is why I gave this book such a low rating.As a story, it's pretty good. A bit heavy on the purple prose, but that didn't bother me too much. The detail about life at Henry's court was quite good and the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon and Mary's guilty affection for her was touching.Is the book a tad too long? I think so. I didn't need page after page to remind me that Mary Boleyn loved farming and her children very, very much. Got it the first time. But it was an enjoyable story, and the characters were well-crafted and for the most part believable (though they veered towards charicature near the end).All in all, it wasn't bad, and I would read another book by this author. I'm merely disappointed that she took such liberties with the facts (Mary's daughter in the Tower with Ann? Huh?) and did not explain to her readers why she did so or what the truth was."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I enjoyed this book so much, I read it twice. Rarely do I do that. I was disappointed in the watered-down film version, however. This is my first Philippa Gregory book, but certainly not my last."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is the best book I've ever read! It throws you into history. It shows the personal side of Ann Boleyn, while still being historically accurate."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is fascinating. I highly recommend it to anyone in love with the Renaissance and Tudor era in England. You see history unfold through the eyes of Mary Boleyn, famous Anne Boleyn's sister. Unlike wonderfully wicked plotting Anne, Mary is a sweet girl that just wants to be loved and to take care of her children (who just happen to be royal bastards...). I adore the description of the culture; the dresses, the music, the food, the medical practices. It's very easy to read and very educational."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was great for the first 200 pages or so, and at first I could not put it down, but after that it was all downhill.. the same things happend over and over again.. so much drama about such stupid things ! It became boring and predictable. It was hard to make myself finish this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"There is an unfortunate trend towards the quasi-historical in popular novels today, and some rather terrible books get written in order to cash in on it. The Other Bolyn Girl is one of these books - it could have been better, it could have been *great* - but it was damaged by lack of research, childish writing, and the author's obvious purpose to cater to bored housewives and sex-crazed sorority sisters. If you're looking for serious fictionalized history, this is not the place to get it. You'll be disappointed. But if you need something to read on an 8-hour trans-Atlantic flight, then perhaps it's almost readable."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Of course this isn't historically accurate... its \\"Historica FICTION\\".

I watched the movie and absolutely loved it and I thought I would read the book and like most movie books it was fantastic. It was so captivating I didn't want to put the book down I read it in 4 days. It was so refreshing to read I suggest this book for anybody who wants to read a great suspenseful story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While the characters seduce Henry and his court, so too does this book seduce readers as each page is turned. Readers may find it easy to follow the life of Anne Boleyn, who is both sassy and sultry; yet, we are forced to follow the emotions of her more subdued sister, Mary Carey. However, as the story progresses, we grow to love Mary's even-tempered perspective, while we shrink from Anne's ever-increasing power--and temper. As the story progresses, Mary emerges not as \\"the other Boleyn girl\\" but as the one who is stronger and, in the end, more seductive, for we have trusted only her to reveal the truth."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It's been years since I read a book that I couldn't put down!

It is hard to put it down once you get started. It really takes you to Henry's court and what life must have been like in those years.

I guess it should not be a problem because most men would not be interested once they see the title anyway..."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I went to the movies not too long ago and I saw this movie, and I knew instantly that the book was a must-read. I was just fascinated by the whole story and the whole time period, and also the injustice of it all.So I got the book, and I started reading. And I made a discovery. My discovery is that the book is much better than the movie. In the movie, every one's feelings are extremely exaggerated, and there are parts that are cut out that would have made me like the movie even more.But I'm going to just forget about the movie, because I don't want to compare the two.The book, as a whole, was very very good. It was 661 pages of absolute historical fiction loveliness. The characters were so real, and so easily dragged forward in time to be exactly like a family now, in the twenty-first century. The story is timeless and addictive.Now, the negative. This book was long. I know that all of my friends would say \\"Well, Harry Potter is longer, and you read that in a day and a half\\". But with The Other Boleyn Girl, it took me longer than I would have liked. I found myself reading it just to be at the end, and although I was addicted I also wanted the added benefit of being done finally, so I could move on.Other than that, I found nothing wrong with it. I won't judge it for historical accuracy, because I know little to nothing factual about the time period. All I know is that this book was addictive and entrancing, and a book that I would definitely recommend, as long as you're up for the challenge."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the first bit of \\"Tudor\\" fiction I have read, and after finishing it I couldn't wait to read more so I hit my local bookstore and bought \\"I, Elizabeth.\\"At first I couldn't really get into \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" It's a little slow moving at first and 1/2 way through I wondered where it was going. Mary is not the most engaging of characters. She a bit of a wimp in the beginning and a complete pawn in her family's political games.The book is basically Mary's story for the 1st 1/2 and Anne's story--told through the eyes of Mary--for the 2nd 1/2. Anne's story is truly what makes this book readable and the final 250 pages chronicling the events leading up to her execution are exciting. I basically read the last 1/3rd of the book in one sitting.Can't wait for the movie!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was a novel I looked forward to reading everyday in the same way I looked forward to savoring a dessert and coffee. Delicious! It may not be historically accurate in every sense or have the cleverest prose but it doesn't claim to be a history book. It is simply a well done story that happens to have some historical truth to it which does define historical fiction. Phillipa Gregory has written a wonderful novel about the Boleyn family with Mary Boleyn as narrator. This gives the reader an inside look into the court of Henry the VIII and the culture of England in the 1500's. It is profoundly interesting on both accounts. Gregory manages to create an atmosphere which allows the reader to feel as if they are there. It is appalling to see that women are treated with little regard to their feelings and not much more than servants or sex objects. It is shameful how the advancement of a family in the social ladder rested on the looks, and sexual prowess of the females in the family regardless of their own feelings. Anne Boleyn in the novel is portrayed as a scheming, heartless, shrew who actually steals her own sisters baby so she may have a better chance at becoming queen. Mary the narrator although portrayed as naive in most ways is jaded by her families need for power and control and is more or less controlled by them. George the other sibling often quotes that it is not their lot in life to be happy but to do what they must for the family. How their lives play out is the meat of the story and is very well done. Against the back drop of England in the 1500's, court intrigue, betrayal, lust, power plays and treachery, what more could a reader ask for? Well done!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It is said perfectly in one of the critiques on the book - If you want a page-turner without giving up your reputation for reading literature - read this book!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"And why did the person before me need to write how the book ends???I'm in the middle of reading the book and enjoying it very much.I thought I would take a quick look at the reviews and the first one I read tells how the book begins and ends!

I simply could not put it down!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book for my book club. Everyone in the club really enjoyed it. It sparked a lot of interest in and discussion on European History. I will be sure to read other books by Philippa Gregory."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! It was my first experience with Philippa Gregory's work, and now I'm reading *all* of her novels. This is a fantastic transporting in time to an amazing period in history with all the intrigue of the Tudor court, and unforgettable characters. It takes an amazing level of talent to dive into the past, research real historical figures, then bring them to life on the page. Best of all, Gregory's plot twists and turns create real intrigue. It's an effort to *stop* reading on some nights when my tired eyes just won't stay open long enough to enjoy more of it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'll admit it here and now: I hate historical fiction. I loathe it with a passion. It's always boring, repetitive, and since it's history, of course I know how it'll end! So, with that, it's obvious that I was very biased before reading The Other Boleyn Girl, by Philippa Gregory. Yet, I was thoroughly surprised. I was captivated with every page until the every end. There were three different aspects, though, that kept me entranced and thinking: the characterization, plot, and themes of the book.The very characterization of Mary Boleyn was interesting. I love how much she different from the rest of her conniving family, and how she was basically forced to become King Henry VIIIs mistress rather than going into it willingly. She really was presented as a true heroine. Yet, Mary clearly wasn't perfect, as is shown in the beginning when she was often immature, whiney, and desperate. But throughout the book, it shows how much she grows and matures, and it makes her seem so real. You really feel for her like you could feel for your own best friend. Anne Boleyn, on the other hand, was presented as the complete opposite of her younger sister, yet was still so eloquently written. She was intelligent, witty, wicked, and always looked out for herself. In the end, you actually are pretty happy when she gets her head lopped off.The plot was strangely unique, with the idea of Mary basically facing off against her family. Her first major conflict was going against her family's wishes to become King Henry VIIIs mistress. Yet when she finally wants him, and she has his son, he marries her sister. It then goes through Mary's trials of wanting to help her sister bare a soon, be a good wife, and the feelings she still has for the king. OF course, in the end, Anne's head goes off, as in history, bit the little fiction that gives the book some spice gives the book an exciting and fitting conclusion.The last, and best literary element in The Other Boleyn Girl, was it's overall themes. And I mentioned before, Mary's maturity throughout the book grows, and even though she started as a petulant young girl, she grew up into a smart, sensible young woman. As a lesson, she learned that trying to get yourself ahead in the world isn't everything, and if you're in too deep, you might lose your head. Yet, the overall theme and moral of the story was to not let other people control your live and choose a desity for you, when you can do it yourself.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an exciting historical fiction full on sex, greed, malice, and (in the end) an overwhelming sense of justice. I would give it a 5/5 for insight, intrigue, and just for being one good read. So, in conclusion, this is such a good book you'll have to try and keep your head from coming off."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Loved this book!

I was totally into the story. I found myself wanting to be back in that time and really see these characters. The story is told through the eyes of Mary, Ann Boylen's younger sister. I found it appalling how the heads of the families could just tell someone who to love. The way Gregory writes this novel you begin to see parts of yourselves in these characters. I felt a sadness after I was finished reading the book. I did not want it to end. Even though I know the story of Ann Boylen this book took me deeper into her life and I look at her differently now. Mary Boylen is definatly a character who will stick with me as well. I loved how she finally found happiness at the end.

This book has helped me appreciate the struggles of women through the ages. A great read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Most people know that Anne Boleyn was the second wife of England's King Henry VIII, but few have heard of Mary Boleyn- the other Boleyn girl. Anne's sister (historians disagree as to whether she was older or younger) played on the stage of the Tudor court, yet has been mostly forgotten as she was never queen and died of natural causes.As a female member of the Boleyn and Howard families, Mary was a pawn to be used for gain, her own feelings and wants to be ignored. Married at 12 to William Carey, at 14 Mary caught the eye of the philandering king- then wed to Katherine of Aragon- and was his mistress for several years, bearing two children in the process. While laying in to have her second child, her sister Anne seduced the king, reserving only her (questionable) virginity, which she withheld for a promise of marriage and queenship. As we all know, that marriage and queenship was short and unhappy and ended with Anne's head removed from her body.This novel, told from the point of view of Mary Boleyn Carey, is a story that blends the false glitter of the court with strong family ties- ties of both obedience and of love. Mary loves her sister Anne but is also jealous of her- they are constant rivals at everything. Anne is her beloved sister but Anne is a user, someone who never looks at a situation without wondering how she can turn it to her advantage and humans-including family- are disposable. She learned this from her parents, who taught their children- including brother George- well. Their parents care not what happens to their children, as long as they are advanced at court and made wealthy.In this telling, Mary is less driven than Anne or George and more in touch with her moral side. She sleeps with the king because her parents tell her to, while questioning the propriety of betraying both Queen Katherine and her own husband. She asks for presents for her family at their behest. She gives up her place as mistress and aids her sister's ascension despite having come to love the king. She teaches her sister sexual tricks to hold the king and helps her hide miscarriages. She hides the secrets of the family, secrets that are punishable by death.But she finally rebels and makes a life for herself, marrying for love. Not long after, the Boleyn web of secrets falls apart and we all know how that story ends. Mary alone lives on, and historical record seems to point to a happy, if short, life after that.This book takes some liberties with history but I'm willing to forgive it. Gregory brings the era and the court to brilliant, vivid life. Somehow she manages to get the reader to care about these people, not just Mary (although she comes off best) but the avaricious Anne and George, and even the petty, selfish, childish king Henry. These characters are fleshed out, with the contradictions of spirit that we all have. I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Excellent book. Took it to the beach and could do nothing but read. Very well done."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend.

As the publication date of this title is back in 2002, I don't think the increase in price (which is stated as set by the PUBLISHER) is warranted."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Having only recently delved into the historical fiction genre, but having been fascinated by England's monarchy for years, I couldn't put this book down! The historical accuracy of P. Gregory is astounding and, coupled with her fictionalized character traits, this book has become my favorite of the genre. Other authors have much to live up to after reading this Philippa Gregory novel. I can't wait to read more of her work!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have to admit that I have looked at this authors books before in the bookstore, but never bought one. So when I found this book for $7.99 as a Kindle download, I caved in and bought it. Glad I did! I throughly enjoyed reading about Mary Boleyn and her more famous sister, Anne and their brother, George. When I finished the book, I looked up Mary Boleyn on Wikipedia and read up on her and her family and also Henery VIII. Now I am reading another Phillippa Gregory that is the sequal called, The Boleyn Inheritance. An added bonus about historical fiction, is that it is so much fun to look the characters up on Wikipedia right from your Kindle and learn all about their lives. Very cool"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"First off, I see no reason why anyone would be upset at the predictability. The history of Anne Boleyn is no secret! I feel that Philippa Gregory does an excellent job here. I love that the story is from Mary's point of view. Halfway through the book, I felt like I knew what it was like to be at court! This book really opened my eyes to the conniving ways of families at court. I knew enough before, but this really transports you there. Women really had no choices but to bed whomever their family told them to for the sake of social climbing. It also makes me wonder how history might be different if Katherine of Aragon had birthed a son! That seems to be the start of the trouble between her and Henry. Anne Boleyn was very skilled in her \\"work.\\" This book makes you hate her, yet care for her and feel sorry for her. Well done! I absolutely recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"#1 rated book of my book club! If you like historical fiction you will be blown away. This is a page turner - I simply couldn't put it down. (The movie was a huge disappointment)"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I think this would like to be taken as a plausible fictionalisation of history told from an unusual perspective but it's really just a romance in fancy dress and hence not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have read so many bland and otherwise unbelievable historical novels that I was a bit skeptical when I picked up The Other Boleyn Girl. From the start, I was hooked. Using Mary, sister to Anne, as a narrator was as brilliant touch by the author, as she comes across as a vastly different woman with somewhat lesser ambitions, as far as having power and the throne in her grasp.Her sister? Power and ambition seem to be born in her and the author, Philippa Gregory, has clearly done her research, as I felt like I was seeing the world of the 1500s, so vivid, so real. Male/ female relationships were also clearly spelled out and I saw the Boleyn girls as the pawns they were in a very dangerous game of strategy to catch the eye of King Hentry the VIII. It was clear that men held the power and the women were meant to do the bidding of their families, especially if they could be used to help secure land, financial security or upward mobility in society.This may be hard for those looking at the events from a modern perspective but I think the author wasn't off base in her assessment of the times. She has certainly done her research because at the end of the book there is an extensive bibliography, adding weight to my assumption that here is one author who does her homework - and quite thoroughly.Although historical fiction can rarely be accurate as to what was ACTUALLY said at certain moments in history (with the exception of those times when reliable notes or tapes were taken), there can be a fairly solid recreation of the way people lived, the values and traditions. This is one of the strongest points in the book, as the author recreated the daily activities of each level of social class and showed how important (and even dangerous) it could be to catch the King's eye. I also got a feel for the foods eaten, the expectations for women (to speak many languages, learn domestic arts, how to act with propriety and proper manners) and little details like having hair combed with lice combs provided information about the realities that even the highest classes had to deal with (yes, even lice).Every detail of this book pulled at my emotions and imagination as well as providing historical information I hadn't known before.. When I wasn't caught up in reading about the various intrigues of the Boleyn family then I would be sympathizing with poor Mary as she was torn from her children or wondered how various women would fare later in history, not just the Boleyns but the Seymour girls. The author makes no bones about how women were used as pawns, devices in a dangerous game of ambition, scheming and desire to advance a family's reputation.I refuse to say too much about the plot except to note that I doubt few readers will be unmoved by the events described here. Also, you'll come away with a deeper appreciation for the history of the day, an understanding about how it may have played out in day to day life and women's life in the 1500s, as well as court intrigue, political scheming and much more. Richly detailed writing and totally engaging! .Related books:The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn: Family Politics at the Court ofAnne Boleyn"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is the first Phillipa Gregory novel I read, and I tore through it. I really enjoyed how Gregory takes actual historical events and then uses her skill to create a story that absolutely captivates. It's hard to remember, at times, that it is fiction, and wonderful to learn more about a period while enjoying a fantastic read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was fun to read. A page turner. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Ms. Gregory truly brings history to life. It's fascinating to learn historical details in the context of a juicy story. The last couple of pages are an interview with the author, which reveal what she made up along the way, which is just as fascinating as the story. Couldn't put it down. I just wish I had enough time to read all of Ms. Gregory's other books!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I wouldnt call this a literary masterpiece or the best book that I have ever read, but I found it to be one of the most demanding--that I go back to it and finish as soon as possible!It's one of those literary candy novels that you can't put down. You will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next...The amount of sex in the book (without too much graphic detail) is numbing afterwards. It's almost as mundane as brushing one's teeth, after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics, weath, class, manipulation, etc.A harlequin story.Unbelievable society that Tudor was.So glad that women have it much better these days.The PILL did change history!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl, set in the years 1521 to 1536, focuses on the Boleyn/Howard families and their endless quest to climb the social ladder in King Henry VIII's court. In particular, this book deals with Mary and Anne Boleyn, two sisters who could not be more different in looks and personalities. They are Boleyns due to their father's side and Howards due to their mother's. Anne is the dark-haired, seductive beauty who marries the king and is later executed for witchcraft and adultery. Mary, the younger, fairer Boleyn sister, is actually the girl who starts the Boleyn chapter in English history. Mary, married at a young age, catches Henry's eye with her pretty fair looks and charm, and her relatives, the Howard family, seize the opportunity to make Mary Henry's mistress and to glorify the Howard/Boleyn names. Even after conceiving two beautiful children, Mary does not achieve a higher status other than the king's mistress, so Anne takes her place. Anne, with her deadly ambition, is determined to outshadow her fortunate sister and leave her mark in history. The king divorces his faithful but barren Spanish wife of many years and breaks from the Roman Catholic Church so he can marry Anne, and she will do anything, even go to the gates of Hell, to bring a son for the sake of the English throne.Meanwhile, Mary, no longer the Howard favorite, discovers the simple pleasures of life on a farm, and she decides to follow her heart for once and marry her true love. However, she is forced to watch the poignant rise and fall of her best friend and rival, Anne, in the whimsical English court. Anne is constantly kept on her toes, both literally and figuratively, to please the king. Henry acts like a spoiled child who will stop at nothing when he wants something, especially that something being a legitimate son to the throne, and one wrong dance move means certain death.This book wonderfully illustrates the deadly ambition that seizes many families like the Howards and turns the daughters and sons into mere pawns of an intricate game. Some of them escape alive, like Mary and her children (and her new husband), but others like Anne end up greeting the scaffold and not leaving it alive. The Other Boleyn Girl shows the whims of love and lust; Mary eventually discovers true love (to my joy), and she is the only fortunate member in the Boleyn/Howard families, as her brother bitterly notes. I love the magic and the suspense of the book. It is one of the few books I have stayed up many nights in a row, sacrificing precious hours of sleep, just so I could finish reading it. Philippa Gregory blends historical fact and fiction so well; she truly makes Mary, an obscure character in English history, come alive. Although this book is about 700 pages long, it is a true page-turner that keeps the reader wanting more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory has taken a well known story- about Henry VIII and his second wife Anne Boleyn- and created an enthralling read. The story of the seduction of Henry VIII by Anne Boleyn is told through the eyes of her younger sister, who also has 2 children with the king. Both sisters are pressured into pursuing the king by their family which is hungry for power. The narration delves into the motives and mindset of the main characters. This may be history, but it reads like a world class novel!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Unlike quite a few of the reviewers before me, I found this book quite entertaining and a good read. While it might not be entirely historically correct, Gregory still manages to capture the essence of the English court and the games played in order to pursue power. She also divulges into a very intense sister rivalry, a rivalry that is unparalleled in history. I think these two points were Gregory's primary goals in the retelling of the story of Anne and Mary, not to give an accurate historical account of Anne Boleyn and King Henry VIII.If you are looking for the perfect history of King Henry VIII and his most infamous wife, Anne Boleyn, then go buy a history book. If you are looking for an entertaining, fast-paced historical novel that captures the spirit of the 16th century English court I would highly recommend The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was my first Gregory novel, and I LOVED it. I was led to the book by Robin Maxwell's 'The Secret Diary Of Anne Boleyn' (also very good) - Mary Boleyn was mentioned in Secret Diary. I hadn't been aware that Mary had been mistress to Francois 1 and Henry VIII before reading Secret Diary, thus I was excited to find The Other Boleyn Girl (TOBG).Interestingly, it is a very different Anne depicted in TOBG to that given in Secret Diary, a very dark and selfish character .. but fascinating. Mary is also depicted somewhat differently. In Secret Diary she is presented as a silly, sluttish girl, yet in TOBG she is a more rounded, beleivable character .. and valid reasons given for her conduct.The book is well written, although I felt the author did 'flounder' a little in a couple of places. I felt she was 'padding out' the story, but don't let this put you off reading it, for she more than makes up for this in other areas. The conversation between Queen Katherine and Mary in the chapter headed 'Summer 1529' is heart wrenching; and (I hesitate to admit that) I had tears in my eyes at the description of Anne's execution.After reading this book I was compelled to search the Net for details of this neglected and interesting person from history (Mary Boleyn), & it was fascinating to discover that Mary's son (by Henry VIII) also named Henry served his cousin Elizabeth 1 and greatly impressed his sovereign and his nation. King Henry evidently chose not to believe he had fathered the child, although the baby was conceived during his relationship with Mary. Henry did however meticulously provide for Mary's son after her husband's death. Mary's daughter, Catherine Carey became gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber at Elizabeth 1's accession , married Sir Francis Knollys, and became the grandmother of Lord Essex, Elizabeth 1's favourite in her later years.A clear view of Mary's individual character would be difficult to obtain from surviving documents. Her personal history is obscured by the more tumultuous life and death of her younger sister Anne, and glimpses of Mary's life must be garnered from footnotes or brief mention in the works about her sister, her father and the two kings whose lives she touched (Francois 1 and Henry VIII). She was mistress to these two kings, twice wed to men of Henry VIII's Court and mother of children who served their cousin, Elizabeth 1, and must have been an enigmatic and intriguing figure .. and this author has served this character from history well.If you are interested in historical fiction, or even just interested in the Tudor period, I highly recommend this book. I don't think you will be disappointed.And, please don't let the reviewers who have criticised this book, put you off. I admit there are a few inaccurasies in the book, but for goodness sake, if you pick up a FICTION novel then you must accept the authors 'version' of the story. If you want to read totally accurate facts don't browse or shop in the Fiction section of the bookstore .. there's a place for people who can't stand someone else's interpretation .. it's labelled Non Fiction in the store. I suggest the 'critics' try this section & leave this author alone. I for one think she's done a fantastic job on a character from history who, as I said previously, would not have been easy to research.Thank you Philippa Gregory."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl...I wanted to see BBC's version of the book so bad because I thought I would love it, I couldn't find the video and started the book instead.At first I din't like it at all. Everyone is so selfish, immature, evil-minded and all they care about is money, titles and [physical activity], the women are mere [physical activity] objects but even that only until they can make baby boy heirs, they have no voice, no power, no money of their own, no control of their lives, there's too much adultery and while the men are justified, it's the women that face the hurt, and I hate hate hate books with sisters that are each other's rivals and knife each other's back. But I told myself, I'll read just a little bit more to see where it's going and will definitely not continue if this is how it's going to be.And I found myself unable to put it down.- Maybe it's my current classics and historical books obssession- maybe it took a while to settle into the period in which it is set and at last come to terms that this was 1530s after all...I think this was a bit difficult to sink in because the language has a modern feel to it- maybe it's Mary's narrative voice, especially during the middle of the book, where one can feel sympathy for her.- maybe it's Queen Katherine, the Spanish princess of Aragon and her quiet dignity and strength- maybe it's Mary's love of Queen K, inspite of all Mary's betrayals of herbecause of her family- maybe it's because I want to see Mary do something for herself and stand up to her Boleyn and Howard family's evil machinations- maybe it's because I want to see Anne, quite probably the most ambitious woman of her times, succeed because she is so ambitious, willing to work for it, and independently competant; but I am torn because I also want her to redeem herself through some failure, because she is so selfish, and stomped everyone in her way to get there including her sister who means her no harm, I want her to realize it's not all worth it.- maybe it's George- maybe I'm still waiting for the sisters to love each other as sistersI don't know which of the above but I'm still curious about it and reading it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was great, I could not put it down and did not want it to end.

I recommend this book to anyone, it is great!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was incredible-- hands down one of the best pieces of historical fiction I've ever read. Not only does Gregory nail the pliable nature of sisterly rivalry, she succeeds in bringing an unknown heroine to life. I could hardly put this book down. Little known detailed facts about the life and daily tasks of those in Henry VIII's court arise throughout this story making every page essential. And at the book's harrowing, bittersweet and shocking end, Gregory masterfully handles a situation you have to read to believe. I was moved and educated by Gregory's tale and urge everyone to delve into this worthwhile novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have always been interested in the going on's in king henry's court. never had i come across the person, Mary Boleyn. The first thing that caught my attention was that it was a novel based on a real unheard of person. After beginning to read it, I was surprised to discover how her life was controlled. after being married to someone that her parents arranged for her she also becomes the king's mistress. Her second marriage is for love, leading to the disownment from her family. And all along you are getting views of the rising ambition of her older sister, Anne Boleyn. IN no other book can you get the feeling, fears, and dreams of the two boleyn sisters, and that hard fall that awaited them. you won't be able to put this down!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you enjoy historical fiction, this first person account of Anne Boleyn's sister is fascinating. Phillipa Gregory's book is well written and never gets boring. She also provides an interesting view of historical events that I think is very clever. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Excellent background research, compelling character developement and keen pychological insight make this one of the best historical novels on the market. Philippa Gregory has that gift, she can take historical characters that the average person knows very little about and make them fascinating and disturbingly real. This was an engaging and satisfying read and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am an avid reader of Henry the VIII and when I read this book, I was spellbound. I loved reading about Mary and all the hardships that she faced in her life. This is an excellent book and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Henry the VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you like Tudor history, you are in for a treat with The Other Boleyn Girl.It is obvious that Philippa Gregory did her homework, as with all of her novels.As a British history buff, it was a delight to see a story about a woman who is rarely mentioned in popular history, but who had a major impact on the court of Henry the VIII.As Mary, sister to Anne tells her story, The Other Boylen Girl gives us a taste of the extreme difficulties, pressures and hardships even the most privileged encounterd in the Tudorian age.The story is enchanting, haunting and addictive. This is a very memorable read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have never, ever stayed up hours on end reading a book because I could not put it down...now, I have. This book is one of the most entertaining (while educating) works of historical fiction I have ever read. I just cannot say enough except to buy it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The best book I have read in a long, long time. It was interesting from beginning to end. A must for historical novel lovers!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Wonderful story and written superbly! This is the book that got me into reading Phillipa Gregory. I could hardly put it down!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"When one thinks of the Middle Ages, knights in armor, kings, and churches come to mind. However, Philippa Gregory fills The Other Boleyn Girl with sex, scandal, and lies. It is a story of Anne and Mary Boleyn, two sisters who sought power and happiness in a world dominated by men. The book is fascinating, based on real people and events.Although the novel was lengthy (661 pages), it was relatively easy to read and engrossing. I had trouble putting the book down, and the pages flew by. One of the reasons the novel is so interesting is because the characters are flawed, making it easy to relate to them. Anne will stop at nothing to be the best, Mary worries about pleasing everyone else, Henry is a petulant prince, and George cannot be with the person he loves. The characters evolve throughout the entire book. Anne is driven mad by her hunger for power, Mary realizes she wants to be happy and marries against her family's wishes, and George's love is his undoing. They are also filled with human emotions: love, greed, jealousy, bitterness, fear and lust.Another reason I found the novel so interesting was that all the people in the book actually existed. Their lives in the story paralleled their real ones. Gregory merely fills in their thoughts and words.I would recommend this book for those that enjoy reading novels set in the Middle Ages, or are looking for a good read in general. The story is about two women, so is geared more towards females. Don't let the length of the book put you off. It's worth every page."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Everybody has already said everything, so I'll just add that I'm on the fence here. I did enjoy it as a light \\"read,\\" but I appreciate historical accuracy and, as pointed out in a few of the reviews, history took a bit of a beating. I know a few historical writers and admire their striving after historical accuracy. It's a shame with such a rich tapestry from which to select, that Gregory played loose with the facts.On the up side, it's a fast and entertaining read. I had no problem with Anne's and Mary's dialog. I enjoy a little down-and-dirty, which is probably closer to the way people actually talked at the time and behind closed doors. The courtly speech rang true for me as well."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I love historical fiction and this book is wonderful. I fell in love with the characters and couldn't wait to finish one page so that I could read the next to find out what would happen. Even though I knew what would happen to Anne Boleyn, I was fascinated by \\"the other Boleyn girl\\" and her story and the story of Anne Boleyn through her eyes as well. There is so much drama, emotion, intrigue, sex, and just life in general in this book. Phillipa Gregory really made their world come to life for me in the pages of this book. If you want a good read then read this book. I am now going to read the other books by this author and see if they are just as good."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is an old tale told from a new angle which is fun. My book club read it and we all enjoyed it. I will definitely bookmark this author."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is a can't put down book.

I know from my own research that it is only partially factual but it was entertaining and had enough history that the characters were entirely believable. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Loved this book, I could hardly put it down! It gives you another perspective of the situation with Henry VIII. However, looking on the web for more information about the characters, I learned that the author may have taken some liberties with the facts...not enough to change my mind about the book!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This novel was a page turner. The fact that the point of view was that of Mary Boleyn gave this historical tale a fresh spin. Refreshing to see true love flourish in a time when women were discarded as mere pawns in a world dominated by men."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was worth it. If you like history this has got is as well as romance. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What an amazing read. This is the story of Anne Boleyn and her sister, Mary, and how they competed for the same man (King Henry). I loved the character of Anne in this book, well, not a character as she is a real person. BUt the way she was written here, I could for once understand her motives and why she did the things she did. This author makes history come alive, her romance writing is compelling, I could not put this book down. I plan to read her other novels as well."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The thing you must realize about this book is that it is, first and foremost, a novel. A novel based on actual historical events, yes, but still a work of fiction. So for those that criticize it for its historical inaccuracy, your criticism is misplaced. This is not a biography of Mary Boleyn or Anne Boleyn and it doesn't pretend to be.I myself am a bit of a Tudor junkie and love reading both fiction and nonfiction about the family and the times, and I found this book a delight. It had all the elements of a good story: sex, love, violence, suspense, complicated characters, and comic relief. My favorite character was George Boleyn, due to his wit, probably the funniest one in the story. Catherine of Aragon I think was the most true-to-life.My chief complaints about the story (historical inaccuracy aside, as I said above that doesn't have to be an issue here) are that sometimes (okay, often) it sounds like a Harlequin romance novel, and also it's very slow-moving. But if you are willing to wait through the long beginning I think you will find yourself well rewarded.A word of advice, though: skip the movie. It was dreadful."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I saw the movie first, and I was glad that the book gave me a lot more of the story. The complication of the story was excellent."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I may be the only person in the world who didn't really like this book. And I tried...I really did.This is actually the first Philippa Gregory book that I have read. It was the first historical fiction I read. It came highly recommended to me by a friend, this friend and I have so much in comment and I usually can trust her taste implicitly...not so much this time. I know people have praised this book ad they are certainly entitled to their opinions. I know my feelings on this are extremely unpopular.I would love to give a good rationalization as to why I have such disdain for this book but unfortunately I can't. I want to say this I adore Philippa Gregory, despite my distaste for this one I did not let it drive me away from her books. And if you look you will see I have reviewed some of her other books and I gave them positive reviews. It's not her as an author, it's just this story...even the best authors have a failure and that is this one. I am sorry to those enjoyed.I found it almost unreadable. The character development was shoddy and the story just felt like drug on and on and on...it was borderline painful. Yes, there were historical inaccuracies (this is not the only story of hers that has historical inaccuracies). I know most people who took issue with this book took issue with inaccuracies. Fiction will be fiction...I get that. I just don't like this book.I do not recommend this book to anyone but that's just my two cents. This was a hard review to write considering my love and admiration for Philippa Gregory as a writer."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was so very interesting. I highly recommend it to historical fiction lovers. I couldn't put it down and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Boleyn family, being a favorite of King Henry VIII, puts ambition before all else in their quest for more power and prestige. When 14 yr old Mary, already in an arranged marriage, attracts the King's eye and becomes his paramour, her controlling Boleyn family demand her siblings, George and Anne, to do everything to keep her in the King's good graces whereby the family enjoys gifts of lands and titles. While Mary recovers from childbirth, Anne is pushed forward to catch and hold the King's attention and keep fortune funneling into the family coffers. This is a tale of sisterly devotion and rivalry told from Mary's point of view. One sweet sister, and one calculating and cruel, wrestles with the greedy demands of their family and each other in their continual quest for more. Eventually, they answer the question: Is happiness attained with a crown on your head or rather with your head on your shoulders?The allure of pomp and pageantry of life at the court of King Henry VIII is irresistible until it begins to wear thin and the ruthless ambition of the players shows through. A highly addictive book! What I like about this book is it didn't get bogged down in political details where other books seem to just confuse their audience. Phillipa Gregory drew from actual events and filled in the spaces so beautifully, that although this is fiction, she could have nailed it. After finishing the last page, I was immediately inspired to learn more about the people and events of England in the 1500s. Fantastic!*The movie with Natalie Portman and Eric Bana, was, I thought, based on this book. But after watching it recently, I found it only shares the title. Stripped down, everything sucked out of it, and the story line turned completely inside out. There is no resemblance. Even the true historic details Gregory was so careful to include were omitted! For shame."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a total no brainer, it was a Kindle book, buy it and download it to the Kindle. A child could have done it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"With every page of this novel, I fell more and more in love with the story and grew more and more unwilling to put it down. The characters, even now, are on my mind and I suspect I will likely go into withdrawal for more. It ended too soon, and yet I devoured it as quickly as I could. I am anxious to read the author's other works and am officially a huge fan of this historical fiction genre."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Let me say that this is my favorite of the Gregory Tudor novels. Gregory does a masterful job of illustrating just how claustrophobic and poisonous the life of the court was, and how it destroyed relationships even between family members in the ruthless struggle for power. This is particularly clear in the Boleyn-Howard family, where power is the reason for everything and love takes a decidedly secondary role, if it even exists at all. I was very struck by the behavior of the mother, who simply abandons her daughters to their fate, never even physically touching them even once throughout the book.That Mary, the narrator, manages to remain warm and kind in this atmosphere is amazing, but she does. The reader is certainly relieved when she escapes the court with her true love, even at the cost of her brother and sister. Her relationship with Anne was very well done: the mixture of love and resentment was poignant.I did feel that the character of Anne could have been more well-rounded and have more depth. She's so nasty that it's hard to see why Mary gives her any love at all; her story would have been even better told if Gregory brought forth some of her redeeming characteristics, such as her love for Elizabeth. Still, the relationships examined in this book were all very compelling and fascinating. It makes you wonder: would it have been better to live as a common person during that era, with all the hardships that entailed, or as a courtier, with all your physical needs being provided for, but your love and humanity sucked out of you?"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Although the idea of a historical fiction books generally put me to sleep, I have to admit this one immediately grabbed me and held my attention through the entire novel. This story and the scandals that happened related to it are told in a way that transport you back to England during this period. Philippa Gregory has the ability to tell a story that makes you feel like you're part of the lives of the Boleyn's, the good, the bad and the ugliest of the Boleyn's. You grow up with Mary, throughout the story and see the impact of a family of prestige and wealth and what they will do to accomplish their goals. As Mary ages, her understanding of life and its importance changes and gives a different view as your travel through the book.Gregory does a great job of establishing the characters and providing the details needed to keep you on the edge of your seat; from family rivalry, to witch craft, adultery, and demon babies the story is never a bit dull. While the book thrilling and entertaining, the entire history appears to not be as accurate as it could be, but I was less concerned with that as the pieces tweaked and moved gave more the story being told. If you want to read a book based strictly on historical fact, then this is not the book. If you want a read full of passion, jealousy, anger, plotting, and deception then pick this book up, sit back and enjoy the historical FICTION ride!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was about Mary Boleyn and her struggle to reach the throne. In this novel her sister, Anne Boleyn, is her rival. Their whole lives has been a competition. This one was the hardest, the quest to become the next queen of England. Mary had the king's heart at first but as soon as she turned her back her sister was their to take her place. Mary never decided for herself what to do next, as it was always the head of the family to decide what to do next. Mary was married young, at the age of thirteen to William Carey. She had hardly know her husband before she was taken to the king. For years Mary was the king's mistress. She had two kids with him, Catherine and Henry. Soon after her second child with the king Anne was the one in the king's favor, not Mary.

The intrigue, the heartbreak, the family dynamics combined with the sense of helplessness that comes from knowing how its going to turn out, makes this book a fascinating read.

This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I felt as though I reveling in the King's court."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought this book as an assignment for my moms' book club. I could NOT put it down! If my history books had been this interesting in high school, I probably would have considered majoring in history in college! Gregory's writing is absolutely delicious. She enhances the historical facts with dialogue and really gives you a sense of how these characters lived and interacted. Now I am completely fascinated by historical novels. Another recommendation from my book club is Abundance, about Marie Antoinette. (Even if you don't read it, please know that Marie is NOT the one who said \\"Let them eat cake!\\" That infamous quote was actually uttered by a man and incorrectly attributed to her. She actually loved the French people.) Anyway, this novel is much better than the movie \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" which I did see, so if you saw the movie you should still read this book to really get the details of the story!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Everyone is familiar I think with the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. After reading this book I saw them in a whole new light, as real people and I gained an understanding of who they were and came to understand their motivations and ways of thinking. In other words, they became alive to me, Philippa Gregory is a very entertaining writer with a refreshing style and I could barely put the book down once I started reading it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This page-turner makes the list of my favorite books of all time. It was the first book I read by Philippa Gregory and definitely won't be the last one.The author makes an amazing job of storytelling that makes it hard to put the book down.I finished the book within two weeks of having purchased it.Loved it!! If you love a story full of twists and surprises this is a must read for you. Can't wait to watch the film adaptation. I am definitely considering other works by Philippa Gregory."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As with most books that are made into a movie, this book is great!! Far better than the movie! Highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I liked the book. It was very engaging and entertaining, a true page-turner. However, the anti-feminism and other radical events that took place could upset one's sensibilities, but it was honest and true of the times of King Henry's reign. but overall, it was so dramatic and wonderful. Phillipa Gregory has a very unique writing style that is very thorough which I absolutely admire."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had to read a historical novel for a history class I was taking. This book as on the list. It was a good choice for me--I was captivated from the first scene (an execution.) Yes, it was soap-opera, but alot of life is, if you really think about it. I found the whole concept of a court, where people just recreate all day a little strange.Some complaints of reviewers aren't valid:1) the English was too modern. Please! Do I want to read a novel where people speak in Old English? If that's what you want, go read Shakespere.2) not historically accurate. It may be Gregory doesn't have every detail exactly right, but then again she may. Do these reviewers have their doctorate degrees in history? If not, they should keep their mouths shut. The list of references in the back of the book seems quite comprehensive to me.3) Gregory presents George and Anne as having an incestuous relationship. Wrong! She merely hints at it by the way they look at and touch each other. She never confirms nor denies the incest, but gives us perhaps reasons for the rumors. I honestly think George was gay (also hinted at in the book), but we can't prove that, now can we?The story of Henry VIII and his wives was always interesting to me, and this book brought it to life."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of my favorite books! It was so easy to read and get involved with. You really get to know the characters. All I had to do was read page one and I was sold! The whole story flowed and I didn't want it to end. I would love to see a movie made from this book!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you enjoy historical fiction, you'll love this book! I got so engrossed I found myself thinking inside the story during the day...when I'd been reading it in bed the night before. The story is fast-paced and exciting, yet touching and real.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Historical fiction, particularly about the role of women is incredibly interesting. Although there were certain portions of this book which seemed inplausible or out of historical context, on the whole it was engaging. The rights and duties of a women at that time in such circumstances was quite worthy of reflection."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What a tale! Ms Gregory is a wonderful historical storyteller and doesn't disappoint in this novel. &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; gives the story of Anne and Henry the VIII from the sister's perspective. This allows the reader to observe the sad story from the outside but with feeling and personal observations. The historical information alone will knock your socks off. Great, wonderful read for those that like substance in their romances."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am not good as writing reviews. I just wanted to say I finished this book last night. I absloutley loved it. I know its not 100% historically accurate but she did a great job telling the story of the Boleyns. I came to love Mary and detest Anne(vile and conniving) and the rest of the Boleyn family. Sometimes though I did like George. King Henry VIII seemed to be a spoiled child who got whatever or whoever he wanted.I was glad to see that Mary got what she wanted at the end. And Anne got what she deserved. Just MHO....."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book kept me riveted! Amazing how women were treated in the days of Henry VIII. Be glad you live now &amp; not then.It was wonderful to learn of Anne Boleyn &amp; how Queen Katherine was ousted from the throne. Ms. Gregory does a good job of staying true to historical facts while weaving lots of love triangles in the story to keep you turning the page."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I realize this is a fictional account of court life during the reign of King Henry VIII given from the POV of Mary Boleyn, younger sister of well-known Anne, but enough facts are included in the book to make it all the more fascinating.Mary, a young recently-married teen, is depicted as the innocent pawn put into play by her calculating family with hopes to gain the attention of the young, virile king and secure a higher position for the family. Court politics decree that Mary is better suited for the task as she is already married and once the king has tired of her she can return to her husband. However, an unmarried maiden taken mistress would be &quot;ruined&quot; and unfit for marriage once discarded. What's more, Mary's husband doesn't dare speak out against the arrangement. Instead he must freely give his wife to the king and is compensated with a new title and land. The children she has from the &quot;royal union&quot; bear her husband's name. How generous.And that's only the beginning. The book abounds with the constant rivalry between the sisters coupled with the unbreakable bond of familial unity, all witnessed within the setting of the strictly choreographed and often corrupt court.As fascinating as it is to peek into this amazing world of court life with all its intrigue and outrageousness, it's also interesting to read about Mary and to follow her as she matures into a woman who discovers true happiness in the simple pleasures found with a loving and beloved spouse and children, free of the choking ambitions imposed on her by her greedy, power-hungry family.Overall a delightful, hard-to-put-down novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have not read much historical fiction and never would have come across this novel but for the recommendations of some acquaintances. I LOVED it! Fascinating subject and engrossing fictionalized account."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I haven't had much time to sit down and read any books lately, however this one fell into my lap while waiting in an airport of all places and i could not put it down! This is an amazing story. Everything from the setting to minor characters are beautifully nurtured. Well done."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the best pieces of historical fiction that I have read. Very hard to put down, the story keeps you wondering what will happen next, even when you know the historical ending.A very enjoyable book to read!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This jewel of a book has rendered me a total Philippa Gregory junkie. An impulse buy prior to a day at the beach, The Other Boleyn Girl proved to be mesmerizing and completely absorbing. I inhaled the 600+ pages in two days. I thought I was fairly familiar with Tudor history, but had not before heard of Anne Boleyn's older sister Mary, let alone known that Mary bore Henry VIII children. The sisterly rivalry, the unbridled ambition of Anne, the treachery of court life all come alive in this massive work that is as light as a feather to read. Warning: you will want to immediately go and purchase The Queen's Fool and The Virgin's Lover (the sequels) as I did. Buy all three of these books, assemble a wool throw, some chocolate, tea, and curl up during a rainstorm. You will lose yourself."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl paints a vivid, beautifully alive picture of what life was like in 16th Century England. That picture may not always be pleasant (in fact at times it can be horrific considering the lengths that the Howards went to to gain power), but it always magnificently transports you to another time and place. Whether it is historically accurate or not, it is nonetheless entertaining and really makes you wonder about the true historical events around the Boleyns. I found myself digging through my old school papers and Google to refresh my memory on the history, and I found I learned a lot in the reading of this novel.The only complaint I have is that it just would not end. I think several chapter could have been cut in an effort to make to make the story progress faster.Other than that, I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A friend lent me this book to ready and I couldn't put it down. I am not a historian by any means, I just love to read. I found this fascinating and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. You find yourself being so drawn back in time. I highly recommend it for pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Ms. Gregory delivers another epic to her fans with the tale of the Boleyn sisters. Anne and Mary, both \\"queens\\" of love vie with and against each other for the legendary lords of Britain. Anne's story is well known, but Mary's romantic exploits thrilled and shocked before her sister came to womanhood. Gregory's well-researched historical detail adds to the atmosphere of her story. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I bought this book in a desperate attempt for more Anne Boleyn reading material. In all honesty, I didn't even read the book cover, I had only heard that it was a good book and saw the word &quot;Boleyn&quot; on the cover. I didn't even know it was about Mary until I picked it up to read the next day.From what you hear about Mary Boleyn in random books is that she was an air-head whore who was simply placed aside when Anne took over. The entire preception of Mary Boleyn is altered in this book while maintaining minor charcter descriptions. Many are upset that many historical facts were altered as well, but it is &quot;Historical Fiction&quot; I believe you must take it with a grain of salt and simply enjoy it for what it is.The book opens at the execution of a distant uncle of the Boleyn's after openly claiming the King would never be able to have a legal heir. This is where Mary learns and realizes the hard way that &quot;there is no room for mistakes in the King's court.&quot;When Mary was around 12 or 13 years-old she made a marriage to benefit her family to William Carey, but when she catches the eye of King Henry of England, she must change her life again to furthur benefit her family. She becomes the King's mistress for three years giving him two illgeimate children, all the time being envied by her older sister, Anne.After giving birth to her second child, Mary finds out she has been replaced by her older sister, Anne. Slowly but steadily Mary witnesses the incredible rise of her sister Anne and watches how her beloved Queen Katherine is replaced, and finally the crown is placed on Anne's ambitious head. Afterwords, Mary then watches in comparison to her slow ride, her fast downfall.Philppa Gregory is...a beyond words amazing author. She weaves an incredible story where you day-dream of wearing the beautiful clothes and dancing at the court banquets, you practically fall in love with the charms of Mary and Anne's brother, George Boleyn. You learn to both love and hate King Henry as Mary does, her enemies are yours, her husbands you love as well. Sounds corny, but its so true!!! Also, its easy to relate to if you have sisters with the entire &quot;Friends, Rivals, Sisters&quot; point of view.&quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; is an interesting title, because while reading, you are never quite sure who the other Boleyn girl is, exactly. Even if you are not a fan of History, as I am, you will still enjoy this as a novel. This is truly a must read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is by far one of the best books that I have read in several years. Although it is over 600 pages long, I read it much quicker than many others that are only 200 pages. I just couldn't put it down. I would look forward to getting on the subway so I could continue the saga, and was very disappointed when the book ended. Six hundred pages was just not enough! The story was so interesting, and the style of writing was completely engrossing. I knew a little bit about Anne Boleyn prior to this book (just the basics) but like most others had never even heard of Mary Boleyn. But after reading this book I became obsessed with this time period/these characters and wanted to read everything else on the subject. I have read a few other books about Anne Boleyn since, but none captured my attenion like this one. Not only is this a great read, it is an important piece if historical fiction and I am personally recommending it to every person I know."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This historical novel was wonderful. Absolutely loved it and all the descriptions of the time and era. Couldn't put it down and sorry it had to end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"TOBG is an appalling portrayal of Anne Boleyn and the real woman that she was. I think Anne would be horrified, disgusted and offended if she knew how modern novelists, such as Gregory, portray her. What irritates me is exactly what Alison Weir has pointed out - history in the Tudor period was so fascinating, you couldn't make it up, so why do people invent things when surely Anne's story is fascinating enough anyway?This book is also a monstrous betrayal of Mary Boleyn, and George. Mary would probably be mortified to see that she is portrayed as nothing more than a naive whore, when Weir's research disputes that and suggests that she was in reality unlucky, whereas there is no evidence that George was homosexual. Philippa Gregory has disgraced the name of the Boleyns. Let us also not forget her horrible depiction of Jane Boleyn in \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\". And I'm quite sure Katherine Howard would not appreciate being presented as a sex-mad bimbo when she was more probably naive than anything else. Disgraceful."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have already read several books from this author and find them very informative and it really gives you a insight into what it must have been like during this time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I agree with \\"Literature Queen\\" who posted on 26 February. This book interests with its 'insider view' - but does not have much basis in fact, except in the large overall themes. I still sometimes really like a book like this, though, or a program like Masterpiece Theatre's Henry VIII (with Helena Bonham Carter) because - even if there aren't historically accurate - they breed new Tudor fans.Though the characterization of Anne is exaggerated to the nth degree, think for a moment what type of woman it would take to cause a TOTAL upheaval in a society, especially in the 16th century when as you can see as you read this book, woman are little more than property.Because of Anne Boleyn, the UK became (and still is) Anglican - basically, Catholicism without the Pope (an IMMENSE presence then). Because of Anne Boleyn, the Catholic hierarchy in England was pulled down so violently that it caused a huge revolt. Because of Anne Boleyn - this the novel points out well - NO wife in that time, especially one of Henry VIII's would ever feel secure again.There is no doubt that Anne became completely impossible for her family to deal with - indeed, even Henry couldn't deal with her. That, more than any other one reason (even the absence of a son), was the reason she was done away with. So, her portrayal here - as an intelligent, ruthless, striving young woman with a blackened heart out to get her way - is probably not TOO far off the mark. That's the lasting image I come away with.In my mind, good historical fiction writes non-real people into real historical situations accurately recreated. Leon Uris is a master of this. The writers others' mention in their reviews are probably equally as good. I guess it's a harder task to create plausible personalities, motives, and dialog when writing about real people from history. Obviously, though this book is a page-turner, Gregory found it too hard to stick with the basis facts so changed them to fit her story.Use this book as 1) a fun throw-away beach read, or 2) the introduction to wanting to learn REAL Tudor history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"There are 9 of us a book club and we've never agreed on a book that we've loved as much as this one. Originally we were apprehensive to pick it as there were so many pages (we are very busy women) but we all flew through it and many said that they had a hard time putting it down (I was 3 hours late to a party because I wanted to continue reading!). The book was fabulous and really gave you a feel for how things were back then. I highly recommend this to everyone. Enjoy, CMD"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is one of Gregory's best yet! This book is so good that they are going to be making a major motion picture from it! This book is a bit long, but when you get to the last page, you want it to keep going. A real page turner. This book is definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely couldnt put this book down. I was sad when I was done because I didnt want it to end. Afterwards be sure to read The Queen's Fool or The Virgin's Lover, loved those too!

I primarily read fiction action/mystery books but my friend convinced me to read this one. Boy, am I glad that she did! Every page kept my attention. I couldn't wait to read what debauchery, deception or plotting was happening next. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"An absolute page turner from the very start. Historical fiction that keeps your attention as you follow the lives of so many different characters all from the perspective of young Mary Boleyn (Anne's sister). See the plotting it takes to become favored by the king as well the horrible sacrafices you must make in order to remain his favorite. A wonderful combination of fact and fiction that draws you in and keeps you there."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory has a true gift for historical fiction. This thoroughly enjoyable novel makes you feel as if you were there, in that place, in that time, with those people. Rich characterization of the members of the Boleyn family and King Henry VIII's court, rich descriptions of the life of the courtiers (full of pettiness, social climbing, gossip, scheming and intrigue) , and vivid explorations of the circumstances of Anne Boleyn's scheming rise and abrupt, precipitous fall, seen through the eyes of her sister Mary, all combine to make an absorbing and entertaining read. When finished reading, I felt, \\"It definitely really could have happened exactly that way.\\" Well researched and well written; you won't want to put this one down because you will be engrossed in this slice of history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This novel was extremely intriguing from a historical perspective as well as simply fun to read. I myself was never even aware that Anne Boleyn had a sister. The book was almost impossible to put down and although I grew faintly tired of the writing style by the end, I thouroughly enjoyed it and would greatly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is just sloppy historical research. Gregory is a good author, I won't deny that but the fact that she sells this tripe as \\"historical fiction\\" is an insult to anyone who even does a surface amount of historical research."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book reads like a romance novel and doesn't have much depth. The characters aren't very well defined and they seem two dimensional. I've read other much better historical novels than this."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"With just a little too much romance to be historical novels and far too much history to be romance novels, Philippa Gregory defies categories in her two immensely readable and wonderfully informative stories of 16th century England: \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and \\"The Queen's Fool.\\" That she is able to saturate her novels with history is less surprising when one realizes that she has a history degree from the University of Sussex and a PhD in eighteenth-century literature from the University of Edinburgh, but that she is able to bring history to life with such apparent ease and without breaking the rhythm of her narrative is most impressive.Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister, narrates the first, chronologically, of these two books: \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" She is Henry VIII's mistress and bears him two children before her more famous sister, Anne, usurps her place. Historically, that is fact, at least the first part is. Whether Anne actually connived to unseat her sister is less clear, though Gregory certainly gives a convincing case of \\"what-if?\\" Beginning with Henry's attentions to Mary, the story continues through a rumble of bedding, wedding, and ultimately Anne's beheading. Along the way Gregory paints a picture of a court in which everyone must look over his shoulder constantly, marriages are made for convenience and political alliances, and men, whether father, brother or husband, control women and use them as pawns in a risky game of power. One sister resists, the other cooperates. From the beginning, Gregory paints a picture of sisterly rivalry weighed against sisterly love. Ultimately, sisterly love wins, though the rivalry proves Anne's undoing.Gregory continues the two themes of sisterly love and rivalry and women obeying (or not obeying, as the case may be) men in \\"The Queen's Fool.\\" With the rivalry, and sometimes love, between Henry's two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth as historical background, Gregory tells the story of Hannah Green, a Jewish refuge from the Spanish Inquisition who, after seeing her mother burned at the stake, flees with her father to England where he sets up shop as a bookseller. Hannah, who narrates the tale, has the gift of \\"sight\\", that is, she has visions that come unbidden and reveal the future to her. It is one of those visions that, early in the story, lands her in court during the short reign of Edward VI and, after his death, leaves her as a pawn batted back and forth between Mary and Elizabeth. Hannah has the ability to see the best in both and, as much as possible, is loyal to both, no mean feat given that each princess see herself as destined for the throne of England. To complicate matters, Hannah is betrothed to another Jewish refuge, who like her, must keep his ancestry a secret. She is torn between her desire for independence and her passion for her intended husband. How she eventually reconciles the two is the meat of the novel.Gregory's narrative is engrossing, her conversations engaging. Among her previous fourteen books is a trilogy that includes \\"Wideacre\\", \\"The Favored Child\\" and \\"Meridon.\\" Dare we hope that she will follow \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and \\"The Queen's Fool\\" with a third partner, focusing on Elizabeth?"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"...and enjoy this engaging historical soap opera! A novel approach to the Henry VIII/Anne Boleyn love affair, told from the point of view of Anne's sister, Mary...largely ignored and unknown by history.

Historical inaccuracies aside, this is simply a poorly written book. Please don't waste your money; hire any neighborhood 12 year old and they'll write a better book for you than this."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boylen Girl is a fantastic portrayal of Henry the man-slut saga told from the perspective from the 'other' Boylen girl.The characters are wonderfully described, and the court intrigue fun.The main concerno of this novel is the mammoth near 700 pages. I'm pretty sure around 200 pages of them could be cut. Most of the last part of the book is a slow decline into the inevitable beheadings and remarriages. Perhaps the author wanted to keep to some degree of historical accuracy, but the last act lacks tension and is a bit of a drag.Required reading for fans of Henry-man-whore and victorian type dramas, perhaps too long to frivulously read on an afternoon whim."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have read all of her books involving the wives of Henry VIII and this was by far my favorite.

This was not the case here. The book is well written, but in that sort of your English teacher makes you read it cause it's a good example of well written technical fiction. Its not too enjoyable, it doesn't flow well. I found it very hard to relate to the characters or feel anything for them, regardless of the fact they were real people.What was even harder for me was the age of the main character and her lust for the king, I mean the girl was 13 or 14 in this book. The author talks about lust, passion, and love -- the age of the girl in the book made it very unbelievable. I had to force myself through it. I wouldn't recommend it -- if you are looking for anything similar to the movie here you won't find it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Book arrived in great time and in near perfect condition, hasn't read it yet but greatly looking forward to it. thanks much!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"1. The Other Boleyn Girl - Phillippa GregoryI love all things Tudor. This novel is the best of them all -- illuminating the little known story of Mary Boelyn, the sister of doomed queen Anne Boelyn whose marriage to King Henry VIII broke the Roman Catholic influence on England and begat one of the country's most prominent rulers: Elizabeth I. But before all that there was Mary, the king's mistress and mother of his illigitimate children. In this world women are pawns in a royally dangerous game, their male family members vying for checkmate.

I was given this book as a gift (thank you a million times over!), and I was interested as I had remembered seeing the previews for the movies. It took me a while to really commit to reading it, but I once I did I was completely fascinated! I could hardly put it down! I expected to get hungup on the language, but the story and the writing really moves...it just flows nicely. The story and the characters pulled me in, and I found myself devouring every detail!If you enjoy historial novels, you'll love this one! If you think you don't enjoy historical novels, give this one a try! You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was extremelllly long, and many times I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over. However, the storyline is pretty interesting. But I felt like I wanted to see more of \\"the other boleyn girl\\" 's life in the end. Everything seemed so drawned out during the novel and then its gets to the the end and you seem to only have the vague notion of how her life turned out. But, perhaps that is what the author wanted."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn girl is told from the viewpoint of Mary Boleyn - the \\"other\\" Boleyn sister, sister to Anne the future Queen of England. There is a focus on the life of the relatively little known Mary as well as the tale of Anne's ascendency and fall. Mary is initially chosen as mistress to Henry VIII - a role that she is pushed into by her family. When the star seems to be shining on Anne - the family throws Mary aside in favor of Anne. Even though Mary is not the star of the family anymore, they still seek to control her every move - when she marries someone that is not approved of they lash out at her. Even though Anne constantly mistreats her sister, she still comes back to her.The story of Anne Boleyn is a much told story - but seeing it from the eyes of her sister puts her story into a very different perspective - sort of how I felt about reading about Anne from the eyes of her daughter Elizabeth in The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn by Robin Maxwell. I loved the compassion and general down-to-earthness of Mary, even when the world was spinning out of control. She was a constant character that you could connect with and anchor to in a turbulent world.Gregory DOES change many events in the book from what is known to have really happened as well as embellished the real story in favor of the best told story. The good thing about this though, is that this is Historical Fiction and that is what I expect. If you are looking for true facts, check out a non-fiction book, but for a good story, try this on for size.I couldn't put this book down and as soon as I finished it I picked up The Boleyn Inheritance, the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. Excellent to say the least."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really enjoy historical fiction to begin with, so I think this book was very interesting from the start. At times it got a little boring especially in the beginning but it had a great plot and very dynamic characters. I think the author made a good effort to show everyone that in the end it was Anne's character that made the king dislike her, however she had become that kind of person to attract him even more for greedy purposes and for him. Its very sad what becomes of Anne. I know its a historical account so a lot is untrue, but it still made me upset in the end."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I got this book for Christmas, I wanted it to read more about the Boleyns and King Henry after seeing the movie, 'The Other Boleyn Girl, which I loved. I was NOT disappointed! It is SO well written and you just completely lose yourself into the life of Mary Boleyn, her family, and the King Henry. I could hardly put this book down. It's fascinating how the lives of ladies in the court were in those times."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is the best piece of historical fiction that I've ever read; there were several nights when I couldn't put down the book and read until the early morning hours.Historical fiction is not generally my preferred reading choice, but I thoroughly enjoyed Phillipa Gregory's portrayal of Henry VIII's court, the ambition of the Boleyn family, and the tragic demise of Anne Boleyn, the oldest of two sisters in the Boleyn family. The story is told by Anne's younger sister, Mary Boleyn, who was married off at the age of 13, became the king's mistress until he lost interest in her, and then after many years of being a pawn in her family's ambitious plan to rise to power, whatever the cost, began to make her own decisions.Anne and Mary were both beautiful young women who were members of a powerful family that felt it could never have too much power or too much wealth. It was fascinating to read about the choices each of these women made along the way, and where their choices led them. It was also eye opening to read about what life was like for women in the 1500s.The English court during Henry VIII's reign is a poignant reminder of what can happen when corruption and abuse of power dominate, no one is safe.Even if you're not someone who typically reads historical fiction, read The Other Boleyn Girl. It will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was purchased as a gift for a family member. It was easy to shop online and the item was a good value, which came quickly, and was well packaged."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The ending is of course not a surprise as far as what happens to Anne, but I haven't read too much about this time period, so I didn't even know that Mary Boleyn existed. The author does an amazing job of combining history with fiction and really bringing the characters to life. A very satisfying book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"WOW...what a book! I don't know why I feel like the last one on earth to read about Henry VIII or Anne Boleyn--I don't even think I knew who they were before reading this (sad, but true)...and now-after days and nights of nonstop reading- I feel like I could teach a class on these two (a short class...for toddlers) I was totally drawn in by the powerful wills, rivalries and love described by Gregory--it seemed both real and impossible. Is it possible that Anne Boleyn was truely the enormous BIT#*!H that was given to us in this novel? Is that possible? If so, then I regret ever assigning that word to any living being because no one-and I mean NO ONE - holds a candle to Annie B. and amazingly, as she walked the block, somehow I began to manifest sympathy for her-despite hundreds of pages of hating her. The story also satisfied the great romantic in me-no better love has been described than that of Mary and William Stafford. How Gregory is able to breathe those first passionate feelings of love into the pages is amazing. You put the book down but somehow find that everything around you looks a little different. Feelings become charged. Little sparks of passion emerge. You can't read about this kind of love and not find yourself in love again. (unfortunately, reading about Henry and his infidelities kind of kills these feelings and I was torn between loving men like Stafford and feeling disgusted by men like Henry, not that I've ever known a king...but I know plenty of men who think they come close) I loved this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Perhaps because so many friends raved about this book I expected too much. All in all it is a good read and held my interest with its novel approach of telling the story of the Boleyns through Mary."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Couldn't put the book down. Read it in 2 sittings. One of the most interesting and enjoyable books I have read in a very long time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Gregory is a true artist. The story engages the reader from beginning to end, with twists and turns, plots and undertones. I couldn't put this one down. Although fiction,the book is filled with historical citations and questions that have never been answered. The book is thought provoking, and offers a well painted portrait of 16th century life. Gregory has once again created a moving novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I absolutely loved this book, I know that some if it may not be true, but it is a very good account of the time and life of Anne Boleyn and the others around her. Excellent read! I have added it to my collection of 16th century novels and biographies."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I picked this book up as something to read on a recent trip. I had not heard of the author or the book, but I have an affinity for historical fiction. I found myself enthralled in the description of life at court. From the descriptions, I felt like I was there among the ladies in waiting. I have passed this book along to many of the my friends and family and they have only had wonderful things to say. I plan to read her other books as well."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I've always been fascinated with Tudor history and was excited at a chance to discover a woman, Mary Boleyn, who's hasn't often merited a place in the whirlwind of Henry VIII's marital exploits.I loved the way Gregory was able to portray this little known person and give her a face and a personality. From the first Mary Boleyn is a woman that any girl with a sister can relate to. She has a sort of bittersweet feeling about her sister Anne. Half the time she wishes her sister the best and the other half wishes her only the worst. Readers become attached to Mary and hope everything will, in the end, turn out great for her. The belated courtship between Mary and the husband she had to put on hold when she was thrust by her ambitious family into the bed of the king is really well done. Readers truly hope that everything will work out for them so Mary can finally be happy with a man she loves.The only reason this novel did not merit a top score of 5, but rather one of 4, was the way it slowed down at the end. The author spent pages and pages on Mary's deepest feelings at the very start of the book, but seemed to be in a bit of a rush nearer the end. It seemed to me almost as though Philippa Gregory got tired of the story and decided to end it as fast as possible.Other than that, though, this is a wonderful book that everyone should pick up and give a try."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was very good. It told you all about the passion and rivalry between Mary and Anne Boleyn as they fought to bed the king and become queen. This book doesn't have a lot of grusome events described in it, considering its subject. If you like history, you'll want to read this book.But,it has lots of English Lituature, which can take a while to read. It has a lot of passionate and sexy scenes, so it might confuse young readers. I give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This well-known author of historical fiction has outdone herself with this rich and absorbing tale of the notorious Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary. The Tudor court, with all its pomp and intrigue, is seen through the eyes of the beautiful Mary Boleyn, who at the age of fourteen arrives at court and becomes lady-in-waiting to Katherine of Aragon, Queen of England and wife to King Henry VIII. Although already married to courtier William Carey, Mary captures the heart of King Henry VIII, whose roving eyes land on this innocent young miss.In the eyes of the grasping and greedy Boleyn family, Mary is but the fatted calf through whom their ambitions, they believe, will become realized. So, they offer her up as a sacrifice to their ruthless ambition. Forced to separate from her husband in order to become the King's mistress, Mary betrays the Queen and becomes mistress to the King, all at the behest of her family. Every step of her affair is choreographed from the wings by her family, with the adept aid of her sly and clever sister, Anne, in the role of chief manipulator.Mary struggles with her own code of honor and personal morality, which is often in conflict with what is mandated by her family. Still, despite her best intentions, Mary disappoints them, as her nature is not the kind that takes well to intrigue and manipulation, as she has sincere feelings of affection for the King, as well as for the Queen. After bearing the King two children, however, she is set aside by a formidable rival, her own sister, Anne, in whom the Boleyn family now place their hopes and ambitions.This is, first and foremost, the story of Mary Boleyn, a woman who has generally been reduced to a footnote in history. It is notable, however, that she was the only Boleyn sibling to survive the purges of the Tudor court and who, ultimately, married for love in an age when this was not the norm among those of her class. It is also the story of Anne Boleyn, her rise and fall, as seen through the eyes of her sister, Mary, with whom Anne was to have a lifelong rivalry.To a lesser degree, it is also the story of their brother, George, a more remote, though no less interesting, personage. His interjection into the story is necessary, as the author attempts to address the issue of incest that arose at the trial of George and Anne Boleyn. She gives quite an interesting perspective on the issue, weaving it, part and parcel, into the story in an effort to explain his downfall, as well his betrayal by his own wife.Told against the magnificent backdrop of the Tudor Court in all its splendor and majesty, the author weaves a complex tale of greed, ambition, sex, and political machination, as well as unparalleled intrigue, in sixteenth century England. Filled with well-fleshed characters taken right out of the annals of history, the story is one that is sure to delight all those with a love for well-written historical fiction. In particular, fans of beloved author, Jean Plaidy, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I remeber hearing briefly about Mary Boleyn when PBS did a documentary series on the six wives of Henry VIII, but I never knew much about her or King Henry's court. Gregory recreates court life in the 16th century, full of intrigue, lust, decadence, spying, and betrayal. Anne Boleyn is a household name, but who knows that her younger sister had two children by Henry VIII before he moved on to Anne? Let me not spoil the juicy experience for you. This was the first of Gregory's novels that I read. I have now finished five! I recommend them all highly, and in this order: The Other Boleyn Girl, The Boleyn Inheritance, The Queen's Fool, The Virgin's Lover, Earthly Joys. Enjoy! Kate"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I admit, at first I thought this book was a bit of fluff. I realized it wasn't when I found myself unable to leave the story to so much as eat. Don't give up if you've just begun, this book will take you on a ride of intrigue, scandal, ambition, lust, incest and greed. The writing seemed very simple to me, but the story was complex enough to fill in the gap. I loved reading about the Tudors and although I knew it wasn't entirely true, the story was entertaining & shocking enough to keep me reading until the last word.This story is told from Mary Boleyn's point of view and and tells the tale of the Boleyn family's ambition to get the to the top of the English crown, no matter what the cost...and oh what prices they pay! Mary was chosen by her family to put herself in the king's (Henry VIII) favor (mainly with sex) to rise to the top to benefit her family. Everything seemed to be going well for Mary until her highly ambitious and beautiful sister Anne came to court and stole all of her thunder and did whatever it took her to get what she wanted, and more. In the king's quest for an heir, a son, he leads the country to the height of scandal by divorcing Queen Katherine, who is barren, to open the door for a new marriage...perhaps to a Boleyn.It's interesting to see the dynamic between Anne, Mary and their brother, George. Rivals from the crib, Anne and Mary were born to be in competition with eachother and were raised for the sole purpose of landing an advantagous marriage. Anne will stop at nothing to land a sucessful marriage to a duke and once that prospect is squashed she goes straight for the heart of the country...the king. She is a shameless, uncaring, evil, ambitious woman, but something about her makes you root for her, in a sick way. For years and years she stops at nothing to get what she wants, but the road she takes to get there is wrought with scandal that puts Anne and her family of unwilling supporters in grave danger.If you want an engaging read, this is it. How many times did I say the word scandalous in this review? A bunch? That's because it is! Read it, you won't regret it. Also, I think thay are making a movie that is to come out this winter. It's a great time to take in the book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is an amazing historical fiction about Mary, the sister of Anne Boleyn. The historical details make you feel as if you are really there. It seems to be very historically accurate as well. I mostly enjoyed reading it... except that after a while the politically charged, cruel, and sometimes evil feel of the life at Henry the VIII's court can be smothering. Towards the end I just wanted to be done with it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"First, I loved this book. It was very intriguing and difficult to put down. Second, I read reviews by people who hated this book because of it's historical inaccuracies. Well, that's why it's called FICTION!! It's not like the author is trying to pass this off as a biography. Read the wikipedia entries on Anne and Mary Boleyn to get a general idea of the historial facts, and then just enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Henry the VIII stuff is my favorite. I even know the rhyme to remember his wives' fates: divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived. This book was fascinating to me -- I knew Anne Boleyn's sister had an affair with Henry and a child, but that was all I knew.Great read! thanks to Phillipa Gregory -- now I'm going to choose one of her other books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"While everyone knows the story of Anne Boleyn and how she was beheaded by Henry VIII after he divorced his long-time wife, Katharine of Aragon, this book tells the story from her sister's point of view - very different from other books on this subject. Other reviews have included more details concerning the story so I will not include them here. This was a very entertaining portrait of a tumultuous time in England's history (certainly certain portions were fictionalized) but I found it a fascinating story that I did not want to put down until I finished it. And I promptly ordered other books by this author on this same era."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The book was an enjoyable historical novel with much intrigue. the book was more descriptive than I care for in the \\"keeping Henry interested seqence\\" although, it certainly spoke is it or isn't it sex \\"with that woman\\" issue.I guess persons in high places can in truth or fiction have \\"flexible\\" standards."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What a fantastic read!!! Guaranteed you will love this one!!Great insight into the life of King Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really appreciate a book, especially historical fiction, in which an author painstakingly researches the material. You could tell by the writing of Philippa Gregory that she is an expert when it comes to the matters of King Henry VIII and his court. This expertise of the author makes the story much more enjoyable and believable. Her writing and descriptions in this book are incredible. She definitely has a grasp of the English language. You will understand what I mean when you read this book.This is definitely a \\"chick book\\" but I read it anyway because I enjoy history and stories of the kings and queens of Europe. I have to admit that I was never once bored with this book throughout the entire 661 pages. The story moved fast and the events took place one right after the other. The cool thing was that I really had feelings for the characters which is always important to me when I read a book. In this book I felt for the characters, some I loved and some I despised. And I found them believable as well.There are plenty of other great reviews on here that can tell you what this book is specifically about, but in one sentence it is simply a book about two sisters competing for the love of the king. I am very surprised to have liked it as much as I did.A quick warning to parents who may be deciding if there kids or young teenagers can read this book: there are some very graphic sexual depictions in this book. I would read it prior to them to decide."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This time Ms Gregory chose a truly unusual viewpoint to give us of an otherwise so famaliar time in English history. Mary Boleyn is ths sister only briefly mentioned, and usually unflatterigly, in most historical references as a preface to Anne's story. But Mary's story is perhaps the better one afterall and this book gives us that is the best possible way, written by the best possible author of historical fiction today. You won't be dissappointed by this read if you are a Philippa Gregory fan. And if you haven't yet been introduced to her but enjoy history this is the book to start acquainting yourself with her delightful span of work. You won't regret it, I promise."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"For over a year this book has appeared on my screen as a recommendation and no amount of correspondence can get rid of it. I finally decided to buy it and donate it to Goodwill. Then, I thought maybe an honest review would get the thing off my screen. I found a used copy and hated it at less cost. It is not an historical novel, it is a romance in an historical setting - like a Disney cartoon treatment of Pocahontas."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As long as you aren't looking for total historical accuracy, this is a diverting vacation read. Whether Philippa Gregory has done research into life in Tudor England to come up with some of the minutiae of day-to-day life or not remains to be seen. Much of the events and mores play as true or plausible, but others (such as reference to a \\"necessary room\\" right alongside references to \\"piss pots\\") seem anachronistic.My beef with this book is that some of the dialogue is appallingly clunky. At times it's like having rocks just jump off the page and hit you in the face. Gregory is a compelling writer, rather than a good one, which means that she sells books, but you're not going to come away with it thinking you've just read a gift to the English language. Love is a very complex thing, and much of what Gregory writes of Mary Boleyn's feelings plays as if it could have walked in from any other chick novel. Perhaps this is what most women want to read, but for all that I couldn't put it down, I felt frustrated. There is an excellent book here screaming to get out, but Gregory just isn't up to the job. At best, a guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you are looking for a light diverting read, this is it. If you are looking for historical fact about the lives of the Boleyns, this is most assuredly NOT it.It's not history, nor is it great literature, but I don't really think it's meant to be either. I recommend it only if you understand what you're getting yourself into; otherwise, you will be bitterly disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I never really was all that interested in the whole Henry VIII thing but I was given this book and just started reading the first couple of pages. It really has a way of engaging you from the start. In the beginning Mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play. You follow her along with her exciting life, and just when things start to cool off for her, you become fixed on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have long been fascinated by English history and have read various books about monarchs by assorted authors. This was definitely the easiest, and most entertaining read. But be warned..if you're looking for accurate history, this is not the place to turn. Basically, The Other Boleyn Girl is a NOVEL based on a handful of facts on Mary Boleyn. It was written to entertain, not educate. No one knows a whole lot about Mary, but the story is a wonderful tale of finding oneself and true love. My main complaint is the sexual content. Of course, a story about the king's mistress is not going to be completely innocent, but there was a lot of dialogue and descriptions that could have been left out. It's a good story, but a dirty one so be careful who you give this to."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Being a beautiful young woman of 14, Mary Boleyn dazzles all who meet her, including the most powerful man of all, King Henry the VIII. Henry quickly falls in love with her and she loves him as well. Mary takes the role of mistress and unofficial queen. The only problem of her status is that her sister, Anne Boleyn starts to become jealous of her and her relationship with Henry. When Mary bears her 2nd child to Henry, Anne whisks Henry's heart away from Mary, and towards herself. After years of dilema, Anne takes the previous queen's place who both Mary and Anne served as lady in waiting to. When Anne becomes queen, she has to bear Henry a son. Mary is jealous but at the same time, feeling that she has more freedom and then she goes to marry a handsome man without any rank. Mary bears her husband, William Stafford a daughter. Many other dilemas come up including the fact that Anne could not bear Henry a son.There are other parts in this story that I have not included, but the story is near 700 pages long so it would take a while to write a good summary of the story. Don't let the 700 pages convince you not to read the story because every page gets more and more exciting. This is my favorite book in the world and a definate must for your bookshelf! Read it! I promise you'll agree with my opinion!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Personally, I think the story of the Boleyn girls and Henry VIII is dramatic enough on its own and doesn't require the added fictionalized details to make the story better, but this was still an interesting book.I agree with the another reviewer who remarked that if you take away the Tudor setting, Gregory is not all that different from your standard romance novelist. Mary was an interesting choice as narrator, but too many times I found myself wanting to smack her for her behavior. Somewhere around mid-book, she evolves into some sort of beloved saint; whether that's true or not, I don't know, but it didn't endear Mary the character to me. Anne, originally a complex and flawed woman becomes a shrieking cariacature by the book's end. When she finally loses her head, it's almost anti-climactic. Given her portrayal, you want something worse to happen.Aside from the birth order debate, there are some other small inconsistencies, like the spelling of Mary's daughter's name and the ambiguity surrounding her son's parentage and where he ends up. Would Henry VIII really allow his second son to just trot off to a farm with another man playing daddy? It was a point that bothered me throughout this book; Henry was desperate for sons and I found his complete dismissal of Mary's son to be odd.Historically, Mary did marry William for love and they did go on to live relatively happily ever after. Sadly, for me, Gregory lapsed back into romance novel-speak in that last part of the book. The language was so flowery, the situations so improbable that I had a hard time finishing this book. There was no evidence that I've ever read that Catherine/Katherine was present with Anne at her beheading, and the notion that some guy on the street would be allowed up on the scaffold to haul one of the ladies in waiting away was simply ridiculous. The story could have been told just as dramatically without those devices.All in all, this is a very good book and full enough of historical accuracy that I'd recommend it on that basis alone. I would, however, also recommend one of the excellent non-fiction books on Henry VIII and his wives as an accompaniment to put some of the events of this story into true perspective (Alison Weir's book is especially good and easy to read)."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A fantastically written look into a less-developed side of the Henry VIII saga. Virtually everyone is familiar with Anne Boleyn, the first wife of Henry VIII to be decapitated. However, few people are familiar with her sister, Mary Boleyn. The novel is based on historical events, but is historical fiction. It is a brilliantly imagined work that delves into the darker side of the Boleyn family and their quest for power at all costs.Philippa Gregory is a gifted story-teller with a flourishing imagination. I devoured this 600-odd page novel in a matter of hours. I would highly recommend this book to anyone curious about this time period.Her writing is fulfilling, keeping you guessing at every turn. It is amazing that she is able to keep the reader so intrigued when one can be fairly certain how events will unfold. (But you may be surprised!)Pick this novel up and you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Think your problems are bad? Not after you read this great written tale of all the women around Henry VIII. This guy got around and who can blame him? There were so many families pushing their daughters toward the \\"favor of the king\\" that his head must have spun.This book offers surprise, intrigue and even a little sex and romance without clouding the story. All in all, great book! And the best part is that the story continues with Gregory's intense writing for a few more generations."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Maybe the historical errors were intentional but they really ruined my enjoyment of the book. Mary was the eldest sister and she also went to France and was well known for her promiscuous behaviour there. I also found the way the characters of Mary and Anne were portrayed unsubtle. However, it was entertaining if you forgive the errors and well written.If you want to read a good, well-grounded, _human_ portrayal of Anne then read 'The Concubine' by Norah Lofts. It's old, and you may have to hunt in 2nd hand bookstores but it's a great read and makes me cry everytime."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"After reading Gregory's The Other Boleyn Girl I became almost obsessed with the Tudor period in England and it aroused an even greater interest in English history than I had held before.The novel is told from the point of view of Mary Boleyn, sister of Henry VIII's second queen, the infamous Anne Boleyn (Mary herself was one of Henry's many discarded mistresses). Gregory's book is both moving and poignant and possesses a great wealth of historical detail and research, while at the same time being totally engrossing. Some of the historical events, such as Anne's erratic behavior and borderline incestuous relationship with her brother George, are slightly exaggerated. In actuality, Anne's charge of incest with her brother was basically brought on to blacken her name and damage her reputation beyond repair. One must remember that Anne was deeply hated by the English people and her name has been greatly slandered, mainly because of her haughtiness and overconfidence. However, this version of Anne is still great fun to read.Through Mary's eyes readers are given a first-class seat into the world of Tudor politics and court intrigues. The ride is truly magnificent and I heartily recommend The Other Boleyn Girl to all book lovers. It is somewhat lengthy, but the chapters fly by as you are immersed into the sixteenth century court.This is Gregory's best effort out of all of her Tudor-themed books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Such a wonderful novel finely woven into the already exciting British history. I devoured this 700 page book and moved on to THE QUEENS FOOL. Gregory does a great job captivating her readers and leaves them wanting more."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was the best book I've read in a while. I've read all three books in the series and this is definetly the best!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read \\"The other Boleyn girl\\" within a few days. The story was well told and well paced, and I like the way the main character develops. I have read a few history books about this period in English history, and thought the historical facts were pretty accurate. The historical figures really come to life in the novel.I'm subtracting one star because I found the development of Anne's character somewhat one-dimensional, turning the character almost into a caricature. It's hard to believe that any sisterly love could still have survived in view of such ruthlessness."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is probably one of the best if not the best historical book I have ever read. I study Art, and have been through many history books and novels, but never have I read one that was so captivating. It takes you right to the Tudor era, where you see everything vivdly in your head, the places, the castles, the people, even the outskirts of London City.The story revolves around Mary and Anne Boleyn (Daughters of Elizabeth Howard). Mary beacme King Henry's mistress under the influence of her family, and was in the courts favor for some time, while Anne , her sister, overshadowed Mary by marrying King Henry and becoming Queen.The book is a mixture of a lot of things, drama, romance, politics, history, that when you've finished reading it, you'll know a lot more about the Tudor age, courts in the 16th century, the King and some of his wives...The close connection and rivarly between Anne and Mary, is astonishing, you'll cry with them, laugh with them, feel happy for them, and sometimes sorry. The story is narrated by Mary Boleyn, which gives a nice change, since most books on this particualr period are from Anne's point of view. Gregory goes into so much depth and detail that the books you read after this one will seem to lack them. It's one of those books, that you can't stop thinking about it till you've finished it, and will probably think about it after it too. I also recommend reading The Queen's Fool, and the Virgin's Lover, after this one, as they are basically sequential.A great read, a great subject, and only a great author could have wrote it. This book is a winner."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Took this book on vacation and couldn't put it down. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a book to escape into and enjoy until the very last page. When you put it down, you will experience that familiar sense of loss that you get when a great story is finished. It is full of complex characters and family intrigue. The characters are well-crafted and defined; their inner conflict is believable. This is historic romance at its best, and I urge you to spend a few dollars to experience the pleasure of escaping into the inner landscape of a jilted woman in King Henry's court. I give this 4 stars rather than 5 stars because it does not contain the absolute accuracy of that era- but being in the historic romance genre, such authenticity would probably impair the page-turning quality of the book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It is my understanding that this is a work of fiction, based on historical events. As such, it is a wonderful book that left me thinking about the characters and the era for days.It also left me with questions about the historical record such as 'How did the Church of England really form?' and 'Is Mary a historical figure and if so, were two of her children Henry's?' 'What happened to them?' 'How did Elizabeth become Queen?'I will grant you that I am completely ignorant of the subject. However, it is my opinion that this genre should leave you wondering what the truth really is so that you can investigate the history in a non-fiction environment. I fully intend to follow up to learn the facts as they are currently known."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Really, I have never read a book faster. The flow, the characters, the descriptions, eveyrthing was written perfectly for this work of FICTION. Yes, some of the facts can be speculated but nothing was none for sure anyway! People are disputing tiny details of 16th century Europe instead of concentrating on the personal and heartwrenching struggle of these characters, particuraly Mary. I loved it anyway.. and I just picked up The Queen's Fool to read too."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is definently an absorbing read, one that I just could not put down.I have read this book many times, and just loved it.After reading this book I developed a hunger to learn more about tudor history.This is definently phillipa gregorys best work yet.If you love tudor history you will love this book, and even if you know nothing of tudor history you will still love this book, its just that good."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is an absolutely fascinating look at a different angle of the Anne Boleyn story. This was the book that got me hooked and learning all I could about this period of time in the court of Henry VIII. Even if you are not particularly interested in the Tudor court, you won't be able to help loving this book. It weaves an amazing tale from the eye's of Anne Boleyn's elder sister Mary, mistress to the King long before Anne ever entered the picture. This young woman who might have been Queen had to deal with more than we could ever imagine - forced to the King's bed by her over-ambitious family, then forced right back out by her younger sister, who proved too ambitious for her own good. This book is hard to find in stores - save yourself the trouble and pick it up here. You won't be sorry!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Despite being unbelievably busy and distracted, I finished this 650+ page novel in one week. I found myself carrying the book into the grocery store and everywhere else just in case I got the off chance to read it for even a minute. The characters permeated my mind and the story stayed with me everywhere I was. I couldn't wait for the next moment to see what would happen and where Ms. Gregory would take me next. After I completed the novel, I began to research the characters and the time and was blown away by the level of accuracy and detail that went into the historical aspect. Right down to the summer of the sweating sickness, Ms. Gregory tied in the known history on every page. Her use of recent theories and assumptions seem to flow right from the truth. I'm not sure how any novel of the Tudor dynasty will match this one. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I do agree with some of the other reviews that the book could have been shorter. At times it is redundant, but it is never slow, so once you get past that, it is a good read. Gregory does a good job of describing the court life of Henry VIII and his first two queens. I thought the particular aspects of the Boleyn family that were brought in and played up were interesting, and bolstered Gregory's story, although some of these things were slightly changed from their (traditional) historic truth by the author to fit her tale. Hearing the tale of Anne Boleyn from her sister's point of view was fascinating, and highlights the tragedies that played out in the game for the throne."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"When I was younger I loved reading fantasy, as I grew older I lost interest in it. My friend recommended me this book, and I instantly fell in love with it. It's so easy not to want to put the book down. Gregory brings you into a world and into the lives of the characters she creates. She seems to know what a good novel is about; telling a story, and an engrossing one at that. It is not a boring story about re-evaluating one self or coming of age. It is a wonderful tale that Gregory weaves superbly. I finished the book today, and now I don't know what to do with myself. Actually, I think I'll read it again."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This review is short and sweet.I couldn't wait each day for my coffee and lunch breaks to escape to 16th century England.My coworkers accused me of being anti-social!I have been a Tudormaniac for more years than I care to admit to and this book just enthralled me. It was so fresh,telling the same old story from a new perspective.I think it would make a great movie."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"That much said, you have to remember that this IS a fictional account. There are some inaccuracies, as far as my own research goes (I don't profess to be an authority on the subject), but for the most part I did enjoy the book. It was well written, and had very vivid imagery. Even if the book isn't completely historically accurate, it was well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Mary Boleyn's story is often told as a postscript to her more illustrious sister's biography. In The Other Boleyn Girl, she is the narrator who offers insight into the often cruel intrigues of the court of Henry VIII. This historical novel takes us from the days Mary is a teenaged bride of William Carey to the time of the execution of her sister, Anne Boleyn in 1536.It is fiction and historians may differ with some of the allegations presented. For instance, some historians say that William Carey rather than Henry VIII was the father of Mary's two children Catherine and Henry. The reasoning: Henry VIII would have openly recognized his children, particulary Mary's son, had he been the father. Bessie Blount's son by Henry VIII, was named Duke of Richmond If Henry had thought Henry Carey was his son titles would have been given to him. Anyway, the parentage of Mary's children has been in dispute for centuries. Most, if not all historians, believe that Henry's charges against Anne were fabricated so he could remarry and have a male heir, which Anne did not give him. Plus he had tired of Anne by this time. It is extremely doubtful that Anne Boleyn cheated on Henry VIII and the thought of an incestuous relationship with her brother (even though this was a charge) was very, very far-fetched.The Other Boleyn Girl introduces protagonists Henry VIII, his wife Katharine of Aragon, Cardinal Wolsey, Henry Percy (Anne Boleyn's early suitor), and Jane Seymour. Mary Boleyn often had to play the role of pawn in her families' ambitions, even though she had a conscience about what was going on. For instance, Mary sympathized with the rejected Queen Katharine, but still had to work against her.I enjoyed this book immensely even though I disagree with some of the allegations (after all it is fiction) and Mary Boleyn seemed like a very real person. Those who enjoy this book might want to read the fiction: The Diary of Anne Boleyn and My Enemy the Queen (about Mary's granddaughter Lettice, who was mother of the infamous Earl of Essex)."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century, not remotely 16th century. Nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the Boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically. The author's choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator (Mary in her early teens) and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself, but was clulmsy in execution. She seems altogether too dense for too long, and even after she's much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her \\"cotton head\\". There's no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous. If this is the only book at hand on that subject, grab it and skim."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I recently purchased this book and I immediately fell in love with Mary Boleyn.

So all and all this book is totaly worth your time"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is the first one I've read in years that I simply couldn't put down once I began. I spent nearly a week hardly sleeping because I couldn't bear to turn out the lights and put this book down. In Mary Boleyn, Philippa Gregory has created a marvelous heroine in what is partially a coming-of-age story, in addition to giving us a prism through which to view the details of a scandalous romance that still captivates after all these centuries.Watching Anne Boleyn's story unfold is to watch one woman forever alter the course of history, helping King Henry VIII usher in reform of the Catholic church and change the policies of England in ways that echo their repercussions even today. I don't think it's a stretch to say that without Anne, the U.S. might not even exist. Think about it.The bottom line, however, is that this book is well worth reading -- especially if you intend to see the movie version coming out in November. Allowing us to discover \\"The other Boleyn girl\\", the one history never remembered, is a glorious treat indeed, and Miss. Gregory deserves to be commended, both for the originality of her idea and her writing itself. It's a must read for any fan of historical fiction and I guarantee that once you begin it, you won't be able to put it down. I read it twice within one month of owning it, and it is definitely the best book I've read in a long, long time."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I haven't enjoyed a Henry V III storyline this much since Anne of the Thousand Days! One of Gregory's best in my opinion. Not as much of the mystical as is her norm and I think the book is better for it. Pretty accurate historically too, for a novel."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is told in the first person narrative of Mary Boleyn. It is a fictional account of the life and times of the monarchy during the reign of Henry VIII.Anne is power hungry and beautiful but her true character, as revealed by Ms. Gregory, portrays a woman who is willing to do anything to be Queen, an ugly interior masked by a pretty face. As we all know, her quest for this power cost her everything in the end.Mary is the softer side of this family. She comes across as more or less innocent in the ways of the court and eventually decides to follow her own heart instead of the path intended for her by her incredibly controlling family.The rivalry between the sisters is felt continuously throughout the story. The parents and the girls uncle use the sisters for their own greed in their constant seeking of social stature and of course, political gain. The treatment and the role of women in this society is well written about here. The story telling and characterization are superb.Read this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Amazon recommended this book to me based on other purchases, and I'm so glad they did! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I read this book immediately after finishing \\"I, Elizabeth,\\" and thought that going from that point of view into a new one would be jarring, but I fell smoothly into Mary's story and loved every minute of it.The book could easily have romanticized the story of Mary Boleyn and her affair with the king, but instead shows a very realistic picture---there is love there, but there is also deceit, manipulation, and betrayal. Anne Boleyn is not just a {prostitue} who displaced a queen, but a real person who in the end falls prey to her own overpowering ambitions. Even Henry has his gentle side, and isn't portrayed solely as a tyrant who likes shedding wives. There are tender moments, and then there are scenes that will make you shudder and be very glad you're not a woman living during the reign of Henry VIII.I did find the ending to be a little abrupt; Mary is at court with her husband and children, trying in her own way to help Anne. She witnesses Anne's execution (thinking all the while that Henry will pardon her at the last, dramatic moment), leaves with her husband and children to go home, and there the book ends. After getting to know Mary so intimately through out the rest of the book, I would have liked more of a reaction to Anne's death and the aftermath. Since most people are familiar with Anne rather than Mary, though, I suppose it made sense to end the book there. I was so immersed in the story, though, that I could have happily read about Mary's adventures for the rest of her life, even if she never went near royalty again."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I wish I'd read the bad reviews first, because they're all correct. This is a dreadful book, the kind you keep reading because you hope it'll get better. It never did, and now I have lost too much time to Ms. Gregory's desperate attempt at telling a story. Inaccurate, tedious, padded, silly."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I did not like this book at all. In fact, I left it behind in a hotel in Britain hoping that someone else might find it more entertaining than I."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This well-known author of historical fiction has outdone herself with this rich and absorbing tale of the notorious Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary. The Tudor court, with all its pomp and intrigue, is seen through the eyes of the beautiful Mary Boleyn, who at the age of fourteen arrives at court and becomes lady-in-waiting to Katherine of Aragon, Queen of England and wife to King Henry VIII. Although already married to courtier William Carey, Mary captures the heart of King Henry VIII, whose roving eyes land on this innocent young miss.In the eyes of the grasping and greedy Boleyn family, Mary is but the fatted calf through whom their ambitions, they believe, will become realized. So, they offer her up as a sacrifice to their ruthless ambition. Forced to separate from her husband in order to become the King's mistress, Mary betrays the Queen and becomes mistress to the King, all at the behest of her family. Every step of her affair is choreographed from the wings by her family, with the adept aid of her sly and clever sister, Anne, in the role of chief manipulator.Mary struggles with her own code of honor and personal morality, which is often in conflict with what is mandated by her family. Still, despite her best intentions, Mary disappoints them, as her nature is not the kind that takes well to intrigue and manipulation. She the temerity to have sincere feelings of affection for the King, as well as for the Queen. After bearing the King two children, however, she is set aside by a formidable rival, her own sister, Anne, in whom the Boleyn family now place their hopes and ambitions.This is, first and foremost, the story of Mary Boleyn, a woman who has generally been reduced to a footnote in history. It is notable, however, that she was the only Boleyn sibling to survive the purges of the Tudor court and who, ultimately, married for love in an age when this was not the norm among those of her class. It is also the story of Anne Boleyn, her rise and fall, as seen through the eyes of her sister, Mary, with whom Anne was to have a lifelong rivalry.To a lesser degree, it is also the story of their brother, George, a more remote, though no less interesting, personage. His interjection into the story is necessary, as the author attempts to address the issue of incest that arose at the trial of George and Anne Boleyn. She gives quite an interesting perspective on the issue, weaving it, part and parcel, into the story in an effort to explain his downfall, as well his betrayal by his own wife.Told against the magnificent backdrop of the Tudor Court in all its splendor and majesty, the author weaves a complex tale of greed, ambition, sex, and political machination, as well as unparalleled intrigue, in sixteenth century England. Filled with well-fleshed characters taken right out of the annals of history, the story is one that is sure to delight all those with a love for well-written historical fiction. In particular, fans of beloved author, Jean Plaidy, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This story was an above all thrill! It captivates your imagination and takes you back to the days at the Englishg courts where King Henry the VIII rules and the Boleyn girls play a game of ambition,love, and desire for the throne.The narrator of the novel is the young Boleyn girl, named Mary, whom immediately catches the wandering eyes of a king, desperate for an heir, as soon as she arrives to court.With its twists and sudden turns the plot thickens ever so deep as soon as Mary is bumped out of the Kings vision and is replaced with Mary's older sister, Anne.Now that each sister clearly is envious of the other and that the desperate Boleyn family desires at least one of their daughters to assume the throne as soon as Queen Katherine, Henry's wife, croaks, the powerful Uncle of Mary and Anne blatantly decides Mary and Anne's fate for them.Mary, becoming quite lonely, for her family's attention is set upon Anne's happiness, falls in love with a man, named William, who is a mere servant for her Uncle, but she follows her heart for the first time in her life and marries whom she really loves despite the consequences and the wrath of her sister, Anne.It is quite clearly the story about Anne's rise and her sad and unexpected fall through the eyes of her sister Mary. And it shows the importance of family, for even though they grow terse and cruel towards each other, they are always there for one another when in need.With all this stories strong points the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it gets a bit frustrating while reading it. Not because it's a hard read, far from it, but because poor Mary never stands up for herself and lets herself get beat up, verbally, by her Uncle, Mother, Father, Sister, Bother, and King. You just want to reach into the book and slap some sense into her! I EXTREMELY suggest that you go out and get yourself a copy, it is truely a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I see from the other reviews here that I will be in the minority, but this may be the most moronic book I have ever read. If you care anything about history, avoid this book at all costs. Frankly, if you have any self-respect at all, avoid this book. I doubt my opinion will change the Cult of Philippa Gregory, but I feel compelled, by the very awfulness of this book, to speak my mind. It's no more than a jazzed-up Harlequin Romance with a few historical references thrown in for kicks. Absurdity on every page and an insult to anyone of intelligence."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I read this book when it first came out. I've always been a huge Henry VIII buff and my favorite wife of his is Anne Boleyn. Needless to say, I was quite excited to read it. And then... disappointment. It is entertaining to an extent, but if you know a lot about what is going on, and see how Gregory has totally butchered the historical facts, it is no longer entertaining. There are so many historically incorrect moments in here I cannot name them all. Some examples, though, is that in the very beginning of the book, began in the year 1521, we find out Mary is only thirteen years old. WHAT?! In reality, Mary had been born before the 1500s even began! At the latest, 1499. She would have already been in her mid-twenties and already married and already having borne the king's illegitimate kids! Also, Mary is the youngest in the book, when in reality she was most likely the oldest with Anne being the youngest, George in between. Also, there is no mention of Mary's having been Francis' mistress in France before she returned to England. In the book, Mary's son Henry is \\"stolen\\" by Queen Anne (which is ridiculous). In the book, Anne and George have sex and conceive a deformed baby, which 1) they never had sex. 2) Anne never gave birth to a deformed baby. She had Elizabeth and then had miscarriages which were BARELY developed enough to tell the sex of the child. I was extremely disappointed with the blatant misuse of historical facts. When you read this, just remember, it is historical FICTION. Please do not take anything in this book as the actual historical facts because chances are, they aren't. But it's nice to see that Gregory, an acclaimed historical author, took such a royal dump on Mary Boleyn and her story."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Now, before anyone jumps down my throat for giving this book a poor rating I want to say from the start that I realized it was a novel and also a fictitious one at that. I mean, it says \\"A Novel\\" and \\"FICTION\\" on the cover so it's pretty tough to not realize that this is a book that is based very loosely around real events.Since that is out of the way I can go on to say that the book was, truly, based on real events. It spans the years of 1521 to 1536 during the reign of King Henry VIII and as we know he went through wives like he went through underwear. The most controversial of which was the transition from Queen Katherine to Queen Anne who is one of the Boleyn Girls. If you even know the briefest of histories of this world you most likely know this so I'm not giving anything away. It starts, however, as Henry's eyes drift from his first Queen to that of Mary Boleyn, sister to Anne and George. This is where the story's perspective comes from. Mary is a bit of an odd duck for the time period and for the setting of the court. She likes nature, doesn't mind acquiring a tan, hard work, and is repulsed by gossip. However, she has been trained from the age of four to be a courtier and so she leads a double life of superior elegance and quality in the court while secretly hungering to flee from it to chase what it's like outside of the walls of castles.She will be continuously accused of not having \\"ambition\\" from her family while Anne has absolutely all of it and George rides a fine line between being like Mary and being like Anne. A sense of duality and opposites exists in the sisters which drives the story forward in an intricate web of family ties, devotion, self-assertion, dominance, and greed. Scandal gets interwoven along with a great deal of politics which doesn't weigh the book down, thankfully. This is the reason it has three stars.The reason two aren't filled in with color is because the book is terribly dull for several hundred pages. The book itself is too long and it seems like there's a regurgitation of the same old spiel which doesn't make you feel for Mary and her wish to live in the countryside, but rather to close the book and never open it again. When it finally does start getting good it doesn't exactly exceed expectations. You would think scandal, threat of death, love, passion, and greed would powerhouse a novel, but in this case it doesn't. The most feeling I got for any of the characters was the way that women were treated--like chattel property--but that's all. The novel has enormous potential, but it can't rise to the occasion on poorly written mechanics and drab hints of such incredibly useful storytelling techniques that are never actually grasped.Perhaps if the book was shorter it would be more enjoyable, but it isn't, so be prepared for a long haul of a lot of characters running around, secrets not being told, pregnancies, bland love affairs, and familial relations in a Renaissance England."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"As a buff of Tudor history, I was shocked from the first page how incorrect the information was. Mary was not 13 or 14 when she became the mistress of Henry VIII - and, accepted historical information indicates that Mary was the OLDER sister, not the younger. What happened to the years spent in France and her being mistress to the King of France? Needless to say, just the first few pages frustrated me so badly that I ceased reading the book and shall not bother finishing it. This author has done a better job following historical information in some of her other books - I just can't imagine what happened here. And now, to think that the movie will project this information to people - but then, if they're not history buffs, they won't know any difference. It's like the cable series about The Tudors and the actor portraying Henry VIII is a scrawny little man instead of someone over 6 feet tall and well built! Oh well - Anyway, I would not recommend this book to anyone for any reason."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The story of King Henry VIII and his six wives is almost common knowledge. Among those six lucky ladies there was Anne Boleyn. She was Henry's second wife. A lot is known about Anne but there is not much talk of her little sister, Mary Boleyn. The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory is a story about Anne's sister Mary. In this novel Gregory shows the bitter sibling rivalry that is aided by their cruel families in order to raise their status within Henry's court.The story starts in the spring of 1521 in London at the Tower where the young Mary, at the young age of thirteen, watches as her uncle is beheaded. Mary was married at the age of twelve to William Carey, and then started her career in the Tudor court at this young age. This pretty young girl caught the roving eye of the young king at fourteen. At this point Mary lives at court with her husband, but relies greatly on her family, especially her sophisticated sister Anne, with whom she always has a rivalry, and her kindly but somewhat secretive brother George. She is ordered by her family to become his mistress which soon becomes tricky business because she is young, nave, and worries of the Queen's, whom she greatly respects, feelings. Also, she ends up falling in love with the King. Eventually she does become his mistress, which gave her a lot of joy. She will give Henry both a daughter and a son during their love affair. During her second pregnancy, Henry's eyes begin to wander to other woman. The Boleyns are very intent on keeping Henry's eyes on only woman within their family, so they put Anne in charge of keeping Henry's interest on her. Henry soon forgets Mary, and Mary is content with her children and would be happy to spend the rest of her days with her children living is at their family estate in Hever. But the manipulative Anne would not let Mary leave her side while she was in Henry's favor. Anne callously keeps Mary from her children and eventually adopts Mary's son as her own, taking him from his mother. Anne does this after her marriage to Henry when she begins to fear that she will never give the king what her sister had given him, which was the son he desired. The rest of the story to Anne's marriage to Henry VIII is well known to most. What is important in this novel is that Mary is the only sibling to escape from a tragic ending.Mary and Anne lived their lives in a constant rivalry between one another. Mary worries in the beginning that Anne would have a better marriage then her own and secretly wishes Anne's boat would sink while she is returning from France. The family fuels this rivalry, and when Mary has the favor of the king Anne was ordered to help Mary in every way to keep Henry's attention on Mary. Mary, while not as ambitious as her sister, liked having Anne as second best. It gave Mary pleasure to see her sister in her old dresses while she wore new ones given to her by the king. However, soon the fickle Henry's favor changes to Anne and Mary is put in the shadows. Mary now has to take the position of aiding Henry's favored girl, her sister, as their roles are reversed. Now the more powerful of the two sisters, Anne is a spiteful and hateful person. It gives Anne pleasure to order her sister around and to see her in pain. Although it may appear that Anne wins in their rivalry because she gains the title of Queen, in the end she is beheaded after three short years as Henry's wife. On the other hand Mary, while not Queen or Henry's wife, lives the life she always wanted in the country with her children.Mary's character is very different from Anne's ambitious nature. Mary is compassionate and was never aiming to gain money or power from her relationship with Henry. She did it all for her love of Henry. This shows the depth of her naivet&eacute;. She follows every order that her family gives her. Later in the book, after losing Henry's favor, Mary never expected Anne to take her children, even though it is obvious that Anne is an evil conniving person that would do anything for the crown. It is apparent that Anne and her brother George are having an incestuous relationship with each other in the story that Mary seems unaware of. Mary is even present in the room for a very un-sisterly/brotherly kiss that happened between the two. George and Mary were the true parents to the second deformed child that Anne borne but Mary never acknowledged the relationship. Also, the beginning of the book while witnessing her uncle's beheading, the young Mary kept waiting for the king to come and pardon him. She believed until the ax fell that the king would save him but he did not. Then, at the end, in the same place and situation, with her on the chopping block, she again believed that somehow her sister would be given a pardon from the king and saved. Yet again Mary is proven wrong and her sister is not saved. This shows that even after all these harsh years in court she is just as nave as she was from the beginning.This was a great book but if you are looking for something that is based on strict historical facts, then this is not the book for you. Although based on actual historical facts, this book is an entirely fictional story. It is an interesting story based on two sisters, one of whom is the Queen of England for a short time. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book to read, especially for those who like realistic, historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Well,actually this book is too much fun to qualify as a lesson. Instead,it's an engrossing,can't-put-it-down dealing with two sisters, Anne Boleyn and her lesser known sister,, Mary,whom King Henry the VIII had a relationship with (as well as fathering two of her children )before Lady Anne caught his eye. The book shows(in vivid detail) how Anne manages to get the notorious womanizer undivided attention,first by stealing him away from her more placid sister,then trying to get him to make her Queen,in spite of the Church,people's negative view of their marriage,her own highly outspoken nature,in a time where women had to know their place(or else).And, most importantly,not giving him a son,which leads to her tragic downfall. This book takes you on a journey,makes you think and best of all,is truly entertaining.."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Not only could I \\"not put it down,\\" I couldn't stop thinking about it. I was utterly lost in the world, the drama and the intrigue of these characters that I carried the book everywhere I went just in case I'd have a free second to delve back in. The characters of Mary and Anne Boelyn are so fascinating. You feel so sympathetic toward both despite Anne's cruel ambition and Mary's inclination to perpetually forgive her sister's terrible betrayals. Ultimately, the story is about two women who attempt different paths toward gaining freedom and independence as women both trapped in a man's world. It was just riveting. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Though many may view this as yet another sympathetic retelling of Anne Boleyn's rise and fall, one could not be more mistaken. Gregory (Virgin Earth), a noted historical novelist, tells the story instead through the eyes of Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister.Mary comes to court and captures the wandering eye of King Henry VIII, putting her marriage aside to become his mistress. All of this is prompted by her ambitious family, the Howards, led by her powerful uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Anne and their brother George play key roles in Mary's seduction of the king, each tutoring her in a different way.Eventually, Mary is put aside in favor of her sister, who will be content with nothing but the wife of Henry. As we watch Anne's tiring and sometimes frantic attempts to keep hold of fickle Henry for six years, we feel Mary's exasperation. Of course, we all know what happens now...Henry divorces Queen Katherine for Anne, Queen Anne gives birth to a daughter (the future Elizabeth I), and it all goes downhill from there. When Anne is put aside and executed, and Jane Seymour takes her place, Mary keeps her own head by denying her family and following her heart.Though the book has many inaccuracies, such as Mary was actually OLDER than Anne, whereas in this novel she is younger. Also, Mary's affair with King Francois of France is never actually mentioned. Aside from this, The Other Boleyn Girl is a wonderful retelling of the rise and fall of the Boleyn faction through the eyes of an unexpected heroine."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Not much has been written about Mary Boleyn. She was very young and married when Henry cast his eyes on her. She was then sent to court to be a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine. She was very fond of the Queen but had no choice when Henry wanted her to be his mistress.She had 2 children by him - first a girl and then a boy. While she was recovering from childbirth, Henry turned from her to her sister, Anne.In one of the unforgettable scenes in the book, the Boleyn family calmly discusses which sister should be the one for Henry. And when it is decided it should be Anne, Mary asks, \\"What shall I be?\\" and the answer from Anne: \\"You'll be my lady in waiting. You'll be the other Boleyn girl.\\"Mary always did as she was told but her real longing was to live a peaceful life in the country - far away from court - with her children. But once Anne became Henry's favorite, she controlled Mary and her children like pieces on a chessboard.Anne became very cruel. The Boleyn family was ruled by blind ambition and anything and everything they did was done to gain access to the throne. Mary was kept from her children and from the man she then fell in love with to serve Anne.One of the amazing things about Mary is she was the only one of her family who just wanted to be common. She managed to stay friends with Queen Katherine even when she had Henry's children. And when Anne and her family had completely lost favor with the King, Mary survived.An absolutely riveting book. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book could have benefited from a good editor. Following the story of Mary Boleyn, sister to the famous Anne, and their rivalry, it had great potential that was somewhat squandered by repetitious dialogue and prose. We were \\"told\\" more than \\"shown\\" the sisters' rivalry. After multiple pages of being beaten over the head with the words that they were jealous of each other and pawns in their family's machinations, I was longing for more action scenes. I also thought the love scenes read like a cheap romance novel, not something I expected for a piece of historical fiction. The last 50 pages of the book had some real suspense, but even this was diluted. Mary's daughter is taken by Anne to the Tower, where Anne awaits trial and execution, and Mary understandably fears for her. This interesting twist is diluted, however, by the assurances of Mary's husband that no harm will come to the girl. All the suspense thus escapes like a pricked balloon.I think a full two thirds of this book could have been cut and the rest reshaped, and it would have made a good story. As it is, I wouldn't pay money for it. I'd look for it in the library or borrow from someone."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Many many reviews have been posted, and I will attempt not to repeat what has been said already.I cannot comprehend the positive reviews of this trash. I am a lover of quality historical novels - Sharon Kay Penman and Jean Plaidy are mentioned by other reviewers ... Phillippa Gregory is in no way comparable. The Other Boleyn Girl is historical only in that it purports to take place a long time ago.Mary Boleyn is potrayed as THIRTEEN years old when she is engaging in witty repartee with king far too old and worldly to be legitimately interested in what she had to say. Indeed, in our world, Henry would have landed on a Nightline special. Well, we know what HE was interested in, but why would we, the reading public, want to read a novel romanticizing behavior which we claim to believe is criminal?And for some readon Gregory has chosen to distort history and represent Mary Boleyn as even younger than she probably was, and far more innocent. If we wonder why teenagers go on-line to flirt with and meet unknown older men, we need only look at is considered entertaining in a novel.The character of Anne is no more credible ... the author wold have us believe that powerful families intent on pimping a child to the king would listen to a 15-16 year old girls's advice on how to accomplish its plan.Overall, the characters are more Sex and the City (I can see Samantha as Anne)than history. I read this nonsense for far longer than I should have, waiting for improvement. Then I gave up. Now I am stuck with this book as well as the sequel (which I have no intention of reading). Both are destined for Half Price Books."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Terrible book. The inaccuracies of the book that other reviewers point out don't bother me so much. It is fiction. I am bothered by how the author writes and I felt zero interest in any of the characters. I read about 225 pages and had to stop. I just felt myself getting stupid with every page."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Recommended to me by my sister-in-law, this book is a departure from my normal choice of murder mystery, and Harry Potter, (I am 40)! But I bought it on her recommendation and just loved it. My first historical novel, around 700 pages and I read it in a week! I even became interested it the real people this book surrounds. You will not be disappointed, I loaned it to my mother and she read it in less time than I did. The follow up books The Queen's Fool and The Virgin Lover are also very good, but not quite as captivating as this one. Still good read's though. Enjoy this is a winner!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A Very good read. Kept me interested and entertained. If you like historical fiction as much as I do, than this is one of many that you'll enjoy."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a great book, and, as a newcomer to Mrs. Gregory, I was highly impressed. I recommend this book to anyone who is tired of hearing the surgarcoated Anne Boleyn story, and is ready to hear the real deal. Blunt and to the point, Phillipa Gregory weaves an awe-inspiring and seductive tale that is sure to please and amaze the reader. While many readers have said that her book is ill-researched, and so let me just make a few points:*For starters, no one really knows exactly how old Anne Boleyn was when she died, and just the same, no one knows who was the older of the siblings. It is actually more plausable that Anne was indeed the second sibling and older sister to Mary.*Many have also said that Anne was displayed as a seductive and destructive wench. Well, if she played so hard for 6 years to captivate the king, not to mention exiling Princess Mary and Henry Carey, and possibly killing many people and alienating others from the court, well, yeah, I have to say she must have been a big seductive and destructive wench."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a wonderful book, hard to put down. The author very effectively blends historical fact with her own imagination of characters' motives and feelings. Very well done and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book had the perfect combination of true facts and fiction to keep me interested and excited with every page. It is a TERRIFIC book for a book club. Everyone I know who read it LOVED it. I even gave up napping while my son was sleeping to read!! ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is one of the most wonderful books I've read in ages. I finished it in 2 days which is a record for me since I have so much going on at home on weekends. I just plopped myself on the couch and grabbed a blanket and didn't stop till I was done. I highly recommend for all who love the Tudors...this is one from a different perspective which puts a fresh spin on old information."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Very good story telling. The characters were very well drawn, and I found I was staying up until the wee hours to finish this one. It is the mark of a great story that makes me curse out loud at one of the characters. But Anne was so deliciously evil in this book, that I just couldn't help it. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I am more the romance genre reader but for some reason I kept picking up this book. I am glad I did. It was very interesting the roller coaster these characters lived on. In fact the story such a rollercoaster I couldn't put it down and I found myself speeding through the book as if I couldn't wait to read what happened in the end. Shockingly enough history did not change, but this author made you think the Queen actually had a shot. Good read!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is such an amazing book! I could not put it down once I started reading it. I know when I am reading a fantastic book when my mind is totally consumed by the plot at all times. I would be at work and thinking, &quot;what is going to happen next?&quot;, &quot;what will Anne and Mary do about this?&quot;. It got to be very distracting! Philippa Gregory is a hard working author who knows exactly how to describe long-ago people and places so that you can feel as if you are present in the story as well. I get very excited about engrossing books and I will stay up to all hours of the night in order to read more, but then I ususally end up very sad when the book is over. I feel as if I have lost some new and dearly loved friends. This book is well written and extremely entertaining. Don't let the length of the book put you off, it is such a quick read that you will not want it to end. Read this book for an insider's view of one of the most infamous historical time periods ever known. Good job Ms. Gregory, I will be reading more of your books in the future!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I lost this book after about the first 50 pages. I think that I did it on purpose. If I want to read fairy tales I will go back to the Brothers Grimm."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Maybe I know too much about Tudor England. The author's placing Anne as the eldest sibling bugged me right off the bat, as I'm almost positive most historians see her as the younger sister. Or, maybe I'm too big a fan of the fascinating Anne to buy anything from boring cow Mary's perspective, I don't know. All I know is, I've only read the first few pages and I'm bored and turned off by this book. I should want to read it. I bought it. But somehow, I just can't be bothered. I recently read a book about Frida Khalo written from her jealous sister's perspective, and it was [junk], so maybe it's bad vibes. Either way, this book isn't nearly as interseting as it's title would suggest."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have heard, seen, and read the story of anne boleyn a million times. I've heard it from a million different viewpoints, and each one is unique. I cannot put this book down. I know what happens in the end, but I'm still hoping that it turns out differently. Excellent for anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Normally I don't read historical fiction but that will all change now that I've finished reading this entertaining and exciting novel. I'm interested in reading some of Gregory's other works."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"A friend recommended this book a year ago. I wasn't interested in this era before and thought it might be a romance novel. I was wrong. Excellent book. I couldn't put it down. I read it in record time and then moved onto Boleyn Inheritance, Queen's Fool and Constant Princess. I would also like to thank the publisher for the excellent Kindle price ($7.99). The White Queen is waiting in the wings. Keep up the good work, Philippa!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I'm surprised how much I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. I'm a historical fiction junkie and this was one of the best for me. It has made me dive right into old English history again and I've ordered another Gregory book. I love her writing style!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is crown jewel of Mrs Gregory's historical fiction series. It manages to feel emotionally raw as well romantic and tastefully erotic. The three Boleyns are ripe with feelings and humanity. In it's base story is as tragic as lovely as Shakespeare Of course, judjing from a historical standpoint it may not be thoughly truthful but as a novel it is a lush, colorful, lustful and surprisingly dark saga."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I have to disagree with others who are disappointed in this book; I have found every one of Philippa Gregory's books well worth reading. I am aware they are fiction, and as in watching movies or television, we must be careful to not get \\"facts\\" from fictional portrayals. Having said that, these books are always a good read and make the characters come to life. A history student can, and should, look up more; the contrast between fiction and fact will prove an interesting study in itself. These books provide insight into historial times, even though fiction, that have inspired me to want to learn more about the \\"facts.\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"It is a very good historical fiction. Almost all based on true events.Very easy reading.Much better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down! It was so interesting, and I fell in love with Mary! She was a great character! It made me interested in the Tudor history and was entertaining as well!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I picked up \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" after loving \\"The Queen's Fool\\" and I was not disappointed. I found myself shirking all of my duties to stay in bed curled up with \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" I stayed up late into the night to follow the characters. Mary Boleyn was a wonderful character and her sister and brother no less fascinating. Gregory paints a vivid portrait of 16th century England and of Henry VIII's reign. History and fiction blend perfectly in her artful hands. You will not be able to put this down. You will not be able to get anything done while reading this book. Do not expect it to be as good as the film BECAUSE THE BOOK IS WAY BETTER!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"THe book is a really good historical fiction - the movie was very disappointing and did not follow the book at all!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book has truly been one of the best books I've ever read. It is fast paced with a well-woven suspenseful plot with twists and turns. The complexity of the character's emotions, especially Mary Boleyn as the 1st person narrator, is extraordinary. Mary pulls you into her life and into the inner workings of her family and life in Henry VIII's court. While the story may be fictional, many details are historically accurate. After finishing this book, I went on to read a biography of Anne Boleyn and one on Henry VIII. I can't say enough good things about The Other Boleyn Girl, though. I breezed through all 600 pages in a matter of days because it was just that good!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really liked this book. I found myself swept away in the moments. It was quick-paced and dramatic. With a long book like this, I usually find myself getting bored with the characters and I begin anticipating a quick wrap up. But, I found myself covering the bottom on the pages so I wouldn't skip to the bottom to find out quickly what had happened... I was savoring the drama. I just purchased my next book by the same author and I hope I get the same results."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Having Studied History in College and recently watched the film of \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", i was very impressed with the book and found it hard to put it down, it had very vivid images and one could almost imagine themselves in each scene looking on as the story unfolded. Very enjoyable read and gave a great insight into the the Boleyn's as a family."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I quite enjoyed this book, my first by Gregory. The way she tells the story, from the point of view of Mary, created an easy to follow flow throughout the book. I read it in 3 days, finding it impossible to put down. It was scandalous, heart-wrenching, and entertaining from start to finish. While I can't attest to the historical accuracy, I was looking for a good historical fiction novel and found it here."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I really enjoyed this book although you need to read some of the great biographies of Anne Boleyn to appreciate fact versus fiction in this fun read."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Philippa Gregory's series of the Tudors has become my most recent addiction. The Constant Princess, the Other Boleyn Girl, the Boleyn Inheritance, the Queen's Fool, and the Virgin's Lover were all page-turners from start to finish. She tells a different perspective on historical events and characters, and has turned me on to the historical fiction genre. I'm looking forward to reading some of her other series."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This a wonderful book writen to bring out the woman's version of the events of history! Henry's and Anne's court was truly filled with drama!It is so great to have woman write about strong women in history."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was a great page turner which kept me absorbed until the last page. Loved it and can;t wait for the movie!!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I must say, before reading this book, I was never interested in reading historical fiction of any sort (the only historical time period I was ever really fascinated with was Ancient Egypt) but after having failed to see the movie version of \\"the other boleyn girl\\" while it was in theatres, I decided to give the novel a chance, and I was glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed it, from minute to end. In fact, I couldn't put it down. Despite the novel being pretty lengthy, I finished it in two days.It gives a very detailed, fascinating glimpse of life at one of the most famous courts in history. Although yes, ill say it is very dramatic (pretty much an old-fashioned soap opera). Nonetheless, its beautifully written, so much so that you can feel yourself going back in time, and imagine yourself at the court, amongst the characters.Since reading this book, I have read several other novels having to do with this time period, a majority of them having to do with Anne Boleyn (one of the main characters in ths book). To me she is the most interesting of all the wives of King Henry VIII. Which leads me to the one thing I must say that I didn't like about this book....the way that Anne Boleyn was potrayed. But anyhow, I will let you decide your opinion of her yourself,and I recommend that everyone reads this book, regardless of whether or not your a fan of historical fiction.I also recomend that you read Philippa Gregorys other novels, especially \\"the boleyn inheritance\\" and \\"the queens fool\\""},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I was pleased to get this book so quickly. The cover was enticing and I dove right in. Wow! We think we have an open society concerning sexual matters...Sex and the City has got nothing on King Henry's court! This was an eye opener. When it comes to family empires the Trumps could take lessons from the Howards!! Get it read it, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful! I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was so interesting and informative. I learned a lot from this book. I would totally recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I purchased this book some years ago to read during a long car ride because the book was long, and I am a fan of historical fiction (and non-fiction too, for that matter.)I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well-written, engaging, reasonably fast-paced, and I didn't notice any jarring anachronisms or inaccuracies of the sort that usually ruin historical fiction. The story is interesting, to boot, although I was not especially gripped by the love-story aspect.Having not had the privilege yet of reading any Jean Plaidy, the closest author I can compare this to is Sharon Kay Penman, and I have to say that if you like Penman, Gregory's THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was picked for our book club to read. First sight of this book and I was thinking \\"Are they crazy?\\" 650+ pages? I work full time, raise a child . .when am I going to have time to read a book like this? I could not put this book down . . I truly ejoyed this book. This was not one of the usual type books I read . . . I wanted the story to continue (yes, after 650+ pages . . ). Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"At first I struggled with this book, wondering why am I reading about all these petty jealousies from an era long gone? But I am the way through it now and can't put it down! I wanted to know more about the family trees of the various characters in this book, mostly to see if any of Mary Boleyn's children may still have living descendents, particularly those she had with Henry VIII. I found this website:http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~jamesdow/s093/f002940.htmI followed the descendents of Mary's daughter with Henry VIII, Catherine Carey (they spell it with a \\"K\\") down though Lettice Knollys (Mary & Henry VIII's granddaughter), Dorothy Devereaux (great-granddaughter) etc., until 9 generations later there was Edmund the 8th Earl of Spenser, who happens to be the father of Diane Frances (Lady Spenser) who married none other than Charles, the Prince of Wales.Kinda makes you think about how history has a way of repeating itself. The fates of Mary Boleyn and Lady Di seem similar in how they were used by powers beyond them to further someone else's agenda. But, it seems when William Arthur Phillip Lois Windsor (Prince William) ascends the throne, which he inevitably will, England will be ruled by a descendant of Henry VIII and Mary Boleyn. Let's hope with a happy ever after."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Historically correct or not, I loved this book. The story of Mary Boleyn and her affair with King Henry VIII and her sister's subsequent marriage to him is one of the most intriguing book I have read in years. Despite its length it was a quick read and a page turner. I had owned the book for many months before picking it up to read because I have been so busy that I was afraid that it was so long that it would take a long time to read it (after all my subway commute is only 20 minutes so I cannot fit too much in) but it really went amazingly quickly and I found myself reading it every spare minute I had. I liked the way it was divided by seasons and the attention to detail of where the court of England was at a particular time. This book gave me more insight as a social commentary than any other book I have read. Women are pawns politically, religiously and socially. This is a must read for anyone interested in the period."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"If you love intrigue, romance, and 16th century court, this is a wonderful book to read. I read it using all of my free time for three days (until I was done) and I am planning to read the books that come after. The best thing about this book is that it is not a meaningless tale of romance or mystery - it is based on solid facts in history, and yet is so personal and detailed that it is hard not to become attached to the characters. The story highlights all of the most basic human drives and emotions - lust, love, hunger for power and fortune, hate, jealousy, fear, and loneliness. It is a tale of two women, two sisters, one who will do anything to obtain a place of power, and another who struggles but learns to stay true to her self. It is a tale of many men, some driven by desire for power, some by lust, some by love. It is a tale of one king - Henry VIII - and his development from a selfish child into a tyrant."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was one of the most captivating novels I have read in a very long time. The historical perspectives were intriguing, the plot lines were riveting. I finished this at midnight last night and began the sequel, The Queen's Fool, at 6am this morning. What a talented writer Gregory is to have captured the tenor of the royal court while engaging the reader in this fast-paced narrative."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I am a big history buff (American mostly) and am often skeptical of historical novels. This was an exception for me. I don't know all that much of England's long royal history. I do know enough to be aware of the high-level intrigue that used to go on in those days to achieve power, but it was really interesting to see it so well-developed and told in this book. A gander through the internet will give you a more accurate picture of what is today accepted as truth and what is in fact the author's imagination. In the back of the paperback edition, the author also tells some of what she invented and what happened to some of the characters after Anne's death. If you realize all this, this is one immensely enjoyable read. The almost 700 pages are turned very quickly and I think you will learn some very valuable things about life in the English courts and England/Europe in general during the 16th century. I think the author's intentions are to pique our interest in either the period or the personalities enough that we might be interested in seeking more historical information. That's what it did for me. I would not mind reading the book that followed this one, watch the movie \\"Elizabeth\\" again or even read an actual history of this episode in British history. Although the main protagonist (Anne's sister, Mary) is historically obscure and without a lot of documentation, many of the other characters are significant enough in history that it should have been easy for the author to do enough research to present portraits as accurate as any historian could. What I came away with regarding Henry VIII, Wolsey and other royals, is not much different than what I came in with. For those sticklers for absolute fact, there are history books. This is a fine introduction for the more casual reader that, to me, gives an accurate enough picture of those days and a plausible description of Anne's life and reign."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I picked this book up at random and immediately it appealed to me, cosidering I like reading about the wives of kings in Europe, and Henry VIII's wives are no exceptions. I have read many novels dealing with his wives, and this one, The Other Boleyn Girl is one of the best. It was, for me, a quick read and intriguing. I find it well-written for the most part. Though primarily fiction, much of it is truth and conincides with the facts that I know.I highly reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of the author, Philippa Gregory, with this being one of her better novels and of historical fiction as well. Highly reccomended to anyone else who has an intrest in the wives of the kings of Europe and Henry VIII especially."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This was an awesome book. A friend refered it to me - we were at the library, she picked it off the shelf and thrust it in my hands. I read the back, and I was thinking.. ehhh. But she convinced me to try it, and that's exactly what I did.I cracked it open on Wednesday and read the first few chapters and then fell asleep. It was torture, because usually I'm the kind of reader that will read through a good book in one setting (yes, that includes the Harry Potter series). Anyway, I had a huge exam on Saturday, and instead of studying, I spent Friday finishing up the book.Simply put, the book is AMAZING. I had never known ANYTHING about King Henry VI and his life and once I finished reading, I remembered that it was HISTORICAL fiction. Of course I promptly went online and googled it and learned much more than I would ever have had.Love, betrayal, trust, and not too much sex, this book is a conglomeration of everything a chick book holds - and definitely more. Try it, I guarentee it'll draw you in."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Noting the author's shameless treatment of history, I found this book at times fascinating, and at others, ridiculous. I thought it rather funny that she bastardized history in the book, and the movie bastardized the book. I sometimes read the book after watching a movie to see how closely it follows. I found myself lost a lot. Plot lines were merged, forgotten, or simply changed completely. Gregory must really hate Anne Boleyn-she portrays her as a high riding [...]-selfish to the end in taking Mary's daughter Catherine to the Tower with her as a last knife twist. I doubt Anne was as bad as she is portrayed in most books. I think she was ambitious, yes, but only a helpless pawn of her family, as most women were at that time. Mary seems the only one to escape the Howard fate-including her cousin, Katherine Howard later on. I have to admit though, I found myself intrigued on how it would all turn out for Mary, and also found myself actually believing some of the story. It seems that marrying Henry VIII was as bad as marrying a Kennedy today. Two truly cursed families. But, it is still my favorite period in history. Alas, Phillipa Gregory, you do but make me blush!!!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book. It was a little long but the plot twists and vivid characters keep you engaged. Great for a book club!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I loved this book and it has now joined my very small collection of \\"Favorite Books\\". I recommend it to anyone who asks me for a book recommendation. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I had read other Phillipa Gregory books before, but this is really the best one there is. If you are at all interested in the Tudor period you should read this book for it's lush portrayal of the period, even though it lacks some historical accuracy. The story of Mary Boleyn's life, along with that of her more famous sister Ann, is fascinating, and will interest any history buff."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I've read a bit about Anne Boleyn and the rest of Henry VIII's court and many wives, so I was intrigued by this book in spite of the flashy movie tie-in cover. Like most, I had no previous knowledge of Mary Boleyn's life. The factual evidence that Mary was Henry's mistress for 2-3 years, together with the timing of the births of her first two children would certainly give great credence to the theory that they were Henry's children, as well as the many honors which were granted to her family during that time. It would also seem very unlikely that Henry would have tolerated Mary bedding both him and her husband during the years of Henry's favor.Regardless of the accuracy of Ms Gregory's narratives relating to the maneuvers of her father and uncle in getting her into Henry's bed, or what Mary may or may not have thought about the role of women in her era, I think the author is owed a few bows for bringing this bit of history to wider audiences than serious Tudor scholars. Certainly the 4 or 5 biographies of this era that are in my personal library scarcely mention Mary at all. Ms Gregory has written an interesting and very readable tale, one that kept me turning the pages."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Everybody knows something about Henry VIII. It's the favorite story of lust, excess and irony for more than 400 years. But is it worth reading a 661 page book to learn a little more? If what you want to know is history, The Other Boleynn Girl is a little short. (You can learn a lot more on Wikiipedia.) For insight into the human condition, you'll fare better. Phillippa Gregory has a special gift in that regard. But you're probably reading the book now because the movie just came out and you want to read it before you go to the theatre.I chose the book as research for my Film and Literature class hoping that I could find some new material. I enjoyed it for many of the same reasons other reviewers have mentioned (even the negative comments) but after viewing the film, I was a little disappointed. Most films made from literary sources are by nature abbreviated, but the film of The Other Boleynn Girl is literally a shorthand version of the book. I don't know how you could follow it if you didn't have some knowledge of the events before you entered the theatre. It wouldn't hurt to have a computer handy to review the real histories of the characters and events. You'll find lots of discrepancies but you'll be able to lord them over your friends at coffee after the movie.While the book is colorfully detailed about locations, clothes and personalities, the film is dark, the personalities shallow (except for the sisters), and the men all seemed to look alike. But two of my favorite actresses, Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, were splendid in the scaled-down script they were given.You don't have to see the film, but you'll find it irresistible after you finish the book--if only to show off your knowledge."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I couldn't put this down, but later I was embarrassed I liked it. It is a true guilty pleasure. The story is historically inaccurate and repetitive -- a hundred pages could be cut with no real damage done -- and everything is juiced up with lots of witchcraft and lots and lots of sex. There's even a deformed baby, apparently just tossed in for the tabloid appeal. However, the characters are so alive! In the end I was still hoping for a last-minute pardon to save Anne's young, scheming, unhappy life. If you are looking for a vivid, fictionalized portrait of historical figures, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" doesn't disappoint.On a different point, this book also shows what it was like to be a woman in the 1500s, how unimportant and humiliated females often were. It made me appreciate my life and how many opportunities I have, much the way reading\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\"made me appreciate being born an American. In fact, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" gives a fascinating portrayal of the human race as a whole back then, from how men loved the casual sport of bear baiting to how royal women at court would comb the lice from their hair."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Even though you know the end when you pick up this book, it still had me gripped. Great Book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What a fascinating and enjoyable book. I could not put it down. I loved the perspective that it was written from. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"What can I write about this novel that hasn't been written before? I loved this novel, it was fascinating to read about the sister of such an infamous historical character, who so often gets passed over in the history books because of her famous sister. And the cover, the cover art is absolutely gorgeous."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"I found that the novel provided me with a new view point of view to a period in history with which I was already familar. The author used verifiable facts, but fleshed out the characters and story in a totally believable and very readable manner. I enjoyed this novel and plan on reading the author's other works."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This is a great historical-fiction book written by one of the best historical-fiction writers out there. It is a book, loosely based on Tudor England, about Ann Boleyn's sister Mary Boleyn, who also slept with the notorious King Henry VIII. It is very entertaining and it does give the reader some true historical background, which is always important. This is a great period in England's history and this book really brings it to life. I've read numerous other books by Philippa Gregory and they are all pretty good but this is the best."},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Lately I've read/watched so much about the lives of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn that I almost convinced myself that I lived in that time. But more about the book....I LOVED IT! Historical fiction has never been this great. It is entertaining to the core. I read it and couldn't put it down...and more than that I wanted more. It is a long book but I never felt overwhelmed by it...it goes by smoothly. Unlike a lot of historical fiction books that weigh you down with way too much history...Gregory puts in a good mixture of history, facts and exciting fiction.As from what I've read of the movie script ...the book is a million times better. So read this first!"},{"Title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is the fictional story of Mary Boleyn's version of events that took place in England during the reign of Henry VIII, the Tutor King who had six wives, one of which was Mary.Mary and the infamous Anne Boleyn were sisters who were maneuvered by their uncle, father and mother to advance the status and wealth of the Boleyn family. The story paints the Boleyn family as the epitome of unbridles greed.Told by Philippa Gregory in the vernacular of the mid-1500s, the tail is a captivating version of English history made delightfully readable by an author who has researched the lives of the characters and presented them in an arresting manner.Among the novels by the author, this book is clearly her best.
